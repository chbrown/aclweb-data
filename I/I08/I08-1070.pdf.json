Such linguistic variations are called paraphrases. Handling paraphrases is one of the key issues in a broad range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering, technology of recognizing if or not the given pair of expressions are paraphrases is desired to gain a higher coverage. On the other hand, a system which generates paraphrases for given expressions is useful for text-transcoding tasks, such as machine translation and summarization, as well as beneficial to human, for instance, in text-to-speech, text simplification, and writing assistance.","Paraphrase phenomena can roughly be divided into two groups according to their compositionality. Examples in (1) exhibit a degree of compositional-ity, while each example in (2) is composed of totally different lexical items. (1) a. be in our favor ⇔ be favorable for us","b. show a sharp decrease ⇔ decrease sharply","(Fujita et al., 2007) (2) a. burst into tears ⇔ cried","b. comfort ⇔ console","(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) A number of studies have been carried out on both compositional (morpho-syntactic) and non-compositional (lexical and idiomatic) paraphrases (see Section 2). In most research, paraphrases have been represented with the similar templates, such as shownin(3)and(4). (3) a. N1 VN2 ⇔ N1’s V -ing of N2","b. N1 VN2 ⇔ N2 be V -en by N1","(Harris, 1957) (4) a. X wrote Y ⇔ X is the author of Y","b. X solves Y ⇔ X deals with Y","(Lin and Pantel, 2001)","The weakness of these templates is that they should be applied only in some contexts. In other words, the lack of applicability conditions for slot fillers may lead incorrect paraphrases. One way to specify the applicability condition is to enumerate correct slot fillers. For example, Pantel et al. (2007) have harvested instances for the given paraphrase templates based on the co-occurrence statis-tics of slot fillers and lexicalized part of templates (e.g. “deal with” in (4b)). Yet, there is no method which assesses semantic equivalence and syntactic substitutability of resultant pairs of expressions."]},{"title":"537","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose a method of directly computing semantic equivalence and syntactic substitutability, i.e., paraphrasability, particularly focusing on automatically generated compositional paraphrases (henceforth, syntactic variants) of predicate phrases. While previous studies have mainly targeted at words or canned phrases, we treat predicate phrases having a bit more complex structures.","This paper addresses two issues in handling phrases. The first is feature engineering. Generally speaking, phrases appear less frequently than single words. This implies that we can obtain only a small amount of information about phrases. To overcome the data sparseness problem, we investigate if the Web snippet can be used as a dense corpus for given phrases. The second is the measurement of paraphrasability. We assess how well the traditional distributional similarity measures approximate the paraphrasability of predicate phrases."]},{"title":"2 Related work 2.1 Representation of paraphrases","paragraphs":["Several types of compositional paraphrases, such as passivization and nominalization, have been represented with some grammar formalisms, such as transformational generative grammar (Harris, 1957) and synchronous tree adjoining grammar (Dras, 1999). These grammars, however, lack the information of applicability conditions.","Word association within phrases has been an at-tractive topic. Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) is a framework which takes into account several types of lexical dependencies in handling paraphrases (Mel’čuk and Polguère, 1987). A bottleneck of MTT is that a huge amount of lexical knowledge is required to represent various relationships between lexical items. Jacquemin (1999) has represented the syntagmatic and paradigmatic correspondences between paraphrases with context-free transformation rules and morphological and/or semantic relations between lexical items, targeting at syntactic variants of technical terms that are typically noun phrases consisting of more than one word. We have proposed a framework of generating syntactic variants of predicate phrases (Fujita et al., 2007). Following the previous work, we have been developing three sorts of resources for Japanese. 2.2 Acquiring paraphrase rules Since the late 1990’s, the task of automatic acquisition of paraphrase rules has drawn the attention of an increasing number of researchers. Although most of the proposed methods do not explicitly eliminate compositional paraphrases, their output tends to be non-compositional paraphrase.","Previous approaches to this task are two-fold. The first group espouses the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968). Among a number of models based on this hypothesis, two algorithms are referred to as the state-of-the-art. DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) collects paraphrase rules consisting of a pair of paths between two nominal slots based on point-wise mutual information. TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004) discovers binary relation templates from the Web based on sets of representative entities for given binary relation templates. These systems often output direc-tional rules such as exemplified in (5). (5) a. X is charged by Y","⇒ Y announced the arrest of X","b. X prevent Y ⇒ X lower the risk of Y They are actually called inference/entailment rules, and paraphrase is defined as bidirectional inference/entailment relation1",". While the similarity score in DIRT is symmetric for given pair of paths, the algorithm of TEASE considers the direction.","The other utilizes a sort of parallel texts, such as multiple translation of the same text (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003), corresponding articles from multiple news sources (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004), and bilingual corpus (Wu and Zhou, 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005). This approach is, however, limited by the difficulty of obtaining parallel/comparable corpora. 2.3 Acquiring paraphrase instances As reviewed in Section 1, paraphrase rules generate incorrect paraphrases, because their applicability conditions are not specified. To avoid the drawback, several linguistic clues, such as fine-grained classification of named entities and coordinated sentences, have been utilized (Sekine, 2005; Torisawa, 2006). Although these clues restrict phenomena to those appearing in particular domain or those describing coordinated events, they have enabled us to collect","1","See http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/WTEP/"]},{"title":"538","paragraphs":["paraphrases accurately. The notion of Inferential Selectional Preference (ISP) has been introduced by Pantel et al. (2007). ISP can capture more general phenomena than above two; however, it lacks abilities to distinguish antonym relations. 2.4 Computing semantic equivalence Semantic equivalence between given pair of expressions has so far been estimated under the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968). Geffet and Dagan (2005) have extended it to the distributional inclusion hypothesis for recognizing the direction of lexical entailment. Weeds et al. (2005), on the other hand, have pointed out the limitations of lexical similarity and syntactic transformation, and have proposed to directly compute the distributional similarity of pair of sub-parses based on the distributions of their modifiers and parents. We think it is worth examining if the Web can be used as the source for extracting features of phrases."]},{"title":"3 Computing paraphrasability between predicate phrases using Web snippets","paragraphs":["We define the concept of paraphrasability as follows:","A grammatical phrase s is paraphrasable","with another phrase t,ifft satisfies the fol-","lowing three:","• t is grammatical","• t holds if s holds","• t is substitutable for s in some context Most previous studies on acquiring paraphrase rules have evaluated resultant pairs from only the second viewpoint, i.e., semantic equivalence. Additionally, we assume that one of a pair (t) of syntactic variants is automatically generated from the other (s). Thus, grammaticality of t should also be assessed. We also take into account the syntactic substitutability, because head-words of syntactic variants some-times have different syntactic categories.","Given a pair of predicate phrases, we compute their paraphrasability in the following procedure: Step 1. Retrieve Web snippets for each phrase. Step 2. Extract features for each phrase. Step 3. Compute their paraphrasability as distribu-","tional similarity between their features.","The rest of this section elaborates on each step in turn, taking Japanese as the target language. 3.1 Retrieving Web snippets In general, phrases appear less frequently than single words. This raises a crucial problem in computing paraphrasability of phrases, i.e., the sparseness of features for given phrases. One possible way to overcome the problem is to take back-off statis-tics assuming the independence between constituent words (Torisawa, 2006; Pantel et al., 2007). This approach, however, has a risk of involving noises due to ambiguity of words.","We take another approach, which utilizes the Web as a source of examples instead of a limited size of corpus. For each of the source and target phrases, we retrieve snippets via the Yahoo API2",". The number of snippets is set to 500. 3.2 Extracting features The second step extracts the features for each phrase from Web snippets. We have some options for feature set, feature weighting, and snippet collection. Feature sets To assess a given pair of phrases against the defi-","nition of paraphrasability, the following three sets of","features are examined.","HITS: A phrase must appear in the Web if it is","grammatical. The more frequently a phrase ap-","pears, the more likely it is grammatical.","BOW: A pair of phrases are likely to be semanti-","cally similar, if the distributions of words sur-","rounding the phrases are similar.","MOD: A pair of phrases are likely to be substi-","tutable with each other, if they share a number","of instances of modifiers and modifiees. To extract BOW features from sentences includ-","ing the given phrase within Web snippets, a morpho-","logical analyzer MeCab3","was firstly used; however,","it resulted wrong POS tags for unknown words, and","hurt statistics. Thus, finally ChaSen4","is used. To collect MOD features, a dependency parser","CaboCha5","is used. Figure 1 depicts an example","of extracting MOD features from a sentence within","Web snippet.

Figure 1: An example of MOD feature extraction. An oval in the dependency tree denotes a bunsetsu. ifier or modifiee of the given phrase. Each feature is composed of three or more elements: (i) modifier or modifiee, (ii) dependency relation types (direct dependency, appositive, or parallel, c.f., RASP and MINIPAR), (iii) base form of the head-word, and (iv) case marker following noun, auxiliary verb and verbal suffixes if they appear. The last feature is employed to distinguish the subtle difference of meaning of predicate phrases, such as voice, tense, aspect, and modality. While Lin and Pantel (2001) have calculated similarities of paths based on slot fillers of subject and object slots, MOD targets at sub-trees and utilizes any modifiers and modifiees. Feature weighting","Geffet and Dagan (2004) have reported on that the better quality of feature vector (weighting function) leads better results. So far, several weighting functions have been proposed, such as point-wise mutual information (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and Relative Feature Focus (Geffet and Dagan, 2004). While these functions compute weights using a small corpus for merely re-ranking samples, we are developing a measure that assesses the paraphrasability of arbitrary pair of phrases, where a more robust weighting function is necessary. Therefore we directly use frequencies of features within Web snippets as weight. Normalization will be done when the paraphrasability is computed (Section 3.3). Source-focused feature extraction","Independent collection of Web snippets for each phrase of a given pair might yield no intersection of feature sets even if they have the same meaning. To obtain more reliable feature sets, we retrieve Web snippets by querying the phrase AND the anchor of","the source phrase. The “anchored version” of Web","snippets is retrieved in the following steps:","Step 2-1. Determine the anchor using Web snippets for the given source phrase. We regarded a noun which most frequently modifies the source phrase as its anchor. Examples of source phrases and their anchors are shown in (6).","Step 2-2. Retrieve Web snippets by querying the anchor for the source phrase AND each of source and target phrases, respectively.","Step 2-3. Extract features for HITS, BOW, MOD.

The first is the measure proposed in (Lin and Pantel, 2001): ParLin (s⇒t)=","∑ f∈Fs∩Ft (w(s, f )+w(t, f ))","∑ f∈Fs w(s, f )+∑","f∈Ft w(t, f ) , where Fs and Ft denote feature sets for s and t,respectively. w(x, f ) stands for the weight (frequency in our experiment) of f in Fx.","While ParLin is symmetric, it has been argued that it is important to determine the direction of paraphrase.

The parameter α is set to 0.99, following tradi-tion, because the optimization of α is difficult.

Settings are described below. 4.1 Test collection First, source phrases were sampled from a 15 years of newspaper articles (Mainichi 1991-2005, approximately 1.5GB). Referring to the dependency structure given by CaboCha, we extracted most frequent 1,000+ phrases for each of 6 phrase types. These phrases were then fed to a system proposed in (Fujita et al., 2007) to generate syntactic variants. The numbers of the source phrases and their syntactic variants are summarized in Table 1, where the numbers in the parentheses indicate that of source phrases paraphrased. At least one candidate was generated for 4,002 (64.7%) phrases. Although the system generates numerous syntactic variants from a given phrase, most of them are erroneous. For example, among 159 syntactic variants that are automatically generated for the phrase “songai:baishou:o:motomeru” (demand compensa-tion for damages), only 8 phrases are grammatical, and only 5 out of 8 are correct paraphrases.","Paraphrasability of each pair of source phrase and candidate is then computed by the methods proposed in Section 3. Table 2 summarizes the numbers of pairs whose features can be extracted from the Web snippets. While more than 90% of candidates were discarded due to ’No hits’ in the Web, at least one candidate survived for 3,020 (48.8%) phrases. Mainichi is a baseline which counts HITS in the corpus used for sampling source phrases. 4.2 Samples for evaluation We sampled three sets of pairs for evaluation, where Mainichi, ∗.HITS, ∗.BOW, ∗.MOD, the harmonic mean of the scores derived from ∗.BOW and ∗.MOD (referred to as ∗.HAR), and two distributional similarity measures for ∗.BOW, ∗.MOD, and ∗.HAR, in total 15 models, are compared.

However, it caused errors in some cases; for example, since N1 was the semantic head in (7), dropping it was incorrect.","(7) s.“shukketsu:taryou:de:shibou-suru”","(die due to heavy blood loss) t.∗ “taryou:de:shibou-suru” (die due to plenty)"]},{"title":"542","paragraphs":["Table 5: Precision for 200 candidates (Ev.Rec).","Strict Lenient Model Nor.∗ Anc.∗ Nor.∗ Anc.∗ Mainichi 78 (39%) --111 (56%) -- HITS 71 (36%) 93 (47%) 113 (57%) 128 (64%) BOW.Lin 159 (80%) 162 (81%) 193 (97%) 191 (96%) BOW.skew 154 (77%) 158 (79%) 192 (96%) 191 (96%) MOD.Lin 158 (79%) 164 (82%) 192 (96%) 193 (97%) MOD.skew 156 (78%) 161 (81%) 191 (96%) 191 (96%) HAR.Lin 157 (79%) 164 (82%) 192 (96%) 194 (97%) HAR.skew 155 (78%) 160 (80%) 191 (96%) 191 (96%) 5.4 Ev.Ling Finally the results for Ev.Ling is shown in Table 6.

Features extracted from the snippets outperformed newspaper corpus; however, the small numbers of features for phrases shown in Table 7 and the lack of sophisticated weighting function suggest that the problem might persist. To examine the proposed features and measures further, we plan to use TSUBAKI8",", an indexed Web corpus developed for NLP research, because it allow us to obtain snippets as much as it archives.","The use of larger number of snippets increases the computation time for assessing paraphrasability. For reducing it as well as gaining a higher coverage, the enhancement of the paraphrase generation system is necessary. A look at the syntactic variants automatically generated by a system, which we proposed, showed that the system could generate syntactic variants for only a half portion of the input, producing many erroneous ones (Section 4.1). To prune a multitude of incorrect candidates, statistical language models such as proposed in (Habash, 2004) will be incorporated. In parallel, we plan to develop a paraphrase generation system which lets us to quit from the labor of maintaining patterns such as shown in (4). We think a more unrestricted generation algorithm will gain a higher coverage, preserv-ing the meaning as far as handling syntactic variants of predicate phrases. 8 http://tsubaki.ixnlp.nii.ac.jp/se/index.cgi"]},{"title":"543 7Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we proposed a method of assessing paraphrasability between automatically generated syntactic variants of predicate phrases. Web snippets were utilized to overcome the data sparseness problem, and the conventional distributional similarity measures were employed to quantify the similarity of feature sets for the given pair of phrases. Empirical experiments revealed that features extracted from the Web snippets contribute to the task, show-ing promising results, while no significant difference was observed between two measures.","In future, we plan to address several issues such as those described in Section 6. Particularly, at present, the coverage and portability are of our interests."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We are deeply grateful to all anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.
