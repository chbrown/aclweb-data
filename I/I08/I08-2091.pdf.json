Generally, a term in a bi-lingual dictionary is provided with very limited information such as part-of-speech, a set of synonyms, and a set of English equivalents. This type of dictionary is comparatively reliable and can be found in an electronic form from various publishers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for applying a set of criteria to assign a synset with an appropriate degree of confidence to the existing bi-lingual dictionary. We show the efficiency in nominating the synset candidate by using the most common lexical information. The algorithm is evaluated against the implementation of Thai-English, Indonesian-English, and Mongolian-English bi-lingual dictionaries. The experiment also shows the effectiveness of using the same type of dictionary from different sources."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is one of the most semantically rich English lexical databases that are widely used as a lexical knowledge resource in many research and development topics. The database is divided by part of speech into noun, verb, adjective and adverb, organized in sets of synonyms, called synset, each of which represents “meaning” of the word entry.","Though WordNet was already used as a starting resource for developing many language WordNets, the construction of the WordNet for any languages can be varied according to the availability of the language resources. Some were developed from scratch, and some were developed from the combination of various existing lexical resources. Spanish and Catalan WordNets, for instance, are automatically constructed using hyponym relation, monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary and taxonomy (Atserias et al., 1997). Italian WordNet (Magnini et al., 1994) is semi-automatically constructed from definition in monolingual dictionary, bilingual dictionary, and WordNet glosses. Hungarian WordNet uses bilingual dictionary, monolingual explanatory dictionary, and Hungarian the-saurus in the construction (Proszeky et al., 2002), etc."]},{"title":"673","paragraphs":["This paper presents a new method particularly to facilitate the WordNet construction by using the existing resources having only English equivalents and the lexical synonyms. Our proposed criteria and algorithm for application are evaluated by implementing to Asian languages which occupy quite different language phenomena in terms of grammars and word unit.","To evaluate our criteria and algorithm, we use the PWN version 2.1 containing 207,010 senses classified into adjective, adverb, verb, and noun. The basic building block is a “synset” which is essentially a context-sensitive grouping of synonyms which are linked by various types of relation such as hyponym, hypernymy, meronymy, antonym, attributes, and modification. Our approach is conducted to assign a synset to a lexical entry by considering its English equivalent and lexical synonyms. The degree of reliability of the assignment is defined in terms of confidence score (CS) based on our assumption of the membership of the English equivalent in the synset. A dictionary from different source is also a reliable source to increase the accuracy of the assignment because it can fulfill the thoroughness of the list of English equivalent and the lexical synonyms.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our criteria for synset assignment. Section 3 provides the results of the experiments and error analysis on Thai, Indonesian, and Mongolian. Section 4 evaluates the accuracy of the assignment result, and the effectiveness of the complimentary use of a dictionary from different sources. Section 5 shows a collaborative interface for revising the result of synset assignment. And Section 6 concludes our work."]},{"title":"2 Synset Assignment","paragraphs":["A set of synonyms determines the meaning of a concept. Under the situation of limited resources on a language, English equivalent word in a bi-lingual dictionary is a crucial key to find an appropriate synset for the entry word in question. The synset assignment criteria described in this Section relies on the information of English equivalent and synonym of a lexical entry, which is most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual dictionary. Synset Assignment Criteria Applying the nature of WordNet which introduces a set of synonyms to define the concept, we set up four criteria for assigning a synset to a lexical entry. The confidence score (CS) is introduced to annotate the likelihood of the assignment. The highest score, CS=4, is assigned to the synset that is evident to include more than one English equivalent of the lexical entry in question. On the contrary, the lowest score, CS=1, is assigned to any synset that occupies only one of the English equivalents of the lexical entry in question when multiple English equivalents exist.","The details of assignment criteria are elaborated as in the followings. Li denotes the lexical entry, Ej denotes the English equivalent, Sk denotes the synset, and  ̨̨ ̨̨ denotes the member of a set:","Case 1: Accept the synset that includes more than one English equivalent with confidence score of 4.","Figure 1 simulates that a lexical entry L0 has two English equivalents of E0 and E1. Both E0 and E1 are included in a synset of S1. The criterion implies that both E0 and E1 are the synset for L0 which can be defined by a greater set of synonyms in S1. Therefore the relatively high confidence score, CS=4, is assigned for this synset to the lexical entry.","","Figure 1. Synset assignment with SC=4 Example: L0: E0: aim E1: target S0: purpose, intent, intention, aim, design S1: aim, object, objective, target S2: aim In the above example, the synset, S1, is assigned","to the lexical entry, L0"]},{"title":", with CS=4. Case 2:","paragraphs":["Accept the synset that includes more than one English equivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry in question with confidence score of 3.","In case that Case 1 fails in finding a synset that includes more than one English equivalent, the English equivalent of a synonym of the lexical entry is picked up to investigate.

Synset assignment with SC=3","Figure 2 simulates that an English equivalent of a lexical entry L0 and its synonym L1 are included in a synset S1. In this case the synset S1 is assigned to both L0 and L1 with CS=3. The score in this case is lower than the one assigned in Case 1 because the synonym of the English equivalent of the lexical entry is indirectly implied from the English equivalent of the synonym of the lexical entry. The newly retrieved English equivalent may not be distorted.","Example:","L0:"]},{"title":"\\b\\t","paragraphs":["L1:"]},{"title":"\\f","paragraphs":["E0: stare E1: gaze S0: gaze, stare S1: stare In the above example, the synset, S0, is assigned","to the lexical entry, L0"]},{"title":", with CS=3.

Synset assignment with SC=2","Figure 3 simulates the assignment of CS-2 when there is only one English equivalent and there is no synonym of the lexical entry. Though there is no any English equivalent to increase the reliability of the assignment, in the same time there is no synonym of the lexical entry to distort the relation. In this case, the only one English equivalent shows it uniqueness in the translation that can maintain a degree of the confidence.","Example:","L0:"]},{"title":"\\f","paragraphs":["E0: obstetrician S0: obstetrician, accoucheur In the above example, the synset, S0, is assigned","to the lexical entry, L0"]},{"title":", with CS=2.

The number of languages that have been successfully developed their WordNets is still limited to some active research in this area. However, the extensive development of WordNet in other languages is important, not only to help in implementing NLP applications in each language, but also in inter-linking WordNets of different languages to develop multi-lingual applications to overcome the language barrier.","We adopt the proposed criteria for automatic synset assignment for Asian languages which has limited language resources. Based on the result from the above synset assignment algorithm, we provide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initiator) (Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlamvanich et al., 2007) to establish an online collaborative work in refining the WorNets.","KUI is a community software which allows registered members including language experts revise and vote for the synset assignment.

Confidence score was proved efficiently assigned to determine the degree of reliability of the assignment which later was a key value in the revision process. Languages in Asia are significantly different from the English language in terms of grammar and lexical word unit. The differences prevent us from finding the target synset by following just the English equivalent. Synonyms of the lexical entry and additional dictionary from different sources can be complimentarily used to improve the accuracy in the assignment. Applying the same criteria to other Asian languages also yielded a satisfactory result. Following the same process that we had implemented to the Thai language, we are expecting an acceptable result from the Indonesian, Mongolian languages and so on. After the revision at KUI, the initial stage of Asian WordNet will be referable through the assigned synset ID."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bernardo Magnini, Carlo Strapparava, Fabio Ciravegna and Emanuele Pianta, 1994.
