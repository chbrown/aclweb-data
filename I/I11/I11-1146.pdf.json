The various kinds of multiword expressions should be analyzed in distinct ways. An adequate comprehensive analysis of multiword expressions must employ both symbolic and statistical techniques. MWEs span a range of constructions, from completely frozen, semantically opaque idiomatic expressions, to frequent but morphologically productive and semantically compositional collocations. Various linguistic processes (orthographic, morphological, syntactic, semantic and cognitive) apply to MWEs in idiosyncratic ways. Notably, MWEs blur the distinction between the lexicon and the grammar, since they often have some properties of words and some properties of phrases. The MWE identification works concentrate on compound nouns, noun-verb combination, idioms and phrases for several languages such as Hindi and Hebrew but not much on RMWEs. The reason may be that the reduplicated words are either rare or easy to identify for these languages since only complete duplication and some amount of partial reduplication may be present in these languages.","On the other hand, reduplicated MWEs (RMWE) of several varieties are widely present in Manipuri1",". In the present work, the identification of Manipuri Named Entities (NEs) and the identification and classification of RMWEs is carried out using the SVM based machine learning approach.  † Presently at Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Mumbai, India  1 Manipuri, locally known as Meiteilon or Meeteilon, is a less privileged, morphologically rich, highly agglutinative language spoken basically in the states of Manipur, Assam, Tripura and Mizoram in India and in the neighboring countries of Myanmar and Bangladesh approximately by three million speakers. Manipuri became the first Tibeto-Burman (TB) language to receive recognition in the year 1992 as a schedule VIII language of India."]},{"title":"1304","paragraphs":["Manipuri is very rich in RMWEs like other Tibeto-Burman languages. The work of (Singh, 2000) describes the linguistic rules for identifying reduplicated words. Manipuri is the direct descendant of the conglomeration of Tibeto-Burman dialects of seven different clans. This is reflected in the commonly found use of double synonyms in Manipuri, technically known as ‘semantic reduplication’. The process of reduplication (Singh, 2000) is defined as: ‘reduplication is that repetition, the result of which constitutes a unit word’. These single unit words are the MWEs. The RMWEs in Manipuri are classified as: (i) Complete RMWEs, (ii) Partial RMWEs, (iii) Echo RMWEs and (iv) Mimic RMWEs. Apart from these four types of RMWEs, there are also cases of (a) Double RMWEs and (b) Semantic RMWEs. ","Complete RMWEs: In the complete RMWEs the single word or phrase is repeated once forming a single unit regardless of the phonological or morphological variations. Interestingly in Manipuri these complete reduplicated MWEs can occur as Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Wh- question type, Verbs, Command and Request.","","মরিক মরিক (‘marik marik’) which means ‘drop by drop’. [Noun]","অটেক অটেকপা (‘atek atek-pa’ ) which means ‘fresh’ [Adjective]","করি করি (‘kari kari’) means ‘what/which’. [Whquestion] ","Partial RMWEs: In case of partial reduplication the second word carries some part of the first word as an affix to the second word, either as a suffix or a prefix. ","For example, চটথাক চত্রিন (‘chat-thok chatsin’) means ‘to go to and fro’; শামী লানমী (‘saa-mi laan-mi’) means ‘army’. ","Mimic RMWEs: In the mimic reduplication the words are complete reduplications but the morphemes are onomatopoetic, usually emotional or natural sounds. For example, কিক কিক (‘krak krak’ ) means ‘cracking sound of earth in drought’. ","Echo RMWEs: The second word does not have a dictionary meaning and is basically an echo word of the first word. For example, থকরি খারি (‘thak-si kha-si‘) means ‘good manner’. ","Double RMWEs: Such type of reduplication generally consists of three words where the prefix or suffix of the first two words is reduplicated but in the third word the prefix or suffix is absent. An example of double prefix reduplication is ইমুন ইমুন মুনবা (‘i-mun i-mun mun-ba’) which means, ‘completely ripe’. ","Semantic RMWEs: Both the reduplication words have the same meaning that is shared by the MWE itself. Such types of MWEs are very special to the Manipuri language. For example, পামবা কক (‘paamba kei’) means ‘tiger’ and each of the component words means ‘tiger’. ","The performance of the SMT is heavily dependent on the quality of the Parallel Corpora and the alignment models used. Integrating MWEs into the Machine Translation (MT) systems in general and phrase based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system in particular is a critical problem. Thus, there is the need for identifying Manipuri RMWE and integrating into the PBSMT system. In the present work, we integrate Manipuri Named entities (both single word and multiword), RMWEs and non-NE transliterated entities into the existing phrase-based model."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["Koehn and Knight (2003) discussed empirical methods for compound splitting by learning rules from monolingual and parallel corpora.

The process can be conceptualized as two levels of decoding: segmentation of the source string into transliteration units; and relating the source language transliteration units to units in the target language, by resolving different combinations of alignments and unit mappings. The problem of machine transliteration has been studied extensively in the paradigm of the noisy channel model. Translation of named entities is a tricky task: it involves both translation and transliteration. For example, the organization name Jadavpur viswavidyalaya is translated to Jadavpur University in which Jadavpur is transliterated to Jadavpur and viswavidyalaya is translated to University.","A bilingual training set of Manipuri NEs and their respective English transliterations, has been created by collecting Manipuri person, location and organization names from Manipuri news corpus and then manually entering their English transliterations.
