This requires either linking entity mentions in the documents with entries in the KB or highlighting these mentions as new entries to current KB.","Entity linking (McNamee and Dang, 2009) involves both finding name variants (e.g. both “George H. W. Bush” and “George Bush Senior” refer to the 41st","U.S. president) and name disambiguation (e.g. given “George Bush” and 1 http://nlp.cs.qc.cuny.edu/kbp/2010/ its context, we should be able to disambiguate which president it is referring to).","Compared with Cross-Document Coreference (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) which clusters the articles according to the entity mentioned, entity linking has a given entity list (i.e. the reference KB) to which we disambiguate the entity mentions. Moreover, in the articles, there are new entities not present in KB.","For name disambiguation in entity linking, there has been much previous work which demonstrates modeling context is an important part of measuring document similarity. However, the traditional approach for entity linking treats the context as a bag of words, n-grams, noun phrases or/and co-occurring named entities, and measures context similarity by the comparison of the weighted literal term vectors (Varma et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; McNamee et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010; Dredze et al., 2010). Such literal matching suffers from sparseness issue. For example, consider the following four observations of Michael Jordan without term match:","1) Michael Jordan is a leading researcher in machine learning and artificial intelligence.","2) Michael Jordan is currently a full professor at the University of California, Berkeley.","3) Michael Jordan (born February, 1963) is a former American professional basketball player.","4) Michael Jordan wins NBA MVP of 91-92 season.","To measure the similarity of these contexts, the semantic knowledge underlying the words is needed.","Furthermore, current state-of-the-art entity linking systems (Dredze et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010) are based on supervised learning approach requiring lots of annotated training instances to achieve good performance. However, entity linking annotation is highly dependent on the KB. When a new KB comes, the annotating process needs to be repeated. We have tried to automate this annotating process (Zhang et al. 2010). However, as discussed in that paper, the distribution of the auto-generated data is not con-562 sistent with the real dataset, because only some types of instances can be generated.","In this paper, we propose two approaches: (1) a Wikipedia-LDA model to effectively mine the semantic knowledge from the contexts of the mentions. Such topic model allows us to measure the similarity between articles and KB entries in the semantic space of Wikipedia category. (2) An instance selection strategy to effectively utilize the auto-generated annotation through an iterative process of selecting a representative, informative and diverse batch of instances at each iteration. The batch sizes at each iteration change according to the variance of classifier’s confidence or accuracy between batches in sequence, which makes selection insensitive to the initial batch size and performs better than fixed size.","We conduct evaluation on KBP-10 data (Ji et al., 2010). Experiments show that the Wikipedia-LDA model is able to effectively capture the underlying semantic information and produce statistically significant improvement over literal matching alone. Correspondingly, instance selection can make the dataset more balanced and it also produces a significant gain in entity linking performance. Collectively, the two advancements lead the highest performance on KBP-10 task. Being a generic approach, the batch size changing method proposed in this paper can also benefit active learning for other tasks.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the framework for entity linking. We present our Wikipedia-LDA model in Section 3, and the instance selection in Section 4. Section 5 shows the experiments and discussions. Section 6 concludes our work."]},{"title":"2 Entity Linking Framework","paragraphs":["Entity linking is done through two steps: name variation resolution and name disambiguation. Name variation resolution finds variants for each entry in KB and then generates the possible KB candidates for the given name mention by string matching. Name disambiguation is to map a mention to the correct entry in the candidate set. 2.1 Name Variation Resolution Wikipedia contains many name variants of entities like confusable names, spelling variations, nick names, etc. We extract the name variants of an entry in KB by leveraging the knowledge sources in Wikipedia: “titles of entity pages”, “disambiguation pages” 2 , “redirect pages” 3 2.2 Name Disambiguation","and “anchor texts”. With the acquired name variants for entries in KB, the possible KB candidates for a given name mention can be retrieved by string matching. If the given mention is an acronym, we will expand it from the given article, and then use entity linking process. First, using a learning to rank method, we rank all the retrieved KB candidates to identify the most likely candidate. In this learning to rank method, each name mention and the associated candidates are formed by a list of feature vectors. During linking, the score for each candidate entry is given by the ranker. The learning algorithm we used is ranking SVM (Herbrich et al., 2000).","Next, the preferred KB candidate is presented to a binary classifier (Vapnik, 1995) to determine if it is believed as the target entry for a name mention. From here, we can decide whether the mention and top candidate are linked. If not, the mention has no corresponding entry in KB (NIL). The base features adopted for both learning to rank and classification include 15 feature groups divided to 3 categories. A summary of the features is listed in Table 1. Due to the space limit, we only show the feature name, leaving out the feature details which can be found in (Dredze et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010)."," Categories Feature Names","Surface Exact Equal Surface, Start With String of","Query, End With String of Query, Equal","Word Num, Miss Word Num","Contextual TF-IDF Similarity, Similarity Rank, All","Words in Text, NE Number Match,","Country in Text Match, Country in Text","Miss, Country in Title Match, Country in","Title Miss, City in Title Match","Others NE Type","Table 1: Base Feature Set"]},{"title":"3 Wikipedia-LDA Model","paragraphs":["In the similar task cross-document coreference (Han and Zhao 2009) and other tasks (e.g. text classification) (Wang and Domeniconi, 2008), Wikipedia concepts are used to model the text. Wikipedia concept is a kind of entity-level topic. In our approach, we use the cross-entity topic Wikipedia Categories to represent the semantic knowledge. 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect 563","Thus, we model the contexts as the distributions over Wikipedia categories. Then, the similarity between the contexts can be measured in a semantically meaningful space. Finally, such semantic similarity, together with other base features, is incorporated in the trainable models to learn the ranker and classifier.","3.1 Modeling the Contexts as Distributions over Wikipedia Categories Wikipedia requires contributors to assign categories to each article, which are defined as “major topics that are likely to be useful to someone reading the article”. Thus, Wikipedia can serve as a document collection with multiple topical labels, where we can learn the posterior distribution over words for each topical label (i.e. Wikipedia category). Then, from the observed words in the mention’s context and KB entry, we can estimate the distribution of the contexts over the Wikipedia categories. To obtain this distribution, we use a supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model – labeled LDA defined by Ramage et al. (2009), which represents state-of-the-art method for multi-labeled text classification. It performs better on collections with more semantically diverse labels, which we need in order to leverage on the large semantically diverse categories from Wikipedia as the topical labels.","Figure 1 shows us a graphical representation of the labeled LDA for the multi-labeled document collection. Labeled LDA is a three level hierarchical Bayesian model. β is the multinomial distribution over words for a Wikipedia category, which has a Dirichlet prior with hyperparameter η. Both the category set Λ as well as the topic prior α influence the topic mixture θ. These distributions can be used to generate documents in the form of a collection of words (w). D is the number of documents, N is the document length and K is the number of categories.","After the model is trained by Wikipedia data, the distributions of KB entry and the article over K categories are estimated by calculating the topic proportions θ. θ is given by an EM procedure that treats θ as a parameter with Z missing.  "," Figure 1: Graphical model of Labeled LDA 3.2 Context Similarity We have mapped the contexts to a K-dimensional semantic space. Thus, we can calculate the context similarity by their distance in this space. To measure the context similarity in the K-dimensional topical space, we calculate the Cosine value as below:"," Similarityd,e = ∑ θd,k×θe,kK k=1","�∑ (θd,k)2K","k=1 ×�∑ (θe,k)2K","k=1 (1)  Where d means the document with the name mention and e means the KB entry. Such semantic similarity can be further combined with other term matching features for SVM ranker and classifier of entity linking. 3.3 Wikipedia Category Selection Each article in Wikipedia is assigned several categories by the contributors as requested. However, from our observation some categories in Wikipedia may not be suitable to model the topics of a document. Thus, we shall consider selecting an appropriate subset from the Wikipedia categories to effectively model the contexts. We examined five possible category subsets: All, All-admin, isa_all, isa_class, and isa_instance.","Wikipedia contains 165,744 categories. This is the set All.","There are some meta-categories used for encyclopedia management in Wikipedia, e.g. “Wikipedia editing guidelines”, which are unsuitable to describe the topics of a document. Thus, we remove the categories which contain any of the following strings: wikipedia, wikiprojects, lists, mediawiki, template, user, portal, categories, articles and pages. This leaves 127,325 categories (All-admin).","However, some categories such as “people by status” and “Geography by place” in the All-admin set cannot serve as the topics of a document properly. Thus, we need to remove them from the category set. From our observation, the topical categories are usually in is-a relation. For example, the relation between the two topical categories “Olympic basketball players” and “Olympic competitors” is an is-a relation, while the categories to be removed “people by status” and “Geography by place” are not in any is-a relation. We thus only select the categories connected by is-a relation to isa_all subset.","Since the categories are connected by unlabeled links in Wikipedia, we need to identify is-a relation links. We use the four methods as below 564 proposed by Ponzetto and Strube (2007) to distinguish is-a and not-is-a relation links.","We first use a syntax-based method: assign is-a to the link between two categories if they share the same lexical head lemma (e.g. “British Computer Scientists” and “Computer Scientists”).","Then, we use structural information from the category network: (1) for a category c, look for a Wikipedia article P with the same name. Take all P’s categories whose lexical heads are plural nouns CP ={cp1, cp2, ..., cpn}. Take all supercategories of c, SC={sc1, sc2, ...,sck }. If the head lemma of one of cpi matches the head lemma of scj, label the relation between c and scj as is-a. (2) assign is-a label to the link between two categories if a Wikipedia article is redundantly categorized under both of them. For example, “Internet” is categorized under both “Computer networks” and “Computing” and there is a link between “Computer networks” and “Computing”. Then this link is assigned is-a.","Next, we use lexical-syntactic patterns in a corpus. This method uses two sets of patterns. One set is used to identify is-a relations (Caraballo, 1999; Hearst, 1992), for example “such NP1 as NP2”, NP1 and NP2 are the values of categories and their subcategories respectively. The second set is used to identify not-is-a relations. For example “NP1 has NP2”, where the link between NP1 and NP2 will be assigned not-is-a. These patterns are used with a corpus built from Wikipedia articles, and separately with the Tipster corpus (Harman and Liberman, 1993). The label is assigned by majority voting between the frequency counts for the two types of patterns.","Finally, we assign is-a labels to links based on transitive closures - all categories along an is-a chain are connected to each other by is-a links.","Another fact is that the categories defined by Wikipedia are not all classes. For example, “Microsoft” is an instance of the class “Computer and Video Game Companies”, and it appears both as an article page and as a category in Wikipedia. We would like to further examine the two different subsets: isa_class, and isa_instance in isa_all set for entity linking. To distinguish instance and class in isa_all set, we use a structure-based method (Zirn et al., 2008). The categories which have other subcategories or Wikipedia articles connected to them by is-a relation are assigned class label. In our problem, the remaining categories are approximately regarded as instances."]},{"title":"4 Instance Selection Strategy","paragraphs":["In this section, we explore a method to effectively utilize a large-scale auto-generated data for entity linking.","In our pervious work (Zhang et al. 2010), we proposed automatically gathering large-scale training instances for entity linking. The basic idea is to take a document with an unambiguous mention referring to an entity e1 in KB and replace it with its variation which may refer to e1, e2 or others. For example, a mention “Abbott Laboratories” in a document only refers to one KB entry “Abbott Laboratories”. “Abbott Laboratories” in the document is replaced with its ambiguous synonyms, including “Abbott” “ABT”, etc. Following this approach, from the 1.7 million documents in KBP-10 text collection, we generate 45,000 instances.","However, the distribution of the auto-generated data is not consistent with the real dataset, since the data generation process can only create some types of training instances. In the case of “Abbott Laboratories”, more than ten “Abbott” mentions are linked to “Abbott Laboratories” entry in KB, but no “Abbott” example is linked to other entries like “Bud Abbott” “Abbott Texas”, etc. Thus, we need an instance selection approach to reduce the effect of this distribution problem. However, the traditional instance selection approaches (Brighton and Mellish, 2002; Liu and Motoda, 2002) only can solve two problems: 1) a large dataset causes response-time to become slow 2) the noisy instances affect accuracy, which are different from our needs here. We thus propose an instance selection approach to select a more balanced subset from the auto-annotated instances. This instance selection strategy is similar to active learning (Shen et al., 2004; Brinker, 2003) for reducing the manual annotation effort on training instances through proposing only the useful candidates to annotators. As we already have a large set of auto-generated training instances, the selection here is a fully automatic process to get a useful and more balanced subset instead.","We use the SVM classifier mentioned in Section 2.2 to select the instances from the large dataset. The initial classifier can be trained on a set of initial training instances, which can be a small part of the whole auto-generated data, or the limited manual annotated training instances available, e.g. those provided by KBP-10.","Our instance selection method is an iterative process. We select an informative, representative 565 and diverse batch of instances based on current hyperplane and add them to the current training instance set at each iteration to further adjust the hyperplane for more accurate classification.","We use the distance as the measure to select informative instances. The distance of an instance’s feature vector to the hyperplane is computed as follows:","","Dist(w) = �∑ αiyik(si, w) + bN i=1 � (2)  Where w is the feature vector of the instance, αi, yi and si correspond to the weight, class and feature vector of the i th","support vector respectively. N is the number of the support vectors.","Next, we quantify the representativeness of an instance by its density. Such density is defined as the average similarity between this instance and all other instances in the dataset. If an instance has the largest density among all the instances in the dataset, it can be regarded as the centroid of this set and also the most representative instance."," Density(wi) =","∑ Sim�wi,wj�j≠i N−1 (3)"," Where w is the instance in the dataset and N is the size of dataset. Sim is cosine similarity.","We combine the informativeness and representativeness by the function λ(1 − Dist(w) ) + (1 − λ)Density(w), in which Dist and Density are normalized first. The individual importance of each part in this function is adjusted by a tradeoff parameter λ (set to 0.5 in our experiment). The instance with the maximum value of this function will be selected first to the batch. This instance will be compared individually with the selected instances in current batch to make sure their similarity is less than a threshold β. This is to diversify the training instance in the batch to maximize the contribution of each instance. We set β to the average similarity between the instances in the original dataset. When a batch of α instances is selected, we add them to the training instance set and retrain the classifier.","Such a batch learning process will stop at the peak confidence of the SVM classifier, since Vlachos (2008) shows that the confidence of the SVM classifier is consistent with its performance. The confidence can be estimated as the sum of the distances to hyperplane for the instances of an un-annotated development set. The development set guides the selection process to solve the distribution problem mentioned above. Alternatively, we can also leverage on some annotated development data and use accuracy instead to guide the selection process. We explore both approaches for different application scenarios in our experiments.","We now need to decide how to set the batch size α at each iteration. It is straightforward to set a fixed batch size α (Fixed Number), which never changes during the process. However, there are some limitations as demonstrated in our experiment in this paper. First, the performance is sensitive to the batch size. Second, if we set the batch size too big, it will impede further improvement allowed by small batch size. But if we set the batch size too small from the beginning, it will dramatically increase the number of itera-tions needed which will make the selection too slow. To resolve the above issues, we change the batch size according to the variance of classifier’s confidence on an un-annotated set. Thus, we assign an integer to α1 and α2 in the first two iterations, and αi (i > 2) in the i th","iteration is","computed as below (Flexible Number):  αi =","αi−1∗(coni−1−coni−2) coni−2−coni−3 (4)"," where coni is the confidence of the classifier on the un-annotated dataset at i th","iteration.

This shows that entity linking can benefit from the semantic information underlying the words and overcome the shortcomings of literal matching.","We further compare the performances of the five different category subsets. From the last five rows of Table 2, we can see that isa_all subset performs best among the five subsets for disambiguation. This should be because isa_all in-cludes more categories than isa_class and isa_instance, and thus can capture more semantic information. However, although All and All-admin include even more categories, they introduce many categories which are unsuitable to model the topics of a news article or blog text, such as the two categories mentioned in Section 3.3, “people by status” which is not in an is-a relation and “Wikipedia editing guidelines” which is used for encyclopedia management. 5.3 System with Instance Selection Table 4 shows the results for evaluating our instance selection strategy. These experiments use the base features (Section 2.2). 5.3.1 With and Without Manual Annotated","Data We want to find out the effectiveness of our instance selection strategy if no manually annotated data is available. In the first block of Table 4, we compare the performances of the systems with and without instance selection. “Auto_Gen” uses the auto-generated dataset described at the beginning of Section 4 as the training set directly, and “Auto_Gen+IS” applies our instance selection to the auto-generated data for training. In the instance selection process, we use the KB entries with more than 15 linked documents in the auto-generated data as our Initial Training Set (1,800 instances) to train a classifier, and then use this classifier to select instance from the auto-generated dataset. The first block of Table 4 shows that our instance selection gives significant improvements (ρ < 0.05, χ2","test ). These improvements show our selection strategy makes the training set more balanced and it can effectively reduce the effect of distribution problem in the large scale dataset.","We further evaluate our instance selection strategy when a large manually annotated data is available in the second block of Table 4. “KBP” is trained on the manually annotated KBP-10 training set. “KBP+Auto_Gen” is trained on KBP-10 set and the auto-generated set. “KBP+Auto_Gen+IS” uses KBP-10 training set as the Initial Training Set, and applies instance selection process to the auto-generated data. Comparing “KBP+ Auto_Gen” with “KBP”, we can see that the unbalanced distribution caused serious problem which even pull down the performance achieved by the large manual annotation alone. The experiment results of “KBP” and “KBP+Auto_Gen+IS” show that our instance selection strategy appears very necessary to bring further improvements over the large manually annotated dataset (5,404 instances). These significant ( ρ < 0.05, χ2","test) improvements are achieved by incorporating more training instances in a reasonable way.","Comparing the performance of “Auto_Gen+IS” with “KBP” in Table 4, we can find that our method performs better without hard intensive work on annotating 5,404 articles. This proves that using our instance selection can save labor without compromise of entity linking accuracy. The pretty much same performance of “Auto_Gen+IS” with “KBP +Auto_Gen+IS” also confirms the above conclusion. 5.3.2 Fixed Size Vs. Changing Size We are also interested in the effectiveness of the two schemes (i.e. Fixed Number and Flexible Number) of setting the batch size α mentioned in Section 4. In Figure 3, we set the batch size α in Fixed Number scheme and α1 α2 in Flexible Number scheme, to different numbers from 50 to 140 increasing 10 each time. We conduct instance selection to the auto-generated data. Figure 3 shows that flexible batch size outperforms the fixed size for entity linking. Especially, the 568 improvement at α=50, 60 and 70 is significant (ρ < 0.05, χ2","test). This proves that batch size should be in line with the variance of the classifier’s confidence at each iteration of instance selection. Furthermore, in this Figure, the performance of flexible batch size is more stable than the Fixed Number scheme. This shows that Flexible Number scheme makes the entity linking system insensitive to the initial batch size during instance selection process. Thus the initial batch size of the experiments in Table 4 is set to 80, which we believe that very similar performance can be achieved even with a different initial size. Another fact is that the selection process is similar to active learning, which needs to manually annotate the selected instances in each batch. Thus, being a generic approach, the batch size changing method proposed in this paper can also benefit active learning for other tasks. ","","Figure 3: Performance Curves for Two Batch Size Schemes 5.3.3 (Un-)Annotated Development Set In the above study, we directly use the test set without annotations as the development set for instance selection to optimize our solution to the application data. Such an approach will be useful when the application set is available in advance as in the case with KBP benchmarks."," "," Figure 4: Annotated Development data","","When the application set is unavailable beforehand, in other words, the articles to be linked only arrive one after the other in linking stage, we leverage on the accuracy on annotated development set for the instance selection.

We only need to use a small amount of annotated development data, 500 articles in our study to guide the instance selection to achieve similar performance as with un-annotated test set being development data.","5.4 Overall Result Combining Two Approaches We also evaluate our model which combines the Wikipedia- LDA and Instance Selection together on KBP-10 data, and compare our method with the top 7 systems in KBP-10 shared task (Ji et al., 2010).

The above two advancements significantly improve entity linking system individually, and collectively they lead the highest performance on KBP-10 task."]},{"title":"Acknowledgment","paragraphs":["This work is partially supported by Microsoft Research Asia eHealth Theme Program. 7 Another system submission shows 86.8%.
