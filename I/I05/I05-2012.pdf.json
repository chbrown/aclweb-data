Technical terms can be classified into single-word terms, and complex term   * The first author's current affiliation is with Computational Linguistics Group, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, 3-5 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, 619-0289 Japan (or multi-word term) according to the number of their constituents. Single-word terms have one term constituent while complex terms have more than one term constituent. Many Korean technical terms are usually complex terms and their meaning can be inferred from their constituents (Sager, 1997). Therefore it is helpful to identify constituents of technical terms and their meaning in order to understand the meaning of the technical terms and to translate the technical term from one’s language to the other. However, a term constituent is usually a morphological unit rather than a conceptual unit1","in Korean technical terms. Due to the mismatch between a term constituent and a conceptual unit, we need to first identify conceptual units which is a chunk of term constituents representing a domain specific concept (“chunking conceptual units”) and then to resolve the proper meaning of the conceptual unit (“resolving meanings”) in order to properly understand the meaning of technical terms and to translate them.","In the “chunking conceptual units” stage, it is necessary to determine whether one term constituent represents a concept or not. The decision depends on contexts of term constituents. For example, a Korean technical term, ‘seong’ can be a conceptual unit by itself when it represents sex. But ‘seong’ in the context of ‘hyangchuk+seong / bun-yeol+jo-jik’ 2","(representing adaxial meristem) should be recognized as a conceptual unit along with its neighborhood ‘hyang-chuk’ such as ‘hyang-chuk+seong’ (adaxial). If ‘seong’ is recognized as a conceptual unit by itself in the context, like ‘hyang-chuk (adaxial) / seong (sex) / bun-yeol+jo-jik (meris-"," 1 In this paper, a conceptual unit is defined as the linguistic unit representing a domain specific concept. 2 In this paper, Romanized Korean transcriptions are represented in the quotation mark. In the transcriptions, ‘+’ represents the boundary of term constituents, ‘-’ represents the syllable boundary and ‘/’ represents the boundary of conceptual units."]},{"title":"67","paragraphs":["tem)’, we can neither understand the designated meaning of ‘hyang-chuk+seong / bun-yeol+jojik’ (“meristem of a leaf cell in the adaxial area”) nor properly translate it.","In the “resolving meanings” stage, homonym, synonym, and domain dependency of conceptual units should be considered. Sino-Korean affixes are frequently used for coining Korean technical terms and are used as a conceptual unit like single words. Moreover, they are usually homonym. For example, a suffix ‘-gi’ is used as a term constituent in a biology domain with four senses like group (基), period (紀), stage (期), and or-gan (器). Therefore, disambiguating the sense of such affixes is very important for understanding a Korean technical term.","Many Korean technical terms are from for-eign origin. These technical terms become Korean technical terms with various translation ways – 1) translation with pure Korean words, 2) translation with Sino-Korean words, 3) transliteration, 4) combinations of the three ways. Moreover, each translation way produces some variations. For example, abdominal is translated into three different Korean terms like ‘bok-bu’, ‘bok’, and ‘bae’, but they indicate the same meaning; in other words, they are synonym. abdominal is translated into two Sino-Korean terms like ‘bok-bu (腹部)’ and ‘bok (服)’, and one pure Korean term, ‘bae’. Capturing synonym, therefore, is important for understanding meaning of technical terms.","Depending on domain of technical terms, translations of conceptual units can be different. For example, the meaning of cell in chemistry, physics, and electricity is usually “A single unit that converts radiant energy into electric energy”, while that in biology is usually “The smallest structural unit of an organism”. In each case, cell is differently translated into Korean terms ‘jeon-ji’ (in chemistry, physics, and electricity domain), and ‘se-po’ (biology domain).","For natural language applications to properly handle technical terms, it is necessary to give information about conceptual units and their meaning including homonym, synonym and domain dependency. In this paper, we propose a term constituent alignment algorithm, which extracts such information from bilingual technical term pairs. In our algorithm, one or more than one English term constituents are regarded as a conceptual unit. Therefore, the main objective of our algorithm is to recognize conceptual units of Korean technical terms corresponding to an English term constituent in English-Korean translation pairs of technical terms.","The recognized bilingual conceptual units give contextual information, which supports decision whether certain term constituent tends to be used as a conceptual unit by itself or not. Homonym and synonym can be handled by finding the correspondence between English and Korean conceptual units. Because English and Korean conceptual units indicating the same concept will be linked to each other, we can easily find homonym and synonym from the relations. For example, the homonym ‘gi’ will be linked to four different English conceptual units. In the same manner, we can capture three relations between the English conceptual unit abdominal and its counterparts ‘bok-bu’, ‘bok’, and ‘bae’. The three Korean counterparts can be clustered as synonyms by means of their corresponding English conceptual unit, like {‘bokbu’, ‘bok’, ‘bae’}. Moreover, domain dependency of conceptual units can be handled by the relations because extracted relations for certain English conceptual unit, which has domain dependency, will be different depending on domains.","This paper organized as follows. In section 2, we will describe the related works. Section 3 shows details of our method. Section 4 deals with experiments. Conclusion and future works are drawn in sections 5."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["One of the well-known alignment techniques is the one based on statistical machine translation models.

IBM Model 3 adopts fertility (How likely is a source language word to align to k target language words) as its parameter for 1:n alignment. IBM Model 4 and 5 make use of relative distortion, word classes and variables to avoid deficiency.","There is another stream of studies on alignment. (Chen et al., 1993; Gale et al., 1993) proposed sentence alignment techniques based on dynamic programming, using sentence length and lexical mapping information. (Haruno et al., 1996; Kay et al., 1993) applied iterative refinement algorithms to sentence level alignment tasks.","In this paper, we propose an alignment algorithm between English and Korean conceptual units (or between English and Korean term constituents) in English-Korean technical term pairs based on IBM Model (Brown et al., 1993). Unlike IBM Model, our alignment model can deal with n:1 alignment. While the IBM Model aimed to word-level alignment of parallel texts, our method focuses on word- and morphology-level alignment of English-Korean term pairs. Moreover, our algorithm reflects the translation properties of English-to-Korean technical term pairs in a bilingual dictionary."]},{"title":"3 Term Constituent Alignment","paragraphs":["For term constituent alignment, we use biology, chemistry and physics dictionaries where term constituents are manually segmented and their part-of-speech is manually assigned. For example, the Korean counterpart of crop growth rate is ‘jak-mul + seng-jang + yul’ and its three term constituents are ‘jak-mul’, ‘seng-jang’, and ‘yul’ where the first two are a noun and the last one is a suffix.","The problem can be defined as finding correspondence between English and Korean term constituents as described in equation (3). For a given English term E=e1,...,en, composed of n English term constituents and its corresponding Korean term K=k1,...,km, composed of m Korean term constituents, the task is to find alignment set, A={a1,....,at;ap=(ei,i+w(p),, kj(p))}, maximizing probability P(A|K,E), where ei is the ith","term constituent of E, kj is the jth","term constituent of K, and ap represents the pth","alignment relation between English and Korean term constituents. Note that ap=(ei,i+w(p), kj(p)) (w ≥ 0) represents an alignment relation between English term constituents ei ,...,ei+w and Korean term constituent kj. For example, there are two alignment relations for English term female sex hormone and Korean term ‘ja-seong + ho-leu-mon’, like a1 =(e1,2(1)=female sex, k1(1)=‘ja-seong’) and a2 =(e1(2)=hormone, k2(2)=‘ho-leu-mon’)"]},{"title":"),|(maxarg* EKAPA","paragraphs":["A"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["(3)"]},{"title":"3.1 Statistical Modeling","paragraphs":["In this section, first, we describe two translation properties (or constraints), derived from analysis of the alignment tendency between English-Korean term constituents and then describe how to apply these properties to statistical modeling of term constituent alignment.","We randomly sample 20% data of English-Korean term pairs in each technical dictionary and finds two properties “Cross alignment appears in some conditions”3","and “Null Alignment hardly appears”4","by analyzing the sampled data. Constraint 1: Cross alignment is partly allowed. Let alignment units in a source language be si, sj(i<j), where i and j are the index of the source language, and those in a target language be tq, tr (q<r), where q and r are the index in the target language. Then alignment ai=(si,tr), and aj=(sj,tq) are called cross alignment. Because a sentence structure of Korean is different from  3 Among analyzed data, 1.3% for biology, 0.1% for physics and 5.65% for chemistry show cross alignment. 4 Among analyzed data, 0.8% for biology, 0.2% for physics and 0.1% for chemistry show null alignment."]},{"title":"69","paragraphs":["that of English, cross-alignment between English and Korean words frequently occurs in parallel sentences (Shin et al., 1995). For alignment between term constituents, however, most alignment relations are derived from sequential alignment because technical terms, which are usually noun phrases, share the similar structure, say modifier and modifee, in both languages. Sometimes there is cross-alignment because of the preposition in an English term such as of. In that case, we allow cross-alignment. For example, there is a cross-alignment relation such as a1 = (e2 = blood, k1 = ‘hyeol-aek’) and a2 = (e1 = clotting, k2 = ‘eung-go’) between the English term clotting of blood and its Korean translation ‘hyeol-aek + eung-go’. Note that we do not consider the preposition of as an alignment unit in that case. English-Korean term pairs representing a name of chemical compounds usually show cross-alignment and 1:1 alignment. To deal with this case, we allow cross-alignment when the number of English term constituents and that of Korean term constituents are same. With the constraint 1, sequential alignment is performed except the above two cases. Constraint 2: Null Alignment is not allowed. Constraint 2 means that all English and Korean term constituents should be aligned. Because, term pairs consist of an English term and its translated Korean term, we assume that all constituents should be aligned. Null alignment means that an alignment unit in one side is aligned to nothing in the other side. For example, for Dutch elm disease and ‘ne-deol-lan-deu (Dutch) / neu-leup-na-mu (elm) / che-gwan (sieve tube) / byeong (disease)’, there is no English term constituent to be aligned to the Korean term constituent ‘che-gwan (sieve tube)’. Because, null alignment, however, does not frequently appear in term constituent alignment (only the 0.1%~0.8% data among analyzed data), we do not consider null alignment in our algorithm."]},{"title":"),,,|(),|( ),|(","paragraphs":["1 )(,)("]},{"title":"tmnjiaekap EKAP","paragraphs":["t l lwiiljl"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["= +"]},{"title":"×=","paragraphs":["(4)"]},{"title":"),|()|( ),,|( ),|(","paragraphs":[",, )(,)()( )(,)( wiij t j w wiij t lwiilj w lj t l lwiiljl"]},{"title":"ekkpekp ekkap ekap","paragraphs":["++ + +"]},{"title":"×≈ =","paragraphs":["(5)","By the constraints, equation (3) can be represented as equation (4).
