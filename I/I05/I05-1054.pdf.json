This paper proposes a variation of synchronous grammar based on the formalism of context-free grammar by generalizing the first component of productions that models the source text, named Constraint-based Synchronous Grammar (CSG). Unlike other synchronous grammars, CSG allows multiple target productions to be associated to a single source production rule, which can be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in the pattern. Furthermore, CSG is augmented with independent rewriting that allows expressing discontinuous constituents in the inference rules. It turns out that such grammar is more expressive to model the translational equivalences of parallel texts for machine translation, and in this paper, we propose the use of CSG as a basis for building a machine translation (MT) system for Portuguese to Chinese translation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In machine translation, to analyze the structure deviations of languages pair hence to carry out the transformation from one language into another as the target translation is the kernel part in a translation system, and this requires a large amount of structural transformations in both grammatical and concept level. The problems of syntactic complexity and word sense ambiguity have been the major obstacles to produce promising quality of translation. In order to overcome the obstacles and hence to improve the quality of translation systems, several alternative approaches have been proposed.","As stated in [1], much of the theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences between layers of representations. In similar, many problems in natural language processing, in particular language translation and grammar rewriting systems, can be expressed as transduction through the use of synchronous formalisms [2,3,4,5,6]. Recently, synchronous grammars are becoming more and more popular for the formal description of parallel texts representing translations for the same document. The underlying idea of such formalisms is to combine two generative devices through a pairing of their productions in such a way that right Machine Translation Based on Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammar 613 hand side non-terminal symbols in the paired productions are linked. However, such formalisms are less expressive and unable to express mutual translations that have different lengths and crossing dependencies. Moreover, synchronous formalisms do not deal with unification and feature structures, as in unification-based formalisms, that give patterns additional power for describing constraints on features. For examples, Multiple Context-Free Grammar [4], where functions are engaged to the non-terminal symbols in the productions to further interpreting the symbols in target generation. In [7], Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) has been proposed for simultaneously bracketing parallel corpora as a variant of Syntax Directed translation schema [8]. But these formalisms are lacked of expressive to describe discontinuous constituents in linguistic expression. Generalized Multitext Grammar (GMTG) proposed by [5,9] is constructed by maintaining two sets of productions as components, one for each language, for modeling parallel texts. Although GMTG is more expressive and can be used to express as independent rewriting, the lack of flexibility in the way to describe constraints on the features associated with a non-terminal makes it difficult to the development of practical MT system.","In this paper, a variation of synchronous grammar, Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammar (CSG), is proposed based on the formalism of context-free grammar. Through the use of feature structures as that in unification-based grammar, the first component of productions in CSG, that describes the sentential patterns for source text, is generalized while the corresponding target rewriting rules for each production are grouped in a vector representing the possible translation patterns for source production. The choice of rule for target generation is based on the constraints on features of non-terminal symbols in pattern. Our motivation is three-fold. First, synchronous formalisms have been proposed for modeling of parallel text, and such algorithms can infer the synchronous structures of texts for two different languages through the grammar representation of their syntactic deviations. That is quite suitable for use in the analysis of languages pair in the development of MT system. Secondly, by augmented the synchronous models with feature structures can enhance the pattern with additional power in describing gender, number, agreement, etc. Since the descriptive power of unification-based grammars is considerably greater than that of classical CFG [10,11]. Finally, by retaining the notational and intuitive simplicity of CFG, we can enjoy both a grammar formalism with better descriptive power than CFG and more efficient parsing and generation algorithm controlled by the feature constraints of symbols hence to achieve the purposes of word sense and syntax disambiguation."]},{"title":"2 Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammars","paragraphs":["Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammars (CSG) is defined by means of the syntax of context-free grammar (CFG) to the case of synchronous. The formalism consists of a set of generative productions and each production is constructed by a pair of CFG rules with zero and more syntactic head and link constraints for the non-terminal symbols in patterns. In a similar way, the first component (in right hand side of productions) represents the sentential patterns of source language, while the second component represents the translation patterns in target language, called source and target component respectively in CSG. Unlike other synchronous formalisms, the target 614 F. Wong et al. component of production consists of one or more generative rules associated with zero or more controlled conditions based on the features of non-terminal symbols of source rule for describing the possible generation correspondences in target translation. In such a way, the source components in CSG are generalized by leaving the task of handling constraints on features in target component, so this also helps to reduce the grammar size. For example, following is one of the productions used in the MT system for Portuguese to Chinese translation: S → NP1 VP* NP2 PP NP3 {[NP1 VP1","NP","3 VP2 NP","2;VPcate=vb1, VPs:sem = NP1sem, VPio:sem=NP2sem,VPo:sem=NP3sem], [NP1 VP NP3 NP2 ;VP =vb0,VPs:sem =NP1sem, VPio:sem=NP2sem]} (1)","The production has two components beside the reduced syntactic symbol on left hand side, the first modeling Portuguese and the second Chinese. The target component in this production consists of two generative rules maintained in vector, and each of which is engaged with control conditions based on the features of symbols from the source component, and this is used as the selectional preferences in parsing. These constraints, in the parsing/generation algorithm, are used for inferring, not only, the structure of input to dedicate what structures are possible or probable, but also the structure of output text for target translation. For example, the condition expression: VPcate=vb1, VPs:sem=NP1sem, VPio:sem=NP2sem, VPo:sem=NP3sem, specifies if the senses of the first, second and the third nouns (NPs) in the input strings matched to that of the subject, direct and indirect objects governed by the verb, VP, with the category type of vb1. Once the condition gets satisfied, the source structure is successfully recognized and the corresponding structure of target language, NP1 VP1","NP","3 VP2 NP 2, is determined also.","Non-terminal symbols in source and target rules are linked if they are given the same index “subscripts” for case of multiple occurrences, such as NPs in the production: S → NP1 VP NP2 PP NP3 [NP1 VP*","NP","3 NP2], otherwise symbols that appear only once in both the source and target rules, such as VPs, are implicitly linked to give the synchronous rewriting. Linked non-terminal must be derived from a sequence of synchronized pairs. Consider the production: S → NP1 VP NP2 PP NP3 [NP1 VP*","NP","3 NP2], the second NP (NP2) in the source rule corresponds to the third NP (NP2) in the target rule, the third NP (NP3) in source rule corresponds to the second NP (NP3) in target pattern, while the first NP (NP1) and VP correspond to each other in both source and target rules. The symbol marked by an “*” is designated as head element in pattern, this allows the features of designated head symbol propagate to the reduced non-terminal symbol in the left hand side of production rule, hence to achieve the property of features inheritance in CSG formalism. The use of features structures associated to non-terminal symbols will be discussed in the later section in this paper.","In modeling of natural language, in particular for the process of languages-pair, the treatment for non-standard linguistic phenomena, i.e. crossing dependencies, discontinuous constituents, etc., is very important due to the structure deviations of two different languages, in particular for languages from different families such as Portuguese and Chinese [12,13]. Linguistic expressions can vanish and appear in translation. For example, the preposition (PP) in the source rule does not show up in any of Machine Translation Based on Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammar 615 the target rules in Production (1). In contrast, Production (2) allows the Chinese characters of “ ” and “ ” to appear in the target rules for purpose to modify the noun (NP) together with the quantifier (num) as the proper translation for the source text. This explicitly relaxes the synchronization constraint, so that the two components can be rewritten independently.","NP → num NP* {[num NP; NPsem=SEM_book], [num NP; NPsem=SEM_automobile]} (2)","A remarkable strength of CSG is its expressive power to the description of discontinuous constituents. In Chinese, the use of combination words that discontinuously distributed in a sentence is very common. For example, take the sentences pair [“Ele vendeu-me todas as uvas. (He sell me all the grapes.)”, “ ”]. The Chinese preposition “ ” and the verb “ ” should be paired with the Portuguese verb “vendeu”, and this causes a fan-out1","and discontinuous constituent in the Chinese component. The following fragment of CSG productions represents such relationships.","S → NP1 VP* NP2 NP3 {[NP1 VP1","NP","3 VP2 NP 2 ; VPcate=vb0,...],..} VP → vendeu* {[ , ;∅]} (3) (4)","In Production (3), the corresponding discontinuous constituents of VP (from source rule) are represented by VP1","and VP2","respectively in the target rule, where the “superscripts” are added to indicate the pairing of the VP in target component. The corresponding translation constituents in the lexicalized production are separated by commas representing the discontinuity between constituents “ ” and “ ” in target translation. During the rewriting phase, the corresponding constituents will be used to replace the syntactic symbols in pattern rule."]},{"title":"3 Definitions","paragraphs":["Let L be a context-free language defined over terminal symbol VT and generated by a context-free grammar G using non-terminal symbol VN disjointed with VT, starting symbol S, and productions of the form A → w where A is in VN and w in (VN VT)*.

Similarly, P is said to translate s iff there is a synchronized derivation sequence Q for s such that P accepts s, and the link constraints of associated target rules in Q is satisfied. The derivation Q then produces a translation t as the resulting sequence of terminal symbols included in the determined target rules in Q. The translation of an input string s essentially consists of three steps. First, the input string is parsed by using the source rules of productions. Secondly, the link constraints are propagated from source rule to target component to determine and build a target derivation sequence. Finally, translation of input string is generated from the target derivation sequence. 3.1 Feature Representation In CSG, linguistic entities are modeled as feature structures which give patterns additional power for describing gender, number, semantic, attributes and number of the arguments required by a verb, and so on. These information are encoded in the commonly used attribute value matrices (AVMs), attached to each of the lexical and syntactic symbols in CSG. This allows us to specify such as syntactic dependencies as agreement and sub-categorization in patterns. Unlike other unification-based grammars [11,14], we do not carry out the unification in full, only interested conditions that are explicitly expressed in the rule constraints are tested and unified. Such unification process can perform in constant time. The use of feature constraints has to be restricted to maintain the efficiency of parsing and generating algorithms, especially to the prevention from generating a large number of ambiguous structure candidates. The word selection in the target language can also be achieved by checking features. In the parsing and generating algorithm, the features information are propagated to the reduced symbol from the designated head element in pattern, hence to realize the mechanism of features inheritance. Features can either be put in lexical dictionary isolated from the formalism to make the work simpler to the construction of analytical grammar, or explicitly encoded in the pre-terminal rules as:  4 If there is no any constraint associated to a target rule, during the parsing phase, the reduction of the source rule is assumed to be valid all the time. 618 F.

An-other way to enhance the CSG formalism is to apply the soft preferences other than hard constraints in the process of features unification. Our consideration is two-fold: first, we found that more than one combination of feature values engaged to a single lexical item is very common in the process of natural language, i.e. one word may have several translations according to the different senses and the pragmatic uses of the word, and this has been the problem of word senses disambiguation [15]. Secondly, the conventional feature unification method can only tell us if the process successes or not. In case of a minor part of conditions get failed during the unification, all the related candidates are rejected without any flexibility to choosing the next preferable or probable candidate. In order to resolve these problems, each feature structure is associates with a weight. It is then possible to rank the matching features according to the linear ordering of the weights rather than the order of lexical items expressed in grammars or dictionary. In our prototyping system, each symbol has its original weight, and according to preference measurement at the time in checking the feature constraints, a penalty is used to reduce from the weight to give the effective weight of associated features in a particular context. Features with the largest weight are to be chosen as the most preferable content."]},{"title":"4 Application to Portuguese-Chinese MT","paragraphs":["CSG formalism can be parsed by any known CFG parsing algorithm including the Earley [16] and generalized LR algorithms [17] augmented by taking into account the features constraints and the inference of target structure. In the prototyping system, the parsing algorithm for our formalism is based on the generalized LR algorithm that we have development for MT system, since the method uses a parse table, it achieves a considerable efficiency over the Earley’s non-complied method which has to compute a set of LR items at each stage of parsing [17]. Generalized LR algorithm was first introduced by Tomita for parsing the augmented Context-Free grammar that can ingeniously handle non-determinism and ambiguity through the use of graphstructured stack while retaining much of the advantages of standard LR parsing","5",". It takes a shift-reduce approach using an extended LR parse table to guide its actions by allowing the multiple actions entries such as shift/reduce and reduce/reduce hence to handle the nondeterministic parse with pseudo-parallelism. In order to adapt to our formalism, we further extend the parse table by engaging with the features constraints and the target rules into the actions table. Our strategy is thus to parse the source rules of CSG productions through the normal shift actions proposed by the parsing table, while at the time reduce action to be fired, the associated conditions are checked to determine if the active reduction is a valid action or not depending on if the working symbols of patterns fulfill the constraints on features.  5 Especially when the grammar is close to the LR grammars.

The ACTION-GOTO table s indexed by a state symbol s (row) and a symbols x ∈VN VT, including the end marker “⊥”. The entry ACTION[s, x] can be one of the following: s n, r m, acc or blank. s n denotes a shift action representing GOTO[s, x]=n, defining the next state the parser should go to; r m means a reduction by the mth","production located in the entry of CONSTRAINT-RULE in state s, and acc denotes the accept action and blank indicates a parsing error. The CONSTRAINT-RULE table is indexed by state symbol s (row) and the number of productions m that may be applied for reduction in state s. The entry CONSTRAINT-RULE[s, m] consists of a set of involved productions together with the target rules and features constraints that are used for validating if the active parsing node can be reduced or not, then try to identify the corresponding target generative rule for reduced production. 4.2 The CSG Parser In the parsing process, the algorithm operates by maintaining a number of parsing processes in parallel, each of which represents an individual parsed result, hence to handle the case of non-deterministic. In general, there are two major components in the process, shift(i) and reduce(i), which are called at each position i=0, 1, ..., n in an input string I = x1x2...xn. The shift(i) process with top of stack vertex v shifts on xi from its current state s to some successor state s’ by creating a new leaf v’; establishing edge from v’ to the top of stack v; and making v’ as the new top of stack vertex.","The reduce(i) executes a reduce action on a production p by following the chain ofparent links down from the top of stack vertex v to the ancestor vertex from which the process began scanning for p earlier, then popping intervening vertices off the stack.

Unlike other transfer-based MT systems that the major components: analysis, transfer and generation are carried out individually in pipeline by using different sets of representation rules to achieve the tasks of structure analysis and transformation [19], in PCT, only a single set of CS grammar is used to dominate the translation task. Since the structures of parallel languages are synchronized in formalism, as well as the deviations of their structures are also captured and described by the grammar. Hence, to the translation of an input text, it essentially consists of three steps. First, for an input sentence s, the structure of string is analyzed by using the rules of source components from the CSG productions; by using the augmented generalized LR parsing algorithm as described. Secondly, the link constraints that are determined during the rule reduction process are propagated to the corresponding target rules R (as selection of target rules) to construct a target derivation sequence Q. And finally, based on the derivation sequence Q, translation of the input sentence s is generated by referencing the set of generative rules R that attached to the corresponding constituent nodes in the parsed tree, hence to realize the translation in target language."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have proposed a variation of synchronous grammar based on the syntax of context-free grammar, called Constraint-based Synchronous Grammar (CSG).
