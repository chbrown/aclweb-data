Various tagging schemes for marking chunk boundaries are discussed along with their results. Contextual information is incorporated into the chunk tags in the form of part-of-speech (POS) information. This information is also added to the tokens themselves to achieve better precision. Error analysis is carried out to reduce the number of common errors. It is found that for certain classes of words, using the POS information is more effective than using a combination of word and POS tag as the token. Finally, chunk labels are also marked on the chunks."]},{"title":"1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation and Problem Statement","paragraphs":["A robust chunker or shallow parser has emerged as an important component in a variety of NLP applications. It is employed in information extraction, named entity identication, search, and even in machine translation. While chunkers may be built using handcrafted linguistic rules, these tend to be fragile, need a relatively long time to develop because of many special cases, and saturate quickly. The task of chunking is ideally suited for machine learning because of robustness and relatively easy training.","A chunker or shallow parser identies simple or non-recursive noun phrases, verb groups and simple adjectival and adverbial phrases in running text. In this work, the shallow parsing task has been broken up into two subtasks: rst, identifying the chunk boundaries and second, labelling the chunks with their syntactic categories.","The rst sub-problem is to build a chunker that takes a text in which words are tagged with part of speech (POS) tags as its input, and marks the chunk boundaries in its output. Moreover, the chunker is to be built by using machine learning techniques requiring only modest amount of training data. The second sub-problem is to label the chunks with their syntactic categories.","The presented work aims at building a chunker for Hindi. Hindi is spoken by approximately half a billion people in India. It is a relatively free word order language with simple morphology (albeit a little more complex than that of English). At present, no POS taggers or chunkers are available for Hindi. 1.2 Survey of Related Work Chunking has been studied for English and other languages, though not very extensively. The earliest work on chunking based on machine learning goes to (Church K, 1988) for English. (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) used transformation based learning using a large annotated corpus for English. (Skut and Brants, 1998) modied Church’s approach, and used standard HMM based tagging methods to model the chunking process. (Zhou,et al., 2000) continued using the same methods, and achieved an accuracy of 91.99% precision and 92.25% recall using a contextual lexicon.","(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) use support vec-"]},{"title":"126","paragraphs":["tor machines for chunking with 93.48% accuracy for English. (Veenstra and Bosch, 2000) use memory based phrase chunking with accuracy of 91.05% precision and 92.03% recall for English. (Osborne, 2000) experimented with various sets of features for the purpose of shallow parsing.","In this work, we have used HMM based chunking. We report on a number of experiments show-ing the effect of different encoding methods on accuracy. Different encodings of the input show the effect of including either words only, POS tags only, or a combination thereof, in training. Their effect on transition probabilities is also studied. We do not use any externally supplied lexicon. Analogous to (Zhou,et al., 2000), we found that for certain POS categories, a combination of word and the POS category must be used in order to obtain good results. We report on detailed experiments which show the effect of each of these combinations on the accuracy. This experience can also be used to build chunkers for other languages. The overall accuracy reached for Hindi is 92.63% precision with 100% recall for chunk boundaries.","The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the problem formulation and reports the results of some initial experiments. In Section 3, we present a different representation of chunks which signicantly increased the accuracy of chunking. In Section 4, we present a detailed error analysis, based on which changes in chunk tags are carried out. These changes increased the accuracy. Section 5 describes experiments on labelling of chunks using rule-based and statistical methods."]},{"title":"2 Initial Experiments","paragraphs":["Given a sequence of words W n","= (w1; w2; ; wn); wi 2 W, where W is the word set and the sequence of corresponding part of speech (POS) tags T n","= (t","1; t2; ; tn); ti 2 T where T is the POS tag set, the aim is to create most probable chunks of the sequence W n",".

C here is the chunk tag set which may consist of symbols such as STRT and CNT for each word marking it as the start or continuation of a chunk. In our experiment, we combine the corresponding words and POS tags to get a sequence of new tokens V n","= (v","1; v2; ; vn)","where vi = (wi; ti) 2 V.

Using chain-rule, the problem reduces to that of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) given by maxci2C n ∏ i=1 P (vijci)P (ci+kjci; ; ci+k 1)","(2) where the probabilities in the rst term are emission probabilities and in the second term are transition probabilities. The optimal sequence of chunk tags can be found using the Viterbi algorithm. For training and testing of HMM we have used the TnT system (Brants, 2000). Since TnT is implemented up to a tri-gram model, we use a second order HMM (k = 2) in our study.","Before discussing the possible chunk sets and the token sets, we consider an example below.","(( sher )) (( hiraN ke pIche )) lion deer of behind NN NN PREP PREP STRT STRT CNT CNT","(( jangal meM )) (( bhAgA . )) forest in ran .

To overcome this limitation in using TnT, we experimented with additional chunk tags.","We rst considered a 3-tag scheme by including an additional chunk tag STP which indicates end of chunk.

Even though the information content in the 3 different chunk tag representations is the same, using higher tag scheme for training and then later converting back to 2-tags results in a signicant improvement in the precision of the tagger. For example, in the case where we took ’Word POSTag’ as the token, using 4-tag set the original precision was 73.64%. When precision was measured by reducing the tag set to 3 tags, we obtained a precision of 79.56%. Four tags reduced to two gave the highest precision of 85.6%. However, these differences may be interpreted as the result of changing the measurement metric. This gure of 85.6% may be compared with a precision of 81.85% obtained when the 2-tag set was used.

In other words, part of speech information would now inuence both the transition and emission probabilities of the model instead of just the emission probabilities.","We carried out the experiment with these modied tags. Based on the results in Table 1 for various tokens, we restricted our choice of tokens to Word POStags only. Also, while combining POS tags with chunk tags, the 4-tag scheme was used.

One was based on machine learning while the other was based on rules. 5.1 HMM Based Chunk Labelling In this method, the chunk boundary tags are augmented with the chunk labels while learning.

This, we believe, is likely to happen, when T2 is more nely and appropriately differentiated. The most striking example was where T1 consisted of chunk boundaries and T2 consisted of boundaries and labels. Training with T2 outperformed T1 for the boundary task, even though it did not perform very well in the labelling task."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Steven Abney. 1996.
