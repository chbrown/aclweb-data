We assume that the context of a sentence is indicated by a latent variable of the model as a topic and that the likelihood of each variable can be inferred. A paraphrase is evaluated for whether its sentences are used in the same context. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves almost 60% accuracy and that there is not a large performance difference between the two models. The results also revealed an upper bound of accuracy of 77% with the method when using only topic information."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper proposes a method to evaluate whether a paraphrasing pair is contextually independent. Evaluating a paraphrasing pair is important when we extract paraphrases from a corpus or apply a paraphrase to a sentence, since we must guarantee that the paraphrase carries almost the same meaning. However, the meaning carried by a sentence is affected by its context. Thus, we focus on the contextual dependency of paraphrases.","A thing can be expressed by various expressions, and a single idea can be paraphrased in many ways to enrich its expression or to increase understanding. Paraphrasing plays a very important role in natural language expressions. However, it is very hard for machines to handle different expressions that carry the same meaning.","The importance of paraphrasing has been widely acknowledged, and many paraphrasing studies have been carried out. Using only surface similarity is insufficient for evaluating paraphrases because there are not only surface differences but many other kinds of differences between paraphrased sentences. Thus, it is not easy to evaluate whether two sentences carry almost the same meaning.","Some studies have constructed and evaluated hand-made rules (Takahashi et al., 2001; Ohtake and Yamamoto, 2001). Others have tried to extract paraphrases from corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001), which are very useful because they enable us to construct paraphrasing rules. In addition, we can construct an example-based or a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)-like paraphrasing system that utilizes paraphrasing examples. Thus, collect-ing paraphrased examples must be continued to achieve high-performance paraphrasing systems.","Several methods of acquiring paraphrases have been proposed (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Yamamoto, 2002). Some use parallel corpora as resources to obtain paraphrases, which seems a promising way to extract high-quality paraphrases.","However, unlike translation, there is no obvious paraphrasing direction. Given paraphrasing pair E1:E2, we have to know the paraphrasing direction to paraphrase from E1 to E2 and vice versa. When extracting paraphrasing pairs from corpora, whether the paraphrasing pairs are con-"]},{"title":"65","paragraphs":["textually dependent paraphrases is a serious problem, and thus there is a specific paraphrase direction for each pair. In addition, it is also important to evaluate a paraphrasing pair not only when extracting but also when applying a paraphrase.","Consider this example, automatically extracted from a corpus: Can I pay by traveler’s check? / Do you take traveler’s checks? This example seems contextually independent. On the other hand, here is another example: I want to buy a pair of sandals. / I’m looking for sandals. This example seems to be contextually dependent, because we don’t know whether the speaker is only looking for a single pair of sandals. In some contexts, the latter sentence means that the speaker is seeking or searching for sandals. In other words, the former sentence carries specific meaning, but the latter carries generic meaning. Thus, the paraphrasing sentences are contextually dependent, and although the paraphrasing direction from specific to generic might be acceptable, the opposite direction may not be.","We can solve part of this problem by inferring the contexts of the paraphrasing sentences. A text model with latent variables can be used to infer the topic of a text, since latent variables correspond to the topics indicated by texts. We assume that a topic indicated by a latent variable of a text model can be used as an approximation of context. Needless to say, however, such an approximation is very rough, and a more complex model or more powerful approach must be developed to achieve performances that match human judgement in evaluating paraphrases.","The final goal of this study is the evaluation of paraphrasing pairs based on the following two factors: contextual dependency and paraphrasing direction. In this paper, however, as a first step to evaluate paraphrasing pairs, we focus on the evaluation of contextual dependency by using probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) as text models with latent variables."]},{"title":"2 Latent Variable Models and Topic Inference","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce two latent variable models, pLSI and LDA, and also explain how to infer a topic with the models.","In addition to pLSI and LDA, there are other latent variable models such as mixture of unigrams. We used pLSI and LDA because Blei et al. have already demonstrated that LDA outperforms mixture of unigrams and pLSI (Blei et al., 2003), and a toolkit has been developed for each model.","From a practical viewpoint, we want to determine how much performance difference exists between pLSI and LDA through evaluations of contextual paraphrase dependency. The time complexity required to infer a topic by LDA is larger than that by pLSI, and thus it is valuable to know the performance difference. 2.1 Probabilistic LSI PLSI is a latent variable model for general cooccurrence data that associates an unobserved topic variable z ∈ Z = {z1, · · · , zK } with each observation, i.e., with each occurrence of word w ∈ W = {w1, · · · , wM } in document d ∈ D = {d1, · · · dN }.","PLSI gives joint probability for a word and a document as follows: P (d, w) = P (d)P (w|d), (1) where P (w|d) = ∑ z∈Z P (w|z)P (z|d). (2)","However, to infer a topic indicated by a document, we have to obtain P (z|d). From (Hofmann, 1999), we can derive the following formulas: P (z|d, w) ∝ P (z)P (d|z)P (w|z) (3) and P (d|z) ∝ ∑ w n(d, w)P (z|d, w), (4) where n(d, w) denotes term frequency, which is the number of times w occurs in d.

A topic z that maximizes Formula 5 is inferred as the topic of document d. 2.2 Latent Dirichlet Allocation Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus. The basic idea is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.","LDA gives us the marginal distribution of a document (p(d|α, β), d = (w1, w2, · · · wN )) by the following formula: ∫ p(θ|α) ( N∏ n=1 ∑ zn p(zn|θ)p(wn|zn, β) ) dθ, (6) where α parameterizes Dirichlet random variable θ and β parameterizes the word probabilities, and zn indicates a topic variable zn ∈ Z = {z1, z2, · · · , zN }. To obtain the probability of a corpus, we take the product of the marginal probabilities of single documents.","Here, we omit the details of parameter estimation and the inference of LDA due to space limitations. However, the important point is that the Dirichlet parameters used to infer the probability of a document can be seen as providing a representation of the document in the topic simplex. In other words, these parameters indicate a point in the topic simplex. Thus, in this paper, we use the largest elements of the parameters to infer the topic (as an approximation of context) to which a given text belongs."]},{"title":"3 Evaluating Paraphrases with Latent Variable Models","paragraphs":["To evaluate a paraphrasing pair of sentences, we must prepare a learning corpus for constructing latent variable models. It must be organized so that it consist of documents, and each document must be implicated in a specific context.","Both latent variable models pLSI and LDA require vector format data for their learning. In this paper, we follow the bag-of-words approach and prepare vector data that consist of words and their frequency for each document in the learning corpus.","After constructing the pLSI and LDA models, we can infer a topic by using the models with vector data that correspond to a target sentence.The vector data for the target sentence are constructed by using the target sentence and the sentences that surround it. From these sentences, the vector data that correspond to the target sentence are constructed. We call the number of sentences used to construct vector data “window size.”","Evaluating a paraphrasing pair (P 1:P 2) is simple. Construct vector data (vec(P 1) and vec(P 2)) and infer contexts (T (P 1) and T (P 2)) by using a latent variable model. Using pLSI, the topic that indicates the highest probability is used as the inferred result, and using LDA, the largest parameter that corresponds to the topic is used as the inferred result. If topics T (P 1) and T (P 2) are different, the sentences might be used in different contexts, and the paraphrasing pair would be contextually dependent; otherwise, the paraphrasing pair would be contextually independent."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We carried out several experiments that automatically evaluated extracted paraphrases with pLSI and LDA. To carry out these experiments, we used plsi-0.031","by Kudo for pLSI and lda-c2 toolkit by Blei (Blei et al., 2003) for LDA. 4.1 Data set We used a bilingual corpus of travel conversation containing Japanese sentences and corresponding English translations (Takezawa et al., 2002). Since the translations were made sentence by sentence, this corpus was sentence-aligned from its origin and consisted of 162,000 sentence pairs.","The corpus was manually and roughly annotated with topics. Each topic had a two-level hierarchical structure whose first level consisted of 19 topics. Each first-level topic had several subtopics. The second level consisted of 218 topics, after expanding all subtopics of each topic in the first level. A rough annotation example is shown in Table 1; the hierarchical structure of this topic seems unorganized. For example, in the first-level topic, there are topics labeled basic and communication, which seem to overlap.","1","http://chasen.org/t̃aku/software/plsi/","2","http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/b̃lei/lda-c/"]},{"title":"67","paragraphs":["Table 1: Examples of manually annotated topics sentence 1st topic 2nd topic Where is the nearest department store? shopping buying something That’s too flashy for me. shopping choosing something There seems to be a mistake on my bill. staying checkout There seems to be a mistake on my bill. staying complaining","In the corpus, however, there is an obvious textual cohesion such that sentences of the same topic are locally gathered. Each series of sentences can be used as a document for a text model. Under the assumption that each series of sentences is a document, the average number of sentences included in a document is 18.7, and the average number of words included in a document is 44.9. 4.2 Extracting paraphrases A large collection of parallel texts contains many sentences in one language that correspond to the same expression in the other language for translation. For example, if Japanese sentences Ji1, ..., Jim correspond to English sentence Ei, then these Japanese sentences would be paraphrases.","We utilized a very simple method to extract Japanese paraphrases from the corpus. First, we extracted duplicate English sentences by exact matching. From the learning set, 18,505 sentences were extracted. Second, we collected Japanese sentences that correspond to each extracted English sentence. Next, we obtained sets of Japanese sentences collected by using English sentences as pivots. In the corpus, one English sentence averaged almost 4.5 Japanese sentences, but this number included duplicate sentences. If duplicate sentences are excluded, the average number of Japanese sentences corresponding to an English sentence becomes 2.4. Finally, we obtained 944,547 Japanese paraphrasing pairs by combining sentences in each group of Japanese sentences.","4.3 Comparing human judgement and inference by latent variable models In this section, we determine the difference between manually annotated topics and inference results using pLSI and LDA. We originally considered evaluating each paraphrase as a binary classification problem that determines whether both sentences of the paraphrase are used in the same context. We evaluated the inferred results by comparison with the manually annotated topics, and thus accuracy could be calculated when the manually annotated topics were correct. However, accuracy is inappropriate for evaluating results inferred by a latent variable model, since the topics were roughly annotated by humans as mentioned in Section 4.1. Accordingly, we employed Kappa statistics as a rough guide for the correctness of the inferred results by latent variable models.","Tables 2 and 3 show the comparison results, where the window size is 11 (the target sentence + the previous five and the following five sentences). When constructing pLSI models, the parameter for tempered EM (TEM) is set to 0.9 (we use this value in all of the experiments in this paper), because it showed the best performance in preliminary experiments.

There were 71 contextually independent paraphrases and 37 contextually dependent paraphrases. Nine paraphrases had problems, all of which were caused by translation errors. The phrase “contextually independent paraphrases” means that the paraphrases can be used in any context and can be applied as two-way paraphrases. On the other hand, “contextually dependent paraphrases” means that the paraphrases are one-way, and so we have to give consideration to the direction of each paraphrase.

According to the basic idea of this method, a contextually independent paraphrasing pair should be judged as having the same topic, and a contextually dependent pair should be judged as having a different topic. Thus, we introduced a criterion to evaluate labeling results in terms of an error rate, defined as follows: Error rate = |Dindep| + |Sdep| # of judged pairs , (7) where Dindep denotes a set that consists of paraphrasing pairs that are judged as having different topics but are contextually independent. On the other hand, Sdep denotes a set that consists of paraphrasing pairs that are judged as having the same topic, but are contextually dependent.","For example, from the results in Table 8, the error rate of the results for the first-level topic is 0.398 ((25 + 18)/108), and that for the second-level topic is 0.528 ((46 + 11)/108).","To estimate the upper bound of this method, we also investigated potentially unavoidable errors. Several paraphrasing pairs are used for the exact same topic, but they seem contextually dependent because several words are different. On the other hand, some paraphrasing pairs seem to be used in obviously different topics but are contextually independent. Table 9 shows the investigation results; at least ten paraphrasing pairs seem contextually independent but are actually used in different topics. In addition, there are at least 15 paraphrasing pairs whose topic is obviously the same, but several differences of words make them contextually dependent. Moreover, in this case, the error rate is 0.231 ((15+10)/108), meaning that it is difficult to judge all of the paraphrasing pairs correctly by using only topic (contextual) information. Thus, this method’s upper bound of accuracy when using only topic information is estimated to be around 77%.","Table 9: Potential upper bound of this method human judgement human judgement from paraphrasing based on topic perspective same different independent 61 10 dependent 15 22","We prepared several latent variable models to investigate the performance of the proposed method and applied it to the sampled paraphrasing sentences mentioned above.

On the other hand, pLSI seems robust against information shortages due to a small window, but it is not effective with a large window. The best performances were shown at window size 15 for both pLSI and LDA, since the average number of sentences in a document (segment) is 18.7, as shown in Section 4.1.","Table 7 shows that in spite of the difference in programing language, pLSI is faster than LDA in practice. In addition, Table 8 reveals that judging the contextual dependency of paraphrasing pairs does not require fine-grained topics.","From the results shown in Table 10, we can conclude that topic inference by latent variable models resembles context judgement by humans as recorded in error rate. However, we note that the error rate was not weighted for contextually independent or dependent results. Error rate is simply a relative index. For example, if there is a result in which all of the inferences reflect the same topic, then the error rate becomes 0.3426. Thus it is important to detect a contextually dependent paraphrase. Considering these points, pLSI20 with window size 11 shows very good results in Table 10.","In Section 4.4, we showed the potential upper bound of this method. The smallest error rate is 0.231, and we can estimate a corrected error by the following formula: |Dindep| + |Sdep| − C # of judged pairs − C , (8) where C denotes the correction value that corresponds to the number of paraphrasing pairs judged incorrectly with only contextual information. In our experiments, from the results shown in Table 9, C is set to 25. From the results shown in Table 10, we can conclude that the performance of our method is almost the same as that by the manually annotated topics, and the accuracy of our method is almost 80% for paraphrasing pairs that can be judged by contextual information.","There are several possibilities for improving accuracy. One is using a f ixed window to obtain contextual information. Irrelevant sentences are sometimes included in fixed windows, and latent variable models fail on inference.

Unfortunately, we conclude that inferring the paraphrasing direction with contextual information is difficult. In the experimental results, however, there were several examples whose direction could be inferred from their contextual information. Thus, contextual information may benefit the inference of paraphrasing direction. Actually, in the experiments, 11 of 37 contextual dependent pairs had obvious paraphrasing directions. In most of the paraphrasing pairs, different words were used or inserted, or some words were deleted. Thus, to infer a paraphrasing direction, we need more specific information for words or sentences; for example what words carry specific or generic meaning and so on.","One might consider a supervised learning method, such as Support Vector Machine, to infer topics (e.g., (Lane et al., 2004)). However, we cannot know the best number of topics for an application in advance.
