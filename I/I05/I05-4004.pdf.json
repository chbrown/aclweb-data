However, there is no uniform specification for defining and processing metadata in Chinese corpus nowadays. This paper introduces a metadata system we’ve proposed for Chinese corpus. 46 elements are defined in all, which can be divided into 6 classes: information about copyright, information about background of linguistic material creator, information about medium of linguistic material, information about the content of linguistic material, information about collecting linguistic material, and information about management of linguistic material. To distinguish one element from another, or our elements from someone else’s, we provide a potent description method, where 10 subsections are designed to describe the detailed properties for each element. 1 Introduction","paragraphs":["“Metadata” is first defined in computer science. It plays an important role in the management of electronic resources, especially the huge information from Internet. By cataloguing the web pages, we can obtain a better search more efficiently. Nowadays, metadata becomes a popular tool to describe administrative information about all kinds of resources. It defines schemes for resource description, and also provides universal mechanism for resource retrieval.","In corpus linguistic, metadata description has existed for a long time, and is generally referred to heading information. By defining metadata, more accurate and profuse annotation contents can be provided for corpus, such as, information about time, area, author and etc. However, there is no uniform specification for processing metadata in Chinese corpus at present. Thus, we define a core metadata set for Chinese corpus and normalize the description of set element. Basing on the Dublin Core metadata, which is widely accepted in philology, the definition takes much attention on the linguistic characteristics of Chinese corpus, and is compatible to the OLAC metadata standards as well. Both creator and users of the corpus can get regulations of textual description and annotation strategy from this standard.","In section 2, we discuss some referenced standards and resources, including DC and OLAC metadata. Section 3 presents a framework within which we design our metadata, and lists the main problems to be solved. Section 4 summarizes our metadata description and reports some further development of the standard. Conclusion is drawn in section 5."]},{"title":"2 Related metadata resources 2.1 Dublin Core metadata","paragraphs":["Dublin Core Metadata has been present in OCLC NCSA National Center for Supercomputer Applications Meta Workshop in 1995.It’s a standard for cross-domain information resource description, and has no fundamental restrictions to the types of resources to which the metadata can be assigned.

Therefore, it’s expected that the corpus can be used directly without reannotation if they are annotated with DC metadata before."]},{"title":"2.2 OLAC metadata","paragraphs":["The OLAC Open Language Archives Community Metadatametadata set is based on the Dublin Core metadata set. In order to meet the specific needs of the language archiving community, the OLAC metadata set qualifies with three kinds of qualification: element refinement, encoding scheme, and content language. With these three attributes, an element in OLAC can indicate more information than the same one in DC does. Take the element “Date” in OLAC for example, with the element refinement, it can represent either date of create, or date of issue, or date of modification in different occasions","The elements in OLAC are listed in table 2,and we can see that it uses all the 15 elements in DC.

It’s designed for analyzing modern Chinese. Texts are collected from different areas and classified according to five criteria: genre, style, mode, topic, and source."]},{"title":"25","paragraphs":["Therefore, this corpus is a representative sample of modern Chinese language. Metadata in Sinica corpus lays special emphasis on describing the linguistics information of linguistic material, such as “Mode”, “Style”, “Medium”, and “Topic”. An example of metadata describing in Sinica corpus is given in table 3. 2.3.2 National modern Chinese corpus meta-","data National modern Chinese corpus is the largest balance corpus in China at present. The selection of linguistic material follows the principles of commonality, description and practicability. In order to reflect the panorama of modern Chinese, a lot of work has been done on designing balance gene. And the finally selected samples have a wide span on time, domain and medium.","Metadata in National modern Chinese corpus pay much attention on copyright information and publish information of linguistic material. Furthermore, both a global serial number and a category number are designed to identify a certain sample. 2.3.3 BNC metadata The British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of current British English, both spoken and written. Each text in BNC has a TEI header to indicate the identification and classification of individual text, special details such as speakers’, and the housekeeping information. The definition of text classification is meticulous. For spoken text material, age, sex, and class of respondent are all make sense as well as the domain, region and type of the content. And for written text material classification, age, sex, type of author, audience, circulation, status, medium, and domain are laid emphasis on. However, some classification were still poorly defined and partially populated, such a “dating”(date of copy or date of first publication?) and “domain” (has something different with text-type?). 2.3.4 Metadata in balanced corpus In recent years, the awareness that text is not just text, but that texts comes in several forms, has spread from more theoretical and literary subfields of linguistics to the more practically oriented information retrieval and natural language processing fields. As a consequence, several test collections available for research explicitly attempt to cover many or most well-established textual genres, or functional styles in well-balanced proportions","In practice, choosing balance gene is a professional work that needs a scientific programming strategy. Sinclair suggested a minimum set of balance gene for general corpus in 1991 that indicates a popular classify principle for linguistic: the style of linguistic (on-the-spot record or literature); the form of linguistic (formal or in-formal); the medium type of linguistic (from book or magazine or paper); and the age, sex of the author. From the Sinica corpus and National modern Chinese corpus we’ve discussed above, we can see that the gene of time, style, area and subject are most in frequent use, which become our crucial reference for metadata designing."]},{"title":"2.4 ISO1179 standard","paragraphs":["ISO1179 is an international standard about developing metadata.

For the universal use of these two metadata standards and the similarity between DC metadata and corpus metadata we discuss above, we finally used all the fifteen elements defined in DC standard. However, some elements are refined or splitted into several new elements on the basis of the old definition. For example, the elements “Date” is extended as “Indite Date”, “Issued Date”, “Created Date” and “Modified Date”, thus more detailed and definite information of date can be obtained for either a single sample or the whole corpus. And the same case for the element “Language” from DC. We defined three kinds of information about language to describe both creator information and content information.","To fully consider the linguistic characteristics of Chinese corpus, we’ve introduced several popular metadata elements in balanced corpus, such as style, mode, medium and so on, which are also important balance gene for corpus designing.","Therefore, we define 46 elements in all, which can be divided into 6 classes. They are: information about copyright, information about background of linguistic material creator, information about medium of linguistic material, information about the content of linguistic material, information about collecting linguistic material, and information about management of linguistic material. Most elements we defined are intellectual metadata, while some structural metadata, access control metadata and critical metadata are included as well."]},{"title":"3.2 Description field","paragraphs":["Metadata is structured data about data. It’s usually expressed with several property fields or subsections, which is regarded as its own data structure or syntax. Different metadata system may use different way to describe and naming its elements, thus it’s hard for metadata communion or understanding the same element from two dissimilar systems.","A unified method for description is helpful, and it’s expected to be succinct, general and distinguished. Our standard has provided 10 fields for a metadata description. Some are obligatory, that is to say you must give a value to such fields in order to confirm an element. And some are optional for the individuation use. This seems to do a better work than DC, while 6 fields in it always have settled value. We specially introduce two subsections for naming an element, thus elements can be distinguished exactly from either “Name” or “Long Name” field. We have exhibited such format in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and created the DTD (Document Type Definition) file for it as well."]},{"title":"3.3 Semantic description","paragraphs":["Semantic structure defines the detailed value of metadata, and finally affirms how to use it. Value land should be carefully considered to avoid confusion use. Many famous metadata standards have formed a maturity definition of elements. For example, DC use ISO 8601 to define element “date”, Dublin Core Types for element ”Resource Type” and URL or ISBN to define element “Identifier”. We took much account of the linguistic characteristics of Chinese corpus and some value are assigned refer to linguistics literature."]},{"title":"4 Metadata standard 4.1 Element set","paragraphs":["Our corpus metadata set is based on the Dublin Core metadata set and uses all fifteen elements defined in that standard. We’ve summarized some annotation items in other large-scale corpus and developed an element set listed in table 4.There are 46 elements in all.

Such information includes native language, born place, age, sex as well as creator’s name. For corpus’ creator is not always a single person, we define “Agent Type” to clarify such instance, and introduce other creators in “Contributor”. 4.1.3 Information about medium of linguistic","material Information about medium of linguistic material provides detailed data of publish region, influence area, circulation extent and so on, which are all important to evaluate the corpus’ balance gene.

When select linguistic material, many factors are considered. We discuss the information about collecting linguistic material in written corpus and oral corpus respectively.","In written corpus, elements mostly describe the information of material sample, such as how to abstract the sample or how long the sample linguistic material should be. Oral corpus has its particular way to collect materials, so we describe them from the scene character of the interlocution. 4.1.6 Information about management of lin-","guistic material Information about management of linguistic material record data for corpus management and further-processing. Most elements are designed for system administrator and it’s recommended that the data is user- sightless.
