Their underlying approaches can be classified into four types: (1) Optical character recognition (OCR) based (Chung 1993), (2) On-line handwriting based (Lee et al. 1997), (3) Speech based (Fu et al. 1996, Chen et al. 2000), and (4) Keyboard based consists of"]},{"title":"phonetic and pinyin based","paragraphs":["(Chang et al. 1991, Hsu et al. 1993, Hsu 1994, Hsu et al. 1999, Kuo 1995, Lua and Gan 1992); arbitrary codes based [Fan et al. 1988]; and structure scheme based (Huang 1985).","Currently, the most popular method for Chinese input is phonetic and pinyin based, because Chinese people are taught to write the corresponding phonetic and pinyin syllables of each Chinese character and word in primary school. In Chinese, each Chinese character corresponds to at least one syllable; and each Chinese word can be a mono-syllabic word, such as “ (mouse)”, a bi-syllabic word, such as “ (kangaroo)”, or a multi-syllabic word, such as “(Mickey mouse).” Although there are more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of which 5,400 are commonly used), there are only about 1,300 distinct syllables. As per (Qiao et al. 1984), each Chinese syllable can be mapped from 3 to over 100 Chinese characters, with the average number of characters per syllable being 17. According to our computation, the minimum, maximum and average numbers f Chinese words per syllable-word in MOE-MANDARIN dictionary “” (one of most commonly-used Chinese dictionaries published by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, its online dictionary is at (MOE)) are 1, 22 and 1.5, respectively. Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word conversion is much less than that of syllable-to-character conversion, the most existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al. 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al. 2002, MSIME) are addressed on syllable-to-word conversion, not syllable-to-character conversion. To the research field of Chinese speech recognition, the STW conversion is the main task of Chinese language processing in typical Chinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al. 1996, Lee et al. 1993, Chien et al. 1993, Su et al. 1992).","Conventionally, there are two approaches for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, se-"]},{"title":"9","paragraphs":["mantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, Fu et al. 1996, Hsu et al. 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al. 1991, Fu et al. 1996, Ho et al. 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003). Although the linguistic approach requires considerable effort in designing effective syntax rules, semantic templates or contextual informa-tion, it is more user-friendly than the statistical approach on understanding why such a system makes a mistake (Hsu 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002). On the other hand, the statistical language model (SLM) used in the statistical approach requires less effort and has been widely adopted in commercial Chinese input systems.","According to previous studies (Chung 1993, Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003), homophone selection and syllable-word segmentation are two critical problems to the STW conversion in Chinese. Incorrect homophone selection and failed syllable-word segmentation will directly influence the STW conversion rate. For example, consider the syllable sequence “yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4” of the sentence “(once)(covet)(China)(of) (making-wine) (technique). As per the MOE-MANDARIN dictionary, the two possible syllable-word segmentations (in pinyin) are:","(F)“yi1/du4ji4/yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4ji u3/ji4shu4”; and","(B)“yi1/du4/ji4yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4ji u3/ji4shu4.”","(We use the forward (F) and the backward (B) longest syllable-word first strategies (Chen et al. 1986, Tsai and Hsu 2002), and “/” to indicate a syllable-word boundary). Among the above syllable-word segmentations, there is an ambiguous syllable-word section: /du4ji4/yu2/ (/{}/{,,,,,,,, , ,,, ,, ,,, ,,, ,, }/); and /du4/ji4yu2/ (/{,,,,,, }/{, }/), respectively. For the ambiguous syllable-word section, the set of word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words (including bi-syllabic words in the following) and their corresponding word-pair frequencies found in the UDN2001 corpus are: { -(1), -(1), -(4), - (1), -(1), -(26), - (19)}. The UDN2001 corpus (Tsai and Hsu 2002) is a collection of 4,539,624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 articles on the United Daily News Website (UDN) in Taiwan. For this case, if the word-pair “(China)- (technique)” with the maximum frequency 26 is used to be the key word-pair, the set of co-occurrence word-pairs with the key word-pair found in the UDN2001 will be {-, -, -, -, -}. Then, by the key word-pair “-” and its co-occurrence word-pair set {-, - , -, -, -}, the mentioned ambiguous syllable-word section (/du4ji4/yu2/ and /du4/ji4yu2/) and the homophone selection of syllable-word /ji4 shu4/ (/{ (technique),(count)}/) of this case can be resolved, simultaneously. Thus, the Chinese words “ (once)”, “ (covet)”, “ (China)” and “(technique)” in the syllable sequence “yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4” can then be correctly identified. If we use the Microsoft Input Method Editor 2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) to translate the syllables, it will be converted into “ (once) (continue)(to)(China) (of)(making-wine)(technique).” As per (Gao et al. 2002), MSIME is a trigam-like Chinese input system. The two error converted words “(continue)” and “(to)” are widely recognized that unseen event (-) and over-weighting (-) the two major problems of SLM systems (Fu et al. 1996, Gao et al. 2002).","The objective of this study is to illustrate the effectiveness of word-pairs for resolving the STW conversion for improving the Chinese input systems. We also conduct STW experiments to show the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of a commercial input product and a bigram model can be improved by our word-pair identifier without a tuning process. Here, the “tonal” is to indicate the syllables input with four tones, such as “niang4() jiu3() ji4() shu4()” and the “toneless” is to indicate the syllables input without four tones, such as “niang( ) jiu() ji() shu().”"]},{"title":"10","paragraphs":["The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows.

Segmentation: Generate the word segmentation for a given Chinese sentence by backward maximum matching (BMM) techniques (Chen et al. 1986) with the system dictionary. Take the Chinese sentence “ (bring the military component parts here)” as an example. Its BMM word-segmentation is “(get)/(military)/(component parts)/ (bring)” and its forward maximum matching (FMM) word-segmentation is “(a general)/(use)/ (component parts)/ (bring).” According to our previous work (Tsai et al. 2004), the word segmentation precision of BMM is about 1% greater than that of FMM.","Step 2. Initial WP set: Extract all the combinations of word-pairs from the word segmentations of Step 1 to be the initial WP set. For the above case, there are six combinations of word-pairs extracted: {“/”, “/”, “/”, “ /”, “/”, “/”}.","Step 3. Final WP set: Select out the word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words to be the finial WP set. For the final WP set, if the word-pair is not found in the WP database, insert it into the WP database and set its frequency to 1; otherwise, increase its frequency by 1. In the above case, the final WP set includes three word-pairs: {“ /”, “/”, “/”}. By applying our AUTO-WP to the UDN2001 corpus (the training corpus), totally 25,439,679 word-pairs were generated. From the generated WP database, the frequencies of word-pairs “ /”, “/” and “/” are 1, 1 and 2, respectively. The frequency of a word-pair is the number of sentences that contain the word-pair with the same word-pair order in the training corpus."]},{"title":"2.2 Word-Pair Identifier","paragraphs":["The algorithm of our WP identifier for a given Chinese syllables is as follows: Step 1.

Since the unknown word problem is not specifically a STW problem, it can be easily taken care of through manual editing or semi-automatic learning during input. In practice, therefore, the tonal and toneless STW accuracies could be raised to 98% and 91%, respectively. Although some of unknown words have been incorporated in the system dictionary by a CWCA system (Tsai et al. 2004), they could still face the problems: inadequate syllable segmentation and failed homophone disambiguation.","(2) The major problem caused error conversions in tonal and toneless STW systems is different. To improve tonal STW systems, the major targets should be the cases of failed homophone selection (53% coverage). For toneless STW systems, on the other hand, the cases of inadequate syllable segmentation (51% coverage) should be the focus for improvement. To sum up the above two observations, the bottlenecks of the STW conversion lie in the second and third problems. To resolve these issues, we believe one simple and effective approach is to extend the size of WP database, because our experiment results show that the WP identifier can achieve better tonal and toneless STW accuracies than those of MSIME and BiGram on the WP-related portion."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and Future Directions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have applied a WP identifier to support the Chinese language processing on the STW conversion and obtained a high STW accuracy on the identified word-pairs. All of the WP data can be generated fully automatically by applying the AUTO-WP on the system and user corpus. We are encouraged by the fact that WP knowledge can achieve tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%, respectively, for the WP-related portion on the testing syllables. The WP identifier can be easily integrated into existing Chinese input systems by identifying word-pairs in a post-processing step. Our experimental results show that, by applying the WP identifier together with MSIME (a trigram-like model) and BiGram (an optimized bigram model), the tonal and toneless STW improvements of the two Chinese input systems are 27.5%/22.1% and 18.9%/18.8%, respectively. For adaptation STW approach, we have tried to apply the AUTO-WP to extract the word-pairs from the 10,000 open testing sentences into the testing WP database, the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of the MSIME with the adaptation WP identifier and the BiGram with the adaptation WP identifier will become 97.0%/97.2% and 91.1%/90.0%, respectively.","Currently, our approach is quite basic when more than one WP occurs in the same sentence. Although there is room for improvement, we believe it would not produce a noticeable effect as far as the STW accuracy is concerned. However, this issue will become important as we want to apply the WP knowledge to speech recognition. According to our computations, the collection of testing WP knowledge can cover approximately 50% and 40% of the characters in the UDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus, respectively.","We will continue to expand our collection of WP knowledge to cover more characters in the UDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus with Web corpus (search engine results) for improving our STW system.
