We first discuss a problem of developing a knowledge base by using natural language documents: wrong information in natural language documents. Then, we describe a method of detecting wrong information in mails posted to a mailing list and developing a knowledge base by using these mails. Finally, we show that question and answer mails posted to a mailing list can be used as a knowledge base for a QA system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Because of the improvement of NLP, research activities which utilize natural language documents as a knowledge base become popular, such as QA track on TREC (TREC) and NTCIR (NTCIR). However, there are a few QA systems which as-sumed the user model where the user asks how type question, in other words, how to do something and how to cope with some problem (Kuro 00) (Kiyota 02) (Mihara 05). This is because we have several difficulties in developing a QA system which answers how type questions. We focus attention to two problems below.","First problem is the difficulty of extracting evidential sentences. It is difficult to extract evidential sentences for answering how type questions only by using linguistic clues, such as, common content words and phrases. To solve this problem, (Kuro 00) and (Kiyota 02) proposed methods of collect-ing knowledge for answering questions from FAQ documents and technical manuals by using the document structure, such as, a dictionary-like structure and if-then format description. However, these kinds of documents requires the considerable cost of developing and maintenance. As a result, it is important to investigate a method of extracting evidential sentences for answering how type questions from natural language documents at low cost. To solve this problem, (Watanabe 04) proposed a method of developing a knowledge base by using mails posted to a mailing list (ML). We have the following advantages when we develop knowledge base by using mails posted to a mailing list.","† it is easy to collect question and answer mails in a specific domain, and","† there is some expectation that information is updated by participants","Next problem is wrong information. It is almost inevitable that natural language documents, especially web documents, contain wrong information. For example, (DA1–1) is opposed by (QR1–1–1).","(Q1) How I set up my wheel mouse for the netscape navigator?","(DA1–1) You can find a setup guide in the Dec. is-sue of SD magazine.","(QR1–1–1) I can not use it although I modified","/usr/lib/netscape/ja/Netscape accord-","ing to the guide. Wrong information is a central problem of developing a knowledge base by using natural language"]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["documents. As a result, it is important to investigate a method of detecting and correcting wrong information in natural language documents. (Watanabe 05) reported a method of detecting wrong information in question and answer mails posted to a mailing list. In (Watanabe 05), wrong information in the mails can be detected by using mails which ML participants submitted for correcting wrong information in the previous mails. Then, the system gives one of the following confirmation labels to each set of question and their answer mails:","positive label shows the information described in a set of a question and its answer mail is confirmed by the following mails,","negative label shows the information is opposed by the following mails, and","other label shows the information is not yet confirmed. Our knowledge base, on which our QA system bases, is composed of these labeled sets of a question and its answer mail. Finally, we describe a QA system: It finds question mails which are similar to user’s question and shows the results to the user. The similarity between user’s question and a question mail is calculated by matching of user’s question and the significant sentence extracted from the question mail. A user can easily choose and access information for solving problems by using the significant sentences and these confirmation labels."]},{"title":"2 Confirmed knowledge base developed by using mails posted to a mailing list","paragraphs":["There are mailing lists to which question and answer mails are posted frequently. For example, in Vine Users ML, several kinds of question and answer mails are posted by participants who are in-terested in Vine Linux 1",". We reported that mails posted to these kinds of mailing lists have the following features.","1. Answer mails can be classified into three types: (1) direct answer (DA) mail, (2) questioner’s reply (QR) mail, and (3) the others. Direct answer mails are direct answers to the original question. Questioner’s reply mails 1 Vine Linux is a linux distribution with a customized","Japanese environment. are questioner’s answers to the direct answer mails.","2. Question and answer mails do not have a firm structure because questions and their answers are described in various ways. Because of no firm structure, it is difficult to extract precise information from mails posted to a mailing list in the same way as (Kuro 00) and (Kiyota 02) did.","3. A mail posted to ML generally has a significant sentence. For example, a significant sentence of a question mail has the following features:","(a) it often includes nouns and unregistered words which are used in the mail subject. (b) it is often quoted in the answer mails.","(c) it often includes the typical expressions, such as, (ga / shikasi (but / however)) + ¢ ¢ ¢ + mashita / masen / shouka / imasu (can / cannot / whether / current situation is) + . (ex) Bluefish de nihongo font ga hyouji deki masen. (I cannot see Japanese fonts on Bluefish.) (d) it often occurs near the beginning. Taking account of these features, (Watanabe 05) proposed a method of extracting significant sentences from question mails, their DA mails, and QR mails by using surface clues. Furthermore, (Watanabe 05) proposed a method of detecting wrong information in a set of a question mail and its DA mail by using the QR mail.","For evaluating our method, (Watanabe 05) selected 100 examples of question mails in Vine Users ML. They have 121 DA mails. Each set of the question and their DA mails has one QR mail.","First, we examined whether the results of determining the confirmation labels were good or not. The results are shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows the type and number of incorrect confirmation. The reasons of the failures were as follows:","† there were many significant sentences which did not include the clue expressions.","† there were many sentences which were not significant sentences but included the clue expressions."]},{"title":"32","paragraphs":["Table 1: Results of determining confirmation labels type correct incorrect total positive 35 18 53 negative 10 4 14 other 48 6 54","Table 2: Type and number of incorrect confirmation incorrect type and number of correct answers confirmation positive negative other total positive – 4 14 18 negative 2 – 2 4 other 4 2 – 6","Table 3: Results of determining confirmation labels","to the proper sets of a question and its DA mail labeling result positive negative other total","correct 29 8 27 64","failure 4 4 15 23","† some question mails were submitted not for asking questions, but for giving some news, notices, and reports to the participants.

In other words, we examined whether","† there was good connection between the significant sentences or not, and † the confirmation label was proper or not. For example, (Q2) and (DA2–1) in Figure 1 have the same topic, however, (DA2–2) has a different topic. In this case, (DA2–1) is a good answer to question (Q2). A user can access the document from which (DA2–1) was extracted and obtain more detailed information. As a result, the set of (Q2) and (DA2–1) was determined as correct. On the contrary, the set of (Q2) and (DA2–1) was a failure. In this experiment, 87 sets of a question and its DA mail were determined as correct and 34 sets were failures. The reasons of the failures were as follows:","(Q2) vedit ha, sonzai shinai file wo hirakou to suru to core wo haki masuka. (Does vedit terminate when we open a new file?)","(DA2–1) hai, core dump shimasu. (Yes, it terminates.)","(DA2–2) shourai, GNOME ha install go sugu tsukaeru no","desu ka? (In near future, can I use GNOME just","after the installation?)","(Q3) sound no settei de komatte imasu. (I have much trouble in setting sound configuration.) (DA3–1) mazuha, sndconfig wo jikkou shitemitekudasai.","(First, please try ’sndconfig’.) (QR3–1–1) kore de umaku ikimashita. (I did well.) (DA3–2) sndconfig de, shiawase ni narimashita. (I tried","’sndconfig’ and became happy.)","(Q4) ES1868 no sound card wo tsukatte imasu ga, oto ga ookisugite komatte imasu. (My trouble is that sound card ES1868 makes a too loud noise.)

Figure 1: Examples of the significant sentence extraction","† wrong significant sentences extracted from question mails, and","† wrong significant sentences extracted from DA mails. Failures which were caused by wrong significant sentences extracted from question mails were not serious. This is because there is not much likelihood of matching user’s question and wrong significant sentence extracted from question mails. On the other hand, failures which were caused by wrong significant sentences extracted from DA mails were serious. In these cases, significant sentences in the question mails were successfully extracted and there is likelihood of matching user’s question and the significant sentence extracted from question mails. Therefore, the precision of the significant sentence extraction was emphasized in this task.","Next, we examined whether proper confirmation labels were given to these 87 good sets of a question and its DA mail or not, and then, we found that proper confirmation labels were given to 64 sets in them. The result was shown in Table 3.","We discuss some example sets of significant sentences in detail. Question (Q3) in Figure 1 has two answers, (DA3–1) and (DA3–2).

Then, the questioner of (Q4) confirmed whether the given information was helpful or not, and then, posted (QR4– 1–1) in order to point out and correct the wrong information in (DA4–1). In this experiment, we found 16 cases where the questioners posted reply mails in order to correct the wrong information, and the system found 10 cases in them and gave negative labels to the sets of the question and its DA mail."]},{"title":"3 QA system using mails posted to a mailing list 3.1 Outline of the QA system","paragraphs":["Figure 2 shows the overview of our system.

Next, the weight of a common modifier-head relation in user’s question Q and significant sentence Si in question mail Mi is: wLINK (l; Mi) = wW ORD(modf ier(l); Mi) +wW ORD(head(l); Mi) where modif ier(l) and head(l) denote a modifier and a head of modifier-head relation l, respectively.","Therefore, the similarity score between user’s question Q and significant sentence Si of question mail Mi, SCORE(Q; Mi), is set to the total weight of common content words and modifier-head relations which occur user’s question Q and significant sentence Si of question mail Mi, that is, SCORE(Q; Mi) = SCOREW ORD(Q; Mi) +SCORELINK (Q; Mi) where the elements of set Ti and set Li are common content words and modifier-head relations in user’s question Q and significant sentence Si in question mail Mi, respectively.","When the number of common content words which occur in user’s question Q and significant sentence Si in question mail Mi is more than one, the similarity calculator calculates the similarity score and sends it to the user interface.
