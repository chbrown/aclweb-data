The second sub-model is used to find the coreference relation between the mentions. In addition, a feedback technique is proposed to further improve the performance of the system.

The goal is to detect all entities in a given text and track all mentions that refer to the same entity. The task is a fundamental to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as informa-tion retrieval and extraction, text classification, summarization, question answering, and machine translation.","EDT is an extension of the task of coreference resolution in that in EDT we not only resolve the coreference between mentions but also detect the entities. Each of those entities may have one or more mentions. In the ACE project, there are five types of entities defined in EDT: person (PER), geography political Entity (GPE), organization (ORG), location (LOC), and facility (FAC). Many traditional coreference techniques can be extended to EDT for entity tracking.","Early work on pronoun anaphora resolution usually uses rule-based methods (e.g. Hobbs 1976; Ge et al., 1998; Mitkov, 1998), which try to mine the cues of the relation between the pronouns and its antecedents. Recent research (Soon et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycherah et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004) focuses on the use of statistical machine learning methods and tries to resolve references among all kinds of noun phases, including name, nominal and pronoun phrase. One common approach applied by them is to first train a binary statistical model to measure how likely a pair of"]},{"title":"232","paragraphs":["mentions corefer; and then followed by a greedy procedure to group the mentions into entities.","Mention detection is to find all the named entity, noun or noun phrase, pronoun or pronoun phrase. Therefore, it needs Named Entity Recognition, but not only. Though the detection of entity mentions is an essential problem for EDT/coreference, there has been relatively less previous research. Ng and Cardie (2002) shows that improving the recall of noun phrase identification can improve the performance of a coreference system. Florian et al. (2004) formulate the mention detection problem as a character-based classification problem. They assign for each character in the text a label, indicating whether it is the start of a specific mention, in-side a specific mention, or outside of any mention.","In this paper, we propose a unified EDT model based on the Transformation Based Learning (TBL, Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese. The model consists of two sub models: a mention detection model and a coreference model. The first sub-model is used to adapt existing Chinese word segmentation and Named Entity (NE) recognition system to a specific EDT standard. TBL is a widely used machine learning method, but it is the first time it is applied to coreference resolution. In addition, a feedback technique is proposed to further improve the performance of the system.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we propose the unified TBL Chinese EDT model framework. We describe the four key techniques of our Chinese EDT, the word segmentation adaptation model, the mention detection model, the coreference model and the feedback technique in section 3, 4, 5 and 6 accordingly. The experimental results on the ACE Chinese EDT corpus are shown in section 7."]},{"title":"2 The Unified System Framework","paragraphs":["Our Chinese EDT system consists of two components, mention detection module and coreference module besides a feedback technique between them as illustrated in Figure 1.","MSRSeg (Gao et al., 2003; Gao et al.), Microsoft Research Asia’s Chinese word segmentation system that is integrated with named entity recognition, is used to segment Chinese words. However MSRSeg can’t well match the standard of ACE EDT evaluation for either types or boundaries. The difference of the standard of named entity between MSRSeg and ACE cause more than half of the errors for NAME mention detection. In order to overcome these problems, we integrate a segmentation adapter to mention detection model.","The EDT system is a unified system that uses the TBL scheme. The idea of TBL is to learn a list of ordered rules while progressively improve upon the current state of the training set. An initial assignment is made based on simple statistics, and then rules are greedily learned to correct the mistakes, until no more improvement can be made. There are three main problems in the TBL framework: An initial state assignment, a set of allowable templates for rules, and an objective function for learning. Figure 1. Entity detection and tracking system flow."]},{"title":"3 Word Segmentation Adaptation","paragraphs":["The method of applying TBL to adapt the Chinese word segmentation standard has been described in Gao et al. (2004). Our approach is slightly different for not have a correctly segmented corpus according to ACE standard.","From the un-segmented ACE EDT corpus, we can only obtain mention boundary informa-tion. So the adapting objective is to detect the mention boundary instead of all words in text, correctly. In the corpus, very few mentions’ boundaries are crossing1",".","The initial state of the segmentation adaptation model is the output of MSRSeg.

The prefix or suffix of current word is used to define the boundary of inserting. Both inserting and removing action consider the combination of POS tag and word string of current, left and right words.","When inserting a boundary, the right part of the word keeps the old POS tag, and the left part introduces a special POS tag “new”. When removing a boundary, the new formed word introduces a special POS tag “new”. The following two examples illustrate the strategy. /nt/court of Russia ̆ /new/Russia /nt/court /nr/Bo /nr/Pu /̆new/Bopu "]},{"title":"4 Mention Detection","paragraphs":["Since the word segmentation adaptation model has corrected the boundaries of mentions, our mention detection model bases on word and only tagging the entity mention types. The model detects the mentions by tagging sixteen tags (including the combination of five entity types and three mention types and “OTHER” tag) for all the words outputted by segmentation adaptation model. The templates, as illustrated in table 1, only refer to local features, such as POS tag and word string of left, right, and current words; the suffix, and single character feature of current word.

And the objective function directs the learning process to insert or remove chains between mentions (Figure 2 b and c) to approach the goal state (Figure 2 f).","A list of rules is learned in greedy fashion, according to the objective function. When no rule that improves the current state of the training set beyond a pre-set threshold can be found, the training phrase ends. The objective function in our system is driven by the correctness of the binary classification for pair-wise mention pairs.","The TBL entity tracking model has more widely clustering/searching space as compare with previous strategies (Soon et al. 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004). For example, the state shown in Figure 2 (d) is not reachable for them. Because they assume one mention should refer to its most confidential mentions or entities that before it, while A and B are obviously not in same entity, as we can see in Figure 2 (d). Thus C can refer to either A or B, but not both. While in TBL model, this state is allowed.","In order to keep our system robust, the transformation templates refer to only six types of simple features, as described below.","All these features do not need any high level tools (i.e. syntactic parser) and little external knowledge base.

And the single mention features are suffixed with “L” or “R” to differentiate for left or right mentions (i.e. ETL represent the left mention’s entity type).","Based on the six kinds of basic features, four simple transformation templates are used in our system, as listed in table 3.

While in this section we will present an automatic method.","The feedback technique is employed by using entity features in mention detection model.
