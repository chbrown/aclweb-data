Each model exploits a distinct linguistic unit as a processing unit. The three models can compensate for each other’s weaknesses. Contrary to the previous systems that depend on manually constructed linguistic knowledge, the proposed system can fully automatically acquire the linguistic knowledge from annotated corpora (e.g. part-of-speech tagged corpora). Besides, without any modification of the system, it can be applied to other corpora having different tagsets and annotation guidelines. We describe the models and present evaluation results on three corpora with a wide range of conditions."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper discusses Korean morphological analysis. Morphological analysis is to break down an Eojeol1","into morphemes, which is the smallest meaningful unit. The jobs to do in morphological analysis are as follows:"," Separating an Eojeol into morphemes"," Assigning the morpho-syntactic category to each morpheme 1 Eojeol is the surface level form of Korean and is the","spacing unit delimited by a whitespace."," Restoring the morphological changes to the original form We have to consider some difficult points in Korean morphology: there are two kinds of ambiguities (segmentation ambiguity and part-of-speech ambiguity). Moreover, morphological changes to be restored are very frequent. In contrast to part-of-speech (POS) tagging, morphological analysis is characterized by producing all the (grammatically) regal interpretations. Table 1 gives examples of morphological analysis for Eojeols “na-neun” and “gam-gi-neun”.","Previous works on morphological analysis depends on manually constructed linguistic knowledge such as morpheme dictionary, morphosyn-tactic rules, and morphological rules. There are two major disadvantages in this approach:"," Construction of the knowledge base is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. In addition, storing every word in a lexicon is impossible so the previous approch suffers from the unknown word problem."," There is a lack of portability. Because the results produced by a morphological analyzer are limited to the given tagset and the annotation guidelines, it is very difficult to apply the system to other tagsets and guidelines.","The proposed morphological analyzer, ProKOMA, tries to overcome these limitations: Firstly, it uses only POS tagged corpora as an information source and can automatically acquire a knowledge base from these corpora. Hence, there is no necessity for the manual labor in constructing and maintaining such a knowledge base."]},{"title":"197","paragraphs":["Table 1: Examples of morphological analysis","na-neun gam-gi-neun na/np+neun/jx ‘I am’ gam-gi/pv+neun/etm ‘be wound’ na/pv+neun/etm ‘to sprout’ gam-gi/nc+neun/jx ‘a cold is’ nal/pv+neun/etm ‘to fly’ gam/pv+gi/etn+neun/jx ‘to wash is’ Although constructing such corpora also requires a lot of efforts, the amount of annotated corpora is increasing every year. Secondly, regardless of tagsets and annotation guidelines, it can be applied to any training data without modification. Finally, it can provide not only analyzed results but also their probabilities by the probabilistic models. In Korean, no attempt has been made at probabilistic approach to morphological analysis. Probabilities enable the system to rank the results and to provide the probabilities to the next module such as POS tagger."]},{"title":"2 Related works","paragraphs":["Over the past few decades, a considerable number of studies have been made on Korean morphological analysis. The early studies concentrated on the algorithmic research. The following approaches belong to this group: longest matching algorithm, tabular parsing method using CYK algorithm (Kim, 1986), dictionary based approach (Kwon, 1991), two-level morphology(Lee, 1992), and syllable-based approach (Kang and Kim, 1994).","Next, many studies have been made on improving the efficiency of the morphological an-alyzers. There have been studies to reduce the search space and implausible interpretations by using characteristics of Korean syllables (Kang, 1995; Lim et al., 1995).","There have been no standard tagset and annotation guideline, so researchers have developed methods with their own tagsets and guidelines. The Morphological Analysis and Tagger Evalua-tion Contest (MATEC) took place in 1999. This is the first trial about the objective and relative evaluation of morphological analysis. Among the participants, some newly implemented the systems and others converted the existing systems’ results through postprocessing steps. In both cases, they reported that they spent much effort and argued the necessity of tuning the linguistic knowledge.","All the systems described so far can be considered as the so called dictionary and rule based approach. In this approach, the quality of the dictionary and the rules govern the system’s performance.","The proposed approach is the first attempt to probabilistic morphological analysis. The aim of the paper is to show that this approach can achieve comparable performances with the previous approaches."]},{"title":"3 Probabilistic morphological analysis model","paragraphs":["Probabilistic morphological analysis generates all","the possible interpretations and their probabilities","for a given Eojeol",".

As mentioned be-fore, morphological analysis of Korean is very complex. The Eojeol-unit analysis can avoid such complex process so that it is very efficient and fast. Besides, it can reduce unnecessary results by only producing the interpretations that really appeared in the corpus. So, we also expect an improvement in accuracy.","Due to the high productivity of Korean Eojeol, the number of possible Eojeols is very large so storing all kinds of Eojeols is impossible. There-fore, using the Eojeol-unit analysis alone is undesirable, but a small number of Eojeols with high frequency can cover a significant portion of the entire ones, thus this model will be helpful. 3.2 Morpheme-unit model As discussed, not all Eojeols can be covered by the Eojeol-unit analysis. The ultimate goal of morphological analysis is to recognize every morpheme within an Eojeol. For these reasons, most previous systems have used morpheme as a processing unit for morphological analysis.","The morpheme-unit morphological analysis model is derived as follows by introducing lexical form",":","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","(2)","where should satisfy the following condition:","","","","","  ","","","","","","where"," is a set of lexical forms that can be de-","rived from the surface form",".

Otherwise, it means that a morphological change occurs. In this case, the pair of two substrings from the beginning to the end of the mismatch is extracted. The morphological information is also automatically extracted from training data.

In English, contextual information and suffix information is helpful to estimate the POS tag of an unknown word. In Korean, the syllable characteristics can be utilized. For instance, a syllable “eoss” can only be a pre-final ending.","The syllable-unit model is derived from Equation 4 as follows:","","","","","","","","","","  ","","","","","","","","","","(8)","where","","","","\\t is the syllable sequence of the","lexical form, and","","","","\\t","is its corresponding","syllable tag sequence.","In the above equation,","","","","","","is the same","as that of the morpheme-unit model (Equation 6),","we use the morpheme-unit model’s result as it is.","The right term   ","","is referred to as “the POS","assignment model”.","The POS assignment model is to assign the","syllables to the syllable tags:","","","","","","","   ","\\t","","","\\t","","(9)  \\t    ","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","   ","","","","","",""," ","","","","","","\\b",""," \\t ","","\\t","","\\t","","","\\t","","","","","","","\\b","","","\\t ","","\\b","","\\t","","","\\t","","(10)","In Equation 10, when","is less than or equal to","zero,","","s and","","s denote the pseudo syllables and","the pseudo tags, respectively.

The other is that the probability of the current syllable tag","","conditionally depends only on the previous syllable, the current syllable, and the previous two syllable tags. This model can consider broader context by introducing the less strict independent assumption than the HMM.","In order to convert the syllable sequence","and the syllable tag sequence","to the morpheme sequence","and the morpheme tag sequence",",we can use two additional symbols (“B” and “I”) to indicate the boundary of morphemes: a “B” denotes the first syllable of a morpheme and an “I” any non-initial syllable.

If a system outputs many results, it is likely to in-clude the correct answer in them, but this leads to an increase of the ambiguity, and vice versa. The higher AIR is, the better the system. The AIR can be an upper bound on the accuracy of POS taggers. On the contrary to AIR, the lower AA is, the better the system. A low AA can reduce the burden of the disambiguation process of the POS tagger. Although the 1A is not used as a common evaluation measure for morphological analysis because previous systems do not rank the results, ProKOMA can be evaluated by this measure because it provides the probabilities for the results. This measure can also be served as a base-line for POS tagging. 4.2 Experimental results To investigate the performance and the effectiveness of the three models, we conducted several tests according to the combinations of the models. For each test, we also performed the experiments on the three corpora. The results of the experiments are listed in Table 5. In the table, “E”, “M”, and “S” mean the Eojeol-unit analysis, the morpheme-unit analysis, and the syllable-unit analysis, respectively. The columns having more than one symbol mean that each model performs sequentially.","According to the results, when applying a single model, each model shows the significant differences, especially between “E” and “S”. Because of low coverage of the Eojeol-unit analysis, “E” shows the lowest AIR and the highest FR. However, it shows the lowest AA because it produces the small number of results. On the contrary, “S” shows the highest AA but the best performances on AIR and FR, which is caused by producing many results.","Most previous systems use morpheme as a processing unit for morphological analysis. We would like to examine the effectiveness of the proposed models based on Eojeol and syllable. First, compare the models that use the Eojeol-unit analysis with others (“M” vs. “EM”, “S” vs. “ES”, and “MS” vs. “EMS”). When applying the Eojeol-unit analysis, AA is decreased, and AIS and 1A are increased. Then, compare the models that use the syllable-unit analysis with others (“E” vs. “ES”, “M” vs. “MS”, and “EM” vs. “EMS”). When applying the syllable-unit analysis, AIR and 1A are increased, and FR is decreased. Therefore, both models are very useful when compared the morpheme-unit model only.","Compared with the performances of two systems that participated in MATEC 99, we listed the results in Table 6. In this evaluation, the ETRI corpus was used and the number of Eojeols included in the test data is 33,855. The evaluation data used in MATEC 99 and ours are not the same, but are close.
