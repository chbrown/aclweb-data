Recently, researchers have applied text- and web-mining algorithms to mine semantic resources. The result is often a noisy graph of relations between words. We propose a mathematically rigorous refinement framework, which uses path-based analysis, updating the likelihood of a relation between a pair of nodes using evidence provided by multiple indirect paths between the nodes. Evaluation on refining temporal verb relations in a semantic resource called VERBOCEAN showed a 16.1% error reduction after refinement."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Increasingly, researchers are creating broad-coverage semantic resources by mining text corpora [1][5] and the Web [2][6]. These resources typically consist of a noisy collection of relations between words. The data is typically extracted on a per link basis (i.e., the relation between two nodes is determined without regard to other nodes). Yet, little work has taken a global view of the graph of relations, which may provide additional information to refine local decisions by identifying inconsistencies, updating confidences in specific edges (relations), and suggesting relations between additional pairs of nodes.","For example, observing the temporal verb relations “discover happens-before refine” and “refine happens-before exploit” provides evidence for the relation “discover happens-before exploit,” because the happens-before relation is transitive.","We conceptualize a semantic resource encoding relations between words as a graph where words are nodes and binary relations between words are edges. In this paper, we investigate the refinement of such graphs by updating the confidence in edges using a global analysis relying on link semantics. Our approach is based on the observation that some paths (chains of relations) between a pair of nodes xi and xj imply the presence or absence of a particular direct relation between xi and xj. Despite each individual path being noisy, multiple indirect paths can provide sufficient evidence for adding, removing, or altering a relation between two nodes. As illustrated by the earlier example, inferring a relation based on the presence of an indirect path relies on the semantics of the links that make up the path, like transitivity or equivalence classes.","As an evaluation and a sample practical application, we apply our refinement framework to the task of refining the temporal precedence relations in VERBOCEAN, a broad-coverage noisy network of semantic relations between verbs extracted by mining the Web [2]. Examples of new edges discovered (added) by applying the Global Path-Based Refinement of Noisy Graphs Applied to Verb Semantics 793 framework include: “ascertain happens-before evaluate”, “approve happens-before back”, “coat happens-before bake”, “plan happens-before complete”, and “interrogate happens-before extradite”.","Examples of edges that are removed by applying our framework include: “induce happens-before treat”, “warm happens-before heat”, “halve happens-before slice”, and “fly happens-before operate”.","Experiments show that our framework is particularly good at filtering out the incorrect temporal relations in VERBOCEAN. Removing incorrect relations is particularly important for inference systems."]},{"title":"2 VerbOcean","paragraphs":["We apply our path-based refinement framework to VERBOCEAN [2], a web-extracted lexical semantics resource with potential applications to a variety of natural language tasks such as question answering, information retrieval, document summarization, and machine translation. VERBOCEAN is a graph of semantic relations between verbs, with 3,477 verbs (nodes) and 22,306 relations (edges). Although the framework applies whenever some paths through the graph imply presence or absence of a relation, for the evaluation we focus on the temporal precedence relation in VERBOCEAN, and, in an ancillary role, on the similarity relation. Senses are not discriminated and an edge indicates that the relation is believed to hold between some senses of the verbs in this relation.","The five semantic relations present in VERBOCEAN are presented in Table 1. Temporal precedence (happens-before) is a transitive asymmetric temporal relation between verbs. Similarity is a relation that suggests two nodes are likely to be in the same equivalence class, although polysemy makes it only weakly transitive. Table 1.

Larger, inconsistent loops are possible, however, as extraction is strictly local. Taking advantage of the global picture to refine the edges of the graph can improve quality of the resource, helping performance of any algorithms or applications that rely on the resource. 794 T. Chklovski and P. Pantel"]},{"title":"3 Global Refinement","paragraphs":["Our approach relies on a global view of the graph to refine a relation between a given pair of nodes xi and xj, based on multiple indirect paths between the two nodes. The analysis processes triples <xi, r, xj> for the relation r to output r, its opposite (which we will denote q), or neither. The opposite of happens-before is the same relation in the reverse direction (happens-after). The refinement is based on evidence provided by indirect paths, over a probabilistic representation of the graph.","Section 3.1 introduces the steps of the refinement, Section 3.2 details which paths are used as evidence, and Section 3.3 derives the statistical model used for combining evidence from multiple unreliable paths. 3.1 Overview of the Refinement Algorithm We first introduce some notation. Let Ri,j denote the event that the relation r is present between nodes xi and xj in the original graph – i.e., the graph indicates (perhaps spuriously) the presence of the relation r between xi and xj. Let ri,j denote the relation r actually holding between xi and xj. Let ψi,j denote an acyclic path from xi to xj of (possibly distinct) relations {Ri,i+1 .. Rj-1,j}. For example, the path “x1 similar x2 happens-before x3” can be denoted ψ1,3. If the edges of ψi,j indicate the relation r between the nodes xi and xj, we say that ψi,j indicates ri,j.","Given a triple <xi, r, xj>, we identify the set Ψr full","of all paths ψ","i,j such that ψi,j indicates ri,j and ψi,j’s sequence of relations {Ri,i+1 .. Rj-1,j} matches one of the allowed sequences. That is, we only consider certain path types. The restriction on types of paths considered is introduced because identifying and processing all possible paths indicating ri,j is too demanding computationally in a large non-sparse graph. The path types considered are detailed in Section 3.2. Note that the intermediate nodes of paths can range over the entire graph.","For each ψi,j in the above set Ψr full",", we compute the estimated probability that ri,j holds given the observation of (relations that make up) ψi,j. Each edge in the input graph is treated as a probabilistic one, with probabilities P(ri,j) and P(ri,j|Ri,j) estimated from human judgments on a representative sample. Generally, longer paths and paths made up of less reliable edges will have lower probabilities. Section 3.3 presents the full model for estimating these probabilities.","Next, we form the set Ψr by selecting from Ψr full","only the paths which have no common intermediate nodes. This is done greedily, processing all paths in Ψr full","in order of decreasing score, placing each in Ψr iff it does not share any intermediate nodes with any path already in Ψr. This is done to avoid double-counting the available evidence in our framework, which operates assuming conditional independence of paths.","Next, we compute P(ri,j | Ψr), the probability of ri,j given the evidence provided by the paths in Ψr. The model for computing this is described in Section 3.3. Similarly, Ψq and P(qi,j | Ψq) are computed for qi,j, the opposite of ri,j. Next, the evidence for r and q are reconciled by computing P(ri,j | Ψr, Ψq) and, similarly, P(qi,j | Ψr, Ψq).","Finally, the more probable of the two relations ri,j and qi,j is output if its probability exceeds a threshold value Pmin (i.e., ri,j is output if P(ri,j | Ψr, Ψq) > P(qi,j | Ψr, Ψq) and P(ri,j | Ψr, Ψq) > Pmin. In Section 4.2, we experiment with varying values of Pmin. Global Path-Based Refinement of Noisy Graphs Applied to Verb Semantics 795 3.2 Paths Considered The enabling observation behind our approach is that in a graph in which edges have certain properties such as transitivity, some paths Ψi,j indicate the presence of a relation between the first node xi and the last node xj. In the paths we consider, we rely on two kinds of inferences: transitivity and equivalence. Also, we do not consider very long paths, as they tend to become unreliable due to accumulation of chance of false detection of each edge and sense drift in each intermediate node. The set of paths to consider was not rigorously motivated. Rather, we aimed to cover some common cases. Refining the sets of paths is a possible fruitful direction for future work.","For the presence of happens-before, a transitive asymmetric relation, we considered all 11 path types of length 3 or less which imply happens-before between the end nodes based on transitivity and equivalence:"," “happens-before” “similar, similar, happens-before” “happens-before, similar” “happens-before, happens-before, similar” “similar, happens-before” “similar, happens-before, happens-before” “happens-before, happens-before” “happens-before, similar, happens-before” “happens-before, similar, similar” “happens-before, happens-before, happens-before” “similar, happens-before, similar” 3.3 Statistical Model for Combining Evidence This section presents a rigorous derivation of the probabilistic model for computing and combining probabilities with which indirect paths indicate a given edge. 3.3.1 Estimating from a Single Path We first derive probability of r1,n given single path ψ 1,n: "]},{"title":"( )","paragraphs":["nnrP ,1,1 |ψ"," If n is 2, i.e. ψ1,n has only one edge R1,2, we have simply the probability that the","edge actually holds given its presence in the graph: "]},{"title":"( ) ( )","paragraphs":["2,12,12,12,1 || RrPrP =ψ (1)","Otherwise, ψ1,n has intermediate nodes, in which case P(r1,n | ψ1,n) can be estimated as follows: "]},{"title":"( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ()()()()","paragraphs":["nnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnn RRrrPrrRRrP RRrrPrrRRrPRRrPrP ,12,1,12,1,12,1,12,1,1 ,12,1,12,1,12,1,12,1,1,12,1,1,1,1 ...,,|...,,...,,,...,,| ...,,|...,,...,,,...,,|...,,|| −−−− −−−−− ¬¬ +==ψ","Because r1,n is conditionally independent from Ri,i+1 given ri,i+1 or ¬ri,i+1, we can simplify: "]},{"title":"( ) ( ) ( ) ()()()()","paragraphs":["nnnnnnn nnnnnnnnn RRrrPrrrP RRrrPrrrPrP ,12,1,12,1,12,1,1 ,12,1,12,1,12,1,1,1,1 ...,,|...,,...,,| ...,,|...,,...,,|| −−− −−− ¬¬ +=ψ","Assuming independence of a given relation ri,i+1 from all edges in ψ1,n except for the edge Ri,i+1 yields: 796 T.

Each row represents a different refinement. The number in parentheses is Pmin, the threshold value for the strength of the relation from Section 3.1.

The extent of the evaluation was limited by availability of human judgments. We randomly sampled 100 pairs from DIRT and presented the classifications to three human judges for evaluation [2].","Of the 100 pairs, 66 were identified to have a relation. We applied our refinement algorithm to VERBOCEAN and inspected the output. On the 37 relations that VERBOCEAN got wrong, our system identified six of them. On the remaining 29 that VERBOCEAN got correct, only one was identified as incorrect (false positive). Hence, on the task of identifying incorrect relations in VERBOCEAN, our system has a precision of 85.7%, where precision is defined as the percentage of correctly identified erroneous relations. However, it only achieved a recall of 16.2%, where recall is the percentage of erroneous relations that our system identified. Table 4 presents the relations that were refined by our system. The first two columns show the verb pair while the next two columns show the original relation in VERBOCEAN. Table 4.

The additional information about confidence can benefit probabilistic inference approaches (e.g., [3]).","Possible extensions to the algorithm include a more elaborate inference from graph structure, for example treating the absence of certain paths as counter-evidence. Suppose that relations A happens-before B and A similar A' were detected, but the relation A' happens-before B was not. Then, the absence of a path Global Path-Based Refinement of Noisy Graphs Applied to Verb Semantics 803 A similar A' happens-before B suggests the absence of A happens-before B. Other important avenues of future work include applying our framework to other","relations (e.g., strength in VERBOCEAN) and to better characterize the refinement","thresholds."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We presented a method for refining edges in graphs by leveraging the semantics of multiple noisy paths. We re-estimated the presence of an edge between a pair of nodes from the evidence provided by multiple indirect paths between the nodes. Our approach applies to a variety of relation types: transitive symmetric, transitive asymmetric, and relations inducing equivalence classes. We applied our model to refining temporal verb relations in a semantic resource called VERBOCEAN. Experiments showed a 16.1% error reduction after refinement. On the 72% refinement decisions that it was most confident, the error reduction was 28.3%.","The usefulness of a semantic resource is highly dependent on its quality, which is often poor in automatically mined resources. With graph refinement frameworks such as the one presented here, many of these resources may be improved automatically."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1. Berland, M. and E. Charniak, 1999.
