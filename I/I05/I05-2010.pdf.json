The mix-WP identifier includes a specific word-pair (SWP) identifier and a common word-pair (CWP) identifier. It is designed as a supporting processing with Chinese input systems. Our experiments show that by applying the mix-WP identifier, together with the Microsoft input method editor 2003 (MSIME) and an optimized bigram model (BiGram), the tonal and toneless STW performance of the two input systems can be improved."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Currently, the most popular method for Chinese input is phonetic and pinyin based, because Chinese people are taught to write the corresponding phonetic and pinyin syllables of each Chinese character and word in primary school. In Chinese, each Chinese character corresponds to at least one syllable; and each Chinese word can be a mono-syllabic word, such as “ 鼠 (mouse)”, a bi-syllabic word, such as “ 袋鼠 (kangaroo)”, or a multi-syllabic word, such as “米老鼠(Mickey mouse).” Although there are more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of which 5,400 are commonly used), there are only about 1,300 distinct syllables. Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-to-character (STC) conversion, the most existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al. 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al. 2002, MSIME) are addressed on STW conversion.","Conventionally, there are two approaches for STW conversion: (1) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, semantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, Fu et al. 1996, Hsu et al. 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al. 1991, Fu et al. 1996, Ho et al. 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003). Although the linguistic approach requires considerable effort in designing effective syntax rules, semantic templates or contextual information, it is more user-friendly than the statistical approach on understanding why such a system makes a mistake (Hsu 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002). On the other hand, the statistical language model (SLM) used in the statistical approach requires less effort and has been widely adopted in commercial Chinese input systems (Gao et al. 2002, Lee 2003).","According to (Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002), homophone selection and syllable-word segmentation are two critical problems to the STW conversion in Chinese. Incorrect homophone selection and failed syllable-word segmentation will directly influence the STW conversion rate. The goal of this study is to illustrate the effectiveness of specific word-pairs and common word-pairs for resolving homonym/segmentation ambiguities to perform STW conversion in Chinese. In this paper, we use tonal to indicate the syllables with four tones, such as “ji4(技)shu4(術)” and toneless to indicate the syllables without four tones, such as “ji( 技 ) shu(術).”"]},{"title":"55","paragraphs":["The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we firstly propose the method for auto-generating the specific word-pairs and the common word-pairs from given Chinese sentences. Then, we develop a mix word-pair (mix-WP) identifier includes a specific word-pair identifier and a common word-pair identifier. The mix-WP identifier is based on pre-collected datasets of specific and common word-pairs. In Section 3, we present our STW experiment results. Finally, in Section 4, we give our conclusions and suggest some future research directions."]},{"title":"2 Development of Mix-WP Identifier","paragraphs":["In this study, a mix word-pair identifier includes a specific word-pair (SWP) identifier and a common word-pair (CWP) identifier. The system dictionary of the mix-WP identifier is comprised of the CKIP lexicon (CKIP, 1995) and those unknown words found automatically from the UDN 2001 corpus by a Chinese word autoconfirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al. 2003). The pinyin syllable-words were translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as “ ㄐㄧ ”̀-to-“ji4.”"]},{"title":"2.1 Development of SWP Identifier 2.1.1 Auto-Generate SWP Data","paragraphs":[". The steps of auto-generating specific word-pair (AUTO-SWP) for a given Chinese sentence: Step 1. Generate the segmentation for the given Chinese sentence with a backward maximum matching (BMM) technique. As pre (Tsai et al. 2004), the performance of BMM is better than that of forward maximum matching. Step 2. Extract the BEGIN, END and BOUND word-pairs from the BMM segmentation of Step 1 by following processes, respectively: (1) BEGIN word-pair. When the word number of segmentation is greater than 1, the first two words will be comprised as a BEGIN word-pair. For the segmentation “音樂會(concert)現 場 (locale) 湧入(enter) 許多(many) 觀眾 (audience members),” the “音樂會-現場” will be generated as a BEGIN word-pair. (2) END word-pair. When the word number of segmentation is greater than 2, the last two words will be comprised as an END word-pair. For the segmentation “ 全部(whole) 工程 (construction) 預定(prearrange) 年底(end of year)完成(complete),” the “ 年底-完成” will be generated as an END word-pair. (3) BOUND word-pair. When the word number of segmentation is greater than 2, the first word and the last word will be comprised as a BOUND word-pair. For the segmentation “物 價(price)大抵(ordinarily)維持(maintain)平穩 (stable),” the “物價-平穩” will be generated as a BOUND word-pair. Step 3. If the generated SWP was not found in its corresponding datasets, insert the generated SWP into the BEGIN, END and BOUND word-pair datasets, respectively. 2.1.2 SWP Identifier. In Figure 1, the SWP data is a collection of auto-generated BEGIN, END and BOUND SWP datasets. If a SWP identifier only uses one of the BEGIN, END or BOUND SWP dataset, it will naturally become a BEGIN(BN), END(ED) or BOUND(BD) SWP identifier. The algorithm of our SWP identifier is as follows: Specific word-pair (SWP) identifier SWP data SWP-sentenceinput syllables System dic  Fig. 1. A system overview of the SWP identifier Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables. Step 2. Generate all found BN, ED and BD SWP in the input syllables to be the initial SWP set. if the initial SWP set, if the found SWP number of the word-syllable pair of a BN, ED or BD SWP is greater than one in the BN, ED or BD datasets, respectively, the SWP will be dropped from the initial SWP set. Step 3. Use the longest syllabic word-pair first (LS-WPF) strategy (Tsai and Hsu. 2002) to select the BN, ED and BD word-pair from the initial SWP set into the final SWP set. Step 4. Replace corresponding syllable-word pair of the input syllables with the word-pairs of the final SWP set to be a SWP-sentence. As per our experiment, the performance of the three SWP identifiers is BD < BN < ED. Thus, the identifying sequence of our SWP identifier is from BD, BN to ED.

Generate the word segmentation for the given Chinese sentence by BMM technique. Step 2. Extract all the combinations of word-pairs from the BMM segmentation of Step 1 to be the initial CWP set. For the segmentation “我/不會/開車,” three CWP will be extracted, i.e. “我-不會”, “我-開車” and “不會-開車.” Step 3. Select the word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words (such as “不會 (can not)”) to be the finial CWP set. For the final CWP set, if the word-pair is not found in the CWP database, insert it into the CWP database and set its frequency to 1; otherwise, increase its frequency by 1. In the above case, the final CWP set includes one word-pair, i.e. “不會-開車.” 2.2.2 CWP Identifier The system overview of the CWP identifier is same with that of the SWP identifier as shown in Fig. 1. The algorithm of our CWP identifier is as follows: Step 1. Input tonal or toneless syllables. Step 2. Generate all possible word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words for the input syllables to be the input of Step 3. Step 3. Select out the word-pairs that match a word-pair in the CWP database to be the initial CWP set, firstly. Then, from the initial CWP set, select the word-pair with maximum frequency as the key word-pair. Finally, find the co-occurrence word-pairs with the key word-pair in the training corpus to be the final CWP set. If there are two or more word-pairs with the same maximum frequency, one of them is randomly selected as the key word-pair. Step 4. Arrange all word-pairs of the final CWP set into a CWP-sentence. If no word-pairs can be identified in the input syllables, a NULL CWP-sentence is produced. If applying the CWP identifier on the syllables “yi1 ge5 wen2 ming2 de5 shuai1 wei2 guo4 cheng2( 一個[a] 文明[civilization] 的 [of] 衰微 [decay] 過程[process]),” the generated WP-sentence will be “一個文明 de5shuai1wei2 過 程.” For the same syllables, the MSIME will convert them into “一個[a]聞名[famous]的[of] 衰微[decay]過程[process].” The detailed analysis and demonstration of our CWP identifier can be found in (Tsai 2005).

All of the testing mix-WP data was auto-generated by using the AUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP on the training corpus. We are encouraged by the fact that mix-WP knowledge can achieve tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 98.8% and 93.5%, respectively, for the mix-WP-related portion of the testing syllables. The mix-WP identifier can be easily integrated into existing Chinese input systems or Chinese language processing of typical speech recognition systems by identifying word-pairs in a post-processing step. Our experimental results show that, by applying the mix-WP identifier together with the MSIME and the BiGram input systems, the tonal and toneless STW improvements are 29%/23% and 13%/20%, respectively. To the adaptive approach, we also tried to use the AUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP to autoextract new SWP and CWP from the open test sentences into the mix-WP data, firstly. Then, we found the overall tonal and toneless STW accuracies of the MSIME and the BiGram for closed/open syllables become 96.5%/90% and 97.1%/89%, respectively.","Currently, our approach is quite basic when more than one SWP or CWP occurs in the same sentence. Although there is room for improvement, we believe it would not produce a noticeable effect as far as the STW accuracy is concerned. However, this issue will become important as we apply the mix-WP knowledge to speech recognition. According to our computations, the collection of our mix-WP knowledge can cover approximately 70% and 60% of the characters in the UDN 2001 and 2002 corpus, respectively.","We will continue to expand our collection of mix-WP knowledge with Web corpus. In other directions, we will try to improve our WP-based STW conversion with other types of WP data, such as NEVF and MWP (Tsai et al. 2002 and 2004), and statistical language models, such as HMM, and extend it to other areas of NLP, especially word segmentation and the mix-WP identifier from the word lattice of Chinese speech recognition systems."]},{"title":"59 References","paragraphs":["Chung, K.H. 1993.
