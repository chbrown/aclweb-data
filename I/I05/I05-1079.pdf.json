Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) represents verbs as semantic structures with a limited number of semantic predicates. This paper attempts to exploit how LCS can be used to explain the regularities underlying lexical and syntactic paraphrases, such as verb alternation, compound word decomposition, and lexical derivation. We propose a paraphrase generation model which transforms LCSs of verbs, and then conduct an empirical experiment taking the paraphrasing of Japanese light-verb constructions as an example. Experimental results justify that syntactic and semantic properties of verbs encoded in LCS are useful to semantically constrain the syntactic transformation in paraphrase generation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Automatic paraphrasing has recently been attracting increasing attention due to its potential in a broad range of natural language processing tasks. For example, a system that is capable of simplifying a given text, or showing the user several alternative expressions conveying the same content, would be useful for assisting a reader.","There are several classes of paraphrase that exhibit a degree of regularity. For example, paraphrasing associated with verb alternation, lexical derivation, compound word decomposition, and paraphrasing of light-verb constructions (LVC(s)) all fall into such classes. Examples1","(1) and (2) appear to exhibit the same transformation pattern, in which a compound noun is transformed into a verb phrase.

For example, the transformation pattern as in (1) and (2) does not apply to another compound noun “machine translation.” We can also find a range of varieties in paraphrasing of LVCs as we describe in Section 3.","In spite of this complexity, the regularity each paraphrase class exhibits were explained by recent advances in lexical semantics, such as the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) [8] and the Generative Lexicon [17]. According to the LCS, for instance, a wide variety of paraphrases including word association within compounds, transitivity alternation, and lexical derivation, were explained by means of the syntactic and semantic properties of the verb involved. The systematicity underlying such linguistic accounts is intriguing also from the engineering viewpoint as it could enable us to take a more theoretically motivated but still practical approach to paraphrase generation.","The issue we address in this paper is to empirically clarify (i) what types of regularities underlying paraphrases can be explained by means of lexical semantics and how, and (ii) how lexical semantics theories can be enhanced with feedback from practical use, namely, paraphrase generation. We make an attempt to exploit the LCS among several lexical semantics frameworks, and propose a paraphrase generation model which utilizes LCS combining with syntactic transformation."]},{"title":"2 Lexical Conceptual Structure 2.1 Basic Framework","paragraphs":["Among several frameworks of lexical semantics, we focus on the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) [8] due to the following reasons. First, several studies [9,3,19] have shown that the theory of the LCS provides a systematic explanation of semantic decomposition as well as syntax determines. In particular, Kageyama [9] has shown that even a simple typology of LCS can explain a wide variety of linguistic phenomena including word association within compounds, transitivity alternation, and lexical derivation. Second, large-scale LCS dictionaries have been developed through practical use on machine translation and compound noun analysis [3,19]. The LCS dictionary for English [3] (4,163-verbs with 468 LCS types) was tailored based on a verb classifica-tion [12] with an expansion for the semantic role delivered to arguments. For Japanese, Takeuchi et al. [19] developed a 1,210-verbs LCS dictionary (with 12 LCS types) called the T-LCS dictionary, following Kageyama’s analysis [9]. In this paper, we make use of the current version of the T-LCS dictionary, because it provides a set of concrete rules for LCS assignment, which ensures the reliability of the dictionary.","Examples of LCS in the T-LCS dictionary are shown in Table 1. An LCS consists of a combination of semantic predicates (“CONTROL,” “BE AT,” etc.) and their argument slots (x, y,andz). Each argument slot corresponds to a semantic role, such as “Agent,” “Theme,” and “Goal,” depending on its surrounding semantic predicates. Let us take “yakusu (to translate)” as an example. The inner structure “[y BE AT z]”denotes the state of affairs where z (“Goal”) indicates the state or physical location of y (“Theme”). The predicate “BECOME” expresses a change of y. In the case of example phrase in Table 1, the change of the language of the book is represented. The leftmost 910 A. Fujita, K. Inui, and Y. Matsumoto Table 1.

The difference between “BECOME BE AT”and“MOVE TO” is underlying their telicity: the for-mer indicates telic, and thus the verb can be perfective, while the latter atelic. Likewise, “CONTROL” implicates a state change, while “ACT ON” merely denotes an action. The following are examples of syntactic and semantic properties represented in LCS:","– Semantic role of argument (e.g. “[x CONTROL ...]” indicates x=“Agent”)","– Syntactic case particle pattern (e.g. “[y MOVE TO z]” indicates y=NOM, z=DAT)","– Aspectual property (e.g. “MOVE TO” is atelic (“∗","ket-tearu (to kick-PERF)”), while “BECOME BE AT” is telic (“oi-tearu (to place-PERF).”))","– Focus of statement (e.g. x is focused in “[x CONTROL ...]”, while z in “[z BE WITH ...]”)","– Semantic relations in lexical derivation • transitivity alternation (“kowasu (to break (vt))” ⇔ “kowareru (to break (vi))”) • lexical active-passive alternation (“oshieru (to teach)” ⇔ “osowaru (to be","taught)”) 2.2 Disambiguation in LCS Analysis In principle, a verb is associated with more than one LCS if it has multiple senses. The mapping from syntactic case assignments to argument slots in LCS is also many-Exploiting Lexical Conceptual Structure for Paraphrase Generation 911 to-many in general.

Sentence (6s) shows an example of an LVC. An LVC is a verb phrase (“kandou-o atae-ta (made an impression),” c.f., Figure 1) that consists of a light-verb (“atae-ta (to give-PAST)”) that syntactically governs a deverbal noun (“kandou (an impression)”). A paraphrase of (6s) is shown in sentence (6t), where the deverbal noun functions as the main verb with its verbalized form (“kandou-s-ase-ta (to be impressed-CAUSATIVE-PAST)”).","(6) s. eiga-ga kare-ni saikou-no kandou-o atae-ta. film-NOM him-DAT supreme-GEN impression-ACC to give-PAST The film made an supreme impression on him.","t. eiga-ga kare-o saikou-ni kandou-s-ase-ta. film-NOM him-ACC supreme-DAT to be impressed-CAUSATIVE-PAST The film supremely impressed him.

These decisions depend not only on the syntactic and semantic attributes of the light-verb, but also on those of the deverbal noun [14]. LVC paraphrasing is thus a novel challenging material for exploiting LCS.","Figure 1 demonstrates tree representations of source and target expressions involved in LVC paraphrasing, taking (6) as an example. To generate this type of paraphrase, we need a computational model that is capable of the following operations:","Change of the dependence: Change the dependences of the elements (a) and (b) due to the elimination of the original modifiee, the light-verb.

Semantic transformation (LCS transformation): The model then transfers the obtained semantic structure to another semantic structure so that the target structure consists of the LCS of the verbalized form of the deverbal noun. In our example, this step generates LCSN1 together with the supplement “[BECOME [...]]”. We refer to such a supplement as LCSS.","Step 3. Surface generation: Having obtained the target LCS representation, the model finally generates the output sentence from it. LCSS triggers another syntactic alternation such as passivization and causativization.","The idea is to use the LCS representation as a semantic representation and to retrieve semantic constraints to relieve the syntactic underspecificity underlying the LVC paraphrasing.

Figure 3 shows a more detailed view of this process for the example shown in Figure 2.","Muraki [14] described that the direction of action and the focus of statement are important clues to determine the voice in LVC paraphrasing. We therefore incorporate the below assumptions into matching process. The model first matches predicates in LCSV 1 and LCSN0, assuming that the agentive argument x is relevant to the direction of action. We classify the semantic predicates into the following three groups: (i) agentive predicates (involve argument x): “CONTROL,” “ACT ON,” “ACT TO,” “ACT,” and “MOVE FROM TO,” (ii) state of affair predicates (involve only argument y or z): “MOVE TO,” “BE AT,” and “BE WITH,” and (iii) aspectual predicates (with no argument): “BECOME,” and allowed any pair of predicates in the same group to match. In our example, “MOVE FROM TO” matches “ACT ON” as shown in Figure 3.","Having matched the predicates, the model then fills each argument slot in LCSN0 with its corresponding argument in LCSV 1. In Figure 3, argument z is matched with y′",",andx with x′",". As a result, “Ken”and“eiga”cometoy′","and x′","slots, respectively. When an argument is filled with another LCS, arguments within the inner LCS are also taken into account. Likewise, we introduced some exceptional rules assuming that the input sentences are periphrastic. For instance, arguments filled with the implicit filler (e.g. “name” for “to sign” is usually not expressed in Japanese) and the deverbal noun, which is already represented by LCSN0 are never matched. Argument z in LCSV 1 is allowed to match with y′","in LCSN0.","LCS representations have right-embedding structures, and inner-embedded predicates denote the state of affairs. We thus prioritize the rightmost predicates in this matching process. In other words, the proceeds from the rightmost inner predicates to the outer ones, and the matching process is repeated until the leftmost predicate in LCSN0 or that in LCSV 1 matched.","If LCSV 1 has any non-transferred part LCSS when the predicate and argument matching has been completed, it represents the semantic content that is not expressed by LCSN1 and needs to be expressed by auxiliary linguistic devices such as voice auxiliaries. As described in Section 2.1, the leftmost part specifies the focus of state-Exploiting Lexical Conceptual Structure for Paraphrase Generation 915 ment. The model thus attaches LCSS to LCSN0 as a supplement, and then use it to determine auxiliaries in the next step, the surface generation.

As we described above, the attached structure LCSS is a clue to determine what the focus is. We therefore use the following decision list:","1. If the leftmost argument of LCSS has the same value as the leftmost argument in LCSN1, the viewpoints of LCSS and LCSN1 are same. Thus, the active voice is selected and the case structure is left as is.","2. If the leftmost argument of LCSS has the same value as either z′","or y′","in LCSN1, the model makes the argument a subject (nominative). That is, the passive voice is selected and case alternation (passivization) is applied.","3. If LCSS has “BE WITH” and its argument has the same value as x′","in LCSN1,the causative voice is selected and case alternation (causativization) is applied.","4. If LCSS has an agentive predicate, and its argument is filled with a value different from those of the other arguments, then the causative voice is selected and case alternation (causativization) is applied.","5. Otherwise, active voice is selected and thus no modification is applied.","The example in Figure 2 satisfies the second condition, thus the model chooses “s-are-ru (PASSIVE)” and passivizes the sentence (8).

Note that more than one LCS was assigned to a verb if it was polysemous. Deverbal nouns: We regard “sahen-nouns” and adverbial forms of verbs as deverbal nouns. We retrieved 1,210 deverbal nouns from the T-LCS dictionary. The set consists of (i) activity nouns (e.g., “sasoi (invitation)” and “odoroki (surprise)”), (ii) Sino-Japanese verbal nouns (e.g., “kandou (impression)” and “shigeki (inspiration)”), and (iii) English borrowings (e.g., “drive” and “support”). Tuples of light-verb and case particle: A verb takes different meanings when it constitutes LVCs with different case particles, and not every tuple of a light-verb v and a 916 A. Fujita, K. Inui, and Y. Matsumoto case particle c functions as an LVC. We therefore tailored an objective collection of tuples ⟨v, c⟩ from corpus in the following manner:","Step 1. From a corpus consisting of 25 million parsed sentences of newspaper articles, we collected 876,101 types of triplet ⟨v, c, n⟩,wherev, c,andn denote a base form of verb, a case particle, and an deverbal noun.","Step 2. For each of the 50 most frequent ⟨v, c⟩ tuples, we extracted the 10 most frequent triplets ⟨v, c, n⟩.","Step 3. Each ⟨v, c, n⟩ was manually evaluated to determine whether it functioned as an LVC. If any of 10 triplets functioned as an LVC, the tuple ⟨v, c⟩ was merged into the list of light-verbs, assigning an LCS according to the linguistic tests examined in [19]. As a result, we collected 40 types of ⟨v, c⟩ for light-verbs. Paraphrase examples: A collection of paraphrase examples, pairs of an LVC and its correct paraphrase, were constructed in the following way:","Step 1. From the 876,101 types of triplet ⟨v, c, n⟩ collected above, 23,608 types of ⟨v, c, n⟩ were extracted, whose components, n and ⟨v, c⟩, were in the dictionaries.","Step 2. For each of the 245 most frequent ⟨v, c, n⟩, the 3 most frequent simple clauses including the ⟨v, c, n⟩ were extracted from the same corpus.","Step 3. Two native speakers of Japanese, adults graduated from university, were employed to build a gold-standard collection. 711 out of 735 sentences were manually paraphrased in the manner of LVC, while the remaining 24 sentences were not because ⟨v, c, n⟩ within them did not function as LVCs. The real coverage of these 245 ⟨v, c, n⟩ with regard to all LVCs among the corpus falls in the range between the below two:","Lower bound: If every ⟨v, c, n⟩ is an LVC, the coverage of the collection is estimated","at 6.47% (492,737 / 7,621,089) of tokens.","Upper bound: If the dictionaries cover all light-verbs and deverbal nouns, the collec-","tion covers 24.1% (492,737 / 2,044,387) of tokens.","In the experiment, our model generated all the possible paraphrases when a given verb was polysemous with multiple entries in the T-LCS dictionary. As a result, the model generated 822 paraphrases from the 735 input sentences, at least one for each input. We then classified the resultant paraphrases as correct and incorrect by comparing them with the gold-standard, where we ignored ordering of syntactic cases, and obtained 624 correct and 198 incorrect paraphrases Recall, precision, and F-measure (α =0.5) were 0.878 (624 / 711), 0.759 (624 / 822), and 0.814, respectively.","As the baseline, we employed a statistical language model developed in [5]. Among all the combinations of the voice and syntactic cases, the baseline model selects the one that has the highest probability. Although the model is trained on a large amount of data, the generated expression often falls out of the vocabulary. In such a case, the probability cannot be calculated, and the model outputs nothing for the given sentence. As a result of an application of this baseline model to the same set of input sentences, we obtained 320 correct and 215 incorrect paraphrases (Recall: 0.450 (320 / 711), Precision: 0.598 (320 / 535), and F-measure: 0.514). The significant improvement indicates that our lexical-semantics-based account benefited on the decisions we considered. Exploiting Lexical Conceptual Structure for Paraphrase Generation 917","The language model can also be complementary used to our LCS-based paraphrase generation. By filtering implausible paraphrases out, 66 incorrect and 15 correct paraphrases were filtered, and the performance was further improved (Recall: 0.857, Precision: 0.822, and F-measure: 0.839). 5.2 Discussion Although the performance has room for further improvement, we think the performance is reasonably high under the current stage of the T-LCS dictionary. In other words, the tendency of errors does not so differ from our expectation. As we expected in Section 2.2, the ambiguity of dative case “ni” (c.f. (5)) occupied the largest portion of errors (78 / 198). This was because the case assignment was performed by a rule instead of semantic parsing. Each rule in our model has been created relying on a set of linguistic tests used in the theory of LCS and our linguistic intuition on handling LCS. However, the rule set was not sufficiently sophisticated, so that led to 59 errors. Equally, 30 errors occurred due to the immature typology of the T-LCS dictionary.","We consider the improvement of the LCS typology as the primal issue, because our transformation rules depend on it. For the moment, we have the following two suggestions. First, more variety of semantic roles should be handled step by step. For example, we need to handle the object of “eikyou-suru (to affect),” which is marked by not accusative but dative. Second, the necessity of “Source” is inconsistent. Verbs such as “hairu (to enter)” do not require this argument (“BECOMEBEAT”) , while some other verbs, such as “ukeru (to receive),” explicitly require it (“MOVE FROM TO”). The telicity of “MOVE FROM TO” should also be discussed. With such a feedback from the application and an extensive investigation into lexicology, we have to enhance the typology, and enlarge the dictionary preserving its consistency."]},{"title":"6 Related Work","paragraphs":["The paraphrases associated with LVCs are not idiosyncratic to Japanese but also appear commonly in other languages such as English, French, and Spanish [13,7,4] as shown in (3) and (4). Our approach raises an interesting issue of whether the paraphrasing of LVCs can be modeled in an analogous way across languages.","Iordanskaja et al. [7] proposed a set of paraphrasing rules including one for LVC paraphrasing based on the Meaning-Text Theory introduced by [13]. The model seemed to properly handle LVC paraphrasing, because their rules were described according to the deep semantic analysis and heavily relied on what were called lexical functions, such as lexical derivation (e.g., S0(affect )=effect ) and light-verb generation (e.g., Oper 1(attempt)=make). To take this approach, however, a vast amount of lexical knowledge to form each lexical function is required, because they only virtually specify all the choices relevant to LVC paraphrasing for every combination of deverbal noun and light-verb individually. In contrast, our approach is to employ lexical semantics to provide a general account of those classes of choices, and thus contributes to the knowledge development in terms of reducing human-labor and preserving consistency.","Kaji et al. [10] proposed a paraphrase generation model which utilized an monolingual dictionary for human. Given an input LVC, their model paraphrases it referring to 918 A. Fujita, K. Inui, and Y. Matsumoto the glosses of both the deverbal noun and light-verb, and a manually assigned semantic feature of the light-verb. Their model looks robust due to the availability of resource. However, their model fails to explain the difference between examples (7) and (9) in the voice selection, because it selects the voice based only on the light-verb irrespective of the deverbal noun: the light-verb “ukeru (to receive)” is always mapped to the passive voice.","(9) s. musuko-ga kare-no hanashi-ni kandou-o uke-ta. son-NOM his-GEN talk-DAT impression-ACC to receive-PAST My son was given a good impression by his talk.","t. musuko-ga kare-no hanashi-ni kandou-shi-ta. son-NOM his-GEN talk-DAT to be impressed-PAST My son was impressed by his talk. In their model, the target expression is restricted only to the LVC itself (c.f., Figure 1). Hence, their model is unable to reassign the case particles as we saw in example (6).","There is another trend in the research of paraphrase generation: i.e., the automatic paraphrase acquisition from existing lexical resources such as ordinary dictionaries, parallel/comparable corpora, and non-parallel corpora. This type of approach may be able to reduce the cost of resource development. However, there are drawbacks that must be overcome before they can work practically. First, automatic methods require large amounts of training data. The issue is how to collect enough large size of data at low cost. Second, automatically extracted knowledge tends to be rather noisy, requiring manual correction and maintenance. In contrast, our approach, which focuses on the regularity underlying paraphrases, is a complementary avenue to develop and maintain knowledge resources that cover a sufficiently wide range of paraphrases.","Previous case studies [14,18,11] have employed some syntactic properties of verbs to constrain syntactic transformations in paraphrase generation: e.g. subject agentivity, aspectual property, passivizability, and causativizability. Several classifications of verbs have also been proposed [12,15] based on various types of verb alternation and syntactic case patterns. In contrast, the theory of lexical semantics integrates syntactic and semantic properties including those above, and gives a perspective to formalize and maintain the syntactic and semantic properties of words."]},{"title":"7Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we explored what sorts of lexical properties encoded in LCS can explain the regularity underlying paraphrases. Based on an existing LCS dictionary, we built an LCS-based paraphrase generation model, and conducted an empirical experiment on paraphrasing of LVC.

To make our model more accurate, we need further discussion on (i) the enhancement of the T-LCS dictionary with feedback from experiments, (ii) the LCS transformation algorithm, and (iii) the semantic parsing. Another goal is to practically clarify what extent can be done by LCS for other classes of paraphrase, such as those exemplified in Section 1.
