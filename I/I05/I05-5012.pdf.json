Often the summary sentence is a paraphrase of a sentence in the source text, or else a combination of phrases and words from important sentences that have been pieced together to form a new sentence. These sentences, referred to as Non-Verbatim Sentences, can replace extracted text to improve readability and coherence in the summary.","Consider the example in Figure 1 which presents an alignment between a human authored summary sentence and a source sentence. The Summary Sentence: Every province in the country, except one, endured sporadic fighting, looting or armed banditry in 2003. Source Sentence: However, as the year unfolded, every province has been subjected to fighting, looting or armed banditry, with the exception of just one province (Kirundo, in northern Burundi). Figure 1: An aligned summary and source sentence. text is taken from a corpus of Humanitarian Aid Proposals1","produced by the United Nations for the purpose of convincing donors to support a relief effort.","The example illustrates that sentence extraction alone cannot account for the breadth of human authored summary sentences. This is supported by evidence presented in (Jing and McKeown, 1999) and (Daumé III and Marcu, 2004).","Moving towards the goal of abstract-like automatic summary generation challenges us to consider mechanisms for generating non-verbatim sentences. Such a mechanism can usefully be considered as automatically generating a paraphrase.2","We treat the problem as one in which a new and previously unseen summary sentence is to be automatically produced given some closely related sentences extracted from a source text.","Following on from (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), we use and extend the Viterbi algorithm (Forney, 1973) for the purposes of generating non-verbatim sentences.

Given a set of words (taken from some set of sentences to paraphrase), we search for the most likely sequence given some language model. Intuitively, we want the generated string to be grammatical and to accurately reflect the content of the source text.","Within the Viterbi search process, each time we append a word to the partially generated sentence, we consider how well it attaches to a dependency structure. The focus of this paper is to evaluate whether or not a series of iterative considerations of dependency structure results in a grammatical generated sentence. Previous preliminary evaluations (Wan et al., 2005) indicate that the generated sequences contain less fragmented text as measured by an off-the-shelf dependency parser; more fragments would indicate a grammatically problematic sentence.","However, while encouraging, such an evaluation says little about what the actual sentence looks like. For example, such generated text might only be useful if it contains complete clauses. Thus, in this paper, we use the precision and recall metric to measure how many generated verb arguments, as extracted from dependency relations, are correct.","The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview introducing our approach. In Section 3, we briefly illustrate our algorithm with examples. A brief survey of related work is presented in Section 4. We present our grammaticality experiments in Section 5. We conclude with further work in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 An Overview of our Approach to Statistical Sentence Generation","paragraphs":["One could characterise the search space as being a series of nested sets. The outer most set would contain all possible word sequences. Within this, a smaller set of strings exhibiting some semblance of grammaticality might be found, though many of these might be gibberish. Further nested sets are those that are grammatical, and within those, the set of paraphrases that are entailed by the input text.","However, given that we limit ourselves to statistical techniques and avoid symbolic logic, we cannot make any claim of strict entailment.

Sentences are prefixed by their length. thus propose an intermediate set of sentences which conserve the content of the source text without necessarily being entailed. These are referred to as the set of verisimilitudes, of which properly entailed sentences are a subset. The aim of our choice of features and our algorithm extension is to reduce the search space from gibberish strings to that of verisimilitudes. While generating verisimilitudes is our end goal, in this paper, we are concerned principally with the generating of grammatical sentences.","To do so, the extension adds an extra feature propagation mechanism to the Viterbi algorithm such that features are passed along a word sequence path in the search space whenever a new word is appended to it. Propagated features are used to influence the choice of subsequent words suitable for appending to a partially generated sentence. In our case, our feature is a dependency structure of the word sequence corresponding to the search path. Our present dependency representation is based on that of (Kittredge and"]},{"title":"89","paragraphs":["Mel’cuk, 1983). However, it contains only the head and modifier of a relation, ignoring relation-ship labels for the present.","Algorithmically, after appending a word to a path, a dependency structure of the partially generated string is obtained probabilistically. Along with bigram information, the long-distance context of dependency head information of the preceding word sequence will be useful in generating better sentences by filtering out all words that might, at a particular position in the string, lead to a spurious dependency relation in the final sentence. Example output is presented in Figure 2.","As the dependency “parsing” mechanism is linear3","and is embedded within the Viterbi algorithm, the result is an O( ",") algorithm.","By examining surface-syntactic dependency structure at each step in the search, resulting sentences are likely to be more grammatical. This marraige of models has been tested in other fields such as speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) with success. Although it is an impoverished representation of semantics, considering dependency features in our application context may also serendipitously assist verisimilitude generation."]},{"title":"3 The Extended Viterbi Algorithm: Propagating Dependency Structure","paragraphs":["In this section, we present an overview of the main features of our algorithm extension. We direct the interested reader to our technical paper (Wan et al., 2005) for full details.","The Viterbi algorithm (for a comprehensive overview, see (Manning and Schütze, 1999)) is used to search for the best path across a network of nodes, where each node represents a word in the vocabulary. The best sentence is a string of words, each one emitted by the corresponding visited node on the path.","Arcs between nodes are weighted using a combination of two pieces of information: a bigram probability corresponding to that pair of words; and a probability corresponding to the likelihood of a dependency relation between that pair of words. Specifically, the transition probability 3 The parse is thus not necessarily optimal, in the sense of","guaranteeing the most likely parse. defining these weights is the average of the dependency transition probability and the bigram probability.","To simplify matters in this evaluation, we assume that the emission probability is always one. The emission probability is interpreted as being a Content Selection mechanism that chooses words that are likely to be in a summary.

Since both food and blankets can reach the end-of-sentence state, both might conceivably be generated by considering just ngrams. However, only one is consistent with the input text.","To encourage the generation of verisimilitudes, we check for a dependency relation between blankets and distributed in the input sentence. As no evidence is found, we score this transition with a low weight. In contrast, there is evidence for the alternative path since the input text does contain a dependency relation between food and distributed.","In reality, multiple words might still conceivably be modified by future words, not just the immediately preceding word. In this example, distributed is the root of a dependency tree structure representing the preceding string. However, any node along the rightmost root-to-leaf branch of the dependency tree (that represents the partially generated string) could be modified. This dependency structure is determined statistically using a probabilistic model of dependency relations. To represent the rightmost branch, we use a stack data structure (referred to as the head stack) whereby older stack items correspond to nodes closer to the root of the dependency tree. The probability of the dependency-based transi-","tion is estimated as follows:        ","","","","","","","","  ","","","","    ","     ","","","","","     ","","","","","","","","where     ","","","","is inspired by and","closely resembles the probabilistic functions in","(Collins, 1996).","After selecting and appending a new word, we","update this representation containing the govern-","ing words of the extended string that can yet be","modified. The new path is then annotated with","this updated stack. 3.2 Maintaining the Head Stack There are three possible alternative outcomes to the head stack update mechanism. Given a head stack representing the dependency structure of the partially generated sentence and a new word to append to the search path, the first possibility is that the new word has no dependency relation to any of the existing stack items, in which case we simply push the new word onto the stack. For the second and third cases, we check each item on the stack and keep a record only of the best probable dependency between the new word and the appropriate stack item. The second outcome, then, is that the new word is the head of some item on the stack. All items up to and including that stack item are popped off and the new word is pushed on. The third outcome is that it modifies some item on the stack. All stack items up to (but not including) the stack item are popped off and the new word is pushed on.","We now step through the generation of the sentence “The UN relief workers distributed food to the hungry” which is produced by the exploration of one path in the search process. Figure 4 shows how the head stack mechanism updates and propagates the stack of governing words as we append words to the path to produce this string.","We first append the determiner the to the new string and push it onto the empty stack. As dictated by a high n-gram probability, the word UN follows. However, there is no evidence of a relation with the preceding word, so we simply push it on the stack. Similarly, relief is appended and also pushed on the stack.","When we encounter the word workers we find evidence that it governs each of the preceding"]},{"title":"91","paragraphs":["Graph nodes:",""," is The","","is food",""," is UN","","is to","  is relief","","is the","  is workers","","is hungry","  is distributed","is the end-of-sentence state","","","  ","","","","","","  ","","","","","","","","  ","","","       ","  "," "," ","  ","  ","  ","   ","  ","        Figure 4: Propagating the head stack feature along the path. three words.

The word food is pushed onto the stack as it too can still be modified.","The sentence could end there.

These approaches begin with a representation of sentence semantics that has been produced by a content planning stage. Compet-ing realisations of the semantic representation are ranked using an n-gram model. Our approach differs in that we do not start with a semantic representation. Rather, we paraphrase the original text, searching for the best word sequence and dependency tree structure concurrently.","Summarization researchers have also studied the problem of generating non-verbatim sentences: see (Jing and McKeown, 1999), (Barzi-lay et al., 1999) and more recently (Daumé III and Marcu, 2004). Jing uses a HMM for learn-ing alignments between summary and source sentences. Daume III also provides a mechanism for sub-sentential alignment but allows for alignments between multiple sentences. Both approaches provide models for later recombining sentence fragments. Our work differs primarily in granularity. Using words as a basic unit potentially offers greater flexibility in pseudo-paraphrase generation; however, like any approach that recombines text fragments, it incurs additional problems in ensuring that the generated sentence reflects the information in the input text.","In work describing summarisation as translation, Knight and Marcu (Knight and Marcu, 2002) also combine syntax models to help rank the space of possible candidate translations. Their work differs primarily in that they search over a space of trees representing the candidate translations and we search over a space of word sequences which are annotated by corresponding trees."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe two small experiments designed to evaluate whether a dependency-based statistical generator improves grammaticality.

To test this intuition, we examined the precision and recall statistics for the two types of dependencies separately.

The precision results for adjacent dependencies are presented in Figure 7. Again, our system performs better than the baseline in terms of precision. Our system is indistinguishable in recall performance from the baseline. Due to space constraints, we omit the recall graph. Using the same significance test as before, we find that the differences in precision are generally significant across sentence lengths.","That our approach should achieve a better precision for adjacent relations supports the claim of improved grammaticality.

Whilst the graph of precision scores, presented in Figure 8, shows our system often performing better than the baseline, this difference is not significant. As expected, the recall scores between our system and the baseline are on par and we again omit the results.","This result is interesting because one would expect that what our approach offers most is the ability to preserve long distance dependencies from the input text. However, long distance relations are fewer in number than adjacent relations, which account for approximately 70% of dependency relations (Collins, 1996). As the generator still does not produce perfect text, if the intermediate text between the head and modifier of a long distance relation contains any grammatical errors, the parser will obviously have difficulty in identifying the original intended relation. Given that there are fewer long distance relations, the presence of such errors quickly reduces the performance margin for the precision metric and hence no significant effect is detected.
