So far, several techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from a parallel/comparable corpus have been studied (Matsumoto and Utsuro, 2000). For example, in the case of estimation from comparable corpora, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999) proposed standard techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora. In their techniques, contextual similarity between a source language term and its translation candidate is measured across the languages, and all the translation candidates are re-ranked according to the contextual similarities.

Therefore, even if one wants to apply those existing techniques to the task of estimating bilingual term correspondences of technical terms, it is usually quite difficult to find an existing corpus for the domain of such technical terms.","Considering such a situation, we take an approach of collecting a corpus for the domain of such technical terms from the Web. In this approach, in order to compile a bilingual lexicon for technical terms, the following two issues have to be addressed: collecting technical terms to be listed as the headwords of a bilingual lexicon, and estimating translation of those technical terms. Among those two issues, this paper focuses on the second issue of translation estimation of technical terms, and proposes a method for translation estimation for technical terms using a domain/topic specific corpus collected from the Web.","More specifically, the overall framework of"]},{"title":"114","paragraphs":["compiling a bilingual lexicon from the Web can be illustrated as in Figure 1. Suppose that we have sample terms of a specific domain/topic, technical terms to be listed as the headwords of a bilingual lexicon are collected from the Web by the related term collection method of (Sato and Sasaki, 2003). Those collected technical terms can be divided into three subsets according to the number of translation candidates they have in an existing bilingual lexicon, i.e., the subset XU","S of terms for which the number of translations in the existing bilingual lexicon is one, the subset XM","S of terms for which the number of translations is more than one, and the subset YS of terms which are not found in the existing bilingual lexicon. (Henceforth, the union XU","S ∪ XM","S is denoted as XS.) The translation estimation task here is to estimate translations for the terms of XM","S and YS. For the terms of XM","S , it is required to select an appropriate translation from the translation candidates found in the existing bilingual lexicon. For example, as a translation of the Japanese technical term “”, which belongs to the logic circuit field, the term “register” should be selected but not the term “regista” of the football field. On the other hand, for the terms of YS, it is required to generate and validate translation candidates. In this paper, for the above two tasks, we use a domain/topic specific corpus. Each term of XU","S has the only one translation in the existing bilingual lexicon. The set of the translations of terms of XU","S is denoted as XU","T . Then, the domain/topic specific corpus is collected from the Web using the terms in the set XU","T . A new bilingual lexicon is compiled from the result of translation estimation for the terms of XM","S and YS, as well as the translation pairs which consist of the terms of XU","S and their translations found in the existing bilingual lexicon.","For each term of XM","S , from the translation candidates found in the existing bilingual lexicon, we select the one which appears most frequently in the domain/topic specific corpus. The experimental result of this translation selection process is described in Section 5.2.","As a method of translation generation/validation for technical terms, we propose a compositional translation estimation technique. Compositional translation estimation of a term can be done through the process of compositionally generating translation candidates of the term by concatenating the translation of the constituents of the term. Here, those translation candidates are validated using the domain/topic specific corpus.","In order to assess the applicability of the compositional translation estimation technique, we randomly pick up 667 Japanese and English technical term translation pairs of 10 domains from existing technical term bilingual lexicons. We then manually examine their compositionality, and find out that 88% of them are actually compositional, which is a very encouraging result. Based on this assessment, this paper proposes a method of compositional translation estimation for technical terms, and through experimental evaluation, shows that the domain/topic specific corpus contributes to improving the performance of compositional translation estimation."]},{"title":"2 Collecting a Domain/Topic Specific Corpus","paragraphs":["When collecting a domain/topic specific corpus of the language T , for each technical term xU","T in the set XU","T , we collect the top 100 pages with search engine queries including xU","T .

First, the Japanese technical term “ ” is decomposed into its constituents by consulting an existing bilingual lexicon and retrieving Japanese headwords.3 In this case, the result of this decomposition can be given as in the cases “a” and “b” (in Figure 2). Then, each constituent is translated into the target language. A confidence score is as-signed to the translation of each constituent. Finally, translation candidates are generated by concatenating the translation of those constituents without changing word order. The confidence score of translation candidates are defined as the product of the confidence scores of each constituent. Here, when validating those translation candidates using the domain/topic specific corpus, those which are not observed in the corpus are not regarded as candidates.","3.2 Compiling Bilingual Constituents Lexicons This section describes how to compile bilingual constituents lexicons from the translation pairs of the existing bilingual lexicon Eijiro.
