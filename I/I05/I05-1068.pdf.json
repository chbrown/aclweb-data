We propose a method for labelling prepositional phrases according to two different semantic role classifications, as contained in the Penn treebank and the CoNLL 2004 Semantic Role Labelling data set. Our results illustrate the difficulties in determining preposition semantics, but also demonstrate the potential for PP semantic role labelling to improve the performance of a holistic semantic role labelling system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Prepositional phrases (PPs) are both common and semantically varied in open English text. Learning the semantics of prepositions is not a trivial task in general. It may seem that the semantics of a given PP can be predicted with reasonable reliability independent of its context. However, it is actually common for prepositions or even identical PPs to exhibit a wide range of semantic fuctions in different open English contexts. For example, consider the PP to the car :this PP will generally occur as a directional adjunct (e.g. walk to the car ), but it can also occur as an object to the verb (e.g. refer to the car ) or contrastive argument (e.g. the default mode of transport has shifted from the train to the car ); to further complicate the situation, in key to the car it functions as a complement to the N-bar key. Based on this observation, we may consider the possibility of constructing a semantic tagger specifically for PPs, which uses the surrounding context of the PP to arrive at a semantic analysis. It is this task of PP semantic role labelling that we target in this paper.","A PP semantic role labeller would allow us to take a document and identify all adjunct PPs with their semantics. We would expect this to include a large portion of locative and temporal expressions, e.g., in the document, providing valuable data for tasks such as information extraction and question answering. Indeed our initial foray into PP semantic role labelling relates to an interest in geospatial and temporal analysis, and the realisation of the importance of PPs in identifying and classifying spatial and temporal references.","The contributions of this paper are to propose a method for PP semantic role labelling, and evaluate its performance over both the Penn treebank (including comparative evaluation with previous work) and also the data from the CoNLL Semantic Role Labelling shared task. As part of this process, we identify the R. Dale et al. (Eds.): IJCNLP 2005, LNAI 3651, pp. 779–791, 2005. c⃝ Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005 780 P. Ye and T. Baldwin Fig. 1.

For example, Figure 1, shows a fragment of the parse tree for the sentence [Japan’s reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights] fell by a hefty $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion [the Finance Ministry said],inwhich the three PPs governed by the verb fell are tagged as, respectively: PP-EXT (“extend”), meaning how much of the reserve fell; PP-TMP (“temporal”), meaning when the reserve fell; and PP-DIR (“direction”), meaning the direction of the fall.","According to our analysis, there are 143 preposition semantic roles in the treebank. However, many of these semantic roles are very similar to one another; for example, the following semantic roles were found in the treebank: PP-LOC, PP-LOC-1, PP-LOC-2, PP-LOC-3, PP-LOC-4, PP-LOC-5, PP-LOC-CLR, PP-LOC-CLR-2, PP-LOC-CLR-TPC-1. Inspection of the data revealed no systematic semantic differences between these PP types. Indeed, for most PPs, it was impossible to distinguish the subtypes of a given superclass (e.g. PP-LOC in our example). We therefore decided to collapse the PP semantic roles based on their first semantic feature. For example, all semantic roles that start with PP-LOC are collapsed to the single class PP-LOC. Table 1 shows the distribution of the collapsed preposition semantic roles.","[2] describe a system1","for disambiguating the semantic roles of prepositions in the Penn treebank according to 7 basic semantic classes.

It also can be observed that there is a consistent performance difference between classifiers 1 and 2, which may suggest that PP-CLR may be harder to distinguish from other semantic roles. This is not totally surprising given the relatively vague definition of the semantics of PP-CLR. We return to analyse these results in greater depth in Section 4."]},{"title":"3 Preposition Semantic Role Labelling over the CoNLL 2004 Dataset","paragraphs":["Having built a classifier which has reasonable performance on the task of treebank preposition semantic role disambiguation, we decided to investigate 2","PP-BNF with only 47 counts was not used by the second classifier. 3","http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0450736/maxent toolkit.html 4","O’Hara’s system was also evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross validation.

We chose the 2004 CoNLL Semantic Role Labelling (SRL) dataset [5] because it contained a wide range of semantic classes of PPs, in part analogous to the Penn treebank data, and also because we wished to couple our method with a holistic SRL system to demonstrate the ability of PP semantic role labelling to enhance overall system performance.","Since the focus of the CoNLL data is on SRL relative to a set of pre-determined verbs for each sentence input,5","our primary objective is to investigate whether the performance of SRL systems in general can be improved in any way by an independent preposition SRL system. We achieve this by embedding our PP classification method within an existing holistic SRL system—that is a system which attempts to tag all semantic role types in the CoNLL 2004 data—through the following three steps: 1. Perform SRL on each preposition in the CoNLL dataset; 2. Merge the output of the preposition SRL with the output of a given verb","SRL system over the same dataset; 3. Perform standard CoNLL SRL evaluation over the merged output.","The details of preposition SRL and combination with the output of a holistic SRL system are discussed below. 3.1 Breakdown of the Preposition Semantic Role Labelling Problem Preposition semantic role labelling over the CoNLL dataset is considerably more complicated than the task of disambiguating preposition semantic roles in the Penn treebank. There are three separate subtasks which are required to perform preposition SRL: 1. PP Attachment: determining which verb to attach each preposition to. 2. Preposition Semantic Role Disambiguation 3. Argument Segmentation: determining the boundaries of the semantic","roles.","The three subtasks are not totally independent of each other, as we demonstrate in the results section, and improved performance over one of the subtasks does not necessarily correlate with an improvement in the final results. 3.2 PP Attachment Classification PP attachment (PPA) classification is the first step of preposition semantic role labelling and involves determining the verb attachment site for a given preposition, i.e. which of the pre-identified verbs in the sentence the preposition is 5 Note that the CoNLL 2004 data identifies certain verbs as having argument structure, and that the semantic role annotation is relative to these verbs only.

Normally, this task would be performed by a parser. However, since the CoNLL dataset contains no parsing information6","and we did not want to use any resources not explicitly provided in the CoNLL data, we had to construct a PPA classifier to specifically perform this task.","This classifier uses the following features, all of which are derived from information provided in the CoNLL data:","– POS tags of surrounding tokens: The POS tags of the tokens before and after the target preposition within a window size of 2 tokens ([−2, 2]).","– POS tag of the target preposition","– The target preposition","– Verbs and their relative position (VerbRelPos): All the (pre-identified) verbs in the same sentence as the target preposition and their relative positions to the preposition are extracted as features. Each (verb, relative position) tuple is treated as a binary feature. The relative positions are determined in a way such that the 1st verb before the preposition will be given the position −1, the 2nd verb before the preposition will be given the position −2, and so on.","– The type of the clause containing the target preposition","– Neighbouring chunk type: The types (NP, PP, VP, etc.) of chunks before and after the target preposition within a window of 3 chunks.","– Word collocation (WordColl): All the open class words in the phrases before and after the target preposition within a predefined window of 3 chunks.","– Hypernym collocation (HyperColl): All the hypernyms from the open class words in the phrases before and after the target preposition within a predefined window of 3 chunks.","– Named Entity collocation NEColl: All the named entity information from the phrases before and after the target preposition within a predefined window of 3 chunks.","The PPA classifier outputs the relative position of the governing verb to the target preposition, or None if the preposition does not have a semantic role.","We trained the PPA classifier over the CoNLL 2004 training set, and tested it on the testing set.

Ye and T. Baldwin namely: PP NP+",". We additionally experimented with a robust statistical parser [6] to determine PP extent, but found that the regular expression-based method performed equally well or marginally better, without requiring any resources external to the original task data.","We make no attempt to perform separate evaluation of this particular subtask because without the semantic role information, no direct comparison can be made with the CoNLL data. 3.5 Combining the Output of the Subtasks Once we have identified the association between verbs and prepositions, and disambiguated the semantic roles of the prepositions, we can begin the process of creating the final output of the preposition semantic role labelling system. This takes place by identifying the data column corresponding to the verb governing each classified PP in the CoNLL data format (as determined by the PPA classifier), and recording the semantic role of that PP (as determined by the SRD classifier) over the full extent of the PP (as determined by the segmentation classifier). 3.6 Merging the Output of Preposition SRL and Verb SRL Once we have generated the output of the preposition SRL system, we can proceed to the final stage where the semantic roles of the prepositions are merged with the semantic roles of an existing holistic SRL system.","It is possible, and indeed likely, that the semantic roles produced by the two systems will conflict in terms of overlap in the extent of labelled constituents and/or the semantic role labelling of constituents.

In each table, ORIG refers to the base system without preposition SRL merging.","We can make a few observations from the results of the merged systems. First, out of verb attachment, SRD and segmentation, the SRD module is both: (a) the component with the greatest impact on overall performance, and (b) the component with the greatest differential between the oracle performance and classifier (AUTO) performance. This would thus appear to be the area in which future efforts should be concentrated in order to boost the performance of holistic SRLs through preposition SRL.","Second, the results show that in most cases, the recall of the merged system is higher than that of the original SRL system. This is not surprising given that we are generally relabelling or adding information to the argument structure of each verb, although with the more aggressive merging strategies (namely S2 and S3) it sometimes happens that recall drops, by virtue of the extent of an argument being aversely affected by relabelling. It does seem to point to a complementarity between verb-driven SRL and preposition-specific SRL, however.","Finally, it was somewhat disappointing to see that in no instance did a fullyautomated method surpass the base system in precision or F-score. Having said this, we were encouraged by the size of the margin between the base systems and the fully oracle-based systems, as it supports our base hypothesis that preposition SRL has the potential to boost the performance of holistic SRL systems, up to a margin of 10% in F-score for S3."]},{"title":"4 Analysis and Discussion","paragraphs":["In the previous 2 sections, we presented the methodologies and results of two systems that perform statistical analysis on the semantics of prepositions, each Semantic Role Labelling of Prepositional Phrases 789 using a different data set. The performance of the 2 systems was very different. The SRD system trained on the treebank produced highly credible results, whereas the SRL system trained on CoNLL 2004 SRL data set produced somewhat negative results. In the remainder of this section, we will analyze these results and discuss their significance.","There is a significant difference between the results obtained by the treebank classifier and that obtained by the CoNLL SRL classifier. In fact, even with a very small number of collocation features, the treebank classifier still outperformed the CoNLL SRL classifier. This suggests that the semantic tagging of prepositions is somewhat artificial. This is evident in three ways. First, the proportion of prepositional phrases tagged with semantic roles is small – around 57,000 PPs out of the million-word Treebank corpus. This small proportion suggests that the preposition semantic roles were tagged only in certain prototypical situations. Second, we were able to achieve reasonably high results even when we used a collocation feature set with fewer than 200 features. This further suggests that the semantic roles were tagged for only a small number of verbs in relatively fixed situations. Third, the preposition SRD system for the CoNLL data set used a very similar feature set to the treebank system, but was not able to produce anywhere near comparable results. Since the CoNLL dataset is aimed at holistic SRL across all argument types, it in-corporates a much larger set of verbs and tagging scenarios; as a result, the semantic role labelling of PPs is far more heterogeneous and realistic than is the case in the treebank. Therefore, we conclude that the results of our treebank preposition SRD system are not very meaningful in terms of predicting the success of the method at identifying and semantically labelling PPs in open text.","A few interesting facts came out of the results over the CoNLL dataset. The most important one is that by using an independent preposition SRL system, the results of a general verb SRL system can be significantly boosted. This is evident because when the oracled results of all three subtasks were used, the merged results were around 10% higher than those for the original systems, in all three cases. Unfortunately, it was also evident from the results that we were not successful in automating preposition SRL. Due to the strictness of the CoNLL evaluation, it was not always possible to achieve a better overall performance by improving just one of the three subsystems. For example, in some cases, worse results were achieved by using the oracled results for PPA, and the results produced by SRD classifier than using the PPA classifier and the SRD classifiers in conjunction. The reason for the worse results is that in our experiments, the oracled PPA always identifies more prepositions attached to verbs than the PPA classifier, therefore more prepositions will be given semantic roles by the SRD classifier. However, since the performance of the SRD classifier is not high, and the segmentation subsystem does not always produce the same semantic role boundaries as the CoNLL data set, most of these additional prepositions would either be given a wrong semantic role or wrong phrasal extent (or both), thereby causing the overall performance to fall. 790 P. Ye and T. Baldwin","Finally, it is evident that the merging strategy also plays an important role in determining the performance of the merged preposition SRL and verb SRL systems: when the performance of the preposition SRL system is high, a more preposition-oriented merging scheme would produce better overall results, and vice versa."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have proposed a method for labelling preposition semantics and deployed the method over two different data sets involving preposition semantics. We have shown that preposition semantics is not a trivial problem in general, and also that has the potential to complement other semantic analysis tasks, such as semantic role labelling.","Our analysis of the results of the preposition SRL system shows that significant improvement in all three stages of preposition semantic role labelling— namely verb attachment, preposition semantic role disambiguation and argument segmentation—must be achieved before preposition SRL can make a significant contribution to holistic SRL. The unsatisfactory results of our CoNLL preposition SRL system show that the relatively simplistic feature sets used in our research are far from sufficient. Therefore, we will direct our future work towards using additional NLP tools, information repositories and feature engineering to improve all three stages of preposition semantic role labelling."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Phil Blunsom and Steven Bird for their suggestions and encouragement, Tom O’Hara for providing insight into the inner workings of his semantic role disambiguation system, and the anonymous reviewers for their comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1.
