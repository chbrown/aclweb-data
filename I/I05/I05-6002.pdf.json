This task was a prerequisite to building a complete database of semantic frames for Japanese. In the task, a Japanese word is first translated into an English word or phrase, E. E is one of the lexical units that evoked a particular semantic frame, F, in the BFN database. When other lexical units of F are translated back into Japanese, this defines a candidate set of F for the lexical units of F in Japanese. The viability of the proposed method was tested on a Japanese verb (X-ga Y -wo) osou (roughly meaning “X attack(s) Y ,” “X hit(s) Y ,” “X surprise(s) Y ” in English, showing that it is a relatively polysemous word). The resulting translation was compared to semantic descriptions provided by IPAL and Nihongo Goi-Taikei (A Japanese Lexicon), two well-known language resources for Japanese, and also by the Frame Oriented Concept Analysis of Language (FOCAL). The comparison revealed that FOCAL, BFN, Goi Taikei, and IPAL provided finer-grained descriptions in this specific order."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Making use of deep semantics in information processing is one of the major problems confronting today’s NLP community. More and more NLP researchers are realizing that they need semantic/lexical resources that go beyond such ones as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) that only specify hierarchical semantic relationships. One of the crucial reasons for this is that raw linguistic data embodies semantic associations that are difficult to capture in terms of such hierarchical relationships, one of which is the so-called “semantic field” effect, a class of associative relationships among words (or concepts). To deal with these issues, deeper semantics are needed with descriptions that incorporate ontological inferences. Let us assume that X attacked Y is to be interpreted.1 This is a complex situation. In interpreting The man attacked a bank, it may be necessary to specify (by inference) that the subject used a weapon (e.g., a gun) and his purpose was to obtain money (illegally), whereas in interpreting The wolf attacked a flock of sheep, it may be necessary to specify that the subject never used a weapon and its purpose was to eat one or two individual sheep (rather than the entire flock) after killing them. Relevant inferences are clearly situation-based, or “case-based” in the sense of Case-based Reason-ing (Kolodner, 1993), and difficult to specify in terms of the lexical semantic descriptions available in resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) which don’t specify associative relationships among concepts, including the relationships between ROBBER (e.g., a man) and WAREHOUSE OF VALUABLES (e.g., a bank, museum, jewelry shop), and the one between a PREDATOR (e.g., a wolf) and its PREY (e.g., sheep, rabbit). Thus, the NLP community has a critical need for resources that encode this kind of information.","Along with PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Ellsworth et al., 2004), Berkeley FrameNet","1","One of the anonymous reviewers told us that it was unclear how ontological inferences of this sort are related to BFN’s frame definitions. The question boils down to the question of definition, i.e., what kind of information we need to define semantic frames to encode, and as we will see later, this is exactly the question addressed by FOCAL claiming that BFN frames are too coarse-grained to be used as an effective knowledge-base for ontological inferences."]},{"title":"11","paragraphs":["(BFN) (Baker et al., 1998) is an ongoing research project that is attempting to meet the demand for resources that encode deeper lexical semantics by providing a semantic frame lexicon (sometimes called the “FrameNet”) and a corpus annotated for semantic information encoded in terms of semantic frames.","Thus far, BFN has produced “a lexical database that currently contains more than 8,900 lexical units, more than 6,100 of which are fully annotated, in more than 625 semantic frames, exemplified in more than 135,000 annotated sentences” (cited from the FrameNet web page). Other ongoing projects, i.e., the German FrameNet or “SALSA” (Erk et al., 2003), the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), and the Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2003), are try-ing to build lexical resources that are compatible with the BFN, but for Japanese at least, no data has been released in a usable form, except for a few annotation examples for verbs of motion.","In sum, no useful resource exists for frame-based description/analysis of Japanese. This is one of the reasons that we attempted the task in this paper, along with our efforts to assess the usefulness of the database provided by BFN.","The anonymous reviewers of our paper pointed out that there have been some similar projects and other methodologies that have tried to translate BFN into other languages automatically, such as BiFrameNet (Chen and Fung, 2004) and Romance FrameNet2",", and that it would have been better to include the comparison against them.","BiFrameNet presented an automatic approach to constructing a bilingual semantic network using the Chinese HowNet, which is a Chinese ontology.

JFN, for example, used a mono-lingual corpus to construct the semantic frames. In cases like this, the construction might be inefficient because they have to construct all semantic frames by them-selves. But this affects on the reliability of the frames identified and described. This risk of arbitrary description can be reduced by using a bilingual corpus, if it is of high-quality. 2.1 Identifying English equivalents of ”osou” We chose Japanese-English alignments from the bilingual corpus in which the Japanese text contained osou, i.e., the target verb. We obtained 135 alignments from the corpus.","The bilingual corpus is consists of two subcorpra. One subcorpus is made of one-to-one alignments. Another is of one-to-many alignments. In the latter, one Japanese sentence is aligned with several English sentences.","In the first case, it was straightforward to specify an English word or phrase that translated the target verb, osou. In the second case, however, it is not. So, we singled out an English sentence that corresponds to a Japanese sentence that contained osou. In this process, the identification of osou’s English translations was done manually.","After this procedure, the following five verbs were identified as English translations of osou: assault, attack, hit, pound, and strike4",". 2.2 Identifying relevant semantic frames Based on these five verbs, we extracted semantic frames using FrameSQL (Sato, 2003). Semantic frames with LUs that included any of the five verbs were chosen from the BFN semantic frame database (referred to here as BFN). Corpora Mailing List, just one week before the submission deadline. This means that we had little chance to know about the project unless we were “insiders.”","4","There were a few other verbs or constructions that served as English translations of osou in the alignments: for example, besiege, engulf, feel pain, occur, hurt, kill, rob, shoot, stab, suffer, wreak on were used as its translations. But we filtered out those less frequent items (whose frequency is less than 3) for purposes of simplicity."]},{"title":"12","paragraphs":["Based on Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982), BFN posits that a semantic frame is an organization of “semantic roles,” which BFN terms as “Frame Elements” (FEs). Usually, LUs are in-stantiations or lexical realizations of FEs. Thus, an LU in a frame, F, is a word, or phrase, that, according to the assumptions of Frame Semantics, “evokes” frame F. The definition of the ⟨Attack⟩ frame in the BFN database is used in Figure 1to illustrate the procedure. As indicated, assault, attack and strike are listed as LUs of the ⟨Attack⟩ frame.","After manually examining all the semantic frames thus obtained, the five BFN frames were recognized as relevant to the various senses of the target word osou: 1. ⟨Attack⟩; 2. ⟨Cause harm⟩ 3. ⟨Experience bodily harm⟩ 4. ⟨Cause impact⟩ 5. ⟨Impact⟩","Semantic frames in the BFN database are supposedly related to one another. There are various relationships, some of which are sometimes encoded by establishing explicit “frame-to-frame relations” (such as “is used” relation) between two frames. Using this information, we obtained the following relationships between the five frames: 1. ⟨Attack⟩; 2. ⟨Cause harm⟩, is used: ⟨Experience bodily harm⟩; 3. ⟨Cause impact⟩, uses: ⟨Impact⟩","2.3 Identifying relevant frame-evoking LUs in English Each semantic frame has a number of FEs, each of which has lexical realizations, which called LUs. In the work reported here, only verbal LUs were selected as relevant from the English LUs made available in the BFN database.5","Admittedly, there","5","On this point, we recognize a certain kind of discrepancy between the theory and the practice in the BFN framework. If a LU is, according to its defintion, a lexical realization of a certain FE of a certain frame, more nominals should be identified and listed as LUs. For example, in Jack or-dered a hamburger at McDonald’s, hamburger is a noun that evokes the ⟨Cooking creation⟩ frame. While the ⟨Selling⟩ frame is evoked by order.v, this means that, according the definition of LU, hamburger.n needs to be identified as an LU of the ⟨Cooking creation⟩ frame; more specifically, it is an LU that instantiates the ⟨Food⟩ FE of the frame. It is obvious that the QUALIA STRUCTURE (Pustejovsky, 1995) of hamburger.n contains information of this sort. We suspect that this aspect of “frame-evocation by nominals” does not seem to be properly recognized and coded, and that BFN’s current practice of mostly identifying predicates as LUs is somewhat misleading, if we could say so, because it con-are a few nominal LUs in certain frames in the BFN, but we ignored them because they found them to be less relevant to our specific task.","After identifying all the relevant LUs for the three frames above, we obtained all the English verbs that translated the senses of the target word osou identified in terms of Frame Semantics.","For example, the relevant LUs for the ⟨Attack⟩ frame are the following verbs: ambush, assault, attack, charge, invade, jump, lay, set, storm, and strike","As was the case with the ⟨Attack⟩ frame, we extracted the relevant LUs for the ⟨Cause harm⟩ and ⟨Cause impact⟩ frames. We manually merged the extracted LUs, and obtained 93 verbal LUs relevant to the Japanese verb osou.","2.4 Obtaining LU candidates for Japanese FEs","Table 1: 15 most frequently occurring nouns Noun Freq. jiken (incident) 39 boukou (criminal assault) 32 josei (woman) 28 taiho (arrest) 23 hikoku (accused, defendant) 21 yougi (charge, suspicion) 20 kougeki (attack) 20 shounen (boy) 14 tero (terrorism) 14 shougai (injury) 13 higai (damage, harm) 12 kenkei (prefectural police department) 12 manshon (apartment) 12 butai (military unit) 10 fujo (girl and woman) 10","Using the bilingual corpus again, we gathered alignments that had English texts containing the English LUs specified in the way previously described. We obtained 262 alignments. This procedure defined a set of Japanese sentences containing Japanese words or phrases that were natural translations of the LUs in the BFN. ceals the fact that there can be, and actually are, many kinds of frame-evoking effects. BFN has been concentrating on identifying LUs for “governors,” not LUs for the entire set of FEs, for whatever reason. In this respect, it is crucial to note that not all frame-evokers are frame-governors: hamburger.n clearly evokes the ⟨Cooking creation⟩ frame, but there the noun does not govern the ⟨Cooking creation⟩ frame. Arguably, it is unreasonable and even gratuitous to posit the ⟨Hamburger⟩ frame to make hamburger.n a governor."]},{"title":"13 Attack Definition:","paragraphs":["An Assailant physically attacks a Victim (which is usually but not always sentient), causing or intending to cause the Victim physical injury.

This evaluation is clearly based on a misunderstanding: the semantic association, or conceptual dependence, between the ⟨Assailant⟩ and the ⟨Victim⟩ FEs is already encoded when we collected only sentences whose main verbs are osou (in Japanese texts) or its translations (in English texts). What we have done with msort is to get subgroupings given a larger semantic group-ing of “harm-causing” at a more generic level. Based on our coding experience, we are sure that subclassfication of a given semantic class is based on “semantic types” rather than semantic roles. To give proper subgroupings of the events that the ⟨Attack⟩ frame is relevant, it is necessary to know whether an ⟨Assailant⟩ is a human ([+human, +animate, . . . ]) or an animal ([−human, +animate, . . . ]), or whether a ⟨Victim⟩ is a human ([+human, +animate, . . . ]) or an animal ([−human, +animate, . . . ]).

In the case of ⟨Attack⟩, the frame has two “core” FEs, i.e., ⟨Assailant⟩ and ⟨Victim⟩, and some other “peripheral” or “noncore” FEs such as ⟨Place⟩, ⟨Time⟩, and ⟨Weapon⟩. Thus, ⟨Attack⟩ denotes a situation in which an agent recognizable as an ⟨Assailant⟩ causes (or tries to cause) some ⟨Harm⟩ or ⟨Injury⟩ to someone or a group of people recognizable as a ⟨Victim⟩ at some ⟨Place⟩ and ⟨Time⟩, sometimes using an item recognizable as a ⟨Weapon⟩.","This means that all we need to do is to classify the nouns in Table 1 into semantic classes such as ⟨Assailant⟩, ⟨Victim⟩, ⟨Place⟩, ⟨Time⟩, or ⟨Weapon⟩, with appropriate subclasses where human assailants are distinguished from nonhuman assailants.10","The groupings provided by msort turned out to be useful for this purpose.11","Using this procedure, the nouns obtained on a frequency-basis for ⟨Attack⟩ were classified into the two core FEs, as follows:","10","It is important to note that the target data selection procedure of BFN is biased. For example, they put aside a number of problematic cases like metaphorical expressions, and this is clearly reflected in the current frame definitions. We repeated noticed that metaphorically extended senses of a word were systematically dropped in the current release of BFN. For illustration, the sense of attack.n in heart attack is not described in BFN. Descriptive “gaps” of this sort are clearly undesirable; some specific kinds of mapping problems between English LUs provided in BFN and Japanese LUs arise from this.","11","We were sometimes unable to identify an FE for a noun class based solely on the output of msort. In these cases, we looked at its usage in the corpus to determine its FE.","• ⟨Assailant⟩: dansei (man), goutou (burglary/burglar, robbery/robber), heishi (soldier), hikoku (accused person), butai (military unit), kyoudan (religious group)","• ⟨Victim⟩: danshi (boy), josei (woman), fujo (girl and woman), joshi (girl), danji (young boy), joji (young girl), youjo (infant girl), shounen (boy), shoujo (girl), aite (opponent), nihonjin (Japanese), . . . 2.6 Advantages of proposed method Using msort turned out to be more beneficial than anticipated when it came to selecting noncore FEs. msort helped to determine noncore FEs correctly to a certain extent. The ⟨Attack⟩ frame, for example, includes noncore FEs such as ⟨Place⟩, ⟨Time⟩, ⟨Purpose⟩, and ⟨Reason⟩ in addition to its core FEs, ⟨Assailant⟩ and ⟨Victim⟩. msort automatically groups naifu (knife), raifuru (rifle), and pisutoru (pistol) into the “product” category, which corresponds to the ⟨Weapon⟩ FE. Similarly, it automatically groups chiiki (Regional site), hokubu (northern area), and shinai (Inner city) into the “location” category, which corresponds to ⟨Place⟩. Thus, part of the FE assignment task can be done automatically using msort.","The procedure also produced some interesting results. For example, the proposed method automatically specifies a set of lexical items (or lexical units) that clearly have the frame-evocation effect but that are not properly identified as frame elements of a semantic frame in BFN, either in terms of core FEs or peripheral FEs (= noncore FEs).

The reason for this is probably that BFN frames successfully specify the semantic interdependence between the ⟨Assailant⟩ and ⟨Victim⟩ roles, whereas such in-terdependece is not encoded in the IPAL descriptions. We believe this is one of the strengths of frame-based semantic description.","BFN definitions are not detailed enough, how-ever. They face problems when we try to account for the constrast between The shark attacked the swimmer and ?*The shark attacked the bank, for example. The latter sentences doesn’t makes sense unless it is reinterpreted some way, while it is straightforward to interpret the first sentence against a predatory situation.","In interpreting the second, there is a clear conflict or “competition” between two strong readings: one interpretation (reading 1) is against the situation of ⟨Predation⟩, where the shark is interpreted as a ⟨Predator⟩ and the bank as a ⟨Prey⟩. Another (reading 2) is against the situation of ⟨Bank Robbery⟩, where the shark is interpreted as a ⟨Bank Robber⟩ and the bank as a ⟨Warehouse of Valuables⟩ (or simply as a ⟨Bank⟩). If reading 2 wins out, an implicit “type coercion” (Pustejovsky, 1995) takes place to the shark so that the referent of the shark is switched to a human who acts as a ⟨Robber⟩ with a nickname “shark.” If reading 1 wins out, by contrast, another kind of implicit type coercion takes place to the bank so that the referent of the bank is switched to an animal (an instance of fish, dolphin, or whale) which acts as a ⟨Prey⟩, being called “the bank” for some unclear reasons. The preference of the reinterpretation for reading 2 over the other can be accounted for if we are allowed to say that to find someone being called “shark” is more likely than to find some animal being called “bank.”","What this suggests is this: pieces of semantic information that would account for “selectional restrictions” of this sort are not specified in the BFN definitions (yet). Therefore, it can be said that the frames constructed from BFN do not classify all meanings of osou in the same way IPAL does not, but these frames specify some finer-grained, selectional aspects of osou’s lexical meaning than the IPAL description.

Its development has been strongly influenced by BFN, but it also tries to extend BFN’s scope of semantic analysis to the next stage.","In the case of X-ga Y-wo osou, FOCAL recognizes 15 frames in total, listed in Table 4, specify-ing their hierarchical organization.14","These frames are identified and classified based on the semantic co-variations between ⟨Harm Cause(r))⟩ X , a special case of ⟨Cause(r)⟩, and ⟨Harm Experiencer⟩ Y , a special case of ⟨Experiencer⟩. This is important to note that FOCAL puts more emphasis on the specification of the semantic co-variation between X and Y in terms of semantic features because they are crucial characteristics of a semantic frame, which are not captured in the Goi Taikei and IPAL descriptions, and are not clearly encoded even in the BFN description.","In FOCAL, frames are defined as idealized models of situations such as Robbery, Predation, assuming that human understanding is situation-based. The descriptive task of FOCAL, then, is to recognize situations and give adequately detailed descriptions to them. Given R is a set of situation-specific roles {r1, . . . , rn}, which are called semantic roles in BFN. Semantic frames are useful only if they serves as specifications of the co-variations among such Rs.","For example, F06, as a subclass of the ⟨Attack⟩ class event is defined as follows:","Definition of F06: Attack(R) = Attack(Predator(X), Prey(Y )) = Hunt(Hunter(X), Target(Y ), Purpose(Z)) where Z = Eat(Eater(X), Food(Y ), Purpose(Z′",")); where Z′","= Satisfy (r1(Z), Hunger) There seems to be no English noun that names r1.","These are the frames that account for more or less all possible readings of X -ga Y -wo osou. The","14","Space limitation disallowed us to show that the 15 frames thus recognized are nearly optimal to exhaustively specify all the situations against which the senses of osou are determined. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses on psychological experiments (Nakamoto et al., to appear). We regret this because the result would surely have answered the question from one of the anonymous reviewers.

The BFN identifies 3 frames relevant to the semantics of osou, while FOCAL uses a total of 15 frames to determine the range of situations against which people understand the sentences whose main verb is osou.","The 3 BFN frames have been compared with the 15 frames below to assess how well they correspond to one another: Table 5: BFN/FOCAL correspondences Attack Part of G1 F01–F05 Cause harm [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] Cause impact [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] [UNCLEAR] G5 F13–F15","This comparison revealed several differences. First, FOCAL specifies situations that the ⟨Attack⟩ frame applies to in much greater detail, although its descriptions are based on semantic frames like BFN’s descriptions are. This is mainly because FOCAL identifies frames in terms of conceivable differences in the “purposes,” or “intended effects” of the ⟨Harm"]},{"title":"18","paragraphs":["Cause(r)⟩15",", of which BFN’s ⟨Assailant⟩ is a special case. This suggests that BFN frames can be further elaborated according to the subclassification of ⟨Assailant⟩ in terms of its purpose.16","The same is conversely true of ⟨Cause harm⟩ and ⟨Cause impact⟩ frames. These BFN frames need to be generalized so that they include nonhuman, nonintentional agents, which is not done in the current BFN. Better matches would be found if the ⟨Cause harm⟩ and ⟨Cause impact⟩ frames were further classified according to the properties of the ⟨Harm causer⟩ and ⟨Impactor⟩ just as in the ⟨Attack⟩ frame.","While FOCAL explicitly groups the F01–F05 frames into G1 and combines it with another group, G2, to yield a more general semantic class { G1, G2} , it is not clear whether BFN captures this hybrid class, since the hierarchical relationships among frames are not sufficiently specified.","In fact, the comparison with FOCAL revealed that BFN does not classify the ⟨Assailant⟩ types in as much detail as FOCAL does. According to FOCAL’s assumptions, it is ⟨Assailant⟩’s ⟨Purpose⟩ (including the “null” value) that defines the differences in otherwise similar situations. To identify such subtle differences is exactly what humans are very good at and computers are not. Specification of information of this kind is one of the serious demands arising from many of the NLP tasks.","To conclude, we noted that the granularity of the semantic descriptions provided by BFN, IPAL, Goi Taikei, and FOCAL had the following hierarchy: FOCAL > BFN ≈ Goi Taikei > IPAL This suggests that, while BFN is clearly useful for a variety of purposes, its semantic descriptions are not detailed enough, particularly when dealing with the polysemy of relatively frequent words like osou in Japanese or hit in English.","While our result is only suggestive at best, let","15","This is not the same as BFN’s ⟨Harm causer⟩ role, which is much more specific than ⟨Harm Cause(r)⟩ in FOCAL’s sense.","16","The question of “where to stop,” addressed by one of the anonymous reviewers, would have been answered if we had enough space to show that those 15 frames/situations are nearly optimal to account for all the semantic classifications reflected in selectional restrictions, as explained in note 14. Clearly, we do not need to identify all semantically possible subclassifications; we just need to identify psychologically real subclassifications. us make a brief comment on some methodological aspects of the BFN framework.","Overall, BFN definitions for semantic frames are much more oriented or even “biased” for descriptions of activities intended and caused by human, volitional agents. In fact, BFN took a methodological decision not to include metaphorical uses and other “problematic” uses of words for ease of lexicon-building, thereby sacrificing its descriptive range, causing a problem with biased data coverage, as far as we could see. In the case of osou, for example, there were clearly many examples in which harm is not caused by a human, i.e., cases described by FOCAL frame clusters G2: F06–F07, G3: F08–F11, G4: F12, and G5: F13–F15. Therefore, as far as we are concerned with the viability of the frame-based description of situations that can be expressed using osou in Japanese, the current status of the BFN database is only partially successful in that it successfully captures the class of situations specified by G1."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed a new translation-like method using BFN to find Japanese LUs that corresponded to English LUs in BFN semantic frames. We evaluated a technique of identifying Japanese LUs based on English LUs using a bilingual corpus. We evaluated the results by comparing them with other Japanese language resources and analyses, IPAL, Goi Taikei, and FOCAL. The comparison revealed that FOCAL, BFN, Goi Taikei, and IPAL provided finer-grained descriptions in this specific order.","Our method allowed us to easily find Japanese LUs that corresponded to LUs in BFN semantics and at the same level of granularity as BFN. Even if all the relevant sentenceswere not manually examined when the semantic frame was constructed, we were able to collect several members of FEs. Our method also automatically specified a set of lexical titems that clearly had the frame-evocation effect but that were not properly identified as Frame Elements of a semantic frame in BFN.","There are several problems still remaining that need to be addressed.

There is therefore a possibility that we failed to identify certain semantic frames. We plan to do further experiments using a greater number of bilingual corpora with a wider domain coverage.","In the comparison of the analyses by BFN and by FOCAL, only one target verb osou is used in this work. Clearly, this is insufficient and our result is only suggestive at best. To draw a realis-tic conclusion, we will definitely need to examine more target words and make the comparison more reliable."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Collin F. Baker, Charles J.
