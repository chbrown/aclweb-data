Recognition of Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) and their relative compositionality are crucial to Natural Language Processing. Various statistical techniques have been proposed to recognize MWEs. In this paper, we integrate all the existing statistical features and investigate a range of classifiers for their suitability for recognizing the non-compositional Verb-Noun (V-N) collocations. In the task of ranking the V-N collocations based on their relative compositionality, we show that the correlation between the ranks computed by the classifier and human ranking is significantly better than the correlation between ranking of individual features and human ranking. We also show that the properties ‘Distributed frequency of object’ (as defined in [27]) and ‘Nearest Mutual Information’ (as adapted from [18]) contribute greatly to the recognition of the non-compositional MWEs of the V-N type and to the ranking of the V-N collocations based on their relative compositionality."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The main goals of the work presented in this paper are (1) To investigate a range of classifiers for their suitability in recognizing the non-compositional V-N collocations, and (2) To examine the relative compositionality of collocations of V-N type. Measuring the relative compositionality of V-N collocations is extremely helpful in applications such as machine translation where the collocations that are highly non-compositional can be handled in a special way.","Multi-word expressions (MWEs) are those whose structure and meaning cannot be derived from their component words, as they occur independently. Examples include conjunctions like ‘as well as’ (meaning ‘including’), idioms like ⋆ Part of the work was done at Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA, when he was visiting IRCS as a visiting Scholar, February to December, 2004.

Joshi ‘kick the bucket’ (meaning ‘die’), phrasal verbs like ‘find out’ (meaning ‘search’) and compounds like ‘village community’. A typical natural language system as-sumes each word to be a lexical unit, but this assumption does not hold in case of MWEs [6] [12]. They have idiosyncratic interpretations which cross word boundaries and hence are a ‘pain in the neck’ [23]. They account for a large portion of the language used in day-to-day interactions [25] and so, handling them becomes an important task.","A large number of MWEs have a standard syntactic structure but are non-compositional semantically. An example of such a subset is the class of non-compositional verb-noun collocations (V-N collocations). The class of V-N collocations which are non-compositional is important because they are used very frequently. These include verbal idioms [22], support-verb constructions [1] [2] etc. The expression ‘take place’ is a MWE whereas ‘take a gift’ is not a MWE.","It is well known that one cannot really make a binary distinction between compositional and non-compositional MWEs. They do not fall cleanly into mutually exclusive classes, but populate the continuum between the two extremes [4]. So, we rate the MWEs (V-N collocations in this paper) on a scale from 1 to6where6denotesacompletely compositional expression, while 1 denotes a completely opaque expression. But, to address the problem of identification, we still need to do an approximate binary distinction. We call the expressions with a rating of 4 to 6 compositional and the expressions with rating of 1 to 3 as non-compositional. (See Section 4 for further details).","Various statistical measures have been suggested for identification of MWEs and ranking expressions based on their compositionality. Some of these are Frequency, Mutual Information [9], Log-Likelihood [10] and Pearson’s χ2","[8]. Integrating all the statistical measures should provide better evidence for recognizing MWEs and ranking the expressions. We use various Machine Learning Techniques (classifiers) to integrate these statistical features and classify the V-N collocations as MWEs or Non-MWEs. We also use a classifier to rank the V-N collocations according to their compositionality. We then compare these ranks with the ranks provided by the human judge. A similar comparison between the ranks according to Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) based features and the ranks of human judges has been done by McCarthy, Keller and Caroll [19] for verb-particle constructions. (See Section 3 for more details). Some preliminary work on recognition of V-N collocations was presented in [28].","In the task of classification, we show that the technique of weighted features in distance-weighted nearest-neighbour algorithm performs slightly better than other machine learning techniques. We also find that the ‘distributed frequency of object (as defined by [27])’ and ‘nearest mutual information (as adapted from [18])’ are important indicators of the non-compositionality of MWEs. In the task of ranking, we show that the ranks assigned by the classifier correlated much better with the human judgement than the ranks assigned by individual statistical measures.","This paper is organised in the following sections (2) Basic Architecture, (3) Related work, (4) Data used for the experiments, (5) Agreement between Relative Compositionality of Multi-word Expressions 555 the Judges, (6) Features, (7) Experiments - Classification, (8) Experiments - Ranking and (9) Conclusion."]},{"title":"2 Basic Architecture","paragraphs":["Recognition of MWEs can be regarded as a classification task where every V-N collocation can be classified eitherasaMWEorasaNon-MWE.EveryV-N collocation is represented as a vector of features which are composed largely of various statistical measures. The values of these features for the V-N collocations are extracted from the British National Corpus. For example, the V-N collocation ‘raise an eyebrow’ can be represented as [ Frequency = 271, Mutual Information = 8.43, Log-Likelihood = 1456.29, etc.].","Now, to recognise the MWEs, the classifier has to do a binary classification of this vector. So, ideally, the classifier should take the above information and classify ‘raise an eyebrow’ as an MWE. The classifier can also be used to rank these vectors according to their relative compositionality."]},{"title":"3 Related Work","paragraphs":["Church and Hanks (1989) proposed a measure of association called Mutual Information [9]. Mutual Information (MI) is the logarithm of the ratio between the probability of the two words occurring together and the product of the probability of each word occurring individually. The higher the MI, the more likely are the words to be associated with each other. The usefulness of the statistical approach suggested by Church and Hanks [9] is evaluated for the extraction of V-N collocations from German text Corpora [7]. Several other measures like Log-Likelihood [10], Pearson’s χ2","[8], Z-Score [8] , Cubic Association Ratio (MI3), Log-Log [17], etc., have been proposed. These measures try to quantify the association of the two words but do not talk about quantifying the non-compositionality of MWEs. Dekang Lin proposes a way to automatically identify the non-compositionality of MWEs [18]. He suggests that a possible way to separate compositional phrases from non-compositional ones is to check the existence and mutual-information values of phrases obtained by replacing one of the words with a similar word. According to Lin, a phrase is probably non-compositional if such substitutions are not found in the collocations database or their mutual information values are significantly different from that of the phrase. Another way of determining the non-compositionality of V-N collocations is by using ‘distributed frequency of object’(DFO) in V-N collocations [27]. The basic idea in there is that “if an object appears only with one verb (or few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature” [27].","Schone and Jurafsky [24] applied Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from the corpus. An interesting way of quantifying the relative compositionality of a MWE is proposed by Baldwin, Bannard, Tanaka and Widdows [3]. They use latent semantic analysis (LSA) to determine the similarity between 556 S. Venkatapathy and A.K. Joshi an MWE and its constituent words, and claim that higher similarity indicates great decomposability. In terms of compositionality, an expression is likely to be relatively more compositional if it is decomposable. They evaluate their model on English NN compounds and verb-particles, and showed that the model correlated moderately well with the Wordnet based decomposibility theory [3].","Evert and Krenn [11] compare some of the existing statistical features for the recognition of MWEs of adjective-noun and preposition-noun-verb types. Galiano, Valdivia, Santiago and Lopez [14] use five statistical measures to classify generic MWEs using the LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) algorithm. In contrast, we do a more detailed and focussed study of V-N collocations and the ability of various classifiers in recognizing MWEs. We also compare the roles of various features in this task.","McCarthy, Keller and Caroll [19] judge compositionality according to the degree of overlap in the set of most similar words to the verb-particle and head verb. They showed that the correlation between their measures and the human ranking was better than the correlation between the statistical features and the human ranking. We have done similar experiments in this paper where we compare the correlation value of the ranks provided by the classifier with the ranks of the individual features for the V-N collocations. We show that the ranks given by the classifier which integrates all the features provides a significantly better correlation than the individual features."]},{"title":"4 Data Used for the Experiments","paragraphs":["The data used for the experiments is British National Corpus of 81 million words. The corpus is parsed using Bikel’s parser [5] and the Verb-Object Collocations are extracted. There are 4,775,697 V-N of which 1.2 million were unique. All the V-N collocations above the frequency of 100 (n=4405) are taken to conduct the experiments so that the evaluation of the system is feasible. These 4405 V-N collocations were searched in Wordnet, American Heritage Dictionary and SAID dictionary (LDC,2003). Around 400 were found in at least one of the dictionaries. Another 400 were extracted from the rest so that the evaluation set has roughly equal number of compositional and non-compositional expressions. These 800 expressions were annotated with a rating from 1 to 6 by using guidelines independently developed by the authors. 1 denotes the expressions which are totally non-compositional while 6 denotes the expressions which are totally compositional. The brief explanation of the various rating are (1) No word in the expression has any relation to the actual meaning of the expression. Example: “leave a mark”. (2) Can be replaced by a single verb. Example : “take alook”. (3) Although meanings of both words are involved, at least one of the words is not used in the usual sense. Example : “break news”. (4) Relatively more compositional than (3). Example : “prove a point”. (5) Relatively less compositional than (6). Example : “feel safe”. (6) Completely compositional. Example : “drink coffee”. For the experiments on classification (Section 7), we call the expressions with ratings of 4 to 6 as compositional and the expressions Relative Compositionality of Multi-word Expressions 557 with rating of 1 to 3 as non-compositional. For the experiments on ranking the expressions based on their relative compositionality, we use all the 6 ratings to represent the relative compositionality of these expressions."]},{"title":"5 Agreement Between the Judges","paragraphs":["The data was annotated by two fluent speakers of English.

Relative Compositionality of Multi-word Expressions 559 7.1 Nearest-Neighbour Algorithm This is an instance-based learning technique where the test vector is classified based on its nearest vectors in the training data.

The test vector is assigned the class of maximum number of neighbours. This can be furthur modified by calculating the inverse weighted distance between the test vector and the neighbouring training vectors in each of the classes. The test vector is then assigned the class which has the higher inverse-weighted distance. One can also use all the training vectors and the weighted-distance principle to classify the test vector.","The average classification accuracy of each of the above methods on the test sets of each of the annotators is shown in Table 3.

Unlike the error-driven algorithms (Perceptron etc.), SVM searches for the two distinct classes and maximizes the margin between two classes. Data of higher dimension can also be classified using the appropriate Kernel. We used Linear and Polynomial Kernel (degree=2) to test the evaluation data. We also used the radial-basis network in SVMs to compare the results because of their proximity to the nearest-neigbour algorithms. Table 4.

As a result, the distance metric used by the nearest-neighbour algorithm which depends on all the features might be misleading. The distance between the neighbour will be dominated by large number of irrelevant features.","A way of overcoming this problem is to weight each feature differently when calculating the distance between the two instances. This also gives us an insight into which features are mainly responsible for recognizing the non-compositionality of MWEs. The jth","feature can be multiplied by the weight z","j, where the values of z1...zn are chosen to minimize the true classification error of the learning algorithm [20].

So, each vector in the training data is classified using the remaining vectors. The classification accuracy is defined as Clacc = 100 ∗ ( m ∑ 1 classify(i)/m) where classify(i)=1, if the ith","training example is classified correctly using the distance-weighted nearest neighbour algorithm, otherwise classify(i)=0.
