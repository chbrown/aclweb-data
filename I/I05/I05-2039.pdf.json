Experiments are performed on both stochastic language models and an EBMT system translating from Japanese to English with a large bicorpus, in order to reassess the assumption that using only homogeneous data tends to make system performance go up. We describe a method to represent corpus homogeneity as a distribution of similarity coefficients based on a cross-entropic measure investigated in previous works. We show that beyond minimal sizes of training data the excessive elimination of heterogeneous data proves prejudicial in terms of both perplexity and translation quality : excessively restricting the training data to a particular domain may be prejudicial in terms of In-Domain system performance, and that heterogeneous, Out-of-Domain data may in fact contribute to better sytem performance."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Homogeneity of large corpora is still an unclear notion. In this study we make a link between the notions of similarity and homogeneity : a large corpus is made of sets of documents to which may be assigned a score in similarity defined by cross-entropic measures (similarity is implicitly expressed in the data). The distribution of the similarity scores of such subcorpora may then be interpreted as a representation of the homogeneity of the main corpus, which can in turn be used to perform corpus adaptation to tune a corpus based NLP system to a particular domain.","(Cavaglià 2002) makes the assumption that a corpus based NLP system generally yields better results with homogeneous training data rather than heterogeneous, and experiments on a text classifier system (Rainbow1","), to mixed conclusions. We reassess this assumption by experimenting on language model perplexity, and on an EBMT system translating from Japanese to English."]},{"title":"2 A framework for corpus homogeneity 2.1 Previous work on corpus similarity and homogeneity","paragraphs":["A range of measures for corpus similarity have been put forward in past literature : (Kilgarriff and Rose 98; Kilgarriff 2001) investigated on the similarity of corpora and compared “Known Similarity Corpora” (KSC) using perplexity and cross-entropy on words, word frequency measures, and a χ2","-test which they found to be the most robust. However(as acknowledged in (Kilgarriff and Rose 98)), using KSC requires that the two corpora chosen for comparison are sufficiently similar that the most frequent lexemes in them almost perfectly overlap. However (Liebscher 2003) showed by comparing frequency counts of different large Google Group 1 See http://www.cs.cmu.edu/mccallum/bow ."]},{"title":"226","paragraphs":["corpora that it is not usually the case.","Measuring homogeneity by counting word / lexeme frequencies introduces addi-tional difficulties as it assumes that the word is an obvious, well-defined unit, which is not the case in the Chinese (Sproat and Emerson 2003) or Japanese language (Matsumoto et al., 2002), for instance, where word segmentation is not trivial.","(Denoual 2004) showed that similarity between corpora could be quantified with a coefficient based on the cross-entropies of probabilistic models built upon reference data. The approach needed no explicit selection of features and was language independent, as it relied on character based models (as opposed to word based models) thus bypassing the word segmentation issue and making it applicable on any electronic data.","The cross-entropy HT (A) of an N-gram model p constructed on a training corpus T , on a test corpus A = {s1, .., sQ} of Q sentences with si = {ci","1..ci","|si|} a sentence of |si| characters is: HT (A) =","∑Q","i=1[∑|si|","j=1 −logpi","j]","∑Q i=1 |si| (1) where pi","j = p(ci","j|ci","j−N+1..ci","j−1).","We therefore define a scale of similarity between two corpora on which to rank any third given one. Two reference corpora T1 and T2 are selected by the user, and used as training sets to compute N-gram character models. The cross-entropies of these two reference models are estimated on a third test set T3, and respectively named HT1(T3) and HT2(T3) as in the notation in Eq. 1. Both model cross-entropies are estimated according to the other reference , i .e ., HT1(T2) and HT1(T1), HT2(T1) and HT2(T2) so as to obtain the weights W1 and W2 of references T1 and T2 : W1 = HT1(T3) − HT1(T1) HT1(T2) − HT1(T1) (2) and : W2 = HT2(T3) − HT2(T2) HT2(T1) − HT2(T2) (3) After which W1 and W2 are assumed to be the weights of the barycentre between the user-chosen references. Thus I(T3) =","W1 W1 + W2 = 1","1 + W2 W1 (4) is defined to be the similarity coefficient between reference sets 1 and 2, which are respectively corpus T1 and corpus T2 . Given the previous as-sumptions, I(T1) = 0 and I(T2) = 1 ; further-more, any given corpus T3 yields a score between the extrema I(T1) = 0 and I(T2) = 1","This framework may be applied to the quantification of the similarity of large corpora, by projecting them to a scale defined implicitly via the reference data selection. In this study we shall specifically focus on a scale of similarity bounded by a sublanguage of spoken conversation on the one hand, and a sublanguage of written style media on the other.","We build upon this previous work in order to represent intra-corpus homogeneity. 2.2 Representing corpus homogeneity Corpora are collected sets of documents usually originating from various sources. Whether a corpus is homogeneous in content or not is scarcely known besides the knowledge of the nature of the sources. As homogeneity is multidimensional (see (Biber 1988) and (Biber 1995) for considerations on the dimensions in register variation for instance), one cannot trivially say that a corpus is homogeneous or heterogeneous : different sublanguages show variations that are lexical, semantic, syntactic, and structural (Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982).","In this study we wish to implicitly capture such variations by applying the previously described similarity framework to the representation of homogeneity. Coefficients of similarity may be computed for all smaller sets in a corpus, the distribution of which shall depict the homogeneity of the corpus relatively to the scale defined implicitly by the choice of the reference data.","Homogeneity as depicted here is relative to the choice of reference training data, which implicitly embrace lexical and syntactic variations in a sublanguage (which are by any means not unidimensional, as argued previously). We focus as in (Denoual 2004) on a scale of similarity bounded by a sublanguage of spoken conversation on the one hand, and a sublanguage of written style media on the other."]},{"title":"227 3 A study of the homogeneity of a large bicorpus 3.1 Data","paragraphs":["Reference data is needed to set up a scale of similarity, and implicitly bound it.","For the sublanguage of spoken conversation we used for both English and Japanese the SLDB (Spontaneous Speech Database) corpus, a multilingual corpus of raw transcripts of dialogues described in (Nakamura et al., 1996).","For the sublanguage of written style media, we used for English a part of the Calgary2","corpus, containing several contemporary English literature pieces3",", and for Japanese a corpus of collected articles from the Nikkei Shinbun newspaper4",".","The large multilingual corpus that is used in our study is the C-STAR5","Japanese / English part of an aligned multilingual corpus, the Basic Traveller’s Expressions Corpus (BTEC).","A prerequisite of the method is that levels of data transcriptions are strictly normalized, so that the comparison is not made on the transcription method but on the underlying signal itself. 3.2 Homogeneity in the BTEC The BTEC is a collection of sentences originating from 197 sets (one set originating from one phrasebook) of basic travel expressions. Here we examine the distribution of the similarity coefficients assigned to its subsets.","The corpus may be segmented in a variety of manners, however we wish to proceed in two intuitive ways : firstly, by keeping the original subdivision, i .e ., one phrasebook per subset ; secondly, at the level of the sentence, i .e ., one sentence per subset . Figure 1 shows the similarity coefficient distributions for Japanese and English at the sentence and subset level, and Table 1 shows their means and standard deviations.","The difference in means and standard deviation","2","The Calgary Corpus is available via anonymous ftp at ftp.cpcs.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/text.compression.corpus .","3","Parts are entitled book1, book2 and book3.","4","The use of classical Japanese literature is not appropriate as (older) copyright-free works make use of a considerably different language. In order to maintain a certain homogeneity, we limit our study to contemporary language.","5","See http://www.c-star.org .

The distribution of similarity coefficients at the line level, however similar to the distribution at the phrasebook level, suggests in its irregularities that it is indeed safer to use a larger unit to estimate cross-entropies. Moreover, we wish not to tamper with the integrity of the original subsets, that is to keep the integrity of phrasebook contents as much as possible.","On the phrasebook level, the similarity coefficient has a low correlation on both the average phrasebook length (0.178) and the average line length (0.278) (which does not make it a too “shallow” profiling method). On the other hand, correlation is high between the coefficients in Japanese and English (0.781), which is only to be expected intuitively."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Method","paragraphs":["This work wishes to reassess the assumption that, for a same amount of training data, a corpus-based NLP system performs better when its data tends to be homogeneous. Here we use the representation of homogeneity defined by the similarity coefficient scale to select data that tends to be homogeneous to an expected task. Experiments shall be performed both on randomly selected data, and on data selected according to their similarity coefficient. The closer the coefficient of the training data is to the coefficient of the expected task, the better.","We assume that the task is sufficiently represented by a set of data from the same domain as the large bicorpus used, the BTEC. Experiments are performed on a test set of 510 Japanese sentences which are not included in the ressource.","6","The BTEC phrasebooks have an average size of 824 lines with a standard deviation in size of 594 lines."]},{"title":"228","paragraphs":["0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Japanese BTEC Coefficients Occurrences 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 English BTEC Coefficients Occurrences Line level Phrasebook level Line level Phrasebook level Figure 1: Distributions of similarity coefficients at the sentence level (thin line) and at the phrasebook level (thick line), respectively for Japanese and English. 0 50 100 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 BLEU score (interpolated) 0 50 100 4 6 8 10 Percent of the original BTEC in size NIST score (interpolated) 0 50 100 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 mWER score (interpolated) Randomly selected data Homogeneous data Figure 2: BLEU, NIST and mWER scores for EBMT systems built on increasing amounts of randomly chosen and homogeneous BTEC data. These sentences shall first be used for language model perplexity estimation, then as input sentences for the EBMT system. The task is found to have a coefficient of I0 = 0.331. The average coefficient for a BTEC phrasebook being 0.330, the task is found to be particularly in the domain of the ressource. We examine the influence of training data size first on language model perplexity, then on the quality of translation from Japanese to English by an example-based MT system. 4.1.1 Language model perplexity","Even if perplexity does not always yield a high correlation with NLP systems performance, it is still an indicator of language model complexity as it gives an estimate of the average branching factor in a language model. The measure is popular in the NLP community because admittedly, when perplexity decreases, the performance of systems based on stochastic models tends to increase.","We compute perplexities of character language models built on variable amounts of training data first randomly taken from the Japanese part of the BTEC, and then selected around the expected task coefficient I0 (thresholds are determined by the amount of training data to be kept). Crossentropies are estimated on the test set, and all estimations are performed five times for the random data selections and averaged. Figure 3 shows the character perplexity values for increasing amounts of data from 0.5% to 100% of the BTEC and interpolated. As was expected, perplexity decreases as training data increases and tends to have an asymptotic behaviour when more data is being used as training."]},{"title":"229","paragraphs":["0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1000 5 10 15 20 25 30 Percent of the original BTEC in size Character perplexity (interpolated) Randomly selected data Homogeneous data Figure 3: Perplexity of character language models built on increasing amounts of randomly chosen BTEC and homogeneous Japanese data.","While homogeneous data yield lower perplexity scores for small amounts of training data (up to 15% of the ressource - roughly 1.5 Megabytes of data), beyond this value perplexity is slightly higher than for a model trained on randomly selected data. Except for the smaller amounts of data, there seems to be no benefit in using homogeneous rather than random heterogeneous training data for model perplexity. On the contrary, excessively restricting the domain seems to yield higher model perplexities.","4.1.2 Automatic evaluation of the translation quality","In this section we experiment on a Japanese to English grammar-based EBMT system, HPATR (described in (Imamura 2001)), which parses a bicorpus with grammars for both source and target language, and translates by automatically generating transfer patterns from bilingual trees constructed on the parsed data. Not being a MT system based on stochastic methods, it is used here as a task evaluation criterion complementary to language model perplexity. Systems are likewise constructed on variable amounts of training data, and evaluated on the previous task of 510 Japanese sentences, to be translated from Japanese to English.","Because it is not feasible here to have humans judge the quality of many sets of translated data, we rely on an array of well known automatic evaluation measures to estimate translation quality :","• BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) is the geometric mean of the n-gram precisions in the output with respect to a set of reference translations. It is bounded between 0 and 1, better scores indicate better translations, and it tends to be highly correlated with the fluency of outputs ;","• NIST (Doddington 2002) is a variant of BLEU based on the arithmetic mean of weighted n-gram precisions in the output with respect to a set of reference translations. It has a lower bound of 0, no upper bound, better scores indicate better translations, and it tends to be highly correlated with the adequacy of outputs ;","• mWER (Och 2003) or Multiple Word Error Rate is the edit distance in words between the system output and the closest reference translation in a set. It is bounded between 0 and 1, and lower scores indicate better translations.","Figure 2 shows BLEU, NIST and mWER scores for increasing amounts of data from 0.5% to 100% of the BTEC and interpolated. As was expected, MT quality increases as training data increases and tends to have an asymptotic behaviour when more data is being used in training. Here again except for the smaller amounts of data (up to 3% of the BTEC in BLEU, up to 18% in NIST and up to 2% in mWER), using the three evaluation methods, translation quality is equal or higher when using random heterogenous data. If we perform a mean comparison of the 510 paired score values assigned to sentences, for instance at 50% of training data, this difference is found to be statistically significant between BLEU, NIST, and mWER scores with confidence levels of 88.49%, 99.9%, and 73.24% respectively."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and future work","paragraphs":["The contribution of this work is twofold :","We describe a method of representing homogeneity according to a cross-entropic measure of similarity to reference sublanguages, that can be used to profile language ressources.

While (Cavaglià 2002) also acknowledged that for minimal sizes of training data, the best NLP system performance is reached with homogeneous ressources, we would like to know more precisely why and to what extent mixing In-Domain and Out-of-Domain data yields better accuracy. Concerning the representation of homogeneity, other experiments are needed to tackle the multidimensionality of sublanguage varieties less implicitly. We would like to consider multiple sublanguage references to untangle the dimensions of register variation in spoken and written language."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by the Na-tional Institute of Information and Communications Technology."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Douglas Biber. 1988.
