How to acquire accurate and effective information has become one of the great concerns among Internet users. Open-Domain Question Answering System (QA) has gain great popularities among scholars who care the above problem (Li, et al. 2002; Moldovan, et al. 2003; Zhang, et al. 2003), for QA can meet users’ demand by offering compact and accurate answers, rather than text with corresponding answers, to the questions presented in natural language. Therefore, it saves users’ great trouble to find out specific facts or figures from large quantity of texts.","The study of Question Classification (QC), as a new field, corresponds with the research of QA. QC is an essential part of QA, for to correctly answer users’ questions, the system has to know what the users are looking for, and it is QC that presents important searching clues for the system. QC can be defined to match a question to one or several classes in K category so as to determine the answer type. Every class presents some semantic restrictions on the answer searching, which serves QA with various strategies in locating the correct answer.","The result of QC can also serve QA in the answer selecting and extract, which influence the performance of QA directly. The first reason is that QC minish searching space. For example, if the system knows that the answer type to the question “Who was the first astronaut to walk in space?” is a person’s name, it can confine the answer in the names, rather than every word in the texts. The second reason is that QC can determine the searching strategies and knowledge base QA may need. For instance, the question “What county is California in?” needs the name of a country as its answer, so system needs the knowledge of countries’ name and name entities tagging to identify and testify the place name, while the question “What is Teflon?” expects an answer in a sentence or a fragment, in the form of Teflon is <.... >. In fact, almost all the QA have the QC module and QC is the one of the most important factors what determines the QA system performance (Moldovan, et al. 2003)."]},{"title":"64","paragraphs":["At present the studies on QC are mainly based on the text classification. Though QC is similar to TC in some aspects, they are clearly distinct in that Question is usually shorter, and contains less lexicon-based information than text, which brings great trouble to QC. Therefore to obtain higher classifying accuracy, QC has to make further analysis of sentences, namely QC has to extend interrogative sentence with syntactic and semantic knowledge, replacing or extending the vocabulary of the question with the semantic meaning of every words. In QC, many systems apply machine-learning approaches (Hovy, et al. 2002; Ittycheriah, et al. 2000; Zhang, et al. 2003). The classification is made according to the lexical, syntactic features and parts of speech. Machine learning approach is of great adaptability, and 90.0% of classifying accuracy is obtained with SVM method and tree Kernel as features. However, there is still the problem that the classifying result is affected by the accuracy of syntactic analyzer, which need manually to determine the weights of different classifying features. Some other systems adopting manual-rule method make QC, though may have high classifying accuracy, lack of adaptability, because regulation determination involves manual interference to solve the conflicts between regulations and to form orderly arranged rule base.","The paper combines statistic and rule classifiers, specifically statistics preceding regulation, to classify questions. With rule classifier as supplementary to statistic, the advantages of respective classifier can be given full play to, and therefore the overall performance of the classifier combination will be better than the single one. Moreover, as far as the QC task is concerned, the paper compares various classifier combinations, statistic-rule classifier, voting Adaboost and ANN. To represent questions, the paper uses dependency structure from Minipar (Lin 1998) and linguistic knowledge from Wordnet (Miller 1995; Miller, et al. 2003). In the following parts of the paper, classifying method and features is first introduced, and then comparisons are made between different type features and between feature combination methods. The comparisons are testified in experiments. The last part of the paper is about the conclusion of the present research and about the introduction of the further work to be done on this issue."]},{"title":"2 Classifying Features","paragraphs":["In machine learning method, every question should at first be transformed into a feature vector. Bag-of-word is one typical way of transforming questions, where every feature is one word in a corpus, whose value can be Boolean, showing whether the word is present in questions, and which can also be an integer or a real number, showing the presence frequency of the word. In this paper, every question is represented as a Boolean vector. 1. Bag-of-word: all lexical items in questions are taken as classifying features, because stop-word such as “what” and “is” playing a critical role in QC. 2. Wordnet Synsets: Wordnet was conceived as a machine-readable dictionary. In Wordnet, word form is represented by word spellings, and the sense is expressed by Synsets, and every synset stands for a concept. Wordnet shows both lexical and semantic relationships. The former exists between word forms, while the latter exists between concepts. Among various semantic relations in Wordnet, we choose hypernyms between nouns as our only concern. The classifying features are the senses of the nouns in the sentences and synsets of their hypernyms. 3. N-gram: the model is founded on a hypothesis that the presence of a word is only relevant to the n words before it. The frequently used are Bi-gram and Tri-gram, and Bi-gram is chosen as the classifying features in the present research. Compared with word, Bi-gram model investigates two historical records, and reflects the partial law of language. It embodies the features of word order, and therefore it can reflect the theme of the sentence more strongly. 4. Dependency 6tructure: Minipar is a syntactic analyzer, which can analyze the dependency relation of words in sentences. It describes the syntactic relationships between words in sentences. Such relation is direction-oriented, semantically rather than spatially, namely one word governs, or is governed by, another concerning their syntactic relation. In one sentence (W1W2...Wn), compared with Bi-gram, Dependency structure concerns"]},{"title":"65","paragraphs":["WiWj but not need limitation j= i+1. Obviously, Dependency Relation goes further than Bi-gram in language understanding. Dependency structure is specified by a list of labeled tuples. The format of a labeled tuple is as follows: label (word pos root governor rel exinfo ) “Label” is a label assigned to the tuple. If the tuple represents a word in the sentence, label should be the index of the word in the sentence. “Word” is a word in the input sentence. “Pos” is the part of speech. “Root” is the root form. “Governor” if the label of the governor of word (if it has one), “rel” is type of dependency relationship, and “exinfo” for extra information. Minipar output is represented by the word dependency relationship via “governor”. Though only 79% of recall and some word relations fail to be analyzed, the accuracy reaches 89%, which guarantees that a large proportion of dependency relations from the output are correct. And the experiment proves that Dependency structure has more classify precision than Bi-gram as classifying feature. For example, as to the question “Which company created the Internet browser Mosaic?” Minipar may produce the following results: E0 (() fin C * ) 1 (Which ~ Det 2 det (gov company)) 2 (company ~ N E0 whn (gov fin)) 3 (created create V E0 i (gov fin)) E2 (() company N 3 subj (gov create) (antecedent 2))","","According to the tuple, we can get dependency relationships between words in sentences. tuple 1 (Which ~ Det 2 det gov company) shows us the det relationship between “which” and “company” in the sentence. Therefore, we can get a words-pair which company, and likewise other five pairs of words can be obtained company create the Mosaic (Internet Mosaic) (browser Mosaic) (create Mosaic), which will be the item of vector represented the question."]},{"title":"3 Classifying Method Description 3.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM)","paragraphs":["SVM is a kind of machine learning approach based on statistic learning theory. SVM are linear functions of the form f (x) = <w•x> +b, where <w•x> is the inner product between the weight vector w and the input vector x. The SVM can be used as a classifier by setting the class to 1 if f(x) > 0 and to -1 otherwise. The main idea of SVM is to select a hyperplane that separates the positive and negative examples while maximizing the minimum margin, where the margin for example xi is yi f(x) and yi >-1,1] is the target output. This corresponds to minimizing <w•w> subject to yi (<w•x> +b) for all i. Large margin classifiers are known to have good generalization properties. An adaptation of the LIBSVM implementation (Chang, et al. 2001) is used in the following. Four type of kernel function linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid are provided by LIBSVM ."]},{"title":"3.2 SVM-TBL QC Algorithm","paragraphs":["TBL has been a part of NLP since Eric Brill’s breakthrough paper in 1995(Brill 1995), which has been as effective as any other approach on the Part-of-Speech Tagging problem. TBL is a true machine learning technique. Given a tagged training corpus, it produces a sequence of rules that serves as a model of the training data. Then, to derive the appropriate tags, each rule may be applied, in order, to each instance in an untagged corpus.","TBL generates all of the potential rules that would make at least one tag in the training corpus correct. For each potential rule, its improvement score is defined to be the number of correct tags in the training corpus after applying the rule minus the number of correct tags in the training corpus before applying the rule. The potential rule with the highest improvement score is output as the next rule in the final model and applied to the entire training corpus. This process repeats (using the updated tags on the training corpus), producing one rule for each pass through the training corpus until no rule can be found with an improvement score that surpasses some predefined threshold.

At first, questions are represented by Bag-of-word, Wordnet Synsets, Bi-gram, and Dependency structure, and are classified by the same samples and same SVM. Then output of SVM is transformed to the input of TBL, and thus every sample in TBL training data is featured by four-dimensioned vectors, from which a new is obtained as training data of TBL. When the errors produced in initial marking process are corrected in TBL to the greatest extent, a final-classifier is produced as follows (Figure1).
