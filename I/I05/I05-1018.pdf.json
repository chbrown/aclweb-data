This paper describes a method of adapting a domain-independent HPSG parser to a biomedical domain. Without modifying the grammar and the probabilistic model of the original HPSG parser, we develop a log-linear model with additional features on a treebank of the biomedical domain. Since the treebank of the target domain is limited, we need to exploit an original disambiguation model that was trained on a larger treebank. Our model incorporates the original model as a reference probabilistic distribution. The experimental results for our model trained with a small amount of a treebank demonstrated an improvement in parsing accuracy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Natural language processing (NLP) is being demanded in various fields, such as biomedical research, patent application, and WWW, because an unmanageable amount of information is being published in unstructured data, i.e., natural language texts. To exploit latent information in these, the assistance of NLP technologies is highly required. However, an obstacle is the lack of portability of NLP tools. In general, NLP tools specialized to each domain were developed from scratch, or adapted by considerable human effort. This is because linguistic resources for each domain, such as a treebank, have not been sufficiently developed yet. Since dealing with various kinds of domains is an almost intractable job, sufficient resources can not be expected.","The method presented in this paper is the development of disambiguation models of an HPSG parser by combining a disambiguation model of an original parser with a new model adapting to a new domain. Although the training of a disambiguation model of a parser requires a sufficient amount of a treebank, its construction requires a considerable human effort. Hence, we exploit the original disambiguation model that was trained with a larger, but domain-independent treebank. Since the original disambiguation model contains rich information of general grammatical constraints, we try to use its information in developing a disambiguation model for a new domain. R.

Tsujii","Our disambiguation model is a log-linear model into which the original disambiguation model is incorporated as a reference distribution. However, we cannot simply estimate this model, because of the problem that has been discussed in studies of the probabilistic modeling of unification-based grammars [1,2]. That is, the exponential explosion of parse candidates assigned by the grammar makes the estimation intractable. The previous studies solved the problem by applying a dynamic programming algorithm to a packed representation of parse trees. In this paper, we borrow their idea, and define reference distribution on a packed structure. With this method, the log-linear model with a reference distribution can be estimated by using dynamic programming.","In the experiments, we used an HPSG parser originally trained with the Penn Treebank [3], and evaluated a disambiguation model trained with the GENIA treebank [4], which consisted of abstracts of biomedical papers. First, we measured the accuracy of parsing and the time required for parameter estimation. For comparison, we also examined other possible models other than our disambiguation model. Next, we varied the size of a training corpus in order to evaluate the size sufficient for domain adaptation. Then, we varied feature sets used for training and examined the parsing accuracy. Finally, we compared the errors in the parsing results of our model with those of the original parser.","In Section 2, we introduce the disambiguation model of an HPSG parser. In Section 3, we describe a method of adopting reference distribution for adapting a probabilistic disambiguation model to a new domain. In Section 4, we examine our method through experiments on the GENIA treebank."]},{"title":"2AnHPSGParser","paragraphs":["The HPSG parser used in this study is Enju [5]. The grammar of Enju was extracted from the Penn Treebank [3], which consisted of sentences collected from The Wall Street Journal [6]. The disambiguation model of Enju was trained on the same treebank. This means that the parser has been adapted to The Wall Street Journal, and would be difficult to apply to other domains such as biomedical papers that include different distribution of words and their constraints.","In this study, we attempted the adaptation of a probabilistic disambiguation model by fixing the grammar and the disambiguation model of the original parser. The disambiguation model of Enju is based on a feature forest model [2], which is a maximum entropy model [7] on packed forest structure. The probability, pE(t|s), of producing the parse result t for a given sentence s is defined as pE(t|s)= 1 Zs exp ( ∑ i λifi(t, s) ) Zs = ∑ t′ ∈T (s) exp ( ∑ i","λifi(t′ ,s)) , Adapting a Probabilistic Disambiguation Model of an HPSG Parser 201 Fig. 1. Chart for parsing “he saw a girl with a telescope” where T (s) is the set of parse candidates assigned to s. The feature function fi(t, s) represents the characteristics of t and s, while the corresponding model parameter λi is its weight. Model parameters were estimated so as to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data.","Estimation of the above model requires a set of training pairs ⟨ts,T(s)⟩,where ts is the correct parse for the sentence s. While ts is provided by a treebank, T (s) is computed by parsing each s inthetreebank.However,thesimpleenumeration of T (s) is impractical because the size of T (s) is exponential to the length of s.","To avoid an exponential explosion, Enju represented T (s)inapackedformof HPSG parse trees [5]. In chart parsing, partial parse candidates are stored in a chart, in which phrasal signs are identified and packed into an equivalence class if they are determined to be equivalent and dominate the same word sequence. A set of parse trees is then represented as a set of relations among equivalence classes. Figure 1 shows a chart for parsing “hesawagirlwithatelescope”,where the modifiee (“saw” or “girl”)of“with” is ambiguous. Each feature structure expresses an equivalence class, and the arrows represent immediate-dominance relations. The phrase, “sawagirlwithatelescope”, has two ambiguous subtrees (A in the figure). Since the signs of the top-most nodes are equivalent, they are packed into the same equivalence class. The ambiguity is represented as two pairs of arrows that come out of the node.","A packed chart can be interpreted as an instance of a feature forest [2]. A feature forest represents a set of exponentially-many trees in an “and/or” graph of a tractable size. A feature forest is formally defined as a tuple ⟨C, D, R, γ, δ⟩, where C is a set of conjunctive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, R ⊆ C is a set of root nodes1",", γ : D → 2C","is a conjunctive daughter function, and δ : C → 2D","is a disjunctive daughter function. 1 For the ease of explanation, the definition of root node is slightly different from the original. 202 T.

As discussed in Section 2, the size of T (s) is exponentially related to the length of s. This imposes a new problem, that is, we need to enumerate p0(t|s) for all candidate parses.

Since the treebank of the new domain was limited, we exploited an original disambiguation model. The new model was trained on a biomedical treebank, and was combined with the original model by using it as a reference distribution of a log-linear model. The experimental results demonstrated our new model was adapted to the target domain, and was superior to other adaptation methods in accuracy and the cost of training time. With our model, the parsing accuracy for the target domain improved by 1.77 point with the treebank of 3,524 sentences. Since the accuracy did not seem to saturate, we will further improve the accuracy by increasing the size of the domain-dependent treebank. In addition, the experimental results showed that the WORD feature significantly contributed to the accuracy improvement.","We examined only a few feature templates, and we must search for further more feature templates. Not only the new combinations of the atomic features but also new types of features, which may be domain-dependent such as named entities, will be possible."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1.
