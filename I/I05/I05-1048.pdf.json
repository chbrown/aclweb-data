This paper proposes a lexicon-constrained character model that combines both word and character features to solve complicated issues in Chinese morphological analysis. A Chinese character-based model constrained by a lexicon is built to acquire word building rules. Each character in a Chinese sentence is assigned a tag by the proposed model. The word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging results are then generated based on the character tags. The proposed method solves such problems as unknown word identification, data sparseness, and estimation bias in an integrated, unified framework. Preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms the best SIGHAN word segmentation systems in the open track on 3 out of the 4 test corpora. Additionally, our method can be conveniently integrated with any other Chinese morphological systems as a post-processing module leading to significant improvement in performance."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Chinese morphological analysis is a fundamental problem that has been studied extensively [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Researchers make use of word or character features to cope with this problem. However, neither of them seems completely satisfactory.","In general, a simple word-based approach can achieve about 90% accuracy for segmentation with a medium-size dictionary. However, since no dictionary includes every Chinese word, the unknown word (or Out Of Vocabulary, OOV) problem [9], [10] can severely affect the performance of word-based approaches. Furthermore, word-based models have an estimation bias when faced with segmentation candidates with different numbers of words. For example, in the standard hidden Markov model, the best result,"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["= −== n i iiii","TT tttptwpWTpT 1 11* )...|()|(maxarg)|( maxarg , is related to the number of the words in the segmentation candidates. As such, a candidate with fewer words is preferred over those with more words in the selection process. Therefore, most word-based models are likely to fail when a combinational ambiguity1","sequence is separated into multiple words.  1 A typical segmentation ambiguity, it refers to a situation in which the same Chinese sequence may be one word or several words in different contexts. A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphological Analysis 543","Compared with Chinese words, Chinese characters are relatively less unambiguous. The Chinese character set is very limited. Therefore, unknown characters occur rarely in a sentence. The grammatical advantages of characters have inspired researchers to adopt character features in Chinese morphology and parsing [5], [6], [11], [12]. However, it is difficult to incorporate necessary word features, such as the form of a Chinese word and its fixed part-of-speech tags, in most character-based approaches. For this reason, character-based approaches have not achieved satisfactory performance in large-scale open tests.","In this paper, we propose a lexicon-constrained character model to combine the merits of both approaches. We explore how to capture the Chinese word building rules using a statistical method, which reflects the regularities in the word formation process. First, a character hidden Markov method assigns the candidate tags to each character. Next, a large-size word list combined with linguistic information is used to filter out erroneous candidates. Finally, segmentation and part-of-speech tagging for the sentence are provided based on the character tags.","The proposed model solves the problems of unknown word detection, word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging using both word and character features. Additionally, our module is a post-processing module, which can be coupled to any existing Chinese morphological system; and it can readily recall some of the unknown words omitted by the system, and as a result, significantly improves the overall performance. Evaluations of the proposed system on SIGHAN open test sets indicate that our method outperforms the best bakeoff results on 3 test sets, and ranks 2nd","in the 4th"," test set [9]."]},{"title":"2 A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphology 2.1 An Elementary Model to Describe Chinese Word Building Rules","paragraphs":["It is recognized that there are some regularities in the process of forming words from Chinese characters. This in general can be captured by word building rules. In this paper, we explore a statistical model to acquire such rules. The following are some definitions used in the proposed model.","[Def. 1] character position feature","We use four notations to denote the position of a character in a Chinese word. ‘F’ means the first character of the word, ‘L’ the last character, ‘M’ is a character within it and ‘S’ the word itself.","[Def. 2] character tag set","It is the product of the set of character position features and the set of part-of-speech tags.","Character tag set ={xy| setwordx POS ∈ , },,,{ LMFSy ∈ }, where, x denotes one part-of-speech (POS) tag and y a character position feature.

Meng, H. Yu, and F. Nishino","Word building rules are acquired based on the relation between the character and the corresponding character tag. Word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging can be achieved easily based on the result of character tagging. For example, a character with ‘xS’ is a single character word with the part-of-speech tag ‘x’; a character sequence starting with ‘xF’ and ending with ‘xL’ is a multiple character word with the part-of-speech tag ‘x’.","The elementary model adopts the character bi-gram hidden Markov model.

Also we adopted a 100,000-word dictionary listing all valid part-of-speech tags for each Chinese word in the training phase to solve the data sparseness problem. The training data are converted into character tagging data through the following steps: a single character word with ‘x’ is converted into the character marked with tag ‘xS’; a two-character word with ‘x’ is converted into a first character with ‘xF’ and a second character with ‘xL’; a word with more than two characters with ‘x’ are converted into a first character with ‘xF’, middle characters with ‘xM’ and last character with ‘xL’. We adopt the POS tag set from the People's Daily Corpus, which consists of 46 tags. Taking into account of the four position features, the final character tag set is comprised of 184 tags.","The emitted probability and transition probability of the model are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The emitted probability is counted by the training Corpus and the dictionary, where the Chinese words in the dictionary are counted one time. The transition probability is trained from the training Corpus only. 2.2 An Improved Character-Based Model Using Lexicon Constraints We tested the above model based on the SIGHAN open test set [9]. The average precision for word segmentation was more than 88%. This means that most of the word building rules in Chinese have been obtained by the elementary model. However, the performance was relatively inferior to other word segmentation systems. It indicated that the model needed more features to learn word building rules. In error analysis, we found that the elementary model was so flexible that it produced many pseudo-words and invalid part-of-speech tags. In practice, a Chinese word is a stable sequence of Chinese characters, whose formation and part-of-speech tags are fixed by long-term usage. It seemed that only character position and meaning cannot describe a word building rule effectively.","We also observed that word segmentation systems based on a simple dictionary matching algorithm and a few linguistic rules could achieve about 90% accuracy [14]. This suggested that a lexicon may have contribution to word building rules. Thus, we tried to incorporate a lexicon to the model to improve the performance. A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphological Analysis 545","The major errors in the elementary model were pseudo words and invalid part-of-speech (POS) tags. We proposed two constraints based on the lexicon to deal with these errors:","1. If a possible word produced from the elementary model is in the word-dictionary, the character tag of the characters forming this word should be consistent with the part-of-speech tag of the word in the dictionary.","2. If a possible word produced is not in the dictionary, it must include one or more single characters, and none of which may be subsumed by any word in the dictionary in the current context.","The first constraint eliminates invalid character tags. For example, the character ‘ ’ has six character tags: ‘aF’ (first in adjective) , ‘dF’ (first in adverb), ‘nF’ (first in noun), ‘nrF’ (first in person name), ‘tF’ (first in time), and ‘vF’ (first in verb). The character ‘ ’ has five character tags: ‘dL’, ‘nL’, ‘nrL’, ‘tL’, and ‘vL’. The combination of the two characters produces the possible word ‘ ’, which includes five possible word part-of-speech tags: ‘d’, ‘n’, ‘nr’, ‘t’, and ‘v’ based on these character tags. But ‘ ’ is a word in the dictionary, which only has two valid part-of-speech tags, namely, ‘time’ and ‘person name’. Obviously, the part-of-speech tags: ‘d’, ‘n’ and ‘v’ of ‘ ’ are invalid. Accordingly, the tags ‘aF’, ‘dF’, ‘nF’ , ‘vF’ on ‘ ’ and the tags ‘dL’, ‘nL’, ‘vL’ on ‘ ’ are also invalid. So they should be pruned from the candidates of the character tagging.","The second constraint prunes pseudo words in the elementary model. Many studies in dictionary-based segmentation treat unknown words as sequences of single characters [1], [14]. The second constraint ensures that the new word produced by the elementary model must have one or more ‘unattached’ single characters (not subsumed by any other words). For example, the sequence ‘ ’ (program error) will combine the pseudo word ‘ ’ because of the tag ‘nF’ on ‘ ’ and the tag ‘nL’ on ‘ ’. The second constraint will prune ‘ ’ since ‘ ’ (program) and ‘ ’ (error) are already in the dictionary and there is no “unattached” single character in it. Accordingly, the tag ‘nF’ on ‘ ’ and the tag ‘nL’ on ‘ ’ will be deleted from the candidates of character tagging.","The following experiments show the lexicon-based constraints are very effective in eliminating error cases. The elementary model faces an average of 9.3 character tags for each character. The constraints will prune 70% of these error tags from it. As a result, the performance of character tagging is improved.","It is worth noting that the lexicon in the elementary model cannot distort the probability of the character tagging results in the model. The pruned cases are invalid cases which cannot occur in the training data because all the words and POS tags in the training data are valid. Thus, the model built from the training data is not affected by the pruning process. 2.3 Case Study In this subsection, we illustrate the advantages of the proposed method for Chinese morphology with an example. 546 Y.

For example, the character tags in ‘ ’ combine four possible unknown words: ‘ ’, ‘ ’, ‘ ’ , and ‘ ’.","Step 2: Prune the invalid candidates using constraints.","The first constraint prunes some invalid character tags. For example, ‘ ’ can be either an adverb (d) or a personal name (nr); ‘ ’ is a time (t) word. The other part-of-speech tags of these two words will be deleted. With the second constraint, we can delete ‘ ’ because ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ are words in the dictionary. However, ‘ ’ , ‘ ’, and ‘ ’ will be kept because ‘ ’ is a “unattached” single character. The remaining candidates are shown in figure 2. aF dF nF nrF nM nrM nsM qM vM aL dL vL aS dF nrF nM lM tM aS tF nM lM tM dL nrL aS nF tF nrM nrL tL  Fig. 2. Remaining Candidates for the sequence ‘ ’ Step 3: Choose the best character tagging result based on the proposed character hidden Markov model. The best character tagging result is chosen using equation 2 in Section 2.1. The ambiguities in segmentation and word POS tagging are solved in the character tagging process. Consider the combinational ambiguity ‘ ’ in the following 2 candidates: Candidate 1: ‘ /nr /t /d /d /n /n /v /v’ Candidate 2: ‘ /nr /t /v /n /n /v /v’ A Lexicon-Constrained Character Model for Chinese Morphological Analysis 547","In word-based linear model, the erroneous candidate 2 will be prior to the correct candidate 1 since the model counts 9 nodes in candidate 1 but 8 nodes in candidate 2. However, there is no such bias in the character model because the number of characters does not change. The combinational ambiguity ‘ ’ will be denoted as ‘ /dS /dS’ or ‘ /vF /vL’. The number of nodes in all candidates of character tagging is the same.","At last, the correct result ‘ /nrF /nrL /tF /tL /dS /dS /nF /nL /nF /nL /vF /vL /vF /vL’ is selected, and the corresponding morphological result is: ‘ /nr /t /d /d /n /n /v /v ’.","The above steps show the proposed approach solves the various issues related to Chinese morphology by a concise character tagging process where word building is revealed."]},{"title":"3 Experiments and Discussion","paragraphs":["We evaluated the proposed character method using the SIGHAN Backoff data, i.e. the one-month People's Daily Corpus of 1998, and the first version of Penn Chinese Treebank [15]. We compared our approach against two state-of-the-art systems: one is based on a bi-gram word segmentation model [7], and the other based on a word-based hidden Markov model [3]. For simplicity, we only considered three kinds of unknown words (personal name, location name, and organization name) in the all methods.","The same corpus and word-dictionary were used to train the above three systems. The training data set was the 5-month People's Daily Corpus of 1998, which contained approximately 6,300,000 words and 46 word part-of-speech tags. The system dictionary contained 100,000 words and the valid part-of-speech tag(s) of each word. On average, there were 1.3 part-of-speech tags for a word in the dictionary.","In the following, chr-HMM refers to the proposed elementary model; chr-HMM+Dic refers to the character model improved by integrating linguistic information. W-Bigram is the word-based bi-gram system, and W-HMM is the word-based hidden Markov system. 3.1 Morphological Experimental Results We examined the performance of our model in comparison against W-Bigram and W-HMM. Table 1 compares the segmentation performance of our model against that of other models. Table 2 shows the accuracy in unknown word identification. Table 3 illustrates the performance of the part-of-speech tagging. The experiments in Table 1 and Table 2 were examined using the SIGHAN open test corpora. The experiments in Table 3 were performed again on the one-month People's Daily Corpus (PD corpus) and 4,000 sentences in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Penn CTB). We only examined 4 major word categories in the Penn Chinese Treebank due to inconsistency in the part-of-speech tag sets between the two corpora. The 4 major word categories were: noun (shown as NN, NR in Penn CTB; n, nr, ns, nz in PD corpus), verb (VV in Penn CTB; v, vd, vn in PD corpus), adjective (JJ in Penn CTB; a, ad, an in PD corpus) and adverb (AD in Penn CTB; d in PD corpus). 548 Y. Meng, H. Yu, and F. Nishino","Segmentation and word POS tagging performance is measured in precision (P%), recall (R%) and F-score (F). Unknown words (NW) are those words not found in our word-dictionary, which include named entities and other new words. The unknown word rate (NW-Rate), the precision on unknown words (NW-Precision) and recall on total unknown words (NW-Recall) are given by: NW-Rate= identifiedNW of # total rdsunknown wo of # NW-Precision = identifiedNW of # total rdsunknown wo validof # ","NW-Recall = data in testingNW of # total rdunknown wo validof # ","Table 1 shows that the above three systems achieve similar performances on the PK testing corpus. All of them were trained by the People's Daily corpus. For this reason, their performances were similar when the testing data had similar styles. But for other texts, the proposed character model performed much better than the word-based models in both recall and precision. This indicated that our approach performed better for unseen data.","Table 2 shows that our method for unknown word identification also outperforms the word-based method. We notice that word-based approaches and character-based approaches have similar precision on unknown word identification, however word-based approaches have much lower recall than character-based ones. The main reason for this is that word-based systems focus only on unknown words with proper word structures, but cannot recognize newly generated words, rare words, and other new words unlisted in the dictionary. A very high proportion of these types of unknown word in the SIGHAN testing data affects the recall of the word-based methods on unknown words. The experiments reveal that our method could effectively identify all kinds of new words. This is because our model has defined word building rules for all kinds of words.","Without a widely recognized testing standard, it is very hard to evaluate the performance on part-of-speech tagging. The results in Penn Chinese Treebank was better than that in the People's Daily Corpus since we examined all 42 POS tags in the People's Daily Corpus, but we only tested four major POS tags in Penn Chinese Treebank. Our approach is better than the word-based method for two test data sets. However, we could not conclude that our method was superior to the word-based method because of the limited testing approaches and testing data. A thorough empirical comparison among different approaches should be investigated in the future. Table 1.

In this subsection, we show how existing word segmentation systems could be improved using chr-HMM.","Given a segmentation result, we assume that unidentified new words may be a sequence of unattached characters. That is, all multiple-character words in the given result are considered correct, while single words, which might include unidentified new words will be rechecked by the chr-HMM. The entire process involves 3 steps:","1. Only character tags that are consistent with the position of the character in the word are listed for multi-character words.","2. The unattached characters are tagged with all possible character tags. In this way, the original segmentation result is converted into a group of character tagging candidates.","3. We then input these character tagging candidates into the chr-HMM to select the best one. 550 Y. Meng, H. Yu, and F.

The chr-HMM will list all possible character tags for these “unattached” characters. The parts outside the brackets are multiple-character words identified by the original system. They are assumed correct and maintain also positional information. Only the character tags, which are consistent with the positions of the character in the word are listed.
