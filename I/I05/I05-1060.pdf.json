Katakana, Japanese phonogram mainly used for loan words, is a trou-blemaker in Japanese word segmentation. Since Katakana words are heavily domain-dependent and there are many Katakana neologisms, it is almost impossible to construct and maintain Katakana word dictionary by hand.

Words are basic unit to assign syntactic/semantic information manually, basic unit to acquire knowledge based on frequencies and co-occurrences, and basic unit to access texts in Information Retrieval.","Languages with explicit word boundaries, like white spaces in English, do not suffer from this issue so severely, though it is a bit troublesome to handle compounds and hyphenation appropriately. On the other hand, languages without explicit boundaries such as Japanese always suffer from this issue. Japanese character set and their usage. Here, we briefly explain Japanese character set and their usage. Japanese uses about 6,000 ideogram, Kanji characters, 83 phonogram, Hiragana, and another 86 phonogram, Katakana.","Kanji is used for Japanese time-honored nouns (including words imported from China ancient times) and stems of verbs and adjectives; Hiragana is used for function words such as postpositions and auxiliary verbs, and endings of verbs and adjectives; Katakana is used for loan words, mostly from the West, as transliterations.","Japanese is very active to naturalize loan words. Neologisms in special/technical domains are often transliterated into Katakana words without translations, or even if there are translations, Katakana transliterations are more commonly used in many cases. For example, , transliteration of “computer” is more commonly used than the translation, (keisanki).","Even for some time-honored Japanese nouns, both Japanese nouns and translitera-tions of their English translations are used together these days, and the use of Automatic Acquisition of Basic Katakana Lexicon from a Given Corpus 683 translit-erations is increasing, such as , transliteration of “desk work” vs. (tsukue shigoto). Furthermore, some Japanese nouns, typically the names of animals, plants, and food, which can be written in Kanji or Hiragana, are also written in Katakana sometimes [4, 6]. Word segmentation and Katakana words. Let us go back to the word segmentation issue. Japanese word segmentation is performed like this: Japanese words are registered into the dictionary; given an input sentence, all possible words embedded in the sentence and their connections are checked by looking up the dictionary and some connectivity grammar; then the most plausible word sequence is selected. The criteria of selecting the best word sequence were simple heuristic rules preferring longer words in earlier times, and some cost calculation based on manual rules or using some training data, these days.","Such a segmentation process is in practice not so difficult for Kanji-Hiragana string. First of all, since Kanji words and Hiragana words are fairly stable excepting proper nouns, they are most perfectly registered in the dictionary. Then, the orthogonal usage of Kanji and Hiragana mentioned above makes the segmentation rather simple, as follows:  (Kare wa daigaku ni kayou) he postp. Univ. postp. go Kanji compound words can cause a segmentation problem. However, since large num-ber of Kanji characters lead fairly sparse space of Kanji words, most Kanji compounds can be segmented unambiguously.","A real troublemaker is Katakana words, which are sometimes very long compounds such as “extra vergin olive oil” and “Japan cup cycle road race”. As mentioned above, many neologisms are written in Katakana, it is almost impossible to register all or most Katakana words into a dictionary by hand. To handle such an insufficiency of a dictionary, conventional Japanese word segmentation incorporates a fall-safe method, which considers a whole continuous Katakana string as a word, when it is neither a registered-word, nor a combination of registered-words. And, Japanese word segmentation basically prefers longer registered words. These mechanism leads that, for example, the Katakana string “tomato sauce” is properly segmented to “tomato” and “sauce”, only when and are in the dictionary and is not. When alone is in the dictionary (means an imperfect dictionary) or is in the dictionary (means a redundant dictionary), is regarded as one word.","Considering the importance of words as a basic unit of NLP, it is quite problematic to handle as a single word. We cannot use information that is a kind of , which is very important for deeper/semantic processing of texts; a text including cannot be retrieved with the word or . Note that a rough treatment using partial string matching causes a tragedy that (rissu) “resource” matches “sauce” and (suraisu) “slice” matches (raisu)“rice” and (isu)“chair”!","To solve this severe problem, this paper proposes a method of constructing precise and concise Japanese Katakana word dictionary, by automatically judging a given T. Nakazawa, D. Kawahara, and S. Kurohashi 684 Katakana string is a single-word or compound, and registering only single-words to the dictionary. We suppose only a medium or large size of Japanese corpus is given, and Katakana strings and their frequencies in the corpus are extracted as follows. We call this data as a word-occurrence data hereafter. (rmen):28727 “noodle” (spu):20808 “soup” (resipi):16436 “recipe (kar):15151 “curry” (meny ):14766 “menu” (esunikku):14190 “ethnic” (sarada):13632 “salad” (toppu):11642 “top” (tomatossu):11641 “tomato sauce” ... (tomato):7887 “tomato” ... (ssu):7570 “sauce” ... Our proposed method consists of the following three methods, which utilize only a word-occurrence data and publicly available resources:1 − A method using a Japanese-English dictionary. − A method using a huge English corpus and a Japanese-English dictionary. − A method using relation in a word-occurrence data.","Since most Katakana words are transliterations of English words, we exploit Japanese-English translation information as much as possible, using a Japanese-English dictio-nary and a huge English corpus. Since these methods, however, cannot achieve high-recall, the third method uses a word-occurrence data itself: a Katakana word is regarded as a compound if it is a combination of other, frequent Katakana words in the word-occurrence data. These three methods vary from high-precision to high-recall, and their appropriate combination leads to high-precision, high-recall analysis.","We explain these three methods in detail, and then report the experimental results and discussion."]},{"title":"2 A Method Using a Japanese-English Dictionary","paragraphs":["The first method utilizes a Japanese-English dictionary, judging some Katakana words as compounds and others as single-words. Words that are judged here will not be pro-cessed by the next two methods.","The basic idea using a dictionary is as follows. Suppose the input word is and the dictionary provides the following information: 1 There are some Katakana words that are not loan words, such as the names of animals, plants and food. We deal with these words as single-words exceptionally, if they are registered in a Japanese dictionary. Automatic Acquisition of Basic Katakana Lexicon from a Given Corpus 685 = tomato sauce = tomato = sauce","If the translation of the input word consists of multi-words and those words correspond to Katakana substrings just enough based on the dictionary information, the input word is considered as a compound. In the case of the above example, is divided into + by these criteria.","On the other hand, if the translation of the input word is one word in the dictionary, it is considered as a single-word (that is, the other two methods are not applied to the input word any more), like the following example: (sandowicchi) = sandwich","The Japanese-English dictionary can be used in such a straightforward way. In prac-tice, however, we handle some exceptional cases more carefully as follows:","− When the dictionary provides multi-word translation for an input, and all of them are capitalized, the input is regarded as a proper noun and treated as a single-word. (Buenosuairesu) = Buenos Aires (Mirukwei) = Milky Way (Sazankurosu) = Southern Cross","− When the dictionary provides multi-word translation for an input, but the alignment of translation words and Katakana substrings fails, still if the final translation word corresponds to the Katakana suffix-string, the input is regarded as a compound, as follows: (Morunessu) = Mornay sauce = sauce (sumkuhamu) = smoked ham (hamu) = ham","− The judgment of being a single-word is invalidated, when the translation corre-sponds to only a partial Katakana string by another dictionary entry as follows: (shifonkki) = chiffon (shifon) = chiffon (kyacchibru) = catch (kyacchi) = catch and are not disposed in this method and transfered to the next methods.

Kurohashi 686"]},{"title":"3 A Method Using a Huge English Corpus and a Japanese-English Dictionary","paragraphs":["A dictionary contains only basic compounds, but there are many more Katakana compounds in real texts. That is, the direct use of dictionary is not enough to handle real Katakana compounds.","Therefore, we have developed a method which utilizes a Japanese-English dictionary to get a basic translation relation, and judges whether a Katakana string is a compound or not by referring to a huge English corpus.","Given an input Katakana string, all possible segmentations to Katakana words registered in the Japanese-English dictionary are detected, and those words are translated into English words. Then, the frequencies of those possible English translations are checked by referring to a huge English corpus, and the most frequent translation is selected as a resultant segmentation. As an English corpus, we use the web, and the hit number of a search engine is used as the frequency.","Forexample, (paserissu) can be segmented in two ways, and the first segmentation can have two different translations, totaling to the three possible translation as follows: (paseri)+ (ssu) parsley source:554 (paseri)+ (ssu) parsley sauce:20600 (pase)+ (rissu) pase resource:3","The web search shows that the second translation, “parsley sauce” is by far the most frequent, supporting is a compound + .","The important issue is how much we believe the frequency of the web. Some web pages are very messy, and even inappropriate segmentation and its mad translation has some frequency in the web, as follows: (demi)+ (gurasu) demi glass:207 (ban)+ (banji ̄ ) van bungee:159 In order to exclude such inappropriate segmentations, we need to set up some","threshold to accept the segmentation. Considering that the longer the Katakana word is,","the more probable it is a compound, we set the following threshold:","C/NL",", where L denotes the length of the Katakana word, and C and N are constant, optimized using some development data set."]},{"title":"4 A Method Using Relation in a Word-Occurrence Data","paragraphs":["Though the method using an English corpus is reliable and accurate, it can be applied only when the constituent words are in the dictionary, and the compound is a natural term in English. However, some neologisms and some words that are not usually written in Katakana are not registered in the dictionary. Furthermore, there are many Automatic Acquisition of Basic Katakana Lexicon from a Given Corpus 687 Japanese-made English-like compounds like “gasoline stand” (means “service station”), which are rarely found in native English corpus.","To handle such cases robustly, we try to find compounds only based on the infor-mation in a word-occurrence data. For example, if and are sufficiently frequent in the word-occurrence data, we consider as a compound, + .","Again, we have to carefully design the threshold to accept the segmentation. Since the word-occurrence data contains very many varieties of Katakana strings, most single-words can be somehow divided into two or more Katakana strings. For example, even (itarian) “Italian” can be divided into ita)+ (rian).","Then, we established the basic criteria as follows: if the geometric mean of fre-quencies of possible constituent words (Fg) is larger than the frequency of the original Katakana word (Fo), then we accept the segmentation. Similar to the method using an English corpus, considering that the longer the Katakana word is, the more probable it is a compound, we modified the condition as follows:","Fo<F′g, F′g = Fg/(C/Nl + α) where l denotes the average length of constituent words (equal to the length of the Katakana word divided by the number of constituent words), C, N and α are constant, optimized using some development data set. α is a term to provide the upper bound of F′g when l becomes large.","When there are segmentations into different number of words, the coarse segmenta-tion, that is, the segmentation into a small number of words is selected. When there are two or more possible segmentations into the same number of words, that of the largest Fg is selected.","Here are some examples in the cooking corpus (the details of this corpus are de-scribed in Section 6.1):","(itarianresutoran):207 ↔ (itarian):1421 + (resutoran):7922 (Fg = 3355)","(supaisuraisu):3 ↔ (supai):9 + (suraisu):2000 (Fg = 134) ↔ (supaisu):2203 + (raisu):980 (Fg = 1896)","(itarian):421 ↔ (ita):91 + (rian):11 (Fg = 31) ↔ (itari):7 + (an):301 (Fg = 45)","“Italian restaurant” and “spice rice” are not segmented by the English corpus method, because is not registered in the Japanese-English dictionary, and “spice rice” does not occur frequently (though “spicy rice” is frequent).

Since the Japanese segmentation program JUMAN[4] selects the segmentation with the minimum cost, this cost assignment is consistent with the segmentation selected by the method using relation in the word-occurrence data.

Then, if the segmentation is incorrect, the compound word is registered into the compound word dictionary with its correct segmentation position.2","All of these treatments can be done automatically based on the results of our compound detection methods.","Note that how much frequent words should be registered into the dictionary depends on the policy of the dictionary maintenance, and the system capability of handling unknown words.
