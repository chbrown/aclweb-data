Many methods of term extraction have been discussed in terms of their accuracy on huge corpora. However, when we try to apply various methods that derive from frequency to a small corpus, we may not be able to achieve sufficient accuracy because of the shortage of statistical information on frequency. This paper reports a new way of extracting terms that is tuned for a very small corpus. It focuses on the structure of compound terms and calculates perplexity on the term unit’s left-side and right-side. The results of our experiments revealed that the accuracy with the proposed method was not that advantageous. However, experimentation with the method combining perplexity and frequency information obtained the highest average-precision in comparison with other methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Term extraction, which is the task of extracting terminology (or technical terms) from a set of documents, is one of major topics in natural language processing. It has a wide variety of applications including book indexing, dictionary generation, and keyword extraction for information retrieval systems.","Most automatic term extraction systems make a sorted list of candidate terms extracted from a given corpus according to the “importance” scores of the terms, so they require scores of “importance” for the terms. Existing scores include TF-IDF, C-Value [1], and FLR [9]. In this paper, we propose a new method that involves revising the definition of the FLR method in a more sophisticated way. One of the advantages of the FLR method is its size-robustness, i.e, it can be applied to small corpus with less significant drop in performance than other standard methods like TF and IDF, because it is defined using more fine-grained features called term units. Our new method, called FPP, inherit this property while exhibiting better performance than FLR.","At the same time, we also propose a new scheme for evaluating term extraction systems. Our idea is to use summaries1","of articles as a gold standard. This strategy is based on the assumption that summaries of documents can","1 In more detail, an article revised for display on mobile phones. R. Dale et al.

Thus, we regard a term in an original document to be important if it also appears in the summary."]},{"title":"2TermExtraction","paragraphs":["Term extraction is the task of extracting important terms from a given corpus. Typically, term extraction systems first extract term candidates,whichareusually the noun phrases detected by handcrafted POS sequence patterns, from the corpus. After that, term candidates are sorted according to some importance score. Important terms, (i.e., terms that appear in the summary, in our problem setting,) are desired to be ranked higher than others. In this paper we focus on the second step, i.e., term candidate sorting by importance scores. We propose a new score of term importance by modifying an existing one in a more sophisticated manner.","In the remainder of this paper, a term candidate is represented by W = w1w2 ···wn where wi represents a term unit contained in W ,andn is the number of term units contained in W .

Methods that use corpus statistics have especially emerged over the past decade due to the increasing number of machine-readable documents such as news articles and WWW documents. These methods can be mainly categorized into the following three types according to what types of features are used to calculate the scores. – Measurement by frequencies – Measurement by internal structures of term candidates – Combination of the above 3.1 Score by Frequency: TF Frequency is one of the most basic features of term extraction. Usually, a term that appears frequently is assumed to be important. We introduce a score of this type: tf (W ).","tf (W )representstheTF(Term Frequency) of W . It is defined as the number of occurrences of W in all documents.Notethattf (W )istheresultofthe brute force counting of W occurrences. This method, for example, counts the Automatic Term Extraction Based on Perplexity of Compound Words 271 term natural even if it is merely part of another phrase such as natural language processing.2 3.2 Score by Internal Structures in Term Candidates: LR An LR method [9] is based on the intuition that some words are used as term units more frequently than others, and a phrase that contains such “good” term units is likely to be important. The left score l(wi) of each term unit wi of a target term is defined as the number (or the number of types) of term units connected to the left of wi (i.e., appearing just in the left of wi in term candidates), and the right score r(wi) is defined in the same manner.3","An LR score lr(wi) is defined as the geometric mean of left and right scores: lr(wi)=","√ l(wi)r(wi)","The total LR score of W is defined as a geometric mean of the scores of term units as: LR(W )=(lr(w1)lr(w2) ···lr(wn)) 1 n . An example of LR score calculation is given in the next section. 3.3 Mixed Measures C-Value. C-Value[1] is defined by the following two expressions: t(W ): frequency of terms that contain W , c(W ): number of types of terms that contain W . Note that t(W )doesnotcountW itself. Intuitively, t(W ) is the degree of being part of another term, and c(W ) is the degree of being part of various types of terms.","C-Value is defined by using these two expressions in the following way. c-val(W )=(n − 1) × ( tf (W ) − t(W ) c(W ) )","Note that the value is zero where n = 1. MC-Value [9] is a modified version of C-Value adapted for use in term collections that include the term of length 1 (i.e., n =1). MC-val(W )=n × ( tf (W ) − t(W ) c(W ) )","We used MC-Value in the experiments because our task was to extract terms","regardless of whether each term is one-word term or not. 2 We can also use another frequency score F(Frequency), or f(W ), that is defined as the number of independent occurrences of W in all documents. (Independent means that W is not included in any larger term candidate.) However, we observed that f(W ) (or the combination of f(W ) and another score) had no advantage over tf(W ) (or the combination of tf(W ) and another score) in the experiments,so in this paper we omit scores that are the combination of f(W ) and other scores. 3 In addition, we apply the adding-one smoothing to both of them to avoid the score beingzerowhenwi has no connected terms. 272 M. Yoshida and H. Nakagawa FLR. The LR method reflects the number of appearances of term units, but does not reflect that of a whole term itself. For example, even if “natural language” is more frequent than “language natural” and the former should be given a higher score than the latter, LR cannot be used to do this.","An FLR method [9] was proposed to overcome this shortcoming of LR. It reflects both the frequencies and inner structures of terms. FLR(W ) is defined as the product of LR(W )andtf (W )as: FLR(W )=tf (W )LR(W )."]},{"title":"4 Our Method: Combining Types and Frequencies via Entropy","paragraphs":["4.1 Preliminaries: Token-LR and Type-LR Figure 1 outlines example statistics for term unit connections.

Token-LR (and Type-LR) are calculated by simply counting the frequency (and the types) of terms connected to each term unit, respectively. In this case, a Type-LR score for the term unit “information” is","l(inf ormation)=1+14 ,r(inf ormation)=3+1,LR(inf ormation)=","√ 8, and a Token-LR score is","l(inf ormation)=3+1,r(inf ormation)=6+1,LR(inf ormation)=√ 28. 4 Note that the adding-one smoothing is applied.

However, Token-LR cannot reflect the number of types that suggest the variety of connections. To solve these shortcomings with LR measures, we propose a new kind that combines these two through perplexity. 4.2 Term Extraction by Perplexity Our method is based on the idea of perplexity [8]. The score of a term is defined by the left perplexity and right perplexity of its term units. In this subsection we first give a standard definition of the perplexity of language, from which our left and right perplexity measures are derived. After that, we describe how to score terms by using these perplexities. Perplexity of language. Assume that language L is information source that produces word lists of length n and each word list is produced independently with probability P (wn","1 ). Then, the entropy of language L is calculated as: H0(L)=− ∑ wn 1","P (wn 1 )logP (wn","1 ). The entropy per word is then calculated as: H(L)=− 1 n ∑ wn 1","P (wn 1 )logP (wn","1 ). This value indicates the number of bits needed to express each word generated from L. Perplexity of language L is defined using H(L)as:","Perplexity =2H(L) . Perplexity can be seen as the average number of types of words that follow each preceding word. The larger the perplexity of L, the less predictable the word connection in L. Left and right perplexity. Assume that k types of unit words can connect to the right of wi (see Figure 2).","Also assume that Ri","is a random variable assigned to the i-th term unit which represents its right connections and takes its value from the set {r1,r2, ···,rk}. Then, entropy H(Ri",")iscalculatedas:","H(Ri )=− k ∑ j=1 P (rj )log2 P (rj ) Note that we define 0 log 0 = 0, according to the fact that x log x → 0where x → 0. 274 M. Yoshida and H.

Example of term unit and term units connected to its right This entropy value can be thought of as a variety of terms that connect to the right of wi, or, more precisely, the number of bits needed to describe words that connect to the right of wi. Then right perplexity ppr(wi) of term unit wi is defined as","ppr(wi)=2H(Ri ) . This value can be seen as the number of branches, in the sense of information theory, of right-connection from wi. It naturally reflects both the frequency and number of types of each connection between term units.","Random variable Li","for the left connections is defined in the same manner. The perplexity for left connections is thus defined as:","ppl(wi)=2H(Li ) . Term Score by Perplexity. We define our measure by substituting l and r in the definition of LR with ppl and ppr. First, a combination of left and right perplexities is defined as the geometric mean of both: pp(wi)=(ppl(wi) · ppr(wi)) 1 2 . After that, perplexity score PP(W )forW is defined as the geometric mean of all pp(wi)s: PP(W )= [ n ∏ i=1 pp(wi) ] 1 n . Automatic Term Extraction Based on Perplexity of Compound Words 275 We used log PP(W ) instead of PP(W ) to make implementation easier. Notice that log x is a monotonic (increasing) function of x. PP(W )= [ n ∏ i=1 {ppl(wi) · ppr(wi)} 1 2 ] 1 n ⇒ log2 PP(W )= 1 n log2","( n ∏ i=1{ppl(wi) · ppr(wi)} 1 2 ) ⇒ log2 PP(W )= 1 2n n ∑ i=1 (log2 ppl(wi)+log2 ppr(wi))","Using ppr(wi)=2H(Ri )","and ppl(wi)=2H(li ) ,weobtain log2 PP(W )= 1 2n n ∑ i=1","(","H(Ri",")+H(Li",")) . The right side means the sum of the left and right entropies of all term units. 4.3 Term Extraction by Perplexity and TF Perplexity itself serves as a good score for terms, but combining it with TF, which is a measure from another point of view, can provide a still better score that reflects both the inner structures of term candidates and their frequencies which are regarded as global information about the whole corpus.","Our new score, FPP(W ), which is a combination of PP and TF, is defined as their product: FPP(W )=tf (W )PP(W ) ⇒ log2 FPP(W )=log2 tf (W )+log2 PP(W ) ⇒ log2 FPP(W )=log2 tf (W )+ 1 2n n ∑ i=1","(","H(Ri",")+H(Li",")) We avoided the problem of log2 tf (W ) being undefined with tf (W )=05 by applying the adding-one smoothing to tf (W ).

Articles for mobile phones were written manually from the original ones, which were shorter versions of the original articles adapted to small displays. We regard them as summaries of the original articles and used them to evaluate whether the extracted terms were correct or not. If a term in the original article was also in the summary, the term was correct, and incorrect if otherwise. Each article had a size of about 300 letters and each summary had a size of about 50.","Table 1 lists the number of articles in each category. Table 1.

A corpus of each size was generated by singly adding an article randomly selected from the corpus of each genre. We generated test data consisting of 50 different sizes (from 1 to 50) for each genre. The average number of letters in the size 50 corpus was about 19,000, and the average number of term candidates was about 1,300. We used five different seed numbers to randomly select articles. The performance of each method was evaluated in terms of recall and precision, which were averaged over the five trials. 5.3 Preprocessing: Term Candidate Extraction Each article was preprocessed with a morphological analyzer, the Chasen 2.3.3.[2] The output of Chasen was further modified according to heuristic rules as follows. – Nouns and undefined words were extracted for further processes and other words were discarded. – Suffixes and prefixes were concatenated to their following and preceding words, respectively. The result was a set of term candidates to be evaluated with the term importance scores described in the previous sections.","We applied the following methods to the term candidates: F, TF, DF (Document Frequency) [8], LR, MC-Value, FLR, TF-IDF [8], PP, and FPP’.
