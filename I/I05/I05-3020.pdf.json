It is because Chinese is written without any separa-tion between words and meanwhile more than 50% words of the Chinese texts in web corpus are out-of-vocabulary (Tsai et al. 2003).","Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al. 1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntaxsemantic knowledge (Chen et al. 2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al. 2003; Ma and Chen, 2003). In practice, statistical approaches are most widely used because their effective and reasonable performance. For a CWS, there are two types of word segmentation ambiguities while there are no unknown words in them: (1) Overlap ambiguity (OA), take a character string ABC as an example. If its segmentation can be either AB/C or A/BC depending on different context, the ABC is called an overlap ambiguity string (OAS), such as “(a general)/(use)” and “(to get)/(for military use)” (the symbol “/” indicates a word boundary); (2) Combination ambiguity (CA), take a character string AB as an example. If its segmentation can be either A/B or AB depending on different context, the AB is called a combination ambiguity string (CAS), such as “(just)/(can)” and “ (ability).” Meantime, there are two types of error segmentation caused by unknown word problem: (1) Lack of unknown word (LUW), it means the error segmentation occurred by lack of an unknown word in the system dictionary, such as “//”; (2) Error identified word (EIW), it means the error segmentation occurred by an error identified unknown words, such as “"]},{"title":"142 ","paragraphs":[".” To sum up, for a CWS in most case the UWI is a pre-processing stage to detect unknown words for the optimization of LUW-EIW tradeoff, and then to disambiguate those autodetected OAS and CAS problems from the segmentation results.","The goal of this paper is to illustrate and report the effectiveness and the scored results of our BMM-based CWS for the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff in the MSR closed (MSR_C) track. For this Bakeoff, our CWS is mainly addressed on optimizing the LUW-EIW tradeoff.","The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we present the details of our BMM-based CWS comprised of a context-based UWI. In Section 3, we present the scored results of the CWS in the MSR_C track and give our analysis. Finally, in Section 4, we give our conclusions and suggest some future research directions."]},{"title":"2 Development of BMM-based CWS","paragraphs":["As per (Tsai et al. 2004), the Chinese word segmentation performance of BMM technique is about 1% greater than that of FMM technique. Thus, we adopt BMM technique as base to develop our CWS. The descriptions of symbols used in our CWS are given as below:","<BOS>: begin of sentence;","<EOS>: end of sentence;","<BOW>: begin of word;","<EOW>: end of word;","/: word boundary;","+: inner word boundaries of the segmentation of a system word segmented by BMM technique with the system dictionary exclusive of this system word;","SWS (stop word string): for a system word (such as “(of)”), if the ratio (non-SWS probability) of total frequency of the other system words including it (such as “ (beautiful)”) and its character string frequency is less than or equal to 1%, it is a SWS;","SWBS (stop word bigram string): for a word bigram (such as “(just)/(can)”), if the ratio (non-SWBS probability) of its character string (such as “ (ability)” frequency and its character string frequency is less than or equal to 1%, it is a SWBS;","BMM-ASM (BMM ambiguity string mapping table: the BMM-ASM table lists all the pairs of correct SS (given in training corpus) and the error BMM SS (generated by BMM with the training system dictionary). Take the Chinese sentence “” as an example. As per its MSR-standard segmentation “(effect)/(really)/(good)” and its BMM segmentation “ (follow)/ (indeed)/(good),” the pair “/”- “/” is a BMM-ASM;","TCT (triple context template): a TCT comprised of three items from left to right are: the left word, the segmented system word and the right word, where the system word is not a mono-syllabic Chinese word. Take the Chinese sentence “//” as an example. The two generated TCT are: “<BOS>/+1-char-word/”","“<BOS>/1-char-word+/”; and","WCT (word context template): a WCT comprised of three items from left to right are: “<BOW>”, the segmented system word and “<EOW>”, where the system word is not a mono-syllabic word. Take the system word “(lamasery)” as an example. Its two WCT are: “<BOW>/+1-char-word/<EOW>”","“<BOW>/2-char-word+/<EOW>.”","The algorithm of our BMM-based CWS com-","prised of a context-based UWI is as below: Step 1. Generate BMM segmentation for the input Chinese sentence with system dictionary, firstly. The system dictionary comprised of all word types found in the training corpus. Then, use BMM-ASM table to revise the matched BMM ambiguity string. Step 2. Use UWI to identify unknown words from the segmentation of Step 1 by the TCT knowledge, firstly. For the matched TCT, the characters between the left word and the right word will be combined as an UWI-identified word. If the UWI-identified word includes a SWS or a SWBS, it will be not an UWI-identified word. Then, use the system dictionary of Step 1 inclusive of the UWI-identified words of this step to repeat Step 1 process. Step 3.

Then, use UWI to identify unknown words by the WCT knowledge. If the number of characters between “<BOW>” and “EOW>” is same with that of the matched WCT, these 1-char characters will be combined as an UWI-identified word. If the UWI-identified word includes a SWS or a SWBS, it will be not an UWI-identified word. Finally, use the system dictionary of Step 2 inclusive of those UWI-identified words of this step to repeat Step 1 process. Step 4. Use UWI to combine a word bigram into a word by the following two conditions: (1) if the non-SWS probability of the right first character of the left-side word is greater or equal to 99% and (2) if the non-SWS probability of the left first character of the right-side word is greater or equal to 99%. Take the word bigram “ / ” as an example. Since the non-SWS probability of the right first character “” of the left-side word “ ” is 99.95%, “” is identified as an UWI-identified word. If the UWI-identified word includes a SWS or a SWBS, it will be not an UWI-identified word. Finally, use the system dictionary of Step 3 inclusive of those UWI-identified words of this step to repeat the Step 1 process. Step 5. Repeat the Step 2 process. Step 6. Repeat the Step 3 process. Step 7. Repeat the Step 4 process. Step 8. Stop.

To sum up the results of this study, we have following conclusions and future directions: (1) Since the F-measure of Step 1 of our CWS is 94.3%, it indicates that the BMM with BMM-ASM knowledge is a simple but probably effective technique as a good base in developing a high performance CWS; (2) Since 82% of segmentation errors of our CWS caused by LUW problem, this result supports that a high performance CWS is relied on a high performance Chinese UWI. (3) For a CWS, there are two critical and probably independent tasks: the optimization of LUW-EIW tradeoff and the detection and disambiguation of OAS and CAS error segmentation. We believe the former task is more critical than the later one. (4) We will continue to expand our CWS with other linguistic knowledge (such as part-of-speech information and morphology) and BTM model (Tsai 2005) to improve our BMM-based CWS for attending the third International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff in both closed and open testing tracks."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Chen, Keh-Jiann and Wei-Yun, Ma. 2002.
