Many sentences end with unique expressions that consist of nouns and case particles. This paper focuses on expressions used at the end of sentences and at-tempts to summarize them by forming noun or case particle endings. We summarize the news sentence through pattern matching approach. Our evalua-tion illustrates that the summarizer reduces 2.50 characters per sentence on average; the reduction ratio is 6%. We also show that people perceive the correct meanings of the summarized sentences with 95% accuracy."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Electrical bulletin board displays the latest news headlines which each newspaper office an-nounced. News headlines are shorter than news-papers’ news with laconicism because they are summarized to transfer in limited space.","One of a characteristics of Japanese news headlines can be seen at sentence ends (Exp.1).","Exp.1) (Countermeasure for alleged abduction is judged after the movement of administration party.)","Although the end of sentence in Exp.1 is omitted, we have no difficulty to understand the meaning. We unconsciously complete the sentence by guessing what is omitted without a mistake. Without unnecessary ends, these type of sentences are short and nonredundant.","The final purpose of this work is to transform news sentences into a news headline style. In Japanese, sentences end with nouns or case particles are grammatically incorrect, however, this kind of expressions are shorter than grammatically perfect sentences, and hence often used to meet the limited length. We believe many sentences have semantically redundant expressions in the end, which needs to be focused in summarization.","In this paper we present a list of deletable expressions at Japanese sentence ends. We have to carefully investigate which sentence ends are deletable, and how to change into the headline style. We present the concrete expressions of deletion with examples and illustrate effects of deletion."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["As the most similar work to ours, Sato et al.[6] tries to extract paraphrasing patterns of sentence end by preparing a lot of alignment pairs between news sentences and their headline versions.

However, they have no proposals on how to use these one-to-N correspondences, i.e., the way to select one from many candidates. Our approach is to obtain many transformation patterns as well, but we do not use aligned corpus; we use a large collec-tion of news headlines instead and find patterns by our thorough observation.","Wakao et al.[7] compares newscast and corresponding subtitle expressions to investigate the differences of them. One of the observation targets is sentence end, and they have shown us some typical patterns of conversion into a short news.
