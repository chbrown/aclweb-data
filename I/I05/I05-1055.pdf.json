Ordering information is a difficult but a important task for natural language generation applications. A wrong order of information not only makes it difficult to understand, but also conveys an entirely different idea to the reader. This paper proposes an algorithm that learns orderings from a set of human ordered texts. Our model consists of a set of ordering experts. Each expert gives its precedence preference between two sentences. We combine these preferences and order sentences. We also propose two new metrics for the evaluation of sentence orderings. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in all evaluation metrics."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The task of ordering sentences arises in many fields. Multidocument Summarization (MDS) [5], Question and Answer (QA) systems and concept to text generation systems are some of them. These systems extract information from different sources and combine them to produce a coherent text. Proper ordering of sentences improves readability of a summary [1]. In most cases it is a trivial task for a human to read a set of sentences and order them coherently. Humans use their wide background knowledge and experience to decide the order among sentences. However, it is not an easy task for computers. This paper proposes a sentence ordering algorithm and evaluate its performance with regard to MDS.","MDS is the task of generating a human readable summary from a given set of documents. With the increasing amount of texts available in electronic format, automatic text summarization has become necessary. It can be considered as a two-stage process. In the first stage the source documments are analyzed and a set of sentences are extracted. However, the document set may contain repeating information as well as contradictory information and these challenges should be considered when extracting sentences for the summary. Researchers have already investigated this problem and various algorithms exist. The second stage of MDS creates a coherent summary from this extract. When summarizing a single document, a naive strategy that arranges extracted sentences according to the appearance order may yield a coherent summary. However, in MDS the extracted sentences belong to different source documents. The source documents R. Dale et al. (Eds.): IJCNLP 2005, LNAI 3651, pp. 624–635, 2005. c⃝ Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005 A Machine Learning Approach to Sentence Ordering 625 may have been written by various authors and on various dates. Therefore we cannot simply order the sentences according to the position of the sentences in the original document to get a comprehensible summary.","This second stage of MDS has received lesser attention compared to the first stage. Chronological ordering; ordering sentences according to the published date of the documents they belong to [6], is one solution to this problem. However, showing that this approach is insufficient, Barzilay [1] proposed an refined algorithm which integrates chronology ordering with topical relatedness of documents. Okazaki [7] proposes a improved chronological ordering algorithm using precedence relations among sentences. His algorithm searches for an order which satisfies the precedence relations among sentences. In addition to these studies which make use of chronological ordering, Lapata [3] proposes a probabilistic model of text structuring and its application to the sentence ordering. Her system calculates the conditional probabilities between sentences from a corpus and uses a greedy ordering algorithm to arrange sentences according to the conditional probabilities.","Even though these previous studies proposed different strategies to decide the sentence ordering, the appropriate way to combine these different methods to obtain more robust and coherent text remains unknown. In addition to these existing sentence ordering heuristics, we propose a new method which we shall call succession in this paper. We then learn the optimum linear combination of these heuristics that maximises readability of a summary using a set of human-made orderings. We then propose two new metrics for evaluating sentence orderings; Weighted Kendall Coefficient and Average Continuity. Comparing with an in-trinsic evaluation made by human subjects, we perform a quantitative evaluation using a number of metrics and discuss the possiblity of the automatic evaluation of sentence orderings."]},{"title":"2Method","paragraphs":["For sentences taken from the same document we keep the order in that document as done in single document summarization. However, we have to be careful when ordering sentences which belong to different documents. To decide the order among such sentences, we implement five ranking experts: Chronological, Probabilistic, Topical relevance, Precedent and Succedent. These experts return precedence preference between two sentences. Cohen [2] proposes an elegant learning model that works with preference functions and we adopt this learn-ingmodeltoourtask.Eachexperte generates a pair-wise preference function defined as following: PREFe(u, v, Q) ∈ [0, 1]. (1) Where, u, v are two sentences that we want to order; Q is the set of sentences which has been already ordered. The expert returns its preference of u to v.If the expert prefers u to v then it returns a value greater than 0.5. In the extreme case where the expert is absolutely sure of preferring u to v it will return 1.0. On the other hand, if the expert prefers v to u it will return a value lesser than 626 D. Bollegala, N. Okazaki, and M. Ishizuka 0.5. In the extreme case where the expert is absolutely sure of preferring v to u it will return 0. When the expert is undecided of its preference between u and v it will return 0.5.","The linear weighted sum of these individual preference functions is taken as the total preference by the set of experts as follows: PREFtotal(u, v, Q)= ∑ e∈E wePREFe(u, v, Q). (2) Therein: E is the set of experts and we is the weight associated to expert e ∈ E. These weights are normalized so that the sum of them is 1. We use the Hedge learning algorithm to learn the weights associated with each expert’s preference function. Then we use the greedy algorithm proposed by Cohen [2] to get an ordering that approximates the total preference. 2.1 Chronological Expert Chronological expert emulates conventional chronological ordering [4,6] which arranges sentences according to the dates on which the documents were published and preserves the appearance order for sentences in the same document. We define a preference function for the expert as follows: PREFchro(u, v, Q)=    1 T (u) <T(v) 1[D(u)=D(v)] ∧ [N (u) <N(v)] 0.5[T (u)=T (v)] ∧ [D(u) ̸= D(v)] 0otherwise . (3) Therein: T (u) is the publication date of sentence u; D(u) presents the unique identifier of the document to which sentence u belongs; N (u) denotes the line number of sentence u in the original document. Chronological expert gives 1 (preference) to the newly published sentence over the old and to the prior over the posterior in the same article. Chronological expert returns 0.5 (undecided) when comparing two sentences which are not in the same article but have the same publication date. 2.2 Probabilistic Expert Lapata [3] proposes a probabilistic model to predict sentence order. Her model assumes that the position of a sentence in the summary depends only upon the sentences preceding it. For example let us consider a summary T which has sentences S1,...,Sn in that order. The probability P (T ) of getting this order is given by: P (T )= n ∏ i=1 P (Sn|S1,...,Sn−i). (4) She further reduces this probability using bi-gram approximation as follows. P (T )= n ∏ i=1 P (Si|Si−1)(5) A Machine Learning Approach to Sentence Ordering 627 She breaks each sentence into features and takes the vector product of features as follows: P (Si|Si−1)= ∏ (a<i,j>,a<i−1,k>)∈Si×Si−1 P (a<i,j>,a<i−1,k>). (6) Feature conditional probabilities can be calculated using frequency counts of features as follows: P (a<i,j>|a<i−1,k>)= f (a<i,j>,a<i−1,k>) ∑ a<i,j> f (a<i,j>,a<i−1,k>) . (7) Lapata [3] uses nouns,verbs and dependency structures as features. Where as in our expert we implemented only nouns and verbs as features. We performed back-off smoothing on the frequency counts in equation 7 as these values were sparse. Once these conditional probabilities are calculated, for two sentences u,v we can define the preference function for the probabilistic expert as follows: PREFprob(u, v, Q)= {","1+P (u|r)−P (v|r)","2 Q ̸= ⊘","1+P (u)−P (v)","2 Q = ⊘ . (8) Where, Q is the set of sentences ordered so far and r ∈ Q is the lastly ordered sentence in Q. Initially, Q is null and we prefer the sentence with higher absolute probability. When Q is not null and u is preferred to v, i.e. P (u|r) >P(v|r), according to definition 8 a preference value greater than 0.5 is returned. If v is preferred to u, i.e. P (u|r) <P(v|r), we have a preference value smaller than 0.5. When P (u|r)=P (v|r), the expert is undecided and it gives the value 0.5. 2.3 Topical Relevance Expert In MDS, the source documents could contain multiple topics. Therefore, the extracted sentences could be covering different topics. Grouping the extracted sentences which belong to the same topic, improves readability of the summary. Motivated by this fact, we designed an expert which groups the sentences which belong to the same topic. This expert prefers sentences which are more similar to the ones that have been already ordered. For each sentence l in the extract we define its topical relevance, topic(l) as follows:","topic(l)=max q∈Q sim(l, q). (9)","We use cosine similarity to calculate sim(l, q). The preference function of this expert is defined as follows: PREFtopic(u, v, Q)= { 0.5[Q = ⊘] ∨ [topic(u)=topic(v)] 1[Q ̸= ⊘] ∧ [topic(u) > topic(v)] 0otherwise . (10) Where, ⊘ represents the null set, u,v are the two sentences under consideration and Q is the block of sentences that has been already ordered so far in the summary. 628 D. Bollegala, N.

Topical relevance expert 2.4 Precedent Expert When placing a sentence in the summary it is important to check whether the preceding sentences convey the necessary background information for this sentence to be clearly understood. Placing a sentence without its context being stated in advanced, makes an unintelligible summary. As shown in figure 2, for each extracted sentence l, we can compare the block of text that appears before it in its source document (P ) with the block of sentences which we have ordered so far in the summary (Q). If P and Q matches well, then we can safely assume that Q contains the necessary background information required by l.We can then place l after Q. Such relations among sentences are called precedence relations. Okazaki [7] proposes precedence relations as a method to improve the chronological ordering of sentences. He considers the information stated in the documents preceding the extracted sentences to judge the order. Based on this idea, we define precedence pre(l) of the extracted sentence l as follows:","pre(l)= max p∈P,q∈Q sim(p, q). (11)"]},{"title":"l 2 &QEWOGPV&5WOOCT[ 3","paragraphs":["Fig. 2.

Succedent expert 2.5 Succedent Expert When extracting sentences from source documents, sentences which are similar to the ones that are already extracted, are usually ignored to prevent repetition of information. However, this information is valuable when ordering sentences. For example, a sentence that was ignored by the sentence extraction algorithm might turn out to be more suitable when ordering the extracted sentences. However, we assume that the sentence ordering algorithm is independent from the sentence extraction algorithm and therefore does not possess this knowledge regarding the left out candidates. This assumption improves the compatibility of our algorithm as it can be used to order sentences extracted by any sentence extraction algorithm. We design an expert which uses this information to order sentences.","Let us consider the siuation depicted in Figure 3 where a block Q of text is orderd in the summary so far. The lastly ordered setence r belongs to document D in which a block K of sentences follows r. The author of this document assumes that K is a natural consequence of r. However, the sentence selection algorithm might not have selected any sentences from K because it already selected some sentences with this information from some other document. Therefore, we search the extract L for a sentence that best matches with a sentence in K. We define succession as a measure of this agreement(13) as follows:","succ(l)=max k∈K sim(l, k). (13) Here, we calculate sim(l, k) using cosine similarity. Sentences with higher succession values are preferred by the expert. The preference function for this expert can be written as follows: PREFsucc(u, v, Q)= { 0.5[Q = ⊘] ∨ [succ(u) = succ(v)] 1[Q ̸= ⊘] ∧ [succ(u) > succ(v)] 0otherwise . (14) 2.6 Ordering Algorithm Using the five preference functions described in the previous sections, we compute the total preference function of the set of experts as defined by equation 2. Section 2.7 explains the method that we use to calculate the weights assigned to each expert’s preference. In this section we will consider the problem of finding an order that satisfies the total preference function. Finding the optimal order for a given 630 D. Bollegala, N. Okazaki, and M. Ishizuka total preference function is NP-complete [2]. However, Cohen [2] proposes a greedy algorithm that approximates the optimal ordering. Once the unordered extract X and total preference (equation 2) are given, this greedy algorithm can be used to generate an approximately optimal ordering function ρ̂. let V = X for each v ∈ V do π(v)= ∑ u∈V PREF(v, u, Q) − ∑ u∈V PREF(u, v, Q)","while V is non-empty do let t =argmaxu∈V π(u) let ρ̂(t)=|V | V = V −{t} for each v ∈ V do","π(v)=π(v) + PREF(t, u) − PREF(v, t)","endwhile 2.7 Learning Algorithm Cohen [2] proposes a weight allocation algorithm that learns the weights associated with each expert in equation 2.

To explain equation 15 let us assume that sentence u comes before sentence v in the human ordered summary. Then the expert must return the value 1 for PREF(u,v,Q). However,if the expert returns any value less than 1, then the difference is taken as the loss. We do this for all such sentence pairs in F . For a summary of length N we have N (N − 1)/2 such pairs. Since this loss is taken to the power of β, a value smaller than 1, the new weight of the expert gets changed according to the loss as in equation 16."]},{"title":"3 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In addition to Kendall’s τ coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient which are widely used for comparing two ranks, we use sentence continuity [7] as well as two metrics we propose; Weighted Kendall and Average Continuity. 3.1 Weighted Kendall Coefficient The Kendall’s τ coefficient is defined as following: τ =1−","2Q","n","C2 . (17) Where, Q is the number of discordant pairs and n","C2 is the number of combinations that can be generated from a set of n distinct elements by taking two elements at a time with replacement. However, one major drawback of this metric when evaluating sentence orderings is that, it does not take into consideration the relative distance d between the discordant pairs. However, when reading a text a human reader is likely to be more sensitive to a closer discordant pair than a discordant pair far apart. Therefore, a closer discordant pair is more likely to harm the readability of the summary compared to a far apart discordant pair. In order to reflect these differences in our metric, we use an exponentially decreasing weight function as follows: h(d)= { exp(1 − d) d ≥ 1 0else. (18) Here, d is the number of sentences that lie between the two sentences of the discordant pair. Going by the traditional Kendall’s τ coefficient we defined our weighted Kendall coefficient as following, so that it becomes a metric in [1, −1] range. τw =1− 2","∑ d h(d)","∑n i=1 h(i) (19) 3.2 Average Continuity Both Kendall’s τ coefficient and the Weighted Kendall coefficient measure discordants between ranks. However, in the case of summaries, we need a metric which expresses the continuity of the sentences. A summary which can be read 632 D. Bollegala, N. Okazaki, and M. Ishizuka continuously is better compared to a one that cannot. If the ordered extract contains most of the sentence blocks of the reference summary then we can safely assume that it is far more readable and coherent to a one that is not. Sentence n-gram counts of continuous sentences give a rough idea of this kind of continuity.","For a summary of length N there are N − n + 1 possible sentence n-grams of length n. Therefore, we can define a precision Pn of continuity length n as: Pn =","number of matched n-grams N − n +1 . (20) Due to sparseness of higher order n-grams Pn decreases in an exponential-like curve with n. Therefore, we define Average Continuity as the logrithmic average of Pn as follows: Average Continuity = exp( 1 3 4 ∑ n=2 log(Pn)) (21) We add a small quantity α to numerator and denominator of Pn in equation 20 so that the logarithm will not diverge when n-grams count is zero. We used α =0.01 in our evaluations. Experimental results showed that taking n-grams up to four gave contrasting results because the n-grams tend to be sparse for larger n values. BLEU(BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) proposed by Papineni [8] for the task of evaluating machine translations has an analogical form to our average continuity. In BLEU, a machine translation is compared against multiple reference translations and precision values are calculated using word n-grams. BLEU is then defined as the logarithmic average of these precision values."]},{"title":"4Results","paragraphs":["We used the 3rd Text Summarization Challenge (TSC) corpus for our experiments.

We then compared the orderings by the proposed algorithm against these human ordered summaries. We used 10-fold cross validation to learn the weights assigned to each expert in our proposed algorithm. These weights are shown in table 1.
