Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["We introduce a general formalism for modeling of bilingual sentence pairs, known as an inversion transduction grammar, with potential application in a variety of corpus analysis areas. Transduction grammar models, especially of the finite-state family, have long been known. However, the imposition of identical ordering constraints upon both streams severely restricts their applicability, and thus transduction grammars have received relatively little attention in language-modeling research. The inversion transduction grammar formalism skips directly to a context-free, rather than finite-state, base and permits one extra degree of ordering flexibility, while retaining properties necessary for efficient computation, thereby sidestepping the limitations of traditional transduction grammars.","In tandem with the concept of bilingual language-modeling, we propose the concept of bilingual parsing, where the input is a"]},{"title":"sentence-pair","paragraphs":["rather than a sentence. Though inversion transduction grammars remain inadequate as full-fledged translation models, bilingual parsing with simple inversion transduction grammars turns out to be very useful for parallel corpus analysis when the true grammar is not fully known. Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. E-mail: dekai@cs.ust.hk © 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3 Fung and Church 1994; Wu and Xia 1994; Fung and McKeown 1994). The primary purpose of bilingual parsing with inversion transduction grammars is not to flag un-grammatical inputs; rather, the aim is to extract structure from the input data, which is assumed to be grammatical, in keeping with the spirit of robust parsing. The formalism's uniform integration of various types of bracketing and alignment constraints is one of its chief strengths.","The paper is divided into two main parts. We begin in the first part below by laying out the basic formalism, then show that reduction to a normal form is possible. We then raise several desiderata for the expressiveness of any bilingual language-modeling formalism in terms of its constituent-matching flexibility and discuss how the characteristics of the inversion transduction formalism are particularly suited to address these criteria. Afterwards we introduce a stochastic version and give an algorithm for finding the optimal bilingual parse of a sentence-pair. The formalism is independent of the languages; we give examples and applications using Chinese and English because languages from different families provide a more rigorous testing ground. In the second part, we survey a number of sample applications and extensions of bilingual parsing for segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and other parsing tasks. 2. Inversion Transduction Grammars A transduction grammar describes a structurally correlated pair of languages. For our purposes, the generative view is most convenient: the grammar generates transductions, so that two output streams are simultaneously generated, one for each language. This contrasts with the common input-output view popularized by both syntax-directed transduction grammars and finite-state transducers. The generative view is more appropriate for our applications because the roles of the two languages are symmetrical, in contrast to the usual applications of syntax-directed transduction grammars. Moreover, the input-output view works better when a machine for accepting one of the languages (the input language) has a high degree of determinism, which is not the case here.","Our transduction model is context-free, rather than finite-state. Finite-state transducers, or FSTs, are well known to be useful for specific tasks such as analysis of inflectional morphology (Koskenniemi 1983), text-to-speech conversion (Kaplan and Kay 1994), and nominal, number, and temporal phrase normalization (Gazdar and Mellish 1989). FSTs may also be used to parse restricted classes of context-free grammars (Pereira 1991; Roche 1994; Laporte 1996). However, the bilingual corpus analysis tasks we consider in this paper are quite different from the tasks for which FSTs are apparently well suited. Our domain is broader, and the model possesses very little a priori specific structural knowledge of the language.","As a stepping stone to inversion transduction grammars, we first consider what a context-free model known as a simple transduction grammar (Lewis and Stearns 1968) would look like. Simple transduction grammars (as well as inversion transduction grammars) are restricted cases of the general class of context-free syntax-directed transduction grammars (Aho and Ullman 1969a, 1969b, 1972); however, we will avoid the term syntax-directed here, so as to de-emphasize the input-output connotation as discussed above.","A simple transduction grammar can be written by marking every terminal symbol for a particular output stream. Thus, each rewrite rule emits not one but two streams.

At the same time, any relaxation of constraints must be traded off against increases in the computational complexity of parsing, which may easily become exponential. The key is to make the relaxation relatively modest but still handle a wide range of ordering variations.","The inversion transduction grammar (ITG) formalism only minimally extends the generative power of a simple transduction grammar, yet turns out to be surprisingly effective. 1 Like simple transduction grammars, ITGs remain a subset of context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars (Lewis and Steams 1968) but this view is too general to be of much help. 2 The productions of an inversion transduction grammar are interpreted just as in a simple transduction grammar, except that two possible orientations are allowed. Pure simple transduction grammars have the implicit characteristic that for both output streams, the symbols generated by the right-hand-side constituents of a production are concatenated in the same left-to-right order.

This means that the adjacency constraints given by the nested levels must be obeyed in the bracketings of both languages. The result of the parse yields labeled bracketings for both sentences, as well as a bracket alignment indicating the parallel constituents between the sentences. The constituent alignment includes a word alignment as a by-product.","The nonterminals may not always look like those of an ordinary CFG. Clearly, the nonterminals of an ITG must be chosen in a somewhat different manner than for a monolingual grammar, since they must simultaneously account for syntactic patterns of both languages. One might even decide to choose nonterminals for an ITG that do not match linguistic categories, sacrificing this to the goal of ensuring that all corresponding substrings can be aligned.","An ITG can accommodate a wider range of ordering variation between the lan-381 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3 Where is the Secretary of Finance when needed ?"]},{"title":"II~¢~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ J]~ ?

Moreover, it may even remain possible to align constituents for phenomena whose underlying structure is not context-free--say, ellipsis or coordination--as long as the surface structures of the two languages fortuitously parallel each other (though again the bracketing would be linguistically implausible). We will return to the subject of ITGs' ordering flexibility in Section 4.","We stress again that the primary purpose of ITGs is to maximize robustness for parallel corpus analysis rather than to verify grammaticality, and therefore writing grammars is made much easier since the grammars can be minimal and very leaky. We consider elsewhere an extreme special case of leaky ITGs, inversion-invariant transduction grammars, in which all productions occur with both orientations (Wu 1995).

A Normal Form for Inversion Transduction Grammars We now show that every ITG can be expressed as an equivalent ITG in a 2-normal form that simplifies algorithms and analyses on ITGs. In particular, the parsing algorithm of the next section operates on ITGs in normal form. The availability of a 2-normal 382 Wu Bilingual Parsing form is a noteworthy characteristic of ITGs; no such normal form is available for unrestricted context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars (Aho and Ullman 1969b).

Then Xi generates (e i+1.. .en, c i+1 ...C n) for all 1 ~ i < n - 1, so the new production A --+ [BIX1] also generates (e, c).

Expressiveness Characteristics","paragraphs":["We now turn to the expressiveness desiderata for a matching formalism. It is of course difficult to make precise claims as to what characteristics are necessary and/or sufficient for such a model, since no cognitive studies that are directly pertinent to bilingual constituent alignment are available. Nonetheless, most related previous parallel corpus analysis models share certain conceptual approaches with ours, loosely based on cross-linguistic theories related to constituency, case frames, or thematic roles, as well as computational feasibility needs. Below we survey the most common constraints and discuss their relation to ITGs.","Crossing Constraints. Arrangements where the matchings between subtrees cross each another are prohibited by"]},{"title":"crossing constraints,","paragraphs":["unless the subtrees' immediate parent constituents are also matched to each other. For example, given the constituent matchings depicted as solid lines in Figure 4, the dotted-line matchings corresponding to potential lexical translations would be ruled illegal. Crossing constraints are implicit in many phrasal matching approaches, both constituency-oriented (Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994) and dependency-oriented (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993). The theoretical cross-linguistic hypothesis here is that the core arguments of frames tend to stay together over different languages. The constraint is also useful for computational reasons, since it helps avoid exponential bilingual matching times.","ITGs inherently implement a crossing constraint; in fact, the version enforced by ITGs is even stronger. This is because even within a single constituent, immediate subtrees are only permitted to cross in exact inverted order. As we shall argue below, this restriction reduces matching flexibility in a desirable fashion.","Rank Constraints. The second expressiveness desideratum for a matching formalism is to somehow limit the rank of constituents (the number of children or right-hand-side symbols), which dictates the span over which matchings may cross. As the number of subtrees of an Ll-constituent grows, the number of possible matchings to subtrees of the corresponding L2-constituent grows combinatorially, with corresponding time complexity growth on the matching process. Moreover, if constituents can immediately dominate too many tokens of the sentences, the crossing constraint loses effectiveness--in the extreme, if a single constituent immediately dominates the entire sentence-pair, then any permutation is permissible without violating the crossing constraint. Thus, we would like to constrain the rank as much as possible, while still permitting some reasonable degree of permutation flexibility.","Recasting this issue in terms of the general class of context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars, the number of possible subtree matchings for a single constituent grows combinatorially with the number of symbols on a production's right-hand side. However, it turns out that the ITG restriction of allowing only matchings with straight or inverted orientation effectively cuts the combinatorial growth, while still maintaining flexibility where needed.","To see how ITGs maintain needed flexibility, consider Figure 5, which shows all 24 possible complete matchings between two constituents of length four each. Nearly all of these--22 out of 24--can be generated by an ITG, as shown by the parse trees (whose 384 Wu Bilingual Parsing The Security Bureau grante / authority to__the polic~ station Figure 4 The crossing constraint. nonterminal labels are omitted). 3 The 22 permitted matchings are representative of real transpositions in word order between the English-Chinese sentences in our data. The only two matchings that cannot be generated are very distorted transpositions that we might call \"inside-out\" matchings. We have been unable to find real examples in our data of constituent arguments undergoing \"inside-out\" transposition.","Note that this hypothesis is for fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese. It would not be expected to hold for so-called scrambling or free-word-order languages, or heavily inflected languages. However, inflections provide alternative surface cues for determining constituent roles (and 3 As discussed later, in many cases more than one parse tree can generate the same subconstituent matching.

Translation-driven Segmentation Segmentation of the input sentences is an important step in preparing bilingual corpora for various learning procedures. Different languages realize the same concept using varying numbers of words; for example, a single English word may surface as a compound in French. This complicates the problem of matching the words between a sentence-pair, since it means that compounds or collocations must sometimes be treated as lexical units. The translation lexicon is assumed to contain collocation translations to facilitate such multiword matchings. However, the input sentences do not come broken into appropriately matching chunks, so it is up to the parser to decide when to break up potential collocations into individual words.","The problem is particularly acute for English and Chinese because word boundaries are not orthographically marked in Chinese text, so not even a default chunking exists upon which word matchings could be postulated. (Sentences (2) and (5) demonstrate why the obvious trick of taking single characters as words is not a workable strategy.) The usual Chinese NLP architecture first preprocesses input text through a word segmentation module (Chiang et al. 1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1992, 1993; Chang and Chen 1993; Wu and Tseng 1993; Sproat et al. 1994; Wu and Fung 1994), but, clearly, bilingual parsing will be hampered by any errors arising from segmentation ambiguities that could not be resolved in the isolated monolingual context because even if the Chinese segmentation is acceptable monolingually, it may not agree with the words present in the English sentence. Matters are made still worse by unpredictable omissions in the translation lexicon, even for valid compounds.","We therefore extend the algorithm to optimize the Chinese sentence segmentation in conjunction with the bracketing process. Note that the notion of a Chinese \"word\" is a longstanding linguistic question, that our present notion of segmentation does not address. We adhere here to a purely task-driven definition of what a correct \"segmentation\" is, namely that longer segments are desirable only when no compositional translation is possible.

This requirement is becoming increasingly direct for the example-based machine translation paradigm (Nagao 1984), whose translation flexibility is strongly restricted if the examples are only at the sentential level. It can now be assumed that a parallel bilingual corpus may be aligned to the sentence level with reasonable accuracy (Kay and Ri3cheisen 1988; Catizone, Russel, and Warwick 1989; Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Chen 1993), even for languages as disparate as Chinese and English (Wu 1994). Algorithms for subsentential alignment have been developed as well as granularities of the character (Church 1993), word (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and Church 1994; Fung and McKeown 1994), collocation (Smadja 1992), and specially segmented (Kupiec 1993) levels. However, the identification of subsentential, nested, phrasal translations within the parallel texts remains a nontrivial problem, due to the added complexity of dealing with constituent structure. Manual phrasal matching is feasible only for small corpora, either for toy-prototype testing or for narrowly restricted applications.","Automatic approaches to identification of subsentential translation units have largely followed what we might call a \"parse-parse-match\" procedure. Each half of the parallel corpus is first parsed individually using a monolingual grammar. Subsequently, the constituents of each sentence-pair are matched according to some heuristic procedure. A number of recent proposals can be cast in this framework (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994).","The parse-parse-match procedure is susceptible to three weaknesses: Appropriate, robust, monolingual grammars may not be available. This condition is particularly relevant for many non-Western European languages such as Chinese. A grammar for this purpose must be robust since it must still identify constituents for the subsequent matching process even for unanticipated or ill-formed input sentences. 396 Wu Bilingual Parsing"]},{"title":"The grammars may be incompatible across languages.","paragraphs":["The best-matching constituent types between the two languages may not include the same core arguments.

To choose the best set of matchings, an optimization over some measure of overlap between the structural analysis of the two sentences is needed. Previous approaches to phrasal matching employ arbitrary heuristic functions on, say, the number of matched subconstituents.","Our method attacks the weaknesses of the parse-parse-match procedure by using (1) only a translation lexicon with no language-specific grammar, (2) a bilingual rather than monolingual formalism, and (3) a probabilistic formulation for resolving the choice between candidate arrangements. The approach differs in its single-stage operation that simultaneously chooses the constituents of each sentence and the matchings between them.","The raw phrasal translations suggested by the parse output were then filtered to remove those pairs containing more than 50% singletons, since such pairs are likely to be poor translation examples. Examples that occurred more than once in the corpus were also filtered out, since repetitive sequences in our corpus tend to be nongrammatical markup. This yielded approximately 2,800 filtered phrasal translations, some examples of which are shown in Figure 12. A random sample of the phrasal translation pairs was then drawn, giving a precision estimate of 81.5%.","Although this already represents a useful level of accuracy, it does not in our opinion reflect the full potential of the formalism. Inspection revealed that performance was greatly hampered by our noisy translation lexicon, which was automatically learned; it could be manually post-edited to reduce errors. Commercial on-line translation lexicons could also be employed if available. Higher precision could be also achieved without great effort by engineering a small number of broad nonterminal categories. This would reduce errors for known idiosyncratic patterns, at the cost of manual rule building.","The automatically extracted phrasal translation examples are especially useful where the phrases in the two languages are not compositionally derivable solely from obvious word translations.

This gives us an interesting alternative perspective, from the standpoint of algorithms that match the words between parallel sentences. By themselves, word alignments are of little use, but they provide potential anchor points for other applications, or for subsequent learning stages to acquire more interesting structures.","Word alignment is difficult because correct matchings are not usually linearly ordered, i.e., there are crossings. Without some additional constraints, any word position in the source sentence can be matched to any position in the target sentence, an assumption that leads to high error rates. More sophisticated word alignment algorithms therefore attempt to model the intuition that proximate constituents in close relationships in one language remain proximate in the other. The later IBM models are formulated to prefer collocations (Brown et al. 1993). In the case of"]},{"title":"word_align","paragraphs":["(Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Dagan and Church 1994), a penalty is imposed according to the deviation from an ideal matching, as constructed by linear interpolation?","From this point of view, the proposed technique is a word alignment method that imposes a more realistic distortion penalty. The tree structure reflects the assumption that crossings should not be penalized as long as they are consistent with constituent structure. Figure 7 gives theoretical upper bounds on the matching flexibility as the lengths of the sequences increase, where the constituent structure constraints are reflected by high flexibility up to length-4 sequences and a rapid drop-off thereafter. In other words, ITGs appeal to a language universals hypothesis, that the core arguments of frames, which exhibit great ordering variation between languages, are relatively few and surface in syntactic proximity. Of course, this assumption over-simplistically 4 Direct comparison with"]},{"title":"word_align","paragraphs":["should be avoided, however, since it is intended to work on corpora whose sentences are not aligned. 398 Wu Bilingual Parsing blends syntactic and semantic notions. That semantic frames for different languages share common core arguments is more plausible than that syntactic frames do. In effect we are relying on the tendency of syntactic arguments to correlate closely with semantics. If in particular cases this assumption does not hold, however, the damage is not too great--the model will simply drop the offending word matchings (dropping as few as possible).","In experiments with the minimal bracketing transduction grammar, the large majority of errors in word alignment were caused by two outside factors. First, word matchings can be overlooked simply due to deficiencies in our translation lexicon. This accounted for approximately 42% of the errors. Second, sentences containing nonliteral translations obviously cannot be aligned down to the word level. This accounted for another approximate 50% of the errors. Excluding these two types of errors, accuracy on word alignment was 96.3%. In other words, the tree structure constraint is strong enough to prevent most false matches, but almost never inhibits correct word matches when they exist. 9. Bilingual Constraint Transfer 9.1 Monolingual Parse Trees A parse may be available for one of the languages, especially for well-studied languages such as English. Since this eliminates all degrees of freedom in the English sentence structure, the parse of the Chinese sentence must conform with that given for the English. Knowledge of English bracketing is thus used to help parse the Chinese sentence; this method facilitates a kind of transfer of grammatical expertise in one language toward bootstrapping grammar acquisition in another.","A parsing algorithm for this case can be implemented very efficiently.

Special cases of particular interest include applications where bracketing or word alignment constraints may be derived from external sources beforehand. For example, a broad-coverage English bracketer may be available. If such constraints are reliable, it would be wasteful to ignore them.","A straightforward extension to the original algorithm inhibits hypotheses that are inconsistent with given constraints. Any entries in the dynamic programming table corresponding to illegal subhypotheses--i.e., those that would violate the given bracket-nesting or word alignment conditions--are preassigned negative infinity values during initialization indicating impossibility. During the recursion phase, computa-tion of these entries is skipped. Since their probabilities remain impossible throughout, the illegal subhypotheses will never participate in any ML bibracketing. The running time reduction in this case depends heavily on the domain constraints.","We have found this strategy to be useful for incorporating punctuation constraints. Certain punctuation characters give constituency indications with high reliability; \"perfect separators\" include colons and Chinese full stops, while \"perfect delimiters\" include parentheses and quotation marks. 10. Unrestricted-Form Grammars It is possible to construct a parser that accepts unrestricted-form, rather than normal-form, grammars. In this case an Earley-style scheme (Earley 1970), employing an active chart, can be used. The time complexity remains the same as the normal-form case.","We have found this to be useful in practice. For bracketing grammars of the type considered in this paper, there is no advantage. However, for more complex, linguistically structured grammars, the more flexible parser does not require the unreasonable numbers of productions that can easily arise from normal-form requirements. For most grammars, we have found performance to be comparable or faster than the normal-form parser. 11. Conclusion The twin concepts of bilingual language modeling and bilingual parsing have been proposed. We have introduced a new formalism, the inversion transduction grammar, and surveyed a variety of its applications to extracting linguistic information from parallel corpora. Its amenability to stochastic formulation, useful flexibility with leaky and minimal grammars, and tractability for practical applications are desirable properties. Various tasks such as segmentation, word alignment, and bracket annotation are naturally incorporated as subproblems, and a high degree of compatibility with conventional monolingual methods is retained. In conjunction with automatic procedures for learning word translation lexicons, SITGs bring relatively underexploited bilingual 400 Wu Bilingual Parsing correlations to bear on the task of extracting linguistic information for languages less studied than English.","We are currently pursuing several directions. We are developing an iterative training method based on expectation-maximization for estimating the probabilities from parallel training corpora. Also, in contrast to the applications discussed here, which deal with analysis and annotation of parallel corpora, we are working on incorporating the SITG model directly into our run-time translation architecture. The initial results indicate excellent performance gains.
