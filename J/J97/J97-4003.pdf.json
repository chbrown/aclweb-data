A compiler is described which translates a set of lexical rules and their interaction into a definite clause encoding, which is called by the base lexical entries in the lexicon. This way, the disjunctive possibilities arising from lexical rule application are encoded as systematic covariation in the specification of lexical entries. The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding. The final output of the compiler constitutes an efficient computational counterpart of the linguistic generalizations captured by lexical rules and allows on-the-fly application of lexical rules. 1. Introduction In the paradigm of HPSG, lexical rules have become one of the key mechanisms used in current linguistic analysis. Computationally, lexical rules have mainly been dealt with in two ways: On the one hand, lexical rules are used to expand out the full lexicon at compile-time. On the other hand, lexical rules are encoded as unary phrase structure rules. Both of these computational treatments of lexical rules, however, have significant shortcomings with respect to lexical rules as used in HPSG.","A computational treatment expanding out the lexicon cannot be used for the in-creasing number of HPSG analyses that propose lexical rules that would result in an infinite lexicon. Most current HPSG analyses of Dutch, German, Italian, and French fall into that category. 1 Furthermore, since lexical rules in such an approach only serve in a precompilation step, the generalizations captured by the lexical rules cannot be used at run-time. Finally, all such treatments of lexical rules currently available presuppose a fully explicit notation of lexical rule specifications that transfer properties not changed by the lexical rules to the newly created lexical entry. This conflicts with the standard assumption made in HPSG that only the properties changed by a lexical rule need be mentioned. As shown in Meurers (1994) this is a well-motivated conven-tion since it avoids splitting up lexical rules to transfer the specifications that must be preserved for different lexical entries. • The authors are listed alphabetically.

Also an analysis treating adjunct extraction via lexical rules (van Noord and Bouma 1994) results in an infinite lexicon.

In addition, computationally treating lexical rules on a par with phrase structure rules fails to take computational advantage of their specific properties. For example, the interaction of lexical rules is explored at run-time, even though the possible interaction can be determined at compile-time given the information available in the lexical rules and the base lexical entries. 2","Based on the research results reported in Meurers and Minnen (1995, 1996), we propose a new computational treatment of lexical rules that overcomes these shortcomings and results in a more efficient processing of lexical rules as used in HPSG. We developed a compiler that takes as its input a set of lexical rules, deduces the necessary transfer of properties not changed by the individual lexical rules, and encodes the set of lexical rules and their interaction into definite relations constraining lexical entries. Each lexical entry is automatically extended with a definite clause encoding of the lexical rule applications which the entry can undergo.

The resulting encoding allows the execution of lexical rules on-the-fly, i.e., coroutined with other constraints at some time after lexical lookup. The computational treatment of lexical rules proposed can be seen as an extension to the principled method discussed by G6tz and Meurers (1995, 1996, 1997b) for encoding the main building block of HPSG grammars--the implicative constraints--as a logic program.","The structure of the paper is as follows: We start with a brief introduction of the formal background on which our approach is based in Section 2. We then describe (Section 3) how lexical rules and their interaction can be encoded in a definite clause encoding that expresses systematic covariation in lexical entries. We show how the encoding of lexical rule interaction can be improved by specializing it for different word classes and, in Section 4, focus on an improvement of this specialization step by means of program transformation techniques. A further improvement relevant to on-the-fly application of lexical rules is presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss implementation results and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed encoding. A comparison with other computational approaches to lexical rules (Section 7) and some concluding remarks (Section 8) end the paper. 2. Background In this section we introduce the formal setup of HPSG grammars that we assume and discuss two ways to formalize a lexical rule mechanism and their consequences for a computational treatment. 2.1 A Formal Setup for HPSG Grammars An HPSG grammar formally consists of two parts (Pollard and Sag 1994): The"]},{"title":"signature","paragraphs":["defines the ontology of linguistic objects, and the"]},{"title":"theory,","paragraphs":["i.e., the usually implicative constraints encoding the grammatical principles, describes the subset of those linguistic 2 This is not to say that a special precompilation treatment along those lines would not be profitable for phrase structure rules. In fact, such a proposal is made by Torisawa and Tsuji (1996). 544 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules objects that are grammatical. The constraints constituting the theory are expressions of a formal language that define the set of grammatical objects, in the sense that every grammatical object is described by every principle in the theory.","The signature consists of the type hierarchy defining which types of objects exist and the appropriateness conditions specifying which objects have which features defined on them to represent their properties. 3 A signature is interpreted as follows: Every object is assigned exactly one most specific type, and in case a feature is appropriate for some object of a certain type, then it is appropriate for all objects of this type. 4","A logic that provides the formal architecture required by Pollard and Sag (1994) was defined by King (1989, 1994). The formal language of King allows the expression of grammatical principles using type assignments to refer to the type of an object and path equalities to require the (token) identity of objects. These atomic expressions can be combined using conjunction, disjunction, and negation. The expressions are interpreted by a set-theoretical semantics. 2.2 Lexical Rules in HPSG While the setup of King provides a clear formal basis for basic HPSG grammars, nothing is said about how special linguistic mechanisms like lexical rules fit into this formal setup. Two formalizations of lexical rules as used by HPSG linguists have been proposed, the meta-level lexical rules (MLRs; Calcagno 1995; Calcagno and Pollard 1995) and the .description-level lexical rules (DLRs; Meurers 1995). 5 2.2.1 Meta-Level Lexical Rules. The MLR approach sees lexical rules in the more traditional sense as relations between lexical entries, i.e., descriptions of word objects. The set of lexical entries constituting the lexicon is closed under the application of lexical rules, which results in a (possibly infinite) set of lexical entries. In order to be grammatical, every word object occurring in a sentence has to be described by one of the descriptions in this expanded lexicon set. In the MLR setup, lexical rules are thus external to the rest of the theory, they only serve to provide an expanded lexicon set. Licensing grammatical words is then done by this set--the lexical rules play no direct role. Externalizing the lexicon and lexical rule application from the theory in such a way has an interesting consequence, namely that the lexical entries serving as input to a lexical rule are not tested for grammaticality.","A computational treatment of lexical rules that expands out the lexicon at compile-time closely resembles the MLR interpretation of lexical rules. The work on MLRs can therefore be seen as providing a semantics for such a computational treatment. It also allows a clear view of its restrictions: First, no restrictions on lexical entries serving as input to a lexical rule can be enforced that cannot be executed on the basis of the information present in the lexical entry alone, 6 and second, grammars including lexical rules that, under the MLR formalization, result in an infinite lexicon, can only 3 The terminology used in the literature varies. Types are also referred to as sorts, appropriateness conditions as feature declarations, and features as attributes. To avoid confusion, we will only use the terminology introduced in the text. 4 This interpretation of the signature is sometimes referred to as closed world (Gerdemann and King 1994; Gerdemann 1995). 5 An in-depth discussion including a comparison of both approaches is provided in Calcagno, Meurers, and Pollard (in preparation). 6 The Partial-VP Topicalization Lexical Rule proposed by Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994, 10) is a linguistic example. The in-specification of this lexical rule makes use of an append relation to constrain the valence attribute of the auxiliaries serving as its input. In the lexicon, however, the complements of an auxiliary are uninstantiated because it raises the arguments of its verbal complement. 545 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 simple-word ---* LE1 v .. • V LEn derived-word ~ ([IN LRl-in] A LRl-out) V ...

The DLR approach formalizes lexical rules as relations between word objects. Lexical rules under this approach are part of the theory, just like any other constraint of the grammar, and they relate the word objects licensed by the base lexical entries to another set of well-formed word objects. Thus, under the DLR approach, no new lexical entries are created, but the theory itself is extended in order to include lexical rules. One possibility for extending the theory is to introduce two subtypes of"]},{"title":"word,","paragraphs":["i.e.,"]},{"title":"simple-word","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"derived-word,","paragraphs":["and define an additional feature IN with appropriate value"]},{"title":"word","paragraphs":["for objects of type"]},{"title":"derived-word.","paragraphs":["The principles encoding the extended lexicon in such an approach are shown in Figure 1.

While this introduces the recursion necessary to permit successive lexical rule application, it also grounds the recursion in a word described by a base lexical entry. Contrary to the MLR setup, the DLR formalization therefore requires all words feeding lexical rules to be grammatical with respect to the theory.","Since lexical rules are expressed in the theory just like any other part of the theory, they are represented in the same way, as unary immediate dominance schemata. 8 This conception of lexical rules thus can be understood as underlying the computational approach that treats lexical rules as unary phrase structure rules as, for example, adopted in the LKB system (Copestake 1992). Both the input and output of a lexical rule, i.e., the mother and the daughter of a phrase structure rule, are available during a generation or parsing process. As a result, in addition to the information present in the lexical entry, syntactic information can be accessed to execute the constraints on the input of a lexical rule. The computational treatment of lexical rules that we propose in this paper is essentially a domain-specific refinement of such an approach to lexical rules. 9 2.2.3 Lexical Rule Specification and Framing. An important difference between unary immediate dominance schemata and lexical rules, however, is that immediate dominance schemata are fully specified in the linguistic theory and can thus be directly interpreted as a relation on objects. Lexical rules, on the other hand, are usually not 7 This approach is, for example, taken in the ALE system. See Section 7 for more discussion of different computational approaches. 8 Elaborating this analogy, the IN feature of derived words can be understood as the DTRS feature of a phrase. 9 See Section 7 for a more detailed discussion of the relation between our approach and this perspective on lexical rules. 546 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules sl ] LOC] CAT LOC[CAT HEAD VAL"]},{"title":"HAVrFbVFOOpsP tlJ su , INDEX [VAL (IL 'CONT","paragraphs":["LCOMpS /[LOC]CONTll NDEX [~]1 []","t---+ VFORM"]},{"title":"pas]","paragraphs":["SUBJ / [LOC] CONT [ INDEX []]/ / ([LOC ICATI HEAD"]},{"title":"prep[ PFORM","paragraphs":["COMPS [] O L CONT]INDEX [] Figure 2 A passivization lexical rule. written as fully specified relations between words, rather, only what is supposed to be changed is specified.","Consider, for example, the lexical rule in Figure 2, which encodes a passive lexicai rule like the one presented by Pollard and Sag (1987, 215) in terms of the setup of Pollard and Sag (1994, ch. 9). This lexical rule could be used in a grammar of English to relate past participle forms of verbs to their passive form2 ° The rule takes the index of the least oblique complement of the input and assigns it to the subject of the output. The index that the subject bore in the input is assigned to an optional prepositional complement in the output.","Only the verb form and some indices are specified to be changed, and thus other input properties, like the phonology, the semantics, or the nonlocal specifications, are preserved in the output. This is so since the lexical rule in Figure 2 \"(like all lexical rules in HPSG) preserves all properties of the input not mentioned in the rule.\" (Pollard and Sag [1994, 314], following Flickinger [1987]).

The formalization of DLRs provided by Meurers (1995) defines a formal lexical rule specification language and provides a semantics for that language in two steps: A rewrite system enriches the lexical rule specification into a fully explicit description of the kind shown in Figure 1. This description can then be given the standard set-theoretical interpretation of King (1989, 1994). 11","10 Note that the passivization lexical rule in Figure 2 is only intended to illustrate the mechanism.

Lexical Covariation: Encoding Lexical Rules and their Interaction as Definite Relations Having situated the computational approach presented in this paper as a computational treatment of DLRs that emphasizes their domain-specific properties, we now turn to the compiler that realizes this approach. We describe four compilation steps that translate a set of lexical rules, as specified by the linguist, and their interaction into definite relations to constrain lexical entries. To give the reader a global idea of our approach, we focus on those aspects of the compiler that are crucial to the presented conception of lexical rules. The different steps of the compiler are discussed with emphasis on understandability and not on formal details. 13","Figure 3 shows the overall setup of the compiler. The first compilation step, discussed in Section 3.1, translates lexical rules into a definite clause representation and derives, for each lexical rule, a frame predicate that ensures the transfer of properties that remain unchanged. In the second compilation step (Section 3.2), we determine the possible interaction of the lexical rules. This results in a finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction, i.e., the interaction of lexical rules irrespective of the lexical entries in the lexicon. In the subsequent step of word class specialization (Section 3.3) this finite-state automaton is fine-tuned for each of the natural classes of lexical entries in the lexicon. In the fourth compilation step (Section 3.4) these automata are translated into definite relations and the lexical entries are adapted to call the definite relation corresponding to the automaton fine-tuned for the natural class to which they belong. 3.1 Lexical Rules as Definite Relations and the Automatic Specification of Frames We start by translating each lexical rule into a definite clause predicate, called the"]},{"title":"lexical rdle predicate.","paragraphs":["The first argument of a lexical rule predicate corresponds to the in-specification of the lexical rule and the second argument to its out-specification.","Assume the signature in Figure 4 on which we base the example throughout the paper and suppose the lexical rule specification shown in Figure 5.14 This lexical rule applies to base lexical entries that unify 15 with the in-specification, i.e., lexical entries specifying B and Y as -. The derived lexical entry licenses word objects with + as the value of x and Y, and b as that of A.","The translation of the lexical rule into a predicate is trivial. The result is displayed description language.","12 In order to focus on the computational aspects of the covariation approach, in this paper we will not go into a discussion of the full lexical rule specification language introduced in Meurers (1995).

We here assume unification as the application criterion, which formally corresponds to the conjunction of descriptions and their conversion to normal form (G6tz 1994). Computationally, a subsumption test could equally well be used in our compiler. 548 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules input: output: Figure 3 The compiler setup."]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["xico~ + translation","I of lexical rules","into definite relations ~~~~~f ~ ~me","determination of lexical rule interaction word class","3 specialization of lexical rule interaction","pruned finite state //","translation","4 of lexical rules interaction into definite relations in Figure 6.

As discussed in Section 2.2.3, features specified in a lexical entry unifying with the in-specification of the lexical rule that are not specified differently in the out-specification of the lexical rule are intended to receive the same value on the derived word as on the input: The compiler implements this by enriching the lexical rule with type specifications and path equalities between the in- and the out-specification to arrive at an explicit representation of its frame.","The detection of which additional specifications are intended by the linguist crucially depends on the interpretation of the signature assumed in HPSG, discussed in Section 2.1. This interpretation makes it possible to determine which kind of word objects (by ontological status fully specified) may undergo the rule.

So, on the basis of the signature, we can determine which \"appropriate\" paths the linguist left unspecified in the out-specification of the lexical rule. For those appropriate paths not specified in the out-specification, one can then add path equalities between the in- and the out-specifications of the lexical rule to ensure framing of those path values.","Frame specification becomes slightly more difficult when one considers type specifications of those paths in words serving as input to a lexical rule that occur in the out-specification of the lexical rule but are not assigned a type value. For example, the lexical rule 1 of Figure 6 applies to word objects with tl as their c value and to those having t2 as their c value. With respect to frame specification this means that there can be lexical entries, such as the one in Figure 7, for which we need to make sure that tl as the value of c gets transferred. 16","One would think that the type information tl, which is more specific than that","16 A linguistic example based on the signature given by Pollard and Sag (1994) would be a lexical rule deriving predicative signs from nonpredicative ones, i.e., changing the PRD value of substantive signs from - to +, much like the lexical rule for NPs given by Pollard and Sag (1994, p. 360, fn. 20). In such a Predicative Lexical Rule (which we only note as an example and not as a linguistic proposal) the subtype of the head object undergoing the rule as well as the value of the features only appropriate for the subtypes of substantive either is lost or must be specified by a separate rule for each of the subtypes. 550 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules b"]},{"title":"lex lel, [:, _,]ollx framel Figure 8","paragraphs":["Lexical rule predicate representing lexical rule 1."]},{"title":"[B o lIB ]c w r","paragraphs":["frame_l( , ). frame_l( |W"]},{"title":"tl [ ~1] Ch[W ~] L t2LZ Figure 9","paragraphs":["Definition of the frame predicate for lexical rule 1. given in the output of the lexical rule, can be specified on the out-specification of the lexical rule if the specification of c is transferred as a whole (via structure sharing of the value of c).

The problem seems to be that there is no notion of sharing just the type of an object. However, introducing such type sharing would not actually solve the problem, since one also needs to account for additional appropriate features. The subtypes of t have different appropriate features, the values of which have to be preserved. In particular, in case the lexical entry has t2 as the value of c, we need to ensure that the value of the feature z is transferred properly.","To ensure that no information is lost as a result of applying a lexical rule, it seems to be necessary to split up the lexical rule to make each instance deal with a specific case.

In the latter case, we can also take care of transferring the value of z. However, as discussed by Meurers (1994), creating several instances of lexical rules can be avoided.

One can represent this information about the interaction of lexical rules as a more complex finite-state automaton, which can be used to avoid trying lexical rule applications at run-time that are bound to fail. To derive a finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction, we first determine which lexical rules can possibly follow which other lexical rules in a grammar.

This excludes lexical","21 The reason for first determining the automaton on the basis of the follow relation alone, instead of taking propagation of specifications into account right from the start, is that the follow relations allow a very simple construction of a finite-state automaton representing lexical rule interaction. Using unification right away would significantly complicate the algorithm, in particular for automata containing cycles.","22 Note that in the case of transitions belonging to a cycle, only those transitions can be removed that are useless at the first visit and after any traversal of the cycle. 554 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules"]},{"title":"j]","paragraphs":["W -- ). lex_entry( C X i Z ,b t2 Figure 15 A lexical entry. rules 1 and 2 as possible followers of that sequence since their in-specifications do not unify with those values. As a result, the arcs 1(q7, q2) and 2(q9, q3), which are marked with grey dots in Figure 14, can be removed.","Two problems remain: First, because of the procedural interpretation of lexical rules, duplicate lexical entries can possibly be derived. And second, relative to a specific lexical entry, many sequences of lexical rules that are bound to fail are tried any-way. We tackle these problems by means of word class specialization, i.e., we prune the automaton with respect to the propagation of specifications belonging to the base lexical entries. 3.3 Word Class Specialization of Lexical Rule Interaction In the third compilation step, the finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction is fine-tuned for each base lexical entry in the lexicon. The result is a pruned finite-state automaton. The pruning is done by performing the lexical rule applications corresponding to the transitions in the automaton representing global lexical rule interaction. To ensure termination in case of direct or indirect cycles, we use a subsumption check. If the application of a particular lexical rule with respect to a lexical entry fails, we know that the corresponding transition can be pruned for that entry. In case of indirect or direct cycles in the automaton, however, we cannot derive all possible lexical entries, as there may be infinitely many. Even though one can prune certain transitions even in such cyclic cases, it is possible that certain inapplicable transitions remain in the pruned automaton. However, this is not problematic since the lexical rule application corresponding to such a transition will simply fail at run-time.","Consider the base lexical entry in Figure 15. With respect to this base lexical entry, we fine-tune the finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction by pruning transitions. In the automaton of Figure 14, we can prune the transitions {3(q2, q8), 4(q2, q6), 3(q3, q11), 4(q3, ql0), 3(ql, q4), 4(ql, q5)}, because the lexical rules 3 and 4 can not be applied to a (derived) lexical entry that does not have both w and x of value +. As a consequence, the states q8, q15, q11, q18, q4, and q12 are no longer reachable and the following transitions can be eliminated as well: {3(q8,q8), 4(q8, q15), 3(q11, q11), 4(q11, q18), 3(q4, q4), 4(q4, q12)}. We can also eliminate the transitions {4(q7,q13),4(q9, q17)}, because the lexical rule 4 requires the value of z to be empty list. Note that the lexical rules 3 and 4 remain applicable in q14 and q16.","Furthermore, due to the procedural interpretation of lexical rules in a computational system (in contrast to the original declarative intention), there can be sequences of lexical rule applications that produce identical entries. 23 To avoid having arcs in the pruned automaton leading to such identical entries, we use a tabulation method","23 Note that the order in which two lexical rules are applied is immaterial as long as both rules modify the value of different features of a lexical entry. 555 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4","3 1 2 3 ~,.,~ 4 q3 Figure 16 Pruned finite state automaton representing lexical rule interaction for a lexical entry. during word class specialization that keeps track of the feature structures obtained for each node. If we find a feature structure for a node qn that is identical to the feature structure corresponding to another node qm, the arc leading to qn or the arc leading to qm is discarded. 24 In the example, q7 and q9 are such identical nodes. So we can discard either 2(q2, q7) or 1(q3, q9) and eliminate the arcs from states that then become unreachable. Choosing to discard 1(q3, q9), the pruned automaton for the example lexical entry looks as displayed in Figure 16. 25","Note that word class specialization of lexical rule interaction does not influence the representation of the lexical rules themselves. Pruning the finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction only involves restricting lexical rule interaction in relation to the lexical entries in the lexicon.","The fine-tuning of the automaton representing lexical rule interaction results in a finite-state automaton for each lexical entry in the lexicon. However, identical automata are obtained for certain groups of lexical entries and, as shown in the next section, each automaton is translated into definite relations only once. We therefore automatically group the lexical entries into the natural classes for which the linguist intended a certain sequence of lexical rule applications to be possible. 26 No additional hand-specification is required. Moreover, the alternative computational treatment to expand out the full lexicon at compile-time is just as costly and, furthermore, impossible in case of an infinite lexicon.","An interesting aspect of the idea of representing lexical rule interaction for particular word classes is that this allows a natural encoding of exceptions to lexical rules. More specifically, the linguist specifies exceptions as a special property of either a lexical rule or a lexical entry. During word class specialization, the compiler then deals with such specifications by pruning the corresponding transitions in the finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule interaction for the particular lexical entry under consideration. This results in an encoding of exceptions to a lexical rule in the interaction predicate called by the irregular lexical entries. An advantage of the setup presented is that entries that behave according to subregularities will automatically be grouped together again and call the same interaction predicate. The final representa-","24 In general, there is not always enough information available to determine whether two sequences of lexical rule applications produce identical entries. This is because in order to be able to treat recursive lexical rules producing infinite lexica, we perform word class specialization of the interaction predicate instead of expanding out the lexicon.","25 Note that an automaton can be made even more deterministic by unfurling instances of cycles prior to pruning. In our example, unfurling the direct cycle by replacing 3(q14, q14) with {3(q14, q14~), 3(q14 ~, q14~), 4(q14 ~, q19~)} would allow pruning of the cyclic transition 3(q14 ~, q14 ~) and the transition 4(q14, q19).

Partial Unfolding of Frame Predicates The automata resulting from word class specialization group the lexical entries into natural classes. In case the automata corresponding to two lexical entries are identical, the entries belong to the same natural class. However, each lexical rule application, i.e., each transition in an automaton, calls a frame predicate that can have a large number of defining clauses. Intuitively understood, each defining clause of a frame predicate corresponds to a subclass of the class of lexical entries to which a lexical rule can be applied. During word class specialization, though, when the finite-state automaton representing global lexical rule application is pruned with respect to a particular base lexical entry, we know which subclass we are dealing with. For each interaction defini-tion we can therefore check which of the flame clauses are applicable and discard the non-applicable ones.

On-the-fly Application of Lexical Rules We want our compiler to produce an encoding of lexical rules that allows us to execute lexical rules on-the-fly, i.e., at some time after lexical lookup. This is advantageous because postponing the execution of the interaction predicates allows more constraints on the word to be collected. When the interaction predicate is finally called, as a result of syntactic information being present, many of its possible solutions simply fail. The search tree that would have resulted from pursuing these possibilities at the beginning of processing does not have to be explored. 31","As it stands, our encoding of lexical rules and their application as covariation in lexical entries does not yet support the application of lexical rules on-the-fly.

In the following, we show that the additional specifications on the extended lexical entry needed to guide processing can be deduced automatically. 5.1 Constraint Propagation The intuitive idea behind this improvement of the covariation encoding is to lift into the extended lexical entry the information that is ensured after all sequences of possible lexical rule applications for a particular base lexical entry have occurred. Note that this is not an unfolding step. Unfolding the interaction predicates with respect to the lexical entries basically expands out the lexicon off-line. Instead, what we do is factor out the information common to all definitions of the called interaction predicate by computing the most specific generalization of these definitions.","The most specific generalization does not necessarily provide additional constraining information. However, usually it is the case that lexical entries resulting from lexical rule application differ in very few specifications compared to the number of specifications in a base lexical entry. Most of the specifications of a lexical entry are assumed to be passed unchanged via the automatically generated frame specification.

Encoding the disjunctive possibilities for lexical rule application in this way, instead of with definite clause attachments, makes all relevant lexical information available at lexical lookup.

For example, in the case of generation, underspecification of the head of a construction can lead to massive nondeterminism or even nontermination when not enough restricting information is available to generate its complements (Martinovi4 and Strzalkowski 1992; Minnen, Gerdemann, and G6tz 1995). Criteria to determine when it is most profitable to execute calls to an interaction predicate are required.","One possibility is to annotate the lexical rule encoding with such criteria by means of delay statements, as, for example, suggested by van Noord and Bouma (1994). While we consider this kind of control facility (Naish [1986] and references therein) to be, in general, indispensable for efficient processing, it also has disadvantages that make it desirable to search for alternative or additional mechanisms: Delay statements presuppose the procedural annotation of an otherwise declarative specification. Substantial computational expertise is required to provide restrictions on the instantiation status of a goal, which must be fulfilled before the goal can be executed. Furthermore, the computational bookkeeping necessary for the delaying mechanism is very expensive. An interesting alternative, therefore, is to automatically determine certain control problems and deal with them in an off-line fashion along the lines of Minnen, Gerdemann, and G6tz (1995) and Minnen, Gerdemann, and Hinrichs (1996). They describe the use of a dataflow analysis for an off-line improvement of grammars that determines automatically when a particular goal in a clause can best be executed. 6. Efficiency Evaluation The computational treatment of lexical rules as covariation in lexical entries was implemented in Prolog by the authors in cooperation with Dieter Martini for the ConTroll system (Gerdemann and King 1994; G6tz and Meurers 1997a). We tested the covariation approach with a complex grammar implementing an HPSG analysis covering the so-called aux-flip phenomenon, and partial-VP topicalization in the three clause types of German (Hinrichs, Meurers, and Nakazawa 1994). This test grammar includes eight lexical rules; some serve syntactic purposes, like the Partial-VP Topicalization Lexical Rule, others are of morphological nature as, for example, an inflectional lexical rule that relates nonfinite verbs to their finite form. Our compiler distinguished seven word classes. Some nouns and most verbal lexical entries fed lexical rules, and a single base lexical entry resulted in up to 12 derivations. 6.1 Time Efficiency To evaluate the time efficiency of the covariation encoding, we compared the parse times for our test grammar with three different computational encodings of the lexicon: 562 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules the expanded out lexicon, the basic covariation encoding, and the covariation encoding improved by constraint propagation. 33","As discussed in Section 5.1, the parsing times with a covariation lexicon without constraint propagation suffer significantly from the lack of information directly available upon lexical lookup. For the test grammar, the resulting extended search-space of parsing with the basic covariation encoding leads to a performance that is, on average, 18 times slower than that with the expanded out lexicon.","The use of constraint propagation, however, makes it possible to exploit the covariation encoding of lexical rule application such that it results in an increase in speed. Parsing with the test grammar using the constraint propagated covariation lexicon is, on average, 25 percent faster than the performance with the expanded out lexicon. The representation of lexical information in a constraint propagated covariation lexicon makes the maximum information available at lexical lookup while requiring a minimum number of nondeterministic choices to obtain this information.","Summing up, the relation between parsing times with the expanded out (EXP), the covariation (COV), and the constraint propagated covariation (IMP) lexicon for the test grammar can be represented as IMP : EXP : COV = 0.75 : 1 : 18. With respect to our test grammar, the constraint propagated covariation lexicon thus is the fastest lexical encoding."]},{"title":"6.2 Space Efficiency","paragraphs":["Besides the effect of requiring a minimum of nondeterministic choices and thereby reducing the number of resolution steps to increase time efficiency, the covariation encoding of lexical rules can result in an additional speedup since it reduces the space requirements of large grammars.","A comparison of space efficiency between an expanded out and a covariation lexicon needs to compare two different encodings. The expanded out lexicon consists solely of lexical entries, whereas the covariation lexicon is made up of three different data structures: the extended base lexical entries, the interaction predicates, and the lexical rule predicates. We focus on a qualitative evaluation of space efficiency, rather than on providing results for the test grammar, since the space efficiency of the covariation encoding relative to the expanded out lexicon is dependent on several properties of the grammar: the number of lexical entries in the lexicon that can undergo lexical rule application, the size of the lexical entries, and the number of lexical entries belonging to a word class.","Since only base lexical entries that feed lexical rules are modified by the lexical rule compiler, the covariation encoding naturally only results in space savings for those lexical entries to which lexical rules apply.","The space efficiency is dependent on the size of the lexical entries since in the covariation encoding much of the lexical information that is specified in a base lexical entry is not duplicated in the lexical entries that can be derived from it, as is the case for an expanded lexicon. Thus, the more information represented in a base lexical entry, the greater the space saving achieved by the covariation encoding. In lexically oriented grammar formalisms like HPSG, the lexical entries are highly information rich. A covariation treatment of HPSG lexica therefore can be particularly profitable.","The number of lexical entries belonging to a word class is relevant since the interaction predicates are identical for all lexical entries belonging to the same word class.","33 The lexicon of the test grammar can be expanded out off-line since the recursive Complement Extraction Lexical Rule applies only to full verbs, i.e, lexical entries with a complement list of finite length. As a result, the grammar does not have an infinite lexicon. 563 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 This means that the more lexical entries in a word class, the greater the saving in space. The covariation approach therefore is particularly attractive for grammars with a large lexicon. 7. Related Work The powerful mechanism of lexical rules (Carpenter 1991) has been used in many natural language processing systems. In this section we briefly discuss some of the more prominent approaches and compare them with the treatment proposed in this paper. 7.1 Off-line Expansion of Lexical Rules A common computational treatment of lexical rules adopted, for example, in the ALE system (Carpenter and Penn 1994) consists of computing the transitive closure of the base lexical entries under lexical rule application at compile-time. While this provides a front-end to include lexical rules in the grammars, it has the disadvantage that the generalizations captured by lexical rules are not used for computation. We mentioned in Section 2.2 that eliminating lexical rules in a precompilation step makes it impossible to process lexical rules or lexical entries that impose constraints that can only be properly executed once information from syntactic processing is available. A related problem is that for analyses resulting in infinite lexica, the number of lexical rule applications needs to be limited. In the ALE system, for example, a depth bound can be specified for this purpose. Finally, as shown in Section 6, using an expanded out lexicon can be less time and space efficient than using a lexicon encoding that makes computational use of generalizations over lexical information, as, for example, the covariation encoding. 7.2 Lexical Rules as Unary Phrase Structure Rules Another common approach to lexical rules is to encode them as unary phrase structure rules. This approach is taken, for example, in LKB (Copestake 1992) where lexical rules are introduced on a par with phrase structure rules and the parser makes no distinction between lexical and nonlexical rules (Copestake 1993, 31). A similar method is included in PATR-II (Shieber et al. 1983) and can be used to encode lexical rules as binary relations in the CUF system (Dbrre and Eisele 1991; D6rre and Dorna 1993b) or the TFS system (Emele and Zajac 1990; Emele 1994). The covariation approach described in this paper can be viewed as a domain-specific refinement of such a treatment of lexical rules.","The encoding of lexical rules used in the covariation approach is related to the work of van Noord and Bouma (1994), who describe the hand-encoding of a single lexical rule as definite relations and show how these relations can be used to constrain a lexical entry. The covariation approach builds on this proposal and extends it in three ways: First, the approach shows how to detect and encode the interaction of a set of lexical rules. Second, it provides a way to automatically obtain a definite clause encoding of lexical rules and their interaction. Finally, it automatically derives the frame specification for lexical rules such that, following standard HPSG practice, only the information changed in a lexical rule needs to be specified. 7.3 Alternative Ways to Express Lexical Generalizations Lexical rules have not gone unchallenged as a mechanism for expressing generalizations over lexical information. In a number of proposals, lexical generalizations are captured using lexical underspecification (Kathol 1994; Krieger and Nerbonne 1992; 564 Meurers and Minnen Covariation Approach to HPSG Lexical Rules Riehemann 1993; Oliva 1994; Frank 1994; Opalka 1995; Sanfilippo 1995). The lexical entries are only partially specified, and various specializations are encoded via the type hierarchy, definite clause attachments, or a macro hierarchy.","These approaches seem to propose a completely different way to capture lexical generalizations. It is therefore interesting that the covariation lexical rule compiler produces a lexicon encoding that, basically, uses an underspecification representation: The resulting definite clause representation after constraint propagation represents the common information in the base lexical entry, and uses a definite clause attachment to encode the different specializations. 8. Summary We presented a new computational treatment of HPSG lexical rules by describing a compiler that translates a set of lexical rules as specifed by a linguist into definite relations, which are used to constrain lexical entries. The frame of a lexical rule and lexical rule interaction is automatically determined and the interaction is represented as a finite-state automaton. The automaton allows us to encode lexical rule interaction without actually having to apply lexical rules a possibly infinite number of times. Word classes relevant to lexical rule application are automatically detected and the corresponding finite-state automata are refined in order to avoid lexical rule applications that are guaranteed to fail. The refined automata are encoded as definite relations and each base lexical entry is extended to call the relation corresponding to its class. Finally, the encoding of lexical rules and their interaction is advanced using constraint propagation to allow coroutining of its execution with other grammar constraints. This reduces the number of nondeterministic choices related to lexical lookup, and, more importantly, allows syntactic information to be used to ensure termination of the covariation encoding of lexical rules. Finally, we discussed implementation results and illustrated the improvement in time and space efficiency resulting from the covariation encoding.
