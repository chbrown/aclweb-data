Introduction Computational theories of discourse are concerned with the context-based interpretation or generation of discourse phenomena in text and dialogue. In the past, research in this area focused on specifying the mechanisms underlying particular discourse phenomena; the models proposed were often motivated by a few constructed examples. While this approach led to many theoretical advances, models developed in this manner are difficult to evaluate because it is hard to tell whether they generalize beyond the particular examples used to motivate them.","Recently however the field has turned to issues of robustness and the coverage of theories of particular phenomena with respect to specific types of data. This new empirical focus is supported by several recent advances: an increasing theoretical consensus on discourse models; a large amount of on-line dialogue and textual corpora available; and improvements in component technologies and tools for building and testing discourse and dialogue testbeds. This means that it is now possible to determine how representative particular discourse phenomena are, how frequently they occur, whether they are related to other phenomena, what percentage of the cases a particular model covers, the inherent difficulty of the problem, and how well an algorithm for processing or generating the phenomena should perform to be considered a good model.","This issue brings together a collection of papers illustrating recent approaches to empirical research in discourse generation and interpretation. Section 2 gives a general overview of empirical studies in discourse and describes an empirical research strategy that leads from empirical findings to general theories. Section 3 discusses how each article exemplifies the empirical research strategy and how empirical methods have been employed in each research project. 2. Why Empirical Studies?

We believe that developing"]},{"title":"general","paragraphs":["theories depends on the ability to characterize computational models of discourse, and their behaviors, tasks, and tasks contexts, in terms of sets of features that can be used to make and evaluate predictions about what affects the behavior under investigation (Cohen 1995; Sparck-Jones and Galliers 1996; Walker * AT&T Labs Research, 600 Mountain Ave. 2D-441, Murray Hill, NJ 07974. E-mail: walker@research.att.com t Computer Science Dept., University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. E-mail: jmoore@cs.pitt.edu (~) 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 1996). 1 The role of empirical methods is to help researchers discover general features by analyzing specific discourse phenomena or programs that interpret or generate them. Once relevant features are identified, hypotheses about the relationship between them can be formed, and controlled studies that test the hypothesized relationships can be devised. This approach leads to general theories via the following steps, which many readers will recognize as a variation of Cohen's empirical generalization strategy (Cohen 1995, 6):","1. Feature identification: identify features of the discourse, tasks, and context that may influence the target behavior;","2. Modeling: develop a causal model of how these features influence the target behavior;","3. Evaluation: assess the performance of the model (often implemented in a program) for producing the target behavior on the tasks and in the contexts for which it was devised;","4. Generalization: once the model makes accurate predictions, generalize the features so that other discourses, tasks, and contexts are encompassed by the causal model, and test whether the general model accurately predicts behavior in the larger set of discourses, tasks, and contexts.","This strategy provides a general research methodology in which the study of discourse phenomena proceeds in several stages, each of which employs empirical methods. The first stage is to identify features that may affect the behavior of interest. Hypotheses about what features are relevant may come from an analysis of a corpus of naturally occurring discourses, a study of the literature on the phenomena of interest, an analysis of tasks in a particular domain or the analysis of a program that exhibits a behavior of interest. These hypotheses are then used to develop or refine a causal model of how the features influence the target behavior. At this point, the model can be evaluated in many ways, for example, a program that embodies the model can be implemented and evaluated. If evaluation indicates that performance of the model is not satisfactory, further work must be done at stages 1 and 2 to identify features that influence the target behavior and to model their interactions appropriately.","Stages 3 and 4 are key to the ability to generalize; once researchers are able to derive quantitative results by testing a model against a data set, general theories can arise from qualitatively analyzing which aspects of the model most directly affect the desired behavior, and from evaluating the model in qualitatively different situations. For this reason, much recent work has been concerned with methodological issues of how to quantitatively measure performance.","But how do empirical methods help researchers discover general features and generate hypotheses? Recent work uses some combination of the following empirical methods: (1) Tagging of discourse phenomena in corpora; (2) Induction of algorithms or discourse models from tagged data; (3) Comparison of algorithm output to human performance; (4) Human scoring of an algorithm's output; (5) Task efficacy evaluation based on the the domain; (6) Ablation studies where algorithm features are systematically turned off; (7) Wizard-of-Oz studies; (8) Testbeds of (parameterizable) dialogue 1 Sparck-Jones and Galliers (1996, 23) call features performance factors and distinguish between environmental factors, which are features of the task that are fixed from the system designer's viewpoint, system factors, which reflect design choices, algorithm features, or other input factors, and system effects, which are features that characterize the behavior of the system. Walker and Moore Empirical Studies in Discourse models using computer-computer dialogue simulation; and (9) Testbeds of (parameterizable) dialogue models implemented in human-computer dialogue interfaces. How are these methods used and how do they contribute to the development of general theories?","Discourse tagging classifies discourse units in naturally occurring texts or dialogues into one of a set of categories. Discourse units range from referring expressions and syntactic constructions (Fox 1987; Kroch and Hindle 1982; Prince 1985), to words or phrases (Heeman and Allen 1994; Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Novick and Sutton 1994), to utterances and relationships among them (Dahlback 1991; Reithinger and Maier 1995; Moser and Moore 1995; Nagata 1992; Rose et al. 1995), to multiutterance units identified by a range of criteria such as speaker intention or initiative (Flammia and Zue 1995a; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996; Whittaker and Stenton 1988). The article by Carletta et al. (this volume) presents a tagging scheme for three levels of discourse structure.","Discourse tags categorize either features of the input (independent variables) or features of the output (dependent variables). Often hypotheses about input features that affect the target behavior are found in previous work (stage 1 of the methodology). In this case, the tagging contributes to developing a causal model. The tagged corpus is used to test whether the features predict the target behavior. For example, researchers have devised algorithms for generating the surface form of explanations and instructions from underlying intention-based representations by tagging naturally occurring discourses for surface form features, informational relations, and intentional relations (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio 1996; Moser and Moore 1995; Moore and Pollack 1992; Paris and Scott 1994). Another promising area is speech act (dialogue move) tagging, where, for example, researchers have tested whether an automatic tag-ger trained on the tagged corpus can improve the performance of a speech recognizer with tag-specific language models (Taylor et al. 1996), and whether an induced discourse model based on the tagging can predict the next dialogue act in the dialogue, and thus affect how the system translates the next utterance (Reithinger and Maier 1995; Nagata 1992).","Tagging is also critical for ablation studies, where algorithm features are selectively turned off, and performance examined. Tagging can characterize the input in terms of features the algorithm uses for producing the target behavior or characterize the target behavior. For example, Lappin and Leass (1994) report an ablation study of an anaphora resolution algorithm, operating on computer manuals, in which various factors that were hypothesized to determine the most likely antecedent were selectively turned off. (See also Dagan et al. [1995]). Sample results include the finding that there is no effect on performance, for this type of text, when an antecedent's likelihood is increased for parallelism.","Another use of discourse tagging is for algorithm induction using automatic classifiers, such as C4.5 or CART, that produce decision trees from data sets described by a set of features (Brieman et al. 1984; Quinlan 1993). This approach uses automatic methods for stages 2 and 3 of our empirical research strategy. Since discourse tagging associates sets of features with discourse phenomena, tagged data is used as input to these automatic classifiers. The decision tree produced by the classifiers functions as a causal model, which can then be examined and further tested. For example, this method has been used to identify features for predicting accent assignment in text-to-speech (Hirschberg 1993), for repairing disfluencies (Nakatani and Hirschberg 1993), cue vs. noncue uses of discourse cue words (Litman 1996; Siegel and McKeown 1994), discourse segment boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Passonneau and Litman, this volume), intonational phrase boundaries (Wang and Hirschberg 1992), and the Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 most likely antecedents for anaphors (Aone and Bennet 1995; Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994).","Discourse tagging is also instrumental in stage 3 of our empirical method, by producing a test set that can be used for comparison to a program's output. This method is used by most of the articles in this volume. A common application is testing coreference resolution algorithms; the tags indicate the preferred interpretation of a potentially ambiguous utterance containing anaphoric noun phrases (Walker 1989; Suri and McCoy 1994; Chinchor and Sundheim 1995). Coreference algorithms are then tested on their ability to select the right equivalence class for an anaphoric noun phrase. The same method has been applied to empirically testing an algorithm for resolving verb phrase ellipsis (Hardt 1992).","In each case, we can generalize on the basis of specific features from studies of specific algorithms operating on specific corpora, whenever the corpora represent a general task for the algorithm. The more varied the test data is, the more generalizable we expect the results to be. For example, the claim that a model is general can be supported by test corpora representing different genres (Fox 1987; Kroch and Hindle 1982), or different language families (Strube and Hahn 1996; Iida 1997; Di Eugenio 1997; Hoffman 1997).","Human performance can also be compared to algorithm output through the use of reaction time or comprehension or production experiments (Brennan 1995; Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988). These methods allow researchers fine-grained control of the phenomena studied, and avoid problems with sparse data that can arise with corpus analyses. Reaction time studies also provide researchers with an indirect measure of how humans process a particular phenomenon; processing times can then be compared with the predictions of a model.","The method of having humans score the result of an algorithm, or compare it to human performance, is useful when the algorithm output is hard to classify as an element of a finite set, for example, when the output is a summary or an explanation produced by a natural language generation system (McKeown and Radev 1995; Robin and McKeown 1996; Sparck-Jones 1993). This is the method used by Lester and Porter (this volume).","The method of task efficacy evaluation tests the effectiveness of the target behavior in an environment in which it is embedded (Sparck-Jones and Galliers 1996). For example, in evaluating the generation mechanism of a tutorial system, a task efficacy measure evaluates how well students comprehend or learn an explanation or an instruction. If the execution of an instruction can be monitored, performance metrics can be collected (Biermann and Long 1996; Young 1997). Another approach is based on field studies with actual end-users (Jarke et al. 1985). Like human scoring, this method appears to be well-suited for research with complex outputs such as instructional dialogue systems.","Because testing dialogue systems requires a fully implemented natural language system, there are two empirical methods for testing hypotheses about discourse models that are independent of the current state of the art in speech or language processing. The first method is Wizard-of-Oz simulation, and the second is computational testbeds for dialogue simulation.","In the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) approach, a human wizard simulates the behavior of a program interacting with a human to carry out a particular task in a particular domain (Dahlb~ick and Jonsson 1989; Hirschman et al. 1993; Oviatt and Cohen 1989; Whittaker and Stenton 1989). The WOZ method can, in principle, be used to test, refine, or generalize any behavior implementable in a program and thus is appropriate at several stages of our methodology. For example, the wizard may follow a proto-4 Walker and Moore Empirical Studies in Discourse col that includes particular system limitations or error-handling strategies, to explore potential problems before implementation, e.g. determining how the program's level of interactivity affects the complexity of the instructions it is given (Oviatt and Cohen 1989). In addition, WOZ is often used to collect sample dialogues that are not affected by system limitations; the human wizard can simulate behavior that would result in a system error, so that the resulting corpus of dialogues is not affected by human adaptation to the system's limitations. In some cases, the resulting corpus provides training data for spoken language systems (Hirschman et al. 1993), is used as a target for improved systems (Moore, Lemaire, and Rosenblum 1996), or forms a test set for evaluating the performance of an existing natural language system (Whittaker and Stenton 1989; Hirschman et al. 1993).","Dialogue simulation testbeds evaluate specific models of agent communicative action. This approach spans stages 1-3 of the methodology: human-human dialogues are used to formulate hypotheses about features that determine a target behavior; a program is designed in which the target behavior is parameterizable and in which metrics for evaluating performance can be collected; and then simulations are run to determine which behaviors, determined by the parameter settings, affect performance on the task. Hans, Pollack, and Cohen (1993) discuss the role of this method in exploration, confirmation, and generalization of particular models of agent behavior. In discourse studies, these testbeds have been used to investigate the utility of planning as an underlying model of dialogue (Power 1979; Houghton and Isard 1985), the interaction of risk-taking dialogue strategies and corresponding repair strategies (Carletta 1992), the relationship between resource bounds, task complexity, and dialogue strategies (Walker 1996; Jordan and Walker 1996), the role of belief revision in tasks in which agents negotiate a problem solution (Logan, Reece, and Sparck-Jones 1994), and the relationship between mixed initiative and knowledge distribution (Guinn 1994).","Empirical research in testbeds for human-computer dialogue interfaces is very recent (Hirschman et al. 1990; Allen et al. 1996). This method supports studies of the interaction of various components; for example Danieli and Gerbino (1995) propose an implicit recovery metric for evaluating how the dialogue manager overcomes limitations in the speech recognizer. Other research parameterizes the dialogue manager to select different behaviors in different contexts, such as"]},{"title":"expert","paragraphs":["vs."]},{"title":"novice","paragraphs":["discourse strategies (Kamm 1995), different repair strategies (Hirschman and Pao 1993), or different degrees of initiative (Potjer et al. 1996; Smith and Gordon, this volume). These dialogue interfaces also provide an opportunity for task efficacy evaluation, as discussed above, and there are already many examples of dialogue systems being tested in field trials with representative populations of users (Danieli and Gerbino [1995], Kamm [1995], Meng et al. [1996], Sadek et al. [1996] inter alia.) 3. Overview of the Issue The articles in this issue represent many of the empirical methods discussed above and span research on dialogue tagging, generation of referring expressions, generation of explanations, topic identification, identification of changes in speaker intention, and the effect of initiative on the structure of dialogues. Below we discuss each article in turn, both in terms of the methods it uses and in terms of how it contributes to the development of general theories. 3.1 Carletta, Isard, Isard, Kowtko, Doherty-Sneddon, and Anderson Discourse tagging is a key component of much empirical work in discourse, however the development of discourse tag sets is still a relatively new area of endeavor. Carletta Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 et al. discuss a scheme for tagging human-human dialogues with three tag sets: transactions, conversational games, and dialogue moves. A transaction is a subdialogue that accomplishes one major step in the participants' plan for achieving the task (Isard and Carletta 1995). The size and shape of transactions is therefore largely dependent on the task. Each transaction consists of a sequence of conversational games, where a conversational game is a set of utterances starting with an initiation (e.g., a request for information) and encompassing all successive utterances until the purpose of the game has been fullfilled or the game has been abandoned. Each game consists of a sequence of moves, each of which is classified as either an initiative (e.g., instruction, explanation) or a response (e.g., reply, acknowledgment).","The paper discusses issues with determining the reliability and generality of tagging sets, and with refining tag sets on the basis of reliability data (Carletta 1996; Condon and Cech 1995). The Discourse Working Group is also applying this tagging scheme to other dialogue types to evaluate its generality (Hirschman et al. 1996; Luperfoy 1996). 3.2 Hearst The target behavior that Hearst is concerned with is subtopic identification in expository texts. She tests the hypothesis that term repetition is a primary feature of textual cohesion (Morris and Hirst 1991) by using it as the basis for two different algorithms for identifying multiparagraph subtopical units. The algorithms are evaluated by comparing the units they propose against a baseline of randomly generated topic boundaries, and against a corpus tagged by human judges. Precision, recall, and K (Carletta 1996; Krippendorf 1980) are used as evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the two algorithms.","In order to generalize, Hearst tests the algorithm's performance on a new task: that of distinguishing boundaries between sets of concatenated news articles. Hearst's algorithm performs comparably to other algorithms on the new task, showing that term repetition may be a more general indicator of subtopic boundaries. Future work could test further generalizations; term repetition may also indicate subtopics in other discourse or dialogue environments, and may interact with other features that correlate with topic boundaries, such as pauses, intonation, or cue words (Cahn 1992; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). 3.3 Lester and Porter The target behavior that concerns Lester and Porter is generating paragraph-length explanations in the biology domain. Given a goal to explain a biology concept or process, their KNIGHT system selects relevant information from a large knowledge base, organizes it, and then generates it. It is clearly not possible to evaluate how well KNIGHT produces coherent paragraph-length explanations by comparing KNIGHT'S explanations word for word, or even proposition for proposition, with a corpus of human explanations. There are simply too many choices on the path from knowledge base to surface form. So Lester and Porter compare KNIGHT to human performance by having domain experts score a corpus consisting of both KNIGHT and human explanations. The domain experts are unaware of the fact that some explanations are generated by a computer. KNIGHT'S performance is evaluated on the basis of grading explanations on a scale of A to F for the features of coherence, content, organization, writing style, and correctness.","To generalize their results, Lester and Porter propose further fine-grained analyses of KNIGHT'S output by sentential form or referring expressions. Other generalizations could arise by showing that KNIGHT'S content organization operators (EDPs) could Walker and Moore Empirical Studies in Discourse be used in other domains for generating explanations, as in Robin and McKeown (1996). 3.4 Passonneau and Litman The target behavior that Passonneau and Litman's article models is the identification of multi-utterance units in spoken story narratives that correspond to speaker's intention. In order to define a test set for the target behavior, seven human subjects tagged each utterance in a narrative as a boundary where the speaker starts communicating a new intention, or as a nonboundary, where the speaker continues discussing the current intention. The boundaries marked by either three or four subjects (out of seven) are used to define the target behavior for boundary identification. Passonneau and Litman then examine three classes of utterance features to determine correlations with boundary and nonboundary utterances: (1) coreferential and inferential relationships between noun phrases across two adjacent utterances; (2) the occurrence of discourse cue phrases at the beginning of an utterance; and (3) prosodic/acoustic utterance features such as phrase-final intonation and utterance-initial pauses. They develop and evaluate three algorithms for producing the target behavior from these features, two hand-developed and one automatically induced.","Generalizations of this work arise from other research on different speech genres In different environments that also found that coreferential relationships, pausing, and intonation are correlated with discourse structure (Cahn 1992; Fox 1987; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). Future work can further test the generalizability of the results reported here: the features used could be examined in other types of spoken monologues, in texts, and in dialogue. 3.5 Smith and Gordon Smith and Gordon examine the effect of initiative on dialogue structure in dialogues in which human subjects interact with the computer to diagnose and repair problems with simple circuits. Initiative is varied by setting the system's initiative to directive or declarative mode. In directive mode, the system instructs the student at each step. In declarative mode, the system lets the student take the initiative, but volunteers relevant facts. Dialogue structure is tagged via a model that segments circuit repair dialogues into five phases: introduction, assessment, diagnosis, repair and test. Then Smith and Gordon examine how the subdialogue length varies depending on initiative mode.","Their results exemplify the empirical generalization strategy by showing that a subdialogue model based on WOZ simulations can be generalized to human-computer dialogues. They also show that claims about the effect of initiative on dialogue structure in human-human dialogues in other domains (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990) generalize to human-computer dialogues in the circuit repair domain. Further generalizations could result from determining whether the subdialogue model can be used in other types of human-human or human-computer problem-solving dialogues. 3.6 Yeh and Mellish The target behavior that Yeh and Mellish model is the generation of anaphoric noun phrases in Chinese texts. The algorithm must select from among zero pronouns, overt pronouns, and full noun phrases; in addition, for full noun phrases, appropriate content must be determined. Their training set is a corpus of Chinese texts tagged for anaphoric noun phrases and for features claimed to affect noun phrase form. They Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 construct a decision tree by sequentially allowing additional features to affect decisions on anaphoric form, wherever there is room for improvement.","In order to test the derived decision tree, they construct a test set of texts generated by a Chinese generator. At each location where a noun phrase occurs, a set of choices of nominal referring expressions are given. Then they conduct two comparisons. First, human judges select from among the forms and the selections of human judges are compared among themselves. Second, a program implementing the derived decision tree selects among the forms and the program's behavior is compared to the human judges.","This work could be generalized by comparing their predictive features with those used in algorithms for generating referring expressions in English (Passonneau 1995). Other generalizations could arise from comparing the decision trees with factors that affect anaphoric forms in Japanese (Iida 1997), Italian (Di Eugenio 1997), or Turkish (Hoffman 1997). In addition, it would be useful to test their suggestion that the lack of agreement among native speakers as to the preferred form of anaphoric noun phrases was partially determined by the use of texts generated by a natural language generator. It is possible that the same experiment carried out on naturally occurring texts would generate a similar amount of disagreement. 4. Future Directions In recent years, there has clearly been a groundswell of interest in empirical methods for analyzing discourse. A survey of recent ACL papers shows that the percentage of empirical papers in semantics, pragmatics, and discourse hovered between 8% and 20% until 1993 when it increased to 40%. In 1995 and 1996, 75% of the ACL papers in semantics, pragmatics, and discourse used empirical methods. While a great deal of progress has been made, several obstacles impede empirical research. The discourse community must develop more shared methods, tools, and resources.","First, researchers in discourse must agree on methods for quantitatively characterizing performance and on ways to determine whether the metrics are serving their intended diagnostic function (Moore and Walker 1995; Cohen 1995; Sparck-Jones and Galliers 1996). Recent work includes discussion of appropriate statistical methods and metrics for spoken dialogue systems (Bates and Ayuso 1993; Danieli et al. 1992; Hirschman et al. 1990; Hirschman and Pao 1993; Simpson and Fraser 1993), information extraction systems (Lewis 1991; Chinchor, Hirschman, and Lewis 1993; Chinchor and Sundheim 1995), and tagging reliability (Carletta 1996).","Second, we must develop more shared tools. The lack of tools greatly increases the cost of accurate coding, which could be reduced with coding tools that structure the coder's input and checks that it is within the coding scheme's constraints. To date most coders enter data by hand in a word processor or using home-grown, hastily constructed tools. To our knowledge, there is only one publicly available tool for dialogue structure coding (Flammia and Zue 1995b).","Third, we must increase the number of and representativeness of dialogue and text corpora. To our knowledge, the only publicly available human-computer dialogue corpora is that for the ATIS task (Hirschman 1993), and there are no publicly available corpora of human-human dialogues representing a broad range of spoken-dialogue applications. Similarly, there are no publicly available corpora of text-based explanations in particular domains that could be a resource for the generation community. However, even if more corpora become available, most discourse studies require data to be tagged, and there are currently no publicly available tagged corpora. In order to develop a large shared resource of tagged materials, the discourse community must share efforts across sites. We need to develop shared coding schemes and make coded Walker and Moore Empirical Studies in Discourse data publicly available to support comparisons of different models. The community is currently addressing these issues through a series of working groups (Hirschman et al. 1996; Luperfoy 1996). Given the current state of the art, we expect these issues to concern the community for some time.
