The system achieves a success rate of 94.8%, where success is defined as sharing of a head between the system choice and the coder choice, while a baseline recency-based scheme achieves a success rate o,I:75.0% by this measure. Other criteria for success are also examined. When success is defined as an exact, word-for-word match with the coder choice, the system performs with 76.0% accuracy, and the baseline approach achieves only 14.6% accuracy.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Ellipsis is a pervasive phenomenon in natural language, and it has been a major topic of study in theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics in the past several decades (Ross 1967; Sag 1976; Williams 1997; Hankamer and Sag 1976; Webber 1978; Lappin 1984; Sag and Hankamer 1984; Chao 1987; Ristad 1990; Harper 1990; Kitagawa 1991; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira 1991; Lappin 1992; Hardt 1993; Kehler 1993; Fiengo and May 1994). While previous work provides important insight into the abstract syntactic and semantic representations that underlie ellipsis phenomena, there has been little empirically oriented work on ellipsis. The availability of parsed corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) makes it possible to empirically investigate elliptical phenomena in a way not possible before.","This paper reports on an empirically based system that automatically resolves VP ellipsis in the 644 examples identified in the parsed Penn Treebank. This work builds on structural constraints and discourse heuristics first proposed in Hardt (1992) and further developed in Hardt (1995). The results reported here represent the first systematic corpus-based study of VP ellipsis resolution, and the performance of the system is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution.","The VP elipsis resolution system (VPE-RES) operates on Penn Treebank parse trees to determine the antecedent for VPE occurrences. The system, implemented in Common LISP, uses a Syntactic Filter to eliminate candidate antecedents in impossible Department of Computing Science, Villanova University, Villanova, PA 19085 Q 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 syntactic configurations, and then ranks remaining candidates using Preference Factors involving recency, parallelism, clausal relations, and quotation structure.","All the examples of VPE in the Treebank were coded for the correct antecedent by two coders. Also, a baseline scheme is implemented, which always selects the most recent full VP. Both the system and the baseline are evaluated by comparison with the coder output, with respect to three different definitions of success: . . . Head Overlap: either the head verb of the system choice is contained in the coder choice, or the head verb of the coder choice is contained in the system choice Head Match: the system choice and coder choice have the same head verb. Exact Match: the system choice and coder choice match word-for-word.","Using the Head Overlap measure, the system achieves a success rate of 94.8% on a blind test of 96 Wall Street Journal examples, while the baseline recency scheme achieves a success rate of 75.0% by this measure. Using the Exact Match measure, the system performs with 76.0% accuracy, and the baseline approach achieves 14.6% accuracy.","In what follows, we first present background on the data set and the coding of that data. Next, we describe the VPE-RES system, examining the Syntactic Filter, the Preference Factors, and the Post-Filter. There follows an empirical analysis of the system, in which we compare the system output to coder choice, based on our three success criteria. Also, the subparts of the system are analyzed individually, in three different ways. Finally, we briefly discuss related work. 2. Background In this section, we describe the data set we collected from the Penn Treebank, and the coding of that data. 2.1 The Data: VPE in the Penn Treebank We have identified 644 examples of VPE from the Brown Corpus and the Wall Street Journal Corpus of the Penn Treebank. Since the parsing schemes used in the Penn Treebank do not explicitly label VPE occurrences, it is difficult to ensure that all occurrences of VPE in the Treebank are found. However, this data set is the first large set of ellipsis examples we are aware of, and it provides a solid empirical foundation not only for the current study, but for future research on ellipsis.","We used several techniques to identify ellipsis occurrences in the Treebank, all involving the tree pattern-matching utility tgrep. 1 In the Wall Street Journal Corpus, the -NONE- category is used to represent a variety of empty expressions, including VPE. We searched for the following pattern: (VP (-NONE- ,?,)) which resulted in a set of 260 examples from the Wall Street Journal corpus. 1 The utility tgrep is written by Rich Pito of the University of Pennsylvania, and is distributed together with the Penn Treebank CD-ROM. 526 Hardt VP Ellipsis Table 1 Identification of VPE occurrences.","Actual Number Number Found False Hits Recall Precision 48 21 19 21/48 (44%) 21/40 (53%) Table 2 Success rates on missed examples.

Success Definition Coder Agreement Head Overlap 99% Head Match 97% Exact Match 93%","In the Brown Corpus, VPE occurrences are not labeled in this way. We searched for occurrences of a sentence (S) with an auxiliary (AUX) but no VP.","To evaluate our identification criteria, we performed a manual search for VPE occurrences in a sample of files constituting about 3.2% of the Treebank. 2 In this sample, we found that the Recall was 44%, and the Precision was 53%, as depicted in Table 1.","In this sample, there were 27 valid VPE occurrences that were missed. We tested VPE-RES on these examples, and found that its performance was comparable to its performance on the examples that were automatically identified. The results are given in Table 2, which also includes results on the complete corpus, for ease of comparison. 3 2.2 Coding the Data All the examples of VPE were coded for the correct antecedent by two human coders. We performed some comparisons of coder responses with one another, based on our three success criteria. On a sample of 162 examples, the results were as shown in Table 3.","In this sample, there was only one example in which coder agreement failed according to the Head Overlap criterion:","(1) Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did yesterday. 2 This percentage was computed using the parsed version of both the Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal Corpus. The sample contained 155,000 words, out of a total of approximately 4,799,845 in the Treebank. 3 The numbers for the missed examples reflect a post hoc analysis of the program output, rather than comparison with coder files. 527 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 Here are the two choices: Coder 1: prevails in the financial markets Coder 2: acts as a haven","The following is an example where the coders disagreed according to Head Match, although they agreed according to Head Overlap:"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["By contrast, in 19th-century Russia, an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.

Post-Filter","The candidates for VPE antecedents are all full VPs appearing within a three sentence window--the current sentence and the two preceding sentences. 4 The Syntactic Filter eliminates all VPs that contain the VPE in an improper fashion. A preference ordering is imposed upon the remaining candidate antecedents, based on recency, clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure. After the candidates have been weighted according to these Preference Factors, the highest-rated candidate is selected, and its form is modified by a Post-Filter. 4 The limitation to three sentences is arbitrary. However, no examples were found in the Treebank in which the antecedent was more distant. 528 Hardt VP Ellipsis"]},{"title":"S NP VP PRP VBD SBAR she said -NONE- S 0 NP VPE NEG I I PRP MD RB she would not Figure 1","paragraphs":["Parse tree for She said she would not. 3.1 Syntactic Filter The Syntactic Filter rules out antecedents that improperly contain the VPE occurrence, s While the precise definition of improper containment is an active area of theoretical research, 6 we rule out antecedents that contain the VPE in a sentential complement. An example of this is given in Figure 1, the parse tree for the sentence in (4). 7 (4) She said she would not.","Here, the VPE occurrence would cannot select as its antecedent the containing VP headed by said. This is ruled out by the Syntactic Filter, because the VPE is contained in SBar, a sentential complement to said.","Pronoun resolution systems often incorporate a syntactic filter--a mechanism to remove certain antecedents based on syntactic structure. The basic syntactic constraint for pronouns is that they cannot take a \"local\" antecedent, as described, for example, in Principle B of the binding theory (Chomsky, 1981). 8 The Syntactic Filter for VPE also rules out \"local\" antecedents in a sense: it rules out antecedents in certain containment configurations.","The implementation of the Syntactic Filter is complicated by two factors: first, there are certain cases in which a containing antecedent is possible, where the VPE is 5 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992) as a way of ruling out antecedents for VPE. 6 See, for example Sag (1976) and May (1985) for discussion, and for example Lappin and McCord (1990) and Jacobson (1992) for alternative views. 7 Parse trees display the exact category labels and structure represented in the Penn Treebank parses. We have added a label, VPE, for VPE occurrences. See Appendix A for a list of Penn Treebank tags; for more information, see Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993). 8 While the precise formulation of Principle B remains controversial, it is generally agreed to rule out, for example, the binding of a pronoun in object position by an NP in subject position. Such constraints on pronoun resolution have been incorporated into several computational approaches to pronoun resolution, such as Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Lappin and McCord (1990), and Lappin and Leass (1994). 529 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4"]},{"title":"VB NP PP SBAR-2 IN NP WHNP S from PRP WDT NP VP it that PRP VBD S she used NP VPE L -NONE- TO I * to take NP DT NN I L the pleasure Figure 2","paragraphs":["Parse tree for She was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to. contained in an NP argument of the containing VP, as in Figure 2, the parse tree for the following example: (5) She was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to.","Here, the (circled) VP headed by take is the antecedent for the VPE, despite the containment relation.","The second complication results from a basic limitation in Treebank parses; there is no distinction between arguments and adjuncts. A VP must be ruled out if the VPE is within a nonquantificational argument; when a VPE occurs in an adjunct position, the \"containing\" VP is a permissible antecedent. The following sentence, whose parse tree is in Figure 3, is an example of this: (6) get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can","In this case, the (circled) VP headed by get is the antecedent for the VPE, despite the appearance of containment. Since the VPE is contained in an adjunct (an adverbial phrase), there is in fact a nonmaximal VP headed by get that does not contain the VPE: this is the VP get to the corner of Adams and Clark. However, because of the approach taken in annotating the Penn Treebank, this nonmaximal VP is not displayed as a VP.","To capture the above data, the Syntactic Filter rules out VPs that contain the VPE in a sentential complement; any other antecedent-containment relation is permitted. 530 Hardt VP Ellipsis"]},{"title":"VB PP get TO NP to DT NN the comer ADVP RB RB RB PP PP just as fast IN S IN NP as NP VPE of NP CC NP PRP MD I I r I I NNP and NNP you can I I Adams Clark","paragraphs":["Figure 3 Parse tree for get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can.

Recency 2. Clausal Relations 3. Parallelism 4. Quotation 9 An anonymous CL reviewer suggests that the filter may be overly restrictive, because of examples like the following: A: It's an important issue, and I'm very concerned about it. B: Well, frankly, I don't care that you do. (Italicized expressions receive pitch accents.) Here, the antecedent for the VPE is care; this would not be permitted by the filter. The reviewer suggests that examples like this should not be categorically excluded, although they are perhaps less than fully acceptable. If this is true, it raises interesting theoretical issues about the acceptability of antecedent-containment configurations. However, the reviewer notes that \"such examples are no doubt rare and perhaps the proposed containment filter does enough work in correctly excluding ill-formed instances of ellipsis to justify the categorical exclusion of these cases.\" Based on our empirical research up to this point, we concur with this. No examples of this sort have been observed among the 644 VPE examples in the Penn Treebank, and the Syntactic Filter as currently formulated contributes significantly to the overall performance of the system (see Section 4 for figures on this). 531 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4","Each candidate is initialized with a weight of 1. This weight is modified by any applicable Preference Factors. 3.2.1 Recency. The simplest and most important factor is recency: if no other Preference Factors obtain, the most recent (syntactically possible) antecedent is always chosen. The weights are modified as follows: the first VP weight is set to be the recency factor, 1.15. Moving rightward, toward the VPE, the weight of each subsequent VP is multiplied by the recency factor. Thus, if there are three VPs preceding the VPE, we have (1.15 1.32 1.52). If a VP contains another VP, the two VPs are set at the same level.

However, we also examined Clause-Rel in combination with the Syntactic Filter, because of their close connection. We did this by defining a Composite system component, consisting of Syntactic Filter, Clause-Rel, and Post-Filter. 3.2.3 Parallelism. There is a preference for similar parallel elements, that is, the elements surrounding the ellipsis site, and the elements that correspond to them surrounding the antecedent. Notions of parallelism figure prominently in many theoretical studies of ellipsis. 12 However, the proposal that similarity of parallel elements can be 10 This reflects the fact that VPE, like pronominal anaphora, permits the antecedent to follow, rather than precede, the VPE occurrence. 11 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992). 12 The term parallel elements is from Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira (1991), where parallelism is emphasized in the interpretation of ellipsis. Parallelism is also important in many other treatments of ellipsis, such as Priest, Scha, and van den Berg (1991), Asher (1993), and Fiengo and May (1994). 532 Hardt VP Ellipsis S DT VBD / All felt JJR S fleer PP NP AUX VP IN S -NONE- TO VB NP than NP VPE ADVP"]},{"title":"I I I I I I","paragraphs":["* to discuss NNS NNS VBD RB"]},{"title":"r","paragraphs":["things students had previously Figure 4 Parse tree for"]},{"title":"All felt freer to discuss things than students had previously.","paragraphs":["used to guide ellipsis resolution is, to our knowledge, a new one) 3 Our current results involving parallelism provide support for this claim. 14 We are continuing to experiment with more sophisticated ways of measuring the similarity of parallel elements.","In the case of VPE, the subject and auxiliary are parallel elements.

The contribution of Clause-Rel is not evident individually; if it is the only factor activated together with Recency-Only, performance in the complete corpus actually declines from 29.2% to 28.1%. However, this is because Clause-Rel requires the Syntactic Filter to make a contribution. This can be observed from the fact that Composite performs better than its individual components. Also, when Clause-Rel is the deactivated factor, performance declines from 75.9% to 72.8%. The Parallelism Preference Factors, Aux-Match and Parallel-Match, 537 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 also make an important contribution: when they are activated in the incremental analysis, there are 22 additional correct selections in the complete corpus, an improvement of 3.4%. 4.5 Errors and Evaluation Criteria Many of the errors occurring under the Exact Match criterion involve alternatives that are virtually identical in meaning, as in the following example: (17) Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body [VP comes immediately to"]},{"title":"mind] [pp","paragraphs":["in this connection], as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People, Yes.","Here, VPE-RES selected comes immediately to mind, since the PP in this connection is parsed as a sister to the VP. One coder selected comes immediately to mind in this connection, while the other coder made the same selection as VPE-RES. It is difficult to see any difference in meaning between the two choices.","Because of examples like this, we believe Head Overlap or Head Match are preferable criteria for success. Even with the Head Match criterion, there are errors that involve very subtle differences, such as the following example:","(18) We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants. Even if it did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns?","The coder selected ignite another war among the world's giants, while VPE-RES selected threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants.","Some errors result from problems with the Syntactic Filter. The following example illustrates a case of antecedent containment that is not recognized by the filter as currently formulated.","(19) All the generals who held important commands in World War 2, did not write books. It only seems as if they did.","The VPE-RES system incorrectly selects seems as the antecedent, because it does not recognize that the VP headed by seems improperly contains the VPE. 5. Related Work There is no comparable work we are aware of dealing with VPE resolution; to our knowledge, this is the first empirical study of a VPE resolution algorithm. There is, however, a large body of empirically oriented work on pronoun resolution. A prominent recent example is Lappin and Leass (1994), in which a pronoun resolution system is evaluated on 360 examples taken from computer manuals, with a success rate of 86%. This work involves a post hoc evaluation of the system output, and it appears that evaluation is based on Head Match, although this is not discussed explicitly. The VPE-RES system achieves an 84.4% success rate according to Head Match in the Blind Test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus. This compares favorably with Lappin and Leass's result, especially considering that computer manual text is a good deal more restricted than newspaper text. It is also likely that the VPE-RES success rate would be higher using a post hoc evaluation scheme. 538 Hardt VP Ellipsis","Previous work on pronoun resolution (Hobbs 1978, Walker 1989) reports higher success rates. However, these involved hand-tested algorithms on rather small data sets. Lappin and Leass (1994) implemented and tested Hobbs's algorithm, and reported results that were about 4% less than that of Lappin and Leass (1994). 6. Conclusions and Future Work We have described the first empirical study of VP ellipsis resolution, using a data set of 644 examples from the Penn Treebank to develop and test a VPE resolution system. The system performance is comparable to the best existing systems for pronoun resolution.","The Preference Factors in the system were selected and developed in an iterative testing and refinement process. In future work, we will explore the relationship of these factors to more fundamental and general features of discourse interpretation. We suspect that the preferences for clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure all involve clues to the underlying discourse structure, reflecting a general preference for configurations where the VPE clause and antecedent clause participate in a discourse relation. TM A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997).","We plan to apply the general approach to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution. We conjecture that suitably generalized versions of the constraints and heuristics in the current system can be applied to a broad range of discourse-processing problems.
