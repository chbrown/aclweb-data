Vitale t Digital Equipment Corporation","paragraphs":["Letter-to-sound rules, also known as grapheme-to-phoneme rules, are important computational tools and have been used for a variety of purposes including word or name lookups for database searches and speech synthesis.","These rules are especially useful when integrated into database searches on names and addresses, since they can complement orthographic search algorithms that make use of permutation, deletion, and insertion by allowing for a comparison with the phonetic equivalent. In databases, phonetics can help retrieve a word or a proper name without the user needing to know the correct spelling. A phonetic index is built with the vocabulary of the application. This could be an entire dictionary, or a list of proper names. The searched word is then converted into phonetics and retrieved with its information, if the word is in the phonetic index. This phonetic lookup can be used to retrieve a misspelled word in a dictionary or a database, or in a text editor to suggest corrections.","Such rules are also necessary to formalize grapheme-phoneme correspondences in speech synthesis architecture. In text-to-speech systems, these rules are typically used to create phonemes from computer text. These phonemic symbols, in turn, are used to feed lower-level phonetic modules (such as timing, intonation, vowel formant trajectories, etc.) which, in turn,feed a vocal tract model and finally output a waveform and, via a digital-analogue converter, synthesized speech. Such rules are a necessary and integral part of a text-to-speech system since a database lookup (dictionary search) is not sufficient to handle derived forms, new words, nonce forms, proper nouns, low-frequency technical jargon, and the like; such forms typically are not included in the database. And while the use of a dictionary is more important now that denser and faster memory is available to smaller systems, letter-to-sound still plays a crucial and central role in speech synthesis technology.","Grapheme-to-phoneme technology is also useful in speech recognition, as a way of generating pronunciations for new words that may be available in grapheme form, or for naive users to add new words more easily. In that case, the system must generate the multiple variations of the word.","While there are different problems in languages that use non-alphabetic writing systems (syllabaries, as in Japanese, or logographic systems, as in Chinese) (DeFrancis 1984), all alphabetic systems have a structured set of correspondences. These range from the trivial in languages like Spanish or Swahili, to extremely complex in languages such as English and French.

Introduction and Historical Background","paragraphs":["The interest in letter-to-sound rules goes back centuries and can be found (in relatively unsystematic descriptions) in many of the older descriptive grammars of languages such as English and French. The paucity of literature in grapheme-to-phoneme translation is partially due to the fact that the field of linguistics, and in particular, descriptive linguistics, has traditionally shied away from the writing system (except as a study in its own right) since the phonological system was considered of primary importance. Papers on the subject are rarely found in linguistics journals. Nevertheless, there have been some important studies done on grapheme-phoneme correspondences in past years; for English: Ainsworth (1973), Bakiri and Dietterich (1991), Bernstein and Nessly (1981), Elovitz et al. (1976), Hertz (1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985), Hunnicutt (1976, 1980), Levin (1963), McCormick and Hertz (1989), McIlroy (1974), O'Malley (1990), Venezky (1962, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c, 1970), Venezky and Weir (1966), Vitale (1991), Weir (1964); for French: Auberg4 (1991), B4chet, Spriet, and E1-B~ze (1996), Catach (1989), Catach and Catach (1992), Cotto (1992), Divay (1984, 1985, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1994), Laporte (1988), Prouts (1980), Yvon (1996).","Some of these studies (Weir 1964; Venezky 1966, 1970) were more descriptive in nature and represented a solid base of data from which a rule set could be built. These works consisted of tables of correspondences and examples of words containing these correspondences. These studies made use of phonetic, phonemic, or even morphophonemic form such as palatalization"]},{"title":"(credulity, cuticle,","paragraphs":["etc.), morphophonemic alternation"]},{"title":"(symmetry","paragraphs":["vs."]},{"title":"symmetric)","paragraphs":["and even morphology"]},{"title":"(singer","paragraphs":["vs."]},{"title":"finger).","paragraphs":["Other studies included pause (McIlroy 1974) and even syntactic information (Divay 1984, 1985).","More recent studies have attempted to use learning algorithms to incorporate pronunciation by analogy (Dedina and Nusbaum 1991), a neural network or connectionist approach to the problem (Sejnowski and Rosenberg 1986; Bakiri and Dietterich 1991; Gonzalez and Tubach 1982; Lucas and Damper 1992), automatic alignment by an in-duction method (Hochberg et al. 1991); a computational approach (Klatt and Shipman 1982; Klatt 1987), an information theoretic approach (Lucassen and Mercer 1984), hidden Markov models (Parfitt and Sharman 1991), and a case-based approach (Golding 1991). Some have even developed a bidirectional approach of letter-to-sound as well as sound-to-letter (Meng 1995), which is a hybrid of data-based and rule-driven approaches and is also useful for automatic speech recognition. This paper will focus on a rule-based approach, as for example in Allen (1979). Divay (1984, 1985, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1994), and others, all of which are essentially knowledge-rich expert systems.","The various attempts at rule formulation were related to differences in the phonemic inventory, the number of rules, the type and format of rules, and even the direction of parse of the rules (whether they were scanned from left to right or from right to left). Different approaches were also taken in the size of the dictionary, the algorithm used to scan or rescan the dictionary (if one was used), the methods for determining lexical stress placement, the amount of morphological analysis used, and the difficulties in the prediction of the correct phonemic form of homographs.","Part of the educational process for a child is learning to read, and educational literature is filled with disparate pedagogical approaches to this problem. Developing a letter-to-sound rule set in software is essentially teaching the computer how to read (pronounce) a language. The difficulty in developing an accurate algorithm to perform this task is directly proportional to the fit between graphemes and corresponding 496 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation phonemes as well as the allophonic complexity of the language in question. 2. Dictionary versus Letter-to-Sound Rules Any procedure to convert text into phonemes would necessarily make use of a lexical database or dictionary to provide for lookup of words prior to letter-to-sound conversion. Such a database typically consists of words that exhibit unusual stress patterns (for languages such as English), and of unassimilated or partially assimilated loanwords including place names and personal names that do not fit into the canonical phonological or phonotactic form of the language.","Memory is increasingly less expensive and we now have the capability to store in memory a large number of words (along with their phonetic equivalent, grammatical class, and meaning). Why not then store all words (or certainly all of the words that would be commonly encountered in text) in memory? First, if we include derived forms and technical jargon, there are well over three-quarters of a million words in the English or French language. It would be an extremely difficult task to create such a list. More importantly, new words come into the language every day and from these are generated many derived forms. Lastly, when we factor in items that may not even be found in a dictionary, such as proper nouns (first names, surnames, place names, names of corporations, etc.), the necessity of a rule-governed approach quickly becomes apparent. For example, there are roughly 1.5 million different surnames in the US alone (Spiegel 1985; Spiegel and Machi 1990; Vitale 1991); moreover, one-third of these surnames are unique in that they are singletons. In fact, at this stage in the technology, it is still the rule set and not the dictionary that is the more dominant, although this is beginning to change, primarily due to the need for more complex lexical entry containing information on syntax, semantics, and even pragmatics for more natural prosodics in text-to-speech tasks.","It is difficult and time consuming to place all derived forms in the dictionary, including singular and plural forms and all verb affixes, especially for a language like French where a verb can expand, depending on the conjugation, into about fifty strings consisting of the root plus suffixes. Code could, of course, be added in the dictionary modules providing information on how to form the plurals or conjugations. The lookup procedure could then strip some of the affixes to retrieve the root in the dictionary.","There do exist letter-to-sound systems based on very large dictionaries (for French, see Laporte [1988]) but they require a great deal of memory, especially if the lexical entries contain graphemic, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic information. The main advantage is that this dictionary can then be used to drive a sentence tagger and parser necessary for improving intonation and naturalness for speech synthesis. This universal electronic dictionary could also be used for speech recognition and machine translation. Today, most speech synthesizers do not include such a large dictionary, which, in any case, must be complemented by a set of rules just in case the word or the proper name is not in the dictionary. 3. Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion Problems for Both English and French In this section, we describe the problems encountered when converting from graphemes to phonemes for English and French. Some problems are similar in both languages, others are specific to one language or the other. 497 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 each of which retains its pronunciation. Usually, in French, s between two vowels is pronounced [z], otherwise [s]. The s in tournesol, entresol, tOlOsi~ge, vraisemblable, contresens, antisocial must be considered the beginning of a morpheme, and although it occurs between two vowels, is pronounced [s]. This morpheme decomposition is difficult and is sometimes based on a large dictionary of morphs. Some implementations have had as many as 12,000 for English (Allen et al., 1979). For English, and French, the number of words having this problem is relatively small, and can be dealt with by a dictionary or rules. In the English implementation, for example, many such morphemes can be incorporated directly into the letter-to-sound rule set itself. For certain other languages, such as German, where word compounding is quite common, morpheme decomposition algorithms tend to be much more complex. 3.4 Homographs Homographs are pairs of words that are orthographically identical but phonetically different. In English, this difference is often simply a difference in stress depending on the grammatical category of the word: permit (['p3\"mIt] noun vs. [po'mIt] verb), baton (['b~et~n] noun vs. [bo't~n] verb), arithmetic ([o'rI0m~tIk] noun vs. [a~rI0'metIk] adjective) and so on. However, it can also be a difference of one or more segments: deliberate ([dI'llborIt] adjective vs. [dI'llboreIt] verb), use ([juls] noun vs. [ju'z] verb) differ in terms of only one segment. Further, it is not always possible to resolve the ambiguity from part of speech: in I read books, the pronunciation of read ([ri'd] or [red]) is ambiguous. A less-frequently examined category, but one that is crucial to more natural speech synthesis, is what we will refer to as functor homographs. These are more subtle variations found in pairs such as can, which could be a verb ([k0en]) or a model auxiliary ([kN] or [kin] - [k0en]); just, which could be an adjective ([d3Ast]) or an adverb ([d3ist ]- [d3Ast]) , etc., where there is partial overlapping in careful speech. See Yarowsky (1994) on homograph disambiguation.","In French, the situation is similar. The same spelling can produce different phonemic forms: ills ([fis] 'son' vs. [fil] 'thread'); pr6sident ([prezida] 'president' vs. [prezid] 'they preside'), etc. The pronunciation typically depends on the grammatical category of the word: tier ('proud' or 'to trust'), est ('is' or 'East'), couvent ('convent' or 'they brood'), notions ('we were noting' or 'the notions'), as ('an ace' or 'you have'), are all ambiguous in terms of their pronunciation. The word six can be pronounced [sis] (j'en veux six), [siz] (six enfants), [si] (sixfi'lles). First-order context can sometimes solve the problem (nous notions vs. des notions; un as vs. tu as), but, generally, a parsing of the entire sentence is required. The ambiguity is often between a conjugated verb and another grammatical category. The entire sentence can be ambiguous as in \"les ills sont jolis\" where ills is pronounced differently depending on the meaning (sons or threads). 3.5 Stress For English, due to the interaction of stress and vowel reduction, knowing the stressed syllable is often crucial in determining the correct phoneme sequence (Halle and Keyser 1971). For instance, a word like aggravation has three tokens of the vowel grapheme a, but all are phonetically different. The vowel nucleus of the first syllable is [0e]; the stressed syllable va is manifested by [eI]; and vowel nucleus of the unstressed syllable gra (in this case) undergoes automatic vowel reduction and is realized as [o]. The stress pattern for English is difficult to predict and has to be learned. Nevertheless, some basic rules exist. We have seen the verb/noun homographs in the previous section. In words of two syllables, the verb has stress on the second syllable, the noun on the first. 500 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 such as le 'the' and de 'of'. If the last syllable is a consonant cluster ending in e, and the next word begins with a consonant, a short [3] is heard as in les ch~vres de [18 ysvr3d3] 'the goats of'; otherwise, more than two consonants would be in the same consonant cluster, and this presents articulatory difficulty in French and violates the constraints on syllable structure. Elision can be done in the first syllable of a word, but is considered familiar (vs. normal) style: petit [pti] 'small', recommencer [rk3mase] 'to begin again'.","In the middle of a word, elision is done for words such as tellement [t~lm~] 'so much' but not for justement [3yst3ma] 'precisely', which is additional support for the three-consonant cluster (CCC) constraint. 6 This elision sometimes does not occur, as in poetry reading, for example.","The rule does not provide for words like batelier [bat31je] 'boatman', or bachelier [bay31je] 'bachelor' where elision is not done. The semivowel [j] can be considered a consonant, and the three-consonant cluster constraint applies.","Sometimes, an [3] phoneme is added between two words. For instance, in the newspaper name Ouest-France [wSst#fr~s], an epenthetic [3] vowel is often inserted [w~st3 #fras]. This happens between two words, in the context CC#C, and is again the result of the difficulty of pronouncing more than two consecutive consonants. 3.8 Segmental Phonology and Speech Rate These rules are generic rules and sometimes may not apply in unusual cases, such as in very slow speech where each word is pronounced or in poetry (which often has its own set of rules different from normal speech). Thus far, in the area of speech synthesis, at least, not much has been done to modify segmental phonology according to speech rate.","In English, when the speech rate exceeds a certain threshold, in natural speech, pauses disappear and segmental durations become shortened. In the future, in text-to-speech systems, some segments and even syllables will disappear entirely and certain functors will be greatly attenuated. See Dirksen and Coleman (1994) for more on speech rate.","In French, in words containing a semivowel followed by a vowel, if the speech rate is slow enough (or sometimes in poetic contexts), a semivowel could be produced as a vowel: lui 'him' ([lqi] vs. [lyi]), nuage 'cloud' ([nqa3] vs. [nya3] ), lier 'to bind' ([lje] vs. [he]). A common phrase such as parce que 'because', which is typically two syllables in normal speech ([parsko]) becomes three syllables in very slow or emphatic speech ([parsoko]). In fast speech, the phrase je te le dirai [3otolodir~] 'I will tell you' is pronounced je t'le dirai [33tlodir~] or j'tel dirai [3t31dir~] eliding one or two [3]. 3.9 Proper Names For proper names, the correspondence between written names and their pronunciation is even more difficult to specify due to their disparate origins. In English (whether British or American), there are many different ethnic groups represented in a telephone book or database of names. In a typical American telephone book, for example, are names that originate from hundreds of languages. In France, when a person is asked to provide a proper name, he or she is also often asked to spell it. For cities like Caen ([ka]), Rennes ([rCn]), Reims ([r~s]), etc., the pronunciation differs substantially from the spelling. In proper names like Lesage, Desprds, Bourgneuf, Montrouge, Lesventes, it is important to recognize the morphemes Le, Des, Bourg, Mont to correctly transcribe. In 6 In French, la r~gle des 3 consonnes. 502 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation both anglophone and francophone countries, these patterns of immigration have been sufficient to make this a serious problem for any automatic phoneticization algorithm.","The rules for proper names can generally be derived from the rules for words. Nevertheless, a large superset of rules has to be added to obtain very high accuracy since the phonotactics change from language to language. Moreover, to compound the problem, the pronunciation of proper names outside of the foreign speech community is often different from their original pronunciation. For example, in the US, e ending Italian names (pronounced [e] in Italian) is typically pronounced [il] or even [ ] (not pronounced). The proper name Falcone is pronounced in anglophone countries as either [f~elk~)ni'] or even [f~ellcDn], Bach as either [bax] or [bak]. In French, we observe a similar situation where the name Smith is pronounced [smis] and Thatcher as [sat~or] as French does not have a [0] phoneme.","There have been successful attempts to automatically detect the ethnic group of a proper name for use in anglophone countries like the United States, and to apply a different set of rules depending on that group (Church 1985, Vitale 1991). Trigram frequencies are computed from a large set of proper names whose ethnic group is known, and used to classify a new proper name in terms of some language, language group, or language family (the linguistic etymology of the name). Depending on that classification, different subsets of language-specific rules can be activated. 4. Expert Systems Expert systems are used to facilitate the transfer of the knowledge of a specific domain from an expert to a computer. They traditionally distinguish between the system, which is as independent as possible from the application, and the expert rules, which are application dependent. The system requires a computer specialist, the rules require an expert in the domain to be processed, in this case, a linguist. Everybody is an \"expert\" in reading his or her own language, and the average educated individual does not hesitate in front of a word like monsieur or second in French, or hiccough or Edinburgh in English, even though the pronunciation may be quite different from the spelling. In any case, we apply, albeit unconsciously, rules to read text aloud.","Considering the complexity of the problems presented above, it was quickly un-derstood that letter-to-sound rules had to be treated like an expert system with a rule set developed by an expert (a linguist) and an interpreter to interpret the rules. This is a pragmatic approach based on failures of systems that use hard-coded rules that the linguist would be forced to program or the programmer would be forced to articulate. 5. The English Rule Set 5.1 The Rule Formalism for English Essentially, a letter-to-sound rule can be viewed as similar to a phonological rule in classical phonology except that it converts a grapheme string to a phoneme string. These rules may be context-sensitive or context-free. A lexical entry in a dictionary (without syntactic and semantic information) is, in essence, a context-free letter-to-sound rule.","An efficient rule set had to be developed. This rule set had to be:","• rigorous (have a minimum of ordering constraints, such that new rules could be added at random with a minimum of liability); • complete, with a large number of rules covering large sequences 503 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 including morphs both free and bound; optimally parsed in order to make use of morphological information relevant to allophonic variation as well as to stress. Using these criteria as a working basis, we developed a set of highly accurate letter-to-sound rules.","In English, the scan is done right to left to strip the suffixes of a word in sequence as shown in Example 4 below. The input is a string of graphemes, the output a string of phonemes (and occasionally the allophones themselves). There is only one scan. The rules themselves are stated in terms a linguist would be familiar with such as the following: X ~ [y]; (context-free) or X --* [y] /W - Z; (context-sensitive) where X, W, and Z are grapheme sequences and [y] is a phoneme (or phone) sequence.","A two-tiered architecture (compiler and interpreter) has been designed to easily define and modify the rule set in our implementation of grapheme-to-phoneme rules.","The rule compiler transforms the external form of the rules into an internal form that can be easily used by the rule interpreter. The grapheme pattern is encoded as a simple text string. The left and right context patterns are encoded as strings of operators and parameters for a pattern-matching procedure, and the replacement phoneme string is encoded using the system's internal phoneme codes. 7 The grapheme pattern and the left context pattern are reversed by the rule compiler (that is, stored in right-to-left order) so that they are stored in the direction that they are actually used. The rule compiler does not perform any sophisticated checking of the rules; it does not check that the rule set is complete, nor does it check that long rules are always presented before short rules.","The rule interpreter begins processing a word by setting its current position to the rightmost grapheme. It then searches linearly through the rules, in the order they were written, until it finds a rule that matches at that current position. A rule matches if the grapheme string matches, the left context pattern matches (if present), and the right context string matches (if present). The grapheme string is matched using a simple right-to-left text compare, and the context strings are matched by a recursive procedure that interprets the pattern string built by the rule compiler. The phonemes for the rule are then placed in the output, the current position is advanced over the matched graphemes, and the process is repeated until a rule consumes the leftmost grapheme. Since the rule set contains an unconstrained rule for each grapheme, the matcher will always find a rule, and will always make progress. Matched graphemes are not deleted; the word is left intact, since \"consumed\" graphemes could be part of the right-hand context of some future rule. The phoneme string generated by the letter-to-sound rule interpreter is represented as a double linked list. This representation was chosen 7 The right-to-left match has already been described. It should be pointed out that the use of \"text\" in \"text string\" was not ASCII, but an encoded alphabet in which some grapheme pairs, like qu, gu and certain others were encoded as single letters, because doing so made it unnecessary to have a large number of (unnecessary) blocking rules in the rules for the grapheme u. 504 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation because subsequent processing (syllable marking, stress analysis, and final allophone adjustment) needs to be able to scan the phoneme string in both directions, and needs to be able to add and delete phonemes at arbitrary places, s","It would be, of course, possible to use more elaborate string-matching techniques to increase the speed of rule selection, but this was not done in our system because letter-to-sound processing never uses a significant fraction of the total processing time."]},{"title":"5.2 Examples of Rules for English Example 1","paragraphs":["The following is an example of a set of two letter-to-sound rules for the letter c in English.

It does not account for words such as cello ['t felon3] or concerto [kon'tf¢otoLq, because these are unassimilated borrowings that still show the original Italian palatalization rule of: c --+ [t~ / - {i,e}; When we have a rule that handles n words, where n is between 1 and some small number, say fewer than 7, we generally put these forms in a dictionary instead of using up computation to process such a small number of words.

This time, however, we are always going from a morphophonemic to a phonetic realization as in: {x} ~ [Yl / [w] - [z]; where {x} is an archiphoneme or abstract morphophoneme, [y] is some phonetic sequence, and [w] and [z] are some environment E, where E is either phonemic or phonetic.

The external codes of the units to be processed must be declared, i.e., the grapheme codes (upper and lower case letters, numbers, punctuation, diacritics) and the phoneme codes. These codes may be composed of one or more characters. In this way, users can define their own code, and the formalism can be used for different languages.

A string consists of the concatenation of the predeclared external characters: ele2e3 is a string. A class is a set of strings having a common property. 'C1' and 'C2' are classes. 'C1' : el, e2, e3/ 'C2' : ele2, e5el, e2e3/ 6.1.3 Blocks of Rules. The set of rules consists of one or several blocks of rules. Each block describes a process, taking the input text, processing it, and replacing it by the 510 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation result of the processing. The different blocks can be activated sequentially, or directly (execute block 5 for example).","begin {Block i} rule 1 rule n end 6.1.4 Rules. The syntax of a rule is: (number): (Is) --* (rs)/(lc) - (rc); where number is the rule label; Is (left string) is the string to be replaced; rs (right string) is the string replacing Is; Ic (left context) represents the strings to be found on the left side of Is; rc (right context) represents the strings to be found on the right of Is. lc and rc are formed with operands (characters, strings, classes) and operators (concatenation, logical or, negation). 6.1.5 Using One or Two Buffers. If the contexts match, the rs string replaces the Is string. This process can be achieved using either one or two buffers. With one buffer, the rs string replaces the ls string, so the left context of a rule must be written according to the rules previously used. With two buffers, the writing of the left context of a rule is easier because the input string is only modified at the end of the block of rules. In effect, three contexts are usable: the left context and right context in the input buffer, and the left context in the output buffer. This left output context is written between angled brackets. 6.1.6 Formal Examples of Rules. E = A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H/; input and output characters 'C1', 'C2', 'C3' classes formed with strings of E.

The rule having the longest match between the set of all the Is strings of the block, and the string beginning with the next character to be processed in the input text, is searched first. If both contexts are true, the rule applies, otherwise another rule is searched for, first any other rule with the same Is, and then in decreasing length of Is matches.","Let us consider the following rules: begin end 50 : AB --* 51 :A --~ 52 : ABC --* 53 : AB 54 : BC ---* 55 : ABCG .; .; .; .; .; .; and the input string, \"ABCE\" to be processed.","The longest match between the left string (Is) of the rules in the block, and the input string to be processed is searched. In this case the longest match is \"ABC\". So, rule 52 is tested. If the contexts are true, the rule is applied, and the next character to process is \"E\" in the input string. If the context is false, the rules are tested in decreasing order of the longest match. Rules with \"AB\" as ls are tested in the order in which they are written (50, 53). Then if no rule has yet been applied, rule 51 is tested. If no rule is true, the first character A to process is copied into the output buffer, and the procedure starts again with the next character B. The order in which rules are tried is: 52, 50, 53, 51. The order in which the rules are written is significant only for those having the same Is.","Using the formalism of the expert system, the expert is in charge of defining a set of rules to simulate his or her expertise. 6.2 Examples of Rules for French As this paper is in English dealing with the French language, and in the event that the reader might be not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of French, only a few examples will be given to explain the mechanism of the letter-to-sound rules for French. 512 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation"]},{"title":"Example 6","paragraphs":["0 oi on is pronounced [o] in moto, loto, solo. is pronounced [w][a] in moi, pois, lois.","is pronounced [5] in bon, but not in abandonner, bonheur, or bonne, where the rule for o applies.","oin is pronounced [w][£] in loin, poing but not in avoine where the rule for oi applies.

This corpus was chosen because it consists of complex polysyllabic forms; (2) a sample taken from the Brown corpus (19,837 words), which we felt to be sizable enough and representative enough to use to examine letter-to-sound accuracy. 516 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation","On the Huggins corpus, without the use of the exceptions dictionary, our rule set scored 94.9% of words.

Out of a total word count of 19,837 words, the dictionary hit count was 7,337 (36.99%); the rules matched 5,432 words (27.38%) for a total word match of 12,769 or 64.37%. Of the words missed, 3,905 (19.69%) missed by only one segmental phoneme or phone and 3,636 (18.33%) had incorrect stress placement.

The word is converted to phonetics and searched for in the phonetic dictionary index (used in both CD-ROM dictionaries Le Grand Robert and Le Petit Robert) (Rey et al. 1989). For information retrieval, open and closed phonemes are always considered identical. The same mechanism (using phonetics) is used to retrieve a proper name (without knowing how to spell it) through the 30,000 proper names of the phone book of the city of Dakar (Senegal). The system is also used in the Taurus multimedia database software (from DCI: Data Concept Informatique) to create an index on one field of a structure defined by the user of the database, and to retrieve the corresponding information even if it is misspelled. Other similar uses are under investigation for the pronunciation of names from on-line telephone books in particular and telecommunications applications in general (Alcatel TITN Answare). 8. Final Remarks It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss letter-to-sound procedures in languages other than English and French. However, the disparate nature of different languages argues for a brief mention of our experience in developing letter-to-sound rule sets in other languages. 12 8.1 Simple Systems In certain languages, as diverse as Spanish and Swahili, letter-to-sound rule sets are extremely easy to produce, due to the extremely close fit between orthography and its phonemic/phonetic equivalent. First, there are many languages that developed a writing system only recently. Swahili, for example, was written in Arabic script until 1850 when Krapf, a German missionary, introduced the Roman alphabet to the Bantuspeaking peoples of the East African coast. Consequently, in the time span of less that 150 years, the phonological and phonetic systems of the language have not had time to change to any significant extent. Secondly, many languages have undergone some spelling reform. Czech, for example, underwent spelling reform fairly recently and the orthographic system was brought into line with the phonological and phonetic system. Third, there are some languages in which the orthography had a close fit with the phonemic system. Spanish, for example, is a simple system in that there is an almost iconic relationship between graphemes and their phonemic equivalent. In fact, even lexical stress is marked in many forms and, where it is not, it is almost always predictable. 8.2 Mid-Level Systems Many languages are somewhat more complex and fit into a second category of languages of mid-level difficulty. German, for example, has a large morphological system yet it is surprisingly simple in terms of letter-to-sound rules. If one lists a large number of common morphemes, it becomes a simple task to state an accurate set of letter-to-","12 All languages of the world are of an equal degree of complexity. Primitive languages are a myth perpetrated by early anthropologists, missionaries, and adventurers. However, when we compare different subsytems of any two languages, it quickly becomes clear that.subsystems are vastly different in complexity. This is true of the phonological, phonetic, morphological, syntactic, semantic and letter-to-sound subsystems of two different languages; some are an order of magnitude more complex than others. 518 Divay and Vitale Grapheme-Phoneme Translation sound rules. Many languages with a high synthetic index (Greenberg 1990) fall into this categoryJ 3 8.3 Complex Systems Certain languages, such as English and French, are among the most complex languages to construct letter-to-sound rules for. These are not the only languages in this last category. Any language with an old writing system that has not undergone a modicum of spelling reform but has undergone dramatic phonological, morphonemic, and morphological changes will probably fall into this category. 9. Conclusions We have presented the difficulties of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for English and French. Both languages have evolved from different origins, and are the results of the historical influence of other languages from which words have been borrowed and assimilated, sometimes only partially. English and French have interacted and continue to interact with each other. For both languages, the spelling has been enforced by dictionaries and laws, but the pronunciation has continued to evolve, widening the gap between the written and spoken components of the language.","Both the English and French translation systems presented in this paper are based on rewriting rules. Nevertheless, some differences exist in the syntax and the interpretation of these rules. For a more theoretical approach to rewriting rules, see Kaplan and Kay (1994).","English is scanned once from right to left to better take into account the suffixes of the word, which in certain cases determine the stressed syllable. The rule transforms the grapheme into phonemes and stress marks used by the stress module. In some cases, the input string is modified to add a morpheme boundary, or to replace the suffix by another suffix to continue the conversion. Syllabification, stress, and allophonic rules are achieved by programs.","French uses the concept of a class that allows for the grouping of strings having a common property, thus reducing the number of rules. Several blocks of rules can be defined corresponding to different scans from left to right of the string (the output string replacing the input text at the end of a block of rules). The input string is not modified. Rules can check the left and right contexts of the input string, and the left context of the output string. French is not a stressed language, so there is no need for a syllabification module or a stress module.","Many problems persist for phonemicization. In English, suffix stripping, compound decomposition, and primary stressed syllable are very important to get the proper phoneme string, and are carried out mostly by rules without an explicit morph dictionary, contrary to as in Allen (1976), who uses a morph dictionary with 12,000 morphs, or Coker (1985), whose dictionary has 43,000 morphs. In French, the word-by-word conversion is probably simpler due to the absence of stressed syllables. Affixes do not alter the pronunciation of the root; compare, for instance, photo, photograph, and photography in English with photo, photographe and photographie in French. But in French, there are more interactions between words due to the linking problem (nous avons) and mute e (chemin defer). These interactions are also dependent on speech rate.","Sometimes the homograph problem can be solved by looking at the left and right context of the word, but the general case requires a better understanding of the overall 13 The synthetic index is Is = w + m, where w is a word and m is a morpheme. 519 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4 structure of the sentence. This is also required to get a more natural prosodics in text-to-speech synthesizers.","The same formalism could be used for both English and French with a slight modification, for instance, of the French formalism. Blocks of rules should indicate if the scan is to be done from left to right or from right to left. In the right-to-left scan, the right context of the output buffer would be usable (instead of the left context if the scan is done from left to right). The word scandalousness could be decomposed by the following rules:","begin RL RL for Right to Left 10:ness --* +ness / ous - _; 20:ous --* +ous / al - (+),_; end + in the output buffer resulting in scandal+ous+ness. Translating the root scandal could be done either from left to right or from right to left in one or more blocks of rules.","The required output phoneme string depends on the application. For speech synthesis, one output string is needed for a word. If several pronunciations are possible, the software has to produce only one for the synthesizer.","Speech recognition algorithms must know all the phonetic variations of the words in the vocabulary to be recognized, so the output should be a set of phonetic strings corresponding to the input word. Some rules must be declared optional, and the interpreter modified to take them into account.","For database searches, a set of equivalences can be devised where two (or more) phonemes or allophones could be considered correct. For example, in many cases [0] and [i] can be considered equivalents. Similarly, [o][1] and [L] (syllabic [1]) can also be considered equivalents. For French open [a] and close [(1] could be equivalent, as would be [o] and [o], or [el and [C]. The search could even be done only on phoneme consonants (for proper name searches, for instance).","To our knowledge, learning algorithms, although promising, have not (yet) reached the level of rule sets developed by humans. The automatic discovery of the underlying structure of a language is not easy, nor is the developing of a universal rewriting rule formalism for the different languages.","Dictionaries and sets of rules will have to continue to coexist either as a dictionary of exceptions and a large set of rules, or as a large dictionary and a set of rules to deal with exceptions.","References","Ainsworth, W.
