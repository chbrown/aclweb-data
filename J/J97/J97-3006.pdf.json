We then demonstrate some problems with a popular centering-based approach with respect to these motivations. 1. Introduction A central claim of centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995 henceforth GJW) is that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others, and that this property imposes constraints on a speaker's use of different types of expressions to refer to them. To articulate some of these constraints, they define several fundamental centering concepts and propose rules based on them that should be followed by a speaker in producing coherent discourse. This work has led to several analyses employing centering theory and extensions of it, particularly in the area of pronoun interpretation (Kameyama 1986; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Di Eugenio 1990, 1996; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996, inter alia; see also citations within GJW, forthcoming papers in Walker, Joshi, and Prince in press, and psycholinguistic studies described in Hudson-D'Zmura 1989, Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993, and Brennan 1995). 1 In this squib, we discuss some facets of the pronoun interpretation problem that motivate a centering-style analysis, and demonstrate some problems with a popular centering-based approach with respect to these motivations. 2. Overview of Centering Centering theory is motivated by two related facts about language that are not explained by purely content-based models of reference and coherence (cf. Hobbs [1979]): (1) that the coherence of a discourse does not depend only on semantic content but also on the type of referring expressions used, and (2) the existence of garden path effects, in which pronouns appear to be resolved before adequate semantic information has become available: Pronouns and definite descriptions are not equivalent with respect to their effect on coherence. We conjecture that this is so because they * Artificial Intelligence Center, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025.

In the most pronounced cases, the wrong choice will mislead a hearer and force backtracking to a correct interpretation.

Passage (1) is presumed to be in a longer segment that is currently centered on John. (1) a. He has been acting quite odd. (He=John) b. He called up Mike yesterday. c.

As we noted in Section 2, such effects distinguish centering-based approaches from purely content-based models of reference and coherence (Hobbs 1979, inter alia). As Brennan (1995) explains: While knowledge-based theories often succeed in resolving referring expressions in this manner [=using semantic information and world knowledge, without taking advantage of the kinds of syntactic constraints that centering uses], they do not model human discourse processing. An entirely knowledge-based algorithm would not reproduce an addressee's immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun as cospecifying the backward center, even when this results in an implausible interpretation. (Brennan 1995, p. 145) However, other examples demonstrate that the BFP algorithm also cannot model an addressee's immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun, and therefore cannot properly account for the pronoun interpretation preferences that result from such tendencies.","To illustrate, we consider a modification to passage (3), shown in passage (6), with three possible follow-ons (6el-e3).

In follow-on (6e0, assigning He=Terry results in a Continue whereas assigning He=Tony results in a Smooth-Shift, and so Terry is preferred. In follow-on (6e2), assigning He=Terry results in a Rough-Shift whereas assigning He=Tony again results in a Smooth-Shift, and so Tony is preferred.

Finally, in sentence (6e3), the assignment of He=Terry results in a Rule 1 violation--the Cb Tony is not pronominalized whereas Terry is--putting it in the company of highly awkward examples such as passage (1). If we ignore this violation, the resulting transition is again a Rough-Shift, the lowest-ranked relation. (The assignment of He=Tony is ruled out by a syntactic constraint violation.)","These varied results are inconsistent with the aforementioned facts concerning these passages in both empirical and theoretical respects. Empirically, the results are counter to the more consistent preferences associated with the subject pronouns in each case. Theoretically, such consistency is just what one would expect given a hearer's immediate tendency to resolve subject pronouns based on the existing discourse state. In either regard, it is unclear why the inclusion of the phrases with him in variant (6e2) and with Tony in variant (6e3) should lead to such varied predictions for the subject pronoun. In fact, the example illustrates a general property of the BFP algorithm: that the preferred assignment for a pronoun in such examples, even in subject position, cannot be determined until the entire sentence has been processed. This property results from the fact that determining the transition type between a pair of utterances Un and Un+l requires the identification of Cb(Un+l), and a noun phrase (pronominal or not) can occur at any point in the utterance that will alter the assignment of Cb(Un+l). This is what occurs in the analysis of passage (6): whereas the Cb of sentence (6el) is these sentences in that any garden path in sentence (6e3) may be resolved earlier than in (6el) and (6e2), specifically, at the point at which Tony is reached. This is a result of the fact that syntactic constraints on coreference can be used to eliminate the possibility of He referring to Tony at that time, whereas in the other cases it is semantic information that comes later in the sentence that eliminates Tony as a referent. 472 Kehler Centering for Pronoun Interpretation Terry assuming"]},{"title":"He","paragraphs":["refers to Terry, the occurrence of"]},{"title":"him","paragraphs":["later in the sentence in (6e2) and similarly"]},{"title":"Tony","paragraphs":["in (6e3) causes the"]},{"title":"Cb","paragraphs":["to be Tony, thus changing the bindings that constitute the various transition possibilities, and in this case, the predicted preferred referents.

Therefore, because the relevant Cb and Cp relations are the same, a BFP-style approach cannot distinguish between these cases, s These examples show that pronominal reference preferences are affected by additional types of intersentential relationships that may be identifiable at the time a pronoun is encountered; proposals along these lines include preference-ranking schemes (e.g., Kameyama [1996]) and systems in which salience and the process of determining coherence relations interact (e.g., Kehler [1995]). 4. Conclusions The pronoun resolution preferences that result from an addressee's immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun motivate pursuing a centering-based approach. However, certain examples demonstrate that BFP's utilization of the centering rules does not model this tendency, which in turn limits the ability of their algorithm to account for the data. Furthermore, data has been presented that shows that in addition to the salience factors utilized by BFP, additional types of intersentential relationships must be taken into account.
