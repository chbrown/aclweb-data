Previously proposed methods rely heavily on word-based statistics. Under a word-based approach, frequent words with a consistent translation can be aligned at a high rate of precision. However, words that are less frequent or exhibit diverse translations generally do not have statistically significant evidence for confident alignment, thereby leading to incomplete or incorrect alignments. The algorithm proposed herein attempts to broaden coverage by exploiting lexicographic resources. To this end, we draw on the two classification systems of words in Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) and Tongyici Cilin (Synonym Forest, CILIN). Automatically acquired class-based alignment rules are used to compensate for what is lacking in a bilingual dictionary such as the English-Chinese version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LecDOCE). In addition, this alignment method is implemented using LecDOCE examples and their translations for training and testing, while further examples from a technical manual in both English and Chinese are used for an open test. Quantitative results of the closed and open tests are also summarized. 1. Introduction Brown, Cocke, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Jelinek, Laffert~ Mercer, and Roosin (1990) advocate a statistical approach to machine translation (MT) and initiate much of the recent interest in bilingual corpora. Statistical machine translation (SMT) can be understood as a word-by-word model consisting of two submodels: a language model for generating a source text segment S and a translation model for mapping S to its translation T. They recommend using a bilingual corpus to train the parameters of translation probability, Pr(S I T) in the translation model. For MT and other purposes, many methods have been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Sirnard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993; Gale and Church 1993), and for other language pairs, including English-German, English-Chinese, and English-Japanese (Kay and ROscheisen 1993; Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, Helfman, and Satish 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu 1994). Alignment at other levels of resolution is obviously useful. A section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, collocation, or word can be aligned to its translation (Kupiec 1993; Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996). Other logical approaches involve aligning parse trees of a sentence and its translation (Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman 1996), or simultaneously generating parse trees and alignment arrangements (Wu 1995). • Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 30043, Taiwan, ROC.

For these applications, we must go one step further from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process of word alignment, the translation of each source word is identified. This study concentrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence and its translation.","In the context of SMT, Brown et al. (1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I T) for word alignment. Model 1 assumes that Pr(S ] T) depends only on lexical translation probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates into the jth word t in T.

Model 2 enhances Model I by considering the dependence of Pr(S I T) on the distortion probability (DP) d(i I J, l, m) where I and m are the respective lengths of S and T measured in number of words. Brown et al. (1990) propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters for LTP and DP from a bilingual corpus. The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both functions converge. In the expectation phase, the parameters t(s I t) and"]},{"title":"d(i I J, l, m) in","paragraphs":["the SMT model for all possible values of s, t, i, j, I, and m are estimated from the sample of an aligned bilingual corpus. In the maximization phase, each sentence-translation pair in the corpus is aligned by maximizing the translation probability, Pr(S I T). They examine the feasibility of aligning the English-French Hansards corpus using the SMT model, on both the sentence level and the word level. The SMT model is then tested for the task of machine translation. The model produces 35 acceptable translations for 73 sentences. However, to our knowledge, the degree of success of word alignment has not yet been explored.","Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) observe that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bilingual text scanned by an OCR device is quite difficult. In such a circumstance, they recommend aligning words directly without the preprocessing phase of sentence alignment. Under that proposal, a rough character-by-character alignment is first performed. Based on the character alignment, words are subsequently aligned based on a modified version of Brown et al.'s Model 2. The authors report that 60.5% of 65,000 words in a noisy document are correctly aligned. For 84% of the words, the offset from correct alignment is at most 3.","Gale and Church (1991b) present an alternative algorithm that does not estimate and store probabilities for all word pairs to reduce memory requirement and to ensure robustness of probability estimation. Instead, for each source word s, only a handful of target words strongly associated with s are found and stored. Such a task is achieved by applying a X2-1ike statistic. They report that the method produces highly precise (95%) alignment for 61% of the words in the 800 sentences tested.","This paper is motivated by the following observations: First, the above survey dearly reveals that word-based methods offer only limited coverage even after they are trained with an extremely large bilingual corpus. Second, we believe that for most applications, low coverage is just as serious as low precision. For aligned corpora to be useful for NLP tasks such as machine translation and word-sense disambiguation, a coverage rate higher than 60% is desirable, even at the expense of a slightly lower precision rate. 314 Sue J.

Experimental results indicate that classification based on existing thesauri is highly effective in broadening coverage while maintaining a high precision rate.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we briefly discuss the nature of text and translation that justifies a class-based approach. A set of three algorithms leading to class-based alignment are outlined in Section 3. The algorithms' effectiveness is demonstrated through examples and their translations in the LecDOCE (Longman Group 1992), a bilingual version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE, Proctor 1988), as well as sentences from bilingual texts in the LightShip User's Guide (Pilot Software Inc. 1993; Galaxy Software Services 1994). The experiments we undertook to assess the performance of these algorithms are the topic of Section 4. Quantitative experimental results are also summarized. In Section 5, we analyze the experimental results and consider ways in which the proposed algorithms might be extended and improved. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6. 2. Text and Translation as a Class-to-Class Mapping The discussion in Section 1 indicates the limitations of statistical methods. As an alternative, we examine the feasibility of using an everyday bilingual dictionary in machine-readable form for word alignment. With tens of thousands of headword-and-translation pairs that can be used to propose high-precision connections, a bilingual machine-readable dictionary (MRD) surprisingly leads to even lower coverage than a statistically-derived lexicon. Below, observations are made to account for the reason why a substantial portion of translations deviate from what is listed in the bilingual MRD or what is statistically probable. Such deviations inhibit word-based methods ' from achieving broad coverage. We contend that a word's translational deviation is mostly bounded within the relevant semantic classes, thus justifying a class-based approach to word alignment. 2.1 Diverse In-Context Translations Given that the translations for a headword (dictionary translations, DTs for short) can be extracted from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE, a word in S can be aligned at a high precision rate with its DTs found in T. Headword-and-translation pairs are a reliable knowledge source for word alignment. However, they cover only a small part of the connections in an average sentence and its translation. Our experiments reveal that the translations of a word in context (in-context translations, ICTs for short) are frequently more diversified than the offerings in an everyday bilingual dictionary. More specifically, less than 30% of the English words in the context of LecDOCE examples translate into one of the relevant DTs in the same dictionary.","Translations in an everyday dictionary are meant to provide the reader with the idea of what is implied by the headword"]},{"title":"out of context;","paragraphs":["they are frequently more of an"]},{"title":"explanation","paragraphs":["than a"]},{"title":"translation.","paragraphs":["For instance, one LecDOCE sense entry defines the word"]},{"title":"boy","paragraphs":["as 'infml esp.

These include (1) a failure on the dictionary's (or the statistically derived lexicon's) part to cover a needed word sense, (2) mismatches in sense specificity between 315 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 the two languages, (3) collocation pattern, and (4) frequent use of interchangeable synonymous translation not covered in the dictionary. These factors are the reasons why many translations are statistically unlikely, thereby leading to a low coverage rate for word-based methods. Sense Gaps. Dictionary and statistically derived translations might not cover the word sense appropriate to a given word in context. This is particularly true when using an everyday dictionary for aligning bilingual technical manuals. For instance, the LecDOCE lists four senses and relevant translations for the word click, including (1) ~ ~~{~ 'to make a slight and short sound', (2)/~ 'to succeed', (3) {,~ ~ 'to fall into place', (4) ~,K~,~ 'to be a quick success, esp. with members of the opposite sex', none of which is the right sense for ~ 'to press', the translation of click in the context of (El): (El) Click anywhere else on the screen background or press ESC. (C1) ~i~l~flJ~:l~i'~__--F]~ ESCo Mismatch in Sense Specificity. Dictionary treatment of word senses in the source language might not correspond to the level of specificity for the relevant concepts in the target language. For instance, the LecDOCE differentiates two word senses for the word news by the means in which it is reported: whether it is via electronic (radio or television) or non-electronic (newspaper) media. In Chinese, the relevant concept is also differentiated according to how it is reported; however, the difference is between mass media (translated as ~r~) and personal communication (translated as ~,~,). The following examples (E2, C2) and (E3, C3) demonstrate this particular instance of mismatch in sense specificity. (E2) to listen to the 7 o'clock news broadcast. (C2) ~t~ti~~o (E3) Our latest news of our son was a letter a month ago. (C3) ~J ~-~ ~ ~ii~l.~ ~ f~I-- ~ ~J ~/0~J ~ ~l~ o Collocation Pattern. The collocation pattern often forces the choice of an ICT quite different from the DTs. For instance, the LecDOCE lists ~r~ 'news' and ~r~ 'news reportage' as the translations for news. However, the translation for news modified by bad is usually ~j0~, 'message'. Similarly, lady modified by old almost surely translates into 5~ 'wife' rather than the DTs, ~ 'lady' or ~;~f'~ 'woman' given in the LecDOCE. The following examples provide further details. (E4) Nothing but bad news in the newspaper today. (C4) @3~.~_L~ ~ 0g, o (C4') ~@~W,~ l-.~~r~ o (E5) He was very attentive to the old lady and did everything for her. 316 Sue J. Ker and Jason S.

However, this is limited to synonyms that appear as an alternative translation frequently and consistently in a bilingual corpus. Bounding the ICTs. An ICT may deviate from the relevant DTs for a variety of reasons, but the deviation is not without constraints. Table 1 lists some examples of deviating translations taken from the LecDOCE. Examples include the words news, meet, lady, grief, care, and child and their respective translations ~j,~,, ~j~, ~, ,~, ~, and q~. Notice that most in-context and dictionary translations of source words are bounded within the same category in a typical thesaurus such as the LLOCE (McArthur 1992) and CILIN (Mei et al. 1993). For instance, Da19-class words in CILIN (news and messages), ~J~,~,, ~r~, ~ appear as the translations (DTs and ICTs) for Ge194-words in LLOCE (information and news) such as news and report. Similarl3~ Idl8-class words (hitting, touching, meeting, and missing), ~, ~J, ~, Mi~ appear as the translations for McO72-words (meeting people and things) such as meet and encounter. This finding suggests that LTP can be estimated more robustly via class-to-class mapping. Furthermore, such ICTs and DTs are often synonymous compounds 317 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 Table 1 Disparity between ICT and DT is bounded within thesaurus categories.

These connections can be subsequ6ntly used as the basis for generalizing to a class-based alignment rule in the form of (X, Y), which stipulate the connection between an X-class word and a Y-class word. 2.2 Class-based Word Alignment To ensure broad coverage, the class-based approach seems to be a promising alternative to word-based methods. Classes can be formed from words in more than one way. Automatic statistical methods for derived classes (Brown, Della Pietra, deSouza, Lai, and Mercer 1992) are not appropriate, since they also suffer low coverage due to data sparseness. Classes formed from morphologically related words are easy to derive and apply. Morphological classes can be formed, either from words that start with the same five-character prefix as in Gale and Church (1991b), or rigorous analysis as suggested in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Lafferty, and Mercer (1992). Although easily applicable, morphological classes are not particularly effective in broadening coverage of word alignment. Chang and Chen (1994) also examine the feasibility of using part-of-speech classes. A potential alternative involves adopting categories available in machine-readable lexicographic resources such as Roget's thesaurus (Chapman 1977) or hand-crafted computer lexicons (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, and Miller 1990; McRoy 1992). 3. Algorithms Leading to Class-based Word Alignment This section describes a series of three algorithms leading to a class-based system for word alignment. The first algorithm attempts to obtain reliable connections. The second algorithm generalizes the connections into a list of class-based rules, which stipulate that a pair of classes of words in the source and target languages are likely mutual translations. The third algorithm performs the actual word alignment based on the acquired rules, in addition to DTs. 319 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 3.1 Dictionary-based Word Alignment This section describes a rudimentary word-alignment algorithm, DictAlign, based on the DTs from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE. Consider a text and translation pair (S, T), a word s in S, and its ICT, t in T. Let DTs denote the set of translations listed in the LecDOCE for the headword s. Recall that if for a word t in T, there is a dt in DTs such that t matches dt completely or partially, then, t is likely to be the ICT of s. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, DictAlign computes the set WT = {t ] t is a word in T} and calculates the similarity between each t and the DTs relevant to S. A similarity measure based on the unweighted Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) can be given as follows:","2 x Id n tl (1) Sim(d, t) - id [ + it I where d, t"]},{"title":"Idl Itl la n tl","paragraphs":["= Mandarin morpheme strings, = the number of the morphemes in d, = the number of the morphemes in t, = the number of the morphemes in the intersection of d and t. Based on this similarity measure, the likelihood of a connection can be associated with the following formulation that links the likelihood of a connection to similarity with a DT:","DTSim(s, t) = max Sire(d, t) (2) dEDTs For instance, consider the following sentence and its Mandarin translation, focusing on the word encounter: S = He encountered many difficulties. T = We will have the following: Ws = {he, encounter, many, difficulty} wT = 2, iil, Iil , }","DTencounter = {~, ~11~, ~ }. Therefore, the connections relevant to encounter with nonzero DTSim values based on unweighted Dice coefficient are as follows: DTSim( encounter, ~ ) DTSim( encounter, ~] ) = max{Sim(~, ~),Sim(itll~, ~),Sim(~tl~, ~)}","2xl 0 2xl~ = max 1+2,1_T_2,i_T_~j=0.67 = max{Sim(~, ~t] ),Sim(i~t~, ~f]),Sim(~, ~!] )}","{2xl 0 2x1~ = max 2+2'2+2'2+2j=0\"5","The head morpheme in a word is usually more relevant in determining a word's meaning, just as content words carry more meaning than function words.

One way to do so is via the classification of words in thesauri. More specifically, one can generalize from a connection (s, t) to a class-to-class mapping (X, Y) where X and Y are thesaurus classes containing s and t respectively. However, this simple intuition is complicated by the fact that a word might belong to more than one class, that is, if the classification is based on a thesaurus that allows for word-sense ambiguity. For a word in a particular context, if one considers classes that are not intended for the context, noise can be introduced.

The LLOCE class EaO03 and CILIN class Fc06 (to eat, chew, suck, and drink) are intended for this context. However, without that information, the following noisy rules might be introduced: (Cb024, Fc06), (De081, Fc06), (Li273, Fc06), (Nf/59, Fc06), along with the signal (EaO03, Fc06).

Nevertheless, connections (s, t) related to some ambiguous words s or t may cause noise to accumulate, leading to erroneous generalization. Therefore, one should try to throw away such noise. Moreover, any signal that gets thrown away by not considering (s, t) is often filled by a connection (s', t) where s' is a synonym of s. For instance, get is many ways ambiguous, as indicated in diversified ICTs in the LecDOCE examples in Table 6. However, each of these ICTs seems to form a connection with a less-ambiguous synonym of get such as receive, reach, and understand in LecDOCE examples. Table 6 provides further details.","As is typical in IR research, highly frequent and ambiguous words (known as stopwords in the IR literature) can be thrown out to reduce such noise.

Just as with the derivation of a bilingual lexicon from a corpus, acquisition of such mapping requires a statistical measure. The Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) is a similarity measure that gauges the ratio of the members in one collection being identical to those of another collection. Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou (1996) propose to link co-occurrence to the Dice coefficient in their study of bilingual collocations. They observe that, unlike statistical measures related to mutual information, the Dice coefficient is insensitive to sample size and, thus, more effective for acquiring bilingual collocations from a bilingual corpus. Our experimental results confirm their observation. Under a formulation linking translation to conceptual similarity, the Dice coefficient is a very useful estimator of the class-to-class mapping.","Therefore, in this work, we measure the likelihood of class-to-class translation mapping in terms of the ratio of member pairs that are connections observed in a bilingual corpus.

Occasionally, for extremely small or large classes, the coefficient does not accurately reflect how likely words in one class are to translate to words in another class. To remedy this problem, we explore the feasibility of weighting the member words. According to our result, weighting eradicates most instances of the problem caused by uneven classification. The weight assigned to each word should positively correlate to the frequency of the word so it reflects the expected ratio of word-translation pairs. Assuming that such weights can be obtained on the basis of each word's frequency in a bilingual corpus, weights can substitute for counts in equation (4) to arrive at the weighted version of the Dice coefficient shown below: ~ From(a, Y)+ y~To(X,b)","ClassSim(X, Y) = a~x bEY","IXI + IYI (5)","where IXI = the total weights of the words in X,","IYI = the total weights of the words in Y,","From (a,Y) = the weight of a, if (3y E Y)(a,y) E ALLCONN,","= 0, otherwise,","To(X,b) -- the weight of b, if (3x E X)(x,b) E ALLCONN,","= 0, otherwise,","ALLCONN = the source-translation pairs obtained for all sentences and","translations in the training corpus using Algorithm 1.","Algorithm 2 summarizes the ClassRule algorithm for acquiring class-based rules.

For simplicity, the unweighted value of ClassSim(CaO05, Ab01) is calculated. CaO05 and Ab01 contain 11 and 92 words, respectively. In ALLCONN, six words in CaO05, i.e. dame, female, girl, lady, Madam, and miss, translate into words listed under AbO1. In the other direction, seven words listed under Ab01, i.e. !~J~, !~, !~, ~-~, ~, tJ~, and 5~.h., are the translations from words listed under CaO05. Thus, the ClassSim value between CaO05 and Ab01 can be valued at (7 + 6)/(11 + 92) = 0.13. Figure 1 presents further details. 3.3 Class-based Word Alignment The proposed alignment algorithm ClassAlign is based on the following observations: First, dictionary translations can be used to produce high-precision connections. Thus, DictAlign should be employed to produce initial connections whose translations exhibit a high similarity to a DT. That is, a relatively high threshold, 0.7 should be used. Second, the class-based rules acquired through the ClassRule Algorithm should capture the diversity of translations to a large extent. According to the observations in Section 2, the rules should stipulate most of the connections left out in the DictAlign step. Nevertheless, conflicting connections do occasionally arise. Such conflicts can be resolved according to an additional consideration of distortion mentioned in Section I Estimating the Likelihood of a Connection Candidate. The above observations can be stated formally from the perspective of Brown et al.'s (1993) Model 2. As mentioned earlier, the model stipulates that a connection be given a probability value Pr(s, t), the product of lexical translation probability t(s I t) and distortion probability, d(i I j, 1, m). Also according to the model, we give each connection candidate a probabilistic value based on lexical and positional considerations: Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i,j) (6) We argue, however, that it is difficult to robustly estimate t(s, t) and d(i,j) for all the values of s, t, i, and j. Therefore, the two functions are defined and estimated by a limited number of cases, according to lexical, conceptual, and positional conditions. 327 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 For this purpose, we define conceptual similarity between s and t as follows:","ConceptSim(s, t) = max ClassSim(X, Y) (7) sE X, tE Y Lexical and conceptual conditions are set up based on DTSim and ConceptSim, while positional conditions are set up based on dislocation, a distortion measure relative to both left and right context. Estimation of LTP Based on Lexical and Conceptual Conditions. The LTP t(s, t) is defined by the following cases: Case 1. Case 2. Case 3. Case 4. Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical and conceptual similarit)5 i.e., ConceptSim (s, t) ~ hi and DTSim(s, t) > h2. Connection (s, t) exhibits high conceptual similarity, i.e., ConceptSim (s, t) _> hi and DTSim(s, t) < h2. Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical similarity, i.e., ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DTSim(s, t) _> h2. Otherwise, ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DTSim(s, t) < h2.","The connections satisfying each condition are given the same probability value determined by maximal likelihood estimation (MLE). For instance, if there are k true connections in a sample of n candidates (s, t) such that ConceptSim(s, t) > hi and DTSim(s, t) > h2, then all these candidates are given the same MLE value for LTP, i.e., t(s, t) = tl = k/n. Equation (8) sums up the above discussion:"]},{"title":"t(s,t) = {","paragraphs":["tl if ConceptSim (s, t) _> hi and DtSim(s, t) _> h2, t2 if ConceptSim (s, t) > hi and DtSim(s, t) < h2, t3 if ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DtSim(s, t) ~ h2, t4 if ConceptSim (s, t) < hi and DtSim(s, t) < h2."]},{"title":"(8)","paragraphs":["Estimation of Distortion Probability (DP). In a similar fashion, we formulate the distortion function by cases related to the monotonicity of translational position with respect to context. Such a formulation is inspired by Gale and Church's (1991b) treatment of distortion. In their study, the authors replace the distortion probability with a probability function defined by different values of slope, a measure of the position of t with respect to the left context of s. This measure is generally quite accurate, leading to a distribution function concentrating at slope 1. Nevertheless, room for improvement still exists, as can be illustrated using the concept of a binary inversion transduction tree (ITT) proposed by Wu (1995). The ITT is a shared parse tree depicting the structural difference between a sentence S and its translation T. Figure 2 presents the ITT of (E12, C12). The horizontal bar denotes that the noun phrase such a lazy mortal and the prepositional phrase as you are inverted when translated into Mandarin. The slope of the first word in such an inverted structure is typically quite large, making the distribution of the slope function slightly fiat. If multiword structural inversion occurs, as it frequently does, then the slope of the first word according to the right context is still very small.

To this end, we define dislocation, dis, for the connection (s, t) of the ith and jth words in S and T to denote I(J -j') - (i - i')[, where i' is the position of a word s' sharing the minimum syntactic structure with s, and s' translates into t', the j'th word in T. Short of syntactic analysis, dis(i,j) can be calculated with respect to a nearby connection in CONN, the initial connections established by DictAlign. Such treatment closely approximates the dislocation value. In light of this, dislocation can be defined as follows:","dis(i,j) = ( [j -j'[ if 3(j')(i,j') E CONN, min([dL[, [dR[) otherwise, (9) where i = the sequence number of s in S, j = the sequence number of t in T, 4 dL = (j--jL)--(i--iL), dR = (j--jR)--(i--iR),","(iL,jL) = argmax(i,,j,)ecoNN<i i',","(&,jR) = argmin(i,,j,)ecoNN>i /', CONN<i = {(k,l) [kth and Ith word in (S,T) form a connection in CONN, k < i}, 329 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2","::::i.~;z:: :::: .: :.:::I i:..::: 've never known such a [:::::1~:.:::, mb:h~! as ~i:i:,~you~ ::~::~::~:~ ........",":.i?:.lii.::: ::i:: 2 3 4 5 6 : :i:::::8::::i::~: ::i::i~:.O:.::!i:i 5 :ii:.i:~:~:::i!~:ili ~:. :~:i~::::~.:~]:~::.i?.i!","w:::! ::::::::::::::::::::::::: i",":::i.:: : :::::::: ::::: ii:.::::.::: ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ~ 0 1 2 3 4 3 ' ::i:~ i:~ :~ i~:~i:::: :::: i:~ i :~i, i: :!:: i z:~:::~! i:: i~::~!~::::ii, ~ :::: :::3!i:::;:::ii :ii~i::;2::i-:: 0 0 1 2 3 j z::::!:~::~:~:~:~i:! :!:i: 2 !i:ilili:]~::::~:!ii::i.i~i.!i::i.~.i~-i~8:.i~:i~:~.ii~: - :::.': • !::.. ~':\" .' : .. :x:.: :::::::::::::::::::::: ::.:. ::::::::::::::::::::::::","5, 4 3 2 ] 3 ~::::~ iii:: ii~: 2::: i:.i ::.~.::i ' :::::~ii:i:.::.ii::~ !~::~:i !!ii: :' ,",".",", .","::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 0 : : ::: :","::':'\"': ::: \": , ::::',::\"\" :: • ' : :\" ::::: i;\"[': :': :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: o :::: i::1:1::::: :::i;I0 i~: 8 7 6 5 4 ~::: 3::::i::: :::::::::::::::::::::: 0 l:~:.~::~)~:: $:~}i~:i:.i i!!.ii:~i:i~iiii~iO::ii.~;i~i~:ii~}:ii Figure 3 Dislocation values for the example-translation pair (E12, C12).

Experiments with"]},{"title":"ClassAlign","paragraphs":["To assess the proposed method's effectiveness, we have implemented the algorithms described in Section 3 and conducted a series of experiments. Tests are performed on the sentences found in the LecDOCE and a user's manual available in both languages to assess the method's robustness and generality. The similarities and differences between English and Mandarin texts are briefly reviewed, since our experiments involve the alignment of English-Mandarin parallel corpora. A general description of the materials used in the experiments follows. Finally, the success rates are quantitatively evaluated. 4.1 Contrastive Analysis of English and Mandarin Chinese Language typology is the study of similarities and differences between languages, formalized in terms of parameters such as word order and morphological structure. Li and Thompson (1981) examine Mandarin Chinese according to four typological parameters that reveal the basic structure of Mandarin Chinese as compared to those of other languages, English in particular. These four parameters are the morphological structure of words, the number of syllables per word, topic prominence, and word order. Li and Thompson's typological description of Mandarin is described below, from the perspective of the task of word alignment. 8 A small percentage of connections (7.8%) in our evaluation are incomplete ones and are considered to be correct. Melamed (1996) takes the same stance in his study of deriving a probabilistic lexicon. He observes that even incomplete entries are useful for many applications and there are ways of expanding incomplete morphemes or words in a connection, so that they become complete (Smadja 1992). 333 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 Table 14 The connection candidates (s, t) in (El0, C10) with higher Pr(s, t) values.

Second, a topic is the old information of which both the speaker and listener have some knowledge. Third, what distinguishes a topic from a subject is that the subject must always have a direct syntactic and semantic relation with the verb, but the topic does not need to. For instance, in the sentence (E13, C13), the first word ~ (daxiang, 'elephant') is the topic and the second word ~ (bizi, 'nose') is the subject; ~ 'elephant' is the focus of the discourse, but it is the subject ~ 'nose' that is very long; not ~ 'elephant'.","(E13) The elephant has a very long nose.","(C13) ~ ~:~ ql~ ~o","Daxiang bizi hen chang","Elephant nose very long","The topic prominence of Mandarin sentences represents alignment connections with a large distortion in position, leading to difficulty in estimating the likelihood of a connection according to translational position. Word Order. Greenberg (1963) stated that the world's languages fall into three word order groups according to the order of the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) in a simple transitive sentence. A language, in general, belongs to one of three basic word order types, SVO, SOV, and VSO. By this notion, English is an SVO language in which the verb typically follows the subject and precedes the object. For most languages, other aspects of word order, such as that of modifier and modified elements, correlate with the order of V and O. However, Mandarin is not an easy language to classify according to this typology for a number of reasons. First, the notion of subject is not well-defined. Second, unlike in English, word order in Mandarin is not determined solely on grammatical grounds but rather depends on semantics. For instance, whether an adverbial expression appears in pre- or postverbal position depends on subtle semantic differences. More specificall~ a time phrase in preverbal position tends to denote punctual time, while that in postverbal position signals durative time, as in: (E14) I have a meeting at three o'clock.","(C14) ~J~ -~ ~d~ ~]~o I three o'clock have-a-meeting (E15) I slept for three hours.","(C15) ~ T ---~ ~i~o I sleep ASPECT three o'clock","(C15') ~ ~ ~! t~ m To I three o'clock sleep ASPECT In contrast, both kinds of time phrase appear in postverbal position in English. As a result of facts such as these, many linguists contend that Mandarin is a language in transition from SVO to SOV. Further details can be found in Li and Thompson (1981). 335 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2","Similar to the situation created for topic prominent sentences, the SOV features of Mandarin represent a deviation from the SVO order of English. Such a deviation further worsens our ability to estimate the likelihood of a connection according to translational position. 4.2 The Experimental Setup The experimental results obtained from the proposed algorithm with respect to word alignment are presented in this section. Nearly 42,000 example sentences and their translations from the LecDOCE were used as training data, primarily to acquire rules and to determine MLE estimates for the cases of LTP and DP. The algorithm's performance was evaluated using the two sets of data. The closed test set consists of 200 examples and their Mandarin translations randomly selected from the LecDOCE. The English examples range from 8 to 23 words long; average example length is 11.5 words. There are, on average, 1.56 inversions per example-translation pair. The open test set consists of 200 sentences randomly drawn from the English and Chinese versions of the LightShip User's Guide. The English sentences in this test set range from 4 to 34 words long; average sentence length is 11.8 words. There are, on average, 1.60 inversions per sentence pair. Table 16 provides some examples from the LightShip User's Guides.","The two thesauri, LLOCE and CILIN, are used as the classification systems of source and target words. The LLOCE contains 23,769 entries and CILIN contains 63,754 entries. Both thesauri cover just over 90% of the words in the test sets. 4.3 Evaluation The first three experiments were designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the naive"]},{"title":"DictAlign","paragraphs":["algorithm based on a bilingual MRD.

Discussion This section thoroughly analyzes the alignment results from the experiments described in Section 4 and, in particular, the data relating to cases where the algorithms failed. Analytical results demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the methods and suggest possible improvements to the algorithms. 5.1 Compounding in Mandarin As stated earlier, the compounding effect in Mandarin frequently results in a change in the number of words between an English sentence and its Mandarin translation.

The morphological differences between English and Mandarin give rise to many language-specific function words. Such Mandarin function words are often quite ambiguous in part of speech as well as in word sense, leading to numerous alignment errors. For instance, ClassAlign connects the words for and of in (E20) erroneously to the morphemes T and ~ in (C20), respectively. Table 19 presents further details.

As mentioned in the previous section, collocation is one of the reasons why in-context translation usually deviates from the dictionary translation. However, unlike other deviations, bilingual collocation is not easily bounded within a couple of classes. For instance, the translation for take (Mb051, carrying, taking and bring) in the collocation take effect is usually ~ ('see') (Fc04, seeing and looking), as in example (E21, C21). However, there is insufficient evidence to support a class-to-class mapping from Mb051 to Fc04. In any case, deriving the MbO51-to-Fc04 mapping would be an overgeneralization. (E21) How soon does the medicine take effect? (C21) :~ 3K~_ ~ ? Paraphrased and Free Translations. For various reasons, such as language typology, style, and cultural differences, a translator does not always translate literally on a word-by-word basis. Adding and deleting words is commonplace, sometimes resulting in a paraphrased or free translation. Such translations obviously create problems for word alignment. For instance, in example (E24, C24), only one word, I, is translated literally, into ~. The main verb angle in example (E25) is given a paraphrased translation ~g~ ('to change the angle'). The noun phrase the people she is speaking to in (E25) is paraphrased as ~ 'audience.' A significant amount of free translation arises due to the use of four-morpheme Mandarin idioms for stylistic reasons. For instance, the clause as long as I breathe in (E22) translates into an idiom ~'al~.%Zde~ and the sentence 339 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 (E23) translates into ,,k,~).

Concluding Remarks In this paper, we have presented an algorithm capable of identifying words and their in-context translations in a bilingual corpus. The algorithm is effective for specific linguistic reasons. First, a significant majority of words have diversified translations that are not found in a bilingual dictionary or statistically-derived lexicon but that are largely bounded within the word classes in thesauri. Therefore, we contend that a more successful alignment can be achieved using a class-based approach. Our assumption seems to hold, for the experiments in this study demonstrate that the method provides broad-coverage alignment with almost no loss in precision.","In a broader sense, we have shown that thesauri and corpora can be used in combination to address the critical issues of generality and efficiency. The thesaurus provides classification that can be used to generalize the empirical knowledge gleaned 340 Sue J. Ker and Jason S. Chang Word Alignment from a corpus. The corpus provides training and testing materials, thereby allowing knowledge to be derived and evaluated objectively.","The algorithm's performance could definitely be improved by enhancing the various modules of the algorithms, e.g., morphological analyses, bilingual dictionar~ monolingual thesauri, and rule acquisition. Nevertheless, this work presents a functional core for processing bilingual corpora at lexical and conceptual levels.","While this paper has specifically addressed English-Chinese corpora, the linguistic issues motivating the algorithms seem to be quite general and are, to a large extent, language independent, which means that the algorithm presented here should be adaptable to other language pairs. The prospects for English-Japanese or Chinese-Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising.
