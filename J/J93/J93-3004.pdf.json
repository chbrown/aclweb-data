Introduction One of the main problems for applied natural language processing is gaps in the lexicon, including missing words and word senses, and inadequate descriptions of word use in context. Traditional lexicography has similar concerns. The availability of large, on-line text corpora provides a straightforward tool for enlarging the stock of words included in a lexicon. The identification of additional word senses and uses is more problematic, however.","Much recent lexicographic work employs concordances generated from text corpora for these purposes.

For example, Church and Hanks (1990) describe the use of the mutual information index for this purpose (cf. Calzolari and Bindi 1990). Church et al. (1991) further describe the use of t-scores to assess the extent of the differences between the collocational patterns of nearly synonymous words. These tools are important in that the strongest collocational associations often represent different word senses, and thus 'they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags' (Church and Hanks 1990, p. 28).","However, such tools do not directly characterize word senses or even provide any direct indication of the number of different senses that a word has. 1 Further, these * Dept. of English, Northern Arizona University, P.O.

Word types are clustered together to the extent that they are associated with the same word-mates. The geometric distance between a word-mate and its word type reflects the strength of the relevant association index, and word-mates are clustered together to the extent that they are associated with the same word types (see Bindi et al. 1991).","Factor analysis differs from MDS in that the input data are computed over the domain of individual texts, rather than over the domain of the entire corpus. Further, the application of factor analysis here is to identify basic word senses and uses associated with a single word rather than the relations among a set of semantically related words. This statistical technique identifies the groupings of collocations that tend to co-occur frequently in texts. If we assume that texts are topically coherent, it follows that groupings of collocations that co-occur frequently in texts will often reflect different underlying word senses.","This approach is illustrated here through analyses of two"]},{"title":"words--certain","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"right--in","paragraphs":["an 11.66 million-word subsample of the Longman/Lancaster corpus.

In the present analysis, this was done simply by computing the frequency of all collocational pairs over the entire corpus; collocations that occurred more than 30 times were considered to be important word associations and thus included in the subsequent analyses. 3 For"]},{"title":"certain,","paragraphs":["20 left collocates and 14 right collocates met this 2 Church et al. (1991, pp. 150-155) show how word association measures computed over the domain of discourse units (rather than bigrams or SVO triples) can be used to identify topical domains for information retrieval purposes. 3 There are more sophisticated approaches that could be used to identify the major collocational associations. First, mutual information indexes could be computed to identify strong word associations 532 Douglas Biber Co-occurrence Patterns criterion; for right, there were 24 left collocates and 53 right collocates meeting the criterion.","The next step was to count the frequency of each collocation pair in each text of the corpus. Only texts longer than 20,000 words were included at this stage, to insure adequate representation of the relevant co-occurring collocations. Two hundred forty-six texts from the subcorpus met this condition.","Factor analysis was then used to identify the groupings of collocational pairs that tended to co-occur in texts. Factor analysis builds upon pairwise correlations among the variables to identify a reduced set of underlying constructs, or 'factors'. 4 Each variable has some correlation, or 'loading,' with each factor, but only the larger loadings are important in interpreting the underlying constructs.","In the present case, the variables are the frequency counts for each collocational pair. The factors thus represent the collocational pairs that tend to co-occur frequently in texts. Given the following assumptions, it was hypothesized that the factor groupings of collocational pairs would represent different underlying word senses; the required assumptions are: 1) that each collocational pair tends to have a strong relation to a single word sense, and 2) that texts are topically coherent, and that words will therefore tend to be used in a single sense throughout the domain of a text. To the extent that these assumptions are accurate, collocational pairs should co-occur in texts as reflections of the same underlying word sense. The pilot analyses presented in the following section indicate that these assumptions do commonly hold in natural discourse. 3. Co-occurrence Patterns among Collocations for"]},{"title":"certain and right","paragraphs":["The factor analyses for the collocates of certain and right are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. 5 The tables present the factor loadings for each collocational pair on each factor. Loadings can range from 0.0 to plus or minus 1.0. A loading of 0.0 that are not necessarily frequent in their overall occurrence. In addition, word associations at a distance should be included. 4 See Biber (1988) for a fuller discussion of factor analysis and its application to the computational analysis of linguistic variation. There are three main corpus design considerations required by this use of factor analysis. First, the analysis requires long, connected texts, to provide ample opportunity for the (co-)occurrence of a range of collocational pairs; the analysis here excludes all texts shorter than 20,000 words. Shorter texts would often contain few tokens of a few collocational pairs and would thus not adequately represent the correlations among collocations. Composite texts are not acceptable because they violate the assumption of topical coherence. Second, the analysis requires a large number of texts. A general rule of thumb for factor analysis is that there should be five times as many texts as variables (Gorsuch 1983). Thus, there should be a minimum of 240 texts included for the final factor analysis of right, which is based on 48 collocational pairs. (The final factor analysis of certain is based on 25 collocational pairs and would thus require only 150 texts.) The sub-corpus used here, with 246 coherent texts longer than 20,000 words, meets these criteria. Finally, the corpus used for analysis must represent the full range of variability with respect to the collocational patterns. Corpora that are restricted topically or restricted to a few registers are not adequate for analyses of this type, because the reduced variability results in reduced correlations, which in turn result in a skewed and unreliable factorial structure (cf. Biber 1990). 5 I used a common factor analysis with a Promax rotation. Scree plots of the eigenvalues and consideration of the two-, three-, and four-factor solutions indicated that the three-factor solution was the most adequate for the analysis of certain, while the four-factor solution was the most adequate for the analysis of right. Variables that had communalities K .10 were dropped from the final analysis; 25 collocational pairs were included in the final analysis of certain, and 48 pairs in the analysis of right. In the analysis of certain, the first factor accounts for 21.4% of the shared variance, while the three factors together account for 39.4% of the shared variance. Factors 1 and 2 have a correlation of .30, while the other inter-factor correlations are negligible. In the analysis of right, the first factor accounts for 22.1% of the shared variance, while the four factors together account for 51.3% of the shared variance; the only appreciable inter-factor correlation is between Factors 2 and 3 (.43). 533 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 Table 1 Factorial structure of the collocates of certain.

Conclusion The two pilot analyses presented here indicate that this approach can be a useful tool for the semi-automatic identification of underlying word senses and uses. Further, both analyses produced unanticipated but systematic results, indicating that this approach can provide a useful complementary perspective to traditional lexicographic methods.","These analyses could be extended in several ways. First, statistics such as the mutual information index could be used to help identify the set of relevant collocations to be included in the factor analysis. Second, the corpus could be pre-processed by a 537 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 grammatical tagger, making the collocations sensitive to grammatical category. Finally, lexical associations at a distance should be included in the analysis. In this regard, the analyses here have been restricted: they consider only collocations of adjacent words, with no regard for grammatical category, and with the input data identified simply on the basis of absolute frequency. However, even with these restrictions, factor analysis appears to be a powerful tool for identifying underlying patterns among collocations, reflecting some of the major senses and uses of a word.","References","Biber, Douglas (1988).
