Introduction The growing availability of bilingual, machine-readable texts has stimulated interest in methods for extracting linguistically valuable information from such texts. For example, a number of recent papers deal with the problem of automatically obtaining pairs of aligned sentences from parallel corpora (Warwick and Russell 1990; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991b; Kay 1991). Brown et al. (1990) assert, and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) and Gale and Church (1991b) both show, that it is possible to obtain such aligned pairs of sentences without inspecting the words that the sentences contain. Brown, Lai, and Mercer base their algorithm on the number of words that the sentences contain, while Gale and Church base a similar algorithm on the number of characters that the sentences contain. The lesson to be learned from these two efforts is that simple, statistical methods can be surprisingly successful in achieving linguistically interesting goals. Here, we address a natural extension of that work: matching up the words within pairs of aligned sentences.","In recent papers, Brown et al. (1988, 1990) propose a statistical approach to machine translation from French to English. In the latter of these papers, they sketch an algorithm for estimating the probability that an English word will be translated into any particular French word and show that such probabilities, once estimated, can be used together with a statistical model of the translation process to align the words in an English sentence with the words in its French translation (see their Figure 3). * IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 (~) 1993 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Pairs of sentences with words aligned in this way offer a valuable resource for work in bilingual lexicography and machine translation.","Section 2 is a synopsis of our statistical approach to machine translation. Following this synopsis, we develop some terminology and notation for describing the word-by-word alignment of pairs of sentences. In Section 4 we describe our series of models of the translation process and give an informal discussion of the algorithms by which we estimate their parameters from data. We have written Section 4 with two aims in mind: first, to provide the interested reader with sufficient detail to reproduce our results, and second, to hold the mathematics at the level of college calculus. A few more difficult parts of the discussion have been postponed to the Appendix.","In Section 5, we present results obtained by estimating the parameters for these models from a large collection of aligned pairs of sentences from the Canadian Hansard data (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991). For a number of English words, we show translation probabilities that give convincing evidence of the power of statistical methods to extract linguistically interesting correlations from large corpora. We also show automatically derived word-by-word alignments for several sentences.","In Section 6, we discuss some shortcomings of our models and propose modifica-tions to address some of them. In the final section, we discuss the significance of our work and the possibility of extending it to other pairs of languages.","Finally, we include two appendices: one to summarize notation and one to collect the formulae for the various models that we describe and to fill an occasional gap in our development. 2. Statistical Translation In 1949, Warren Weaver suggested applying the statistical and cryptanalytic techniques then emerging from the nascent field of communication theory to the problem of using computers to translate text from one natural language to another (published in Weaver 1955). Efforts in this direction were soon abandoned for various philosophical and theoretical reasons, but at a time when the most advanced computers were of a piece with today's digital watch, any such approach was surely doomed to computational starvation. Today, the fruitful application of statistical methods to the study of machine translation is within the computational grasp of anyone with a well-equipped workstation.","A string of English words, e, can be translated into a string of French words in many different ways. Often, knowing the broader context in which e occurs may serve to winnow the field of acceptable French translations, but even so, many acceptable translations will remain; the choice among them is largely a matter of taste. In statistical translation, we take the view that every French string, f, is a possible translation of e. We assign to every pair of strings (e~ f) a number Pr(fle ), which we interpret as the probability that a translator, when presented with e, will produce f as his translation. We further take the view that when a native speaker of French produces a string of French words, he has actually conceived of a string of English words, which he translated mentally. Given a French string f, the job of our translation system is to find the string e that the native speaker had in mind when he produced f. We minimize our chance of error by choosing that English string 6 for which Pr(elf ) is greatest.","Using Bayes' theorem, we can write","Pr(elf ) = Pr(e) Pr(fle ) Pr(f) (1) Since the denominator here is independent of e, finding ~ is the same as finding e 264 Peter F. Brown et al. The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation so as to make the product Pr(e)Pr(fle ) as large as possible. We arrive, then, at the Fundamental Equation of Machine Translation:","= argmax Pr(e) Pr(fle ). (2) e As a representation of the process by which a human being translates a passage from French to English, this equation is fanciful at best. One can hardly imagine someone rifling mentally through the list of all English passages computing the product of the a priori probability of the passage, Pr(e), and the conditional probability of the French passage given the English passage, Pr(fle ). Instead, there is an overwhelming intuitive appeal to the idea that a translator proceeds by first understanding the French, and then expressing in English the meaning that he has thus grasped. Many people have been guided by this intuitive picture when building machine translation systems.","From a purely formal point of view, on the other hand, Equation (2) is completely adequate. The conditional distribution Pr(f[e) is just an enormous table that associates a real number between zero and one with every possible pairing of a French passage and an English passage. With the proper choice for this distribution, translations of arbitrarily high quality can be achieved. Of course, to construct Pr(f[e) by examining individual pairs of French and English passages one by one is out of the question. Even if we restrict our attention to passages no longer than a typical novel, there are just too many such pairs. But this is only a problem in practice, not in principle. The essential question for statistical translation, then, is not a philosophical one, but an empirical one: Can one construct approximations to the distributions Pr(e) and Pr(f[e) that are good enough to achieve an acceptable quality of translation?","Equation (2) summarizes the three computational challenges presented by the practice of statistical translation: estimating the language model probability, Pr(e); estimating the translation model probability, Pr(fle); and devising an effective and efficient suboptimal search for the English string that maximizes their product. We call these the language modeling problem, the translation modeling problem, and the search problem.","The language modeling problem for machine translation is essentially the same as that for speech recognition and has been dealt with elsewhere in that context (see, for example, the recent paper by Maltese and Mancini [1992] and references therein). We hope to deal with the search problem in a later paper. In this paper, we focus on the translation modeling problem. Before we turn to this problem, however, we should address an issue that may be a concern to some readers: Why do we estimate Pr(e) and Pr(fle ) rather than estimate Pr(elf ) directly? We are really interested in this latter probability. Wouldn't we reduce our problems from three to two by this direct approach? If we can estimate Pr(fle ) adequately, why can't we just turn the whole process around to estimate Pr(eif)?","To understand this, imagine that we divide French and English strings into those that are well-formed and those that are ill-formed. This is not a precise notion. We have in mind that strings like II va ?z la biblioth~que, or I live in a house, or even Colorless green ideas sleep furiously are well-formed, but that strings like ~ lava I1 biblioth~que or a I in live house are not. When we translate a French string into English, we can think of ourselves as springing from a well-formed French string into the sea of well-formed English strings with the hope of landing on a good one. It is important, therefore, that our model for Pr(elf ) concentrate its probability as much as possible on well-formed English strings. But it is not important that our model for Pr(f[e) concentrate its probability on well-formed French strings. If we were to reduce the probability of all well-formed French strings by the same factor, spreading the probability thus 265 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 liberated over ill-formed French strings, there would be no effect on our translations: the argument that maximizes some function f(x) also maximizes cf(x) for any positive constant c. As we shall see below, our translation models are prodigal, spraying probability all over the place, most of it on ill-formed French strings. In fact, as we discuss in Section 4.5, two of our models waste much of their probability on things that are not strings at all, having, for example, several different second words but no first word. If we were to turn one of these models around to model Pr(elf ) directly, the result would be a model with so little probability concentrated on well-formed English strings as to confound any scheme to discover one.","The two factors in Equation (2) cooperate. The translation model probability is large for English strings, whether well- or ill-formed, that have the necessary words in them in roughly the right places to explain the French. The language model probability is large for well-formed English strings regardless of their connection to the French. Together, they produce a large probability for well-formed English strings that account well for the French. We cannot achieve this simply by reversing our translation models."]},{"title":"3. Alignments","paragraphs":["We say that a pair of strings that are translations of one another form a translation, and we show this by enclosing the strings in parentheses and separating them by a vertical bar. Thus, we write the translation (Qu'aurions-nous pu faire? I What could we have done?) to show that What could we have done? is a translation of Qu'aurions-nous pu faire? When the strings end in sentences, we usually omit the final stop unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.","Brown et al. (1990) introduce the idea of an alignment between a pair of strings as an object indicating for each word in the French string that word in the English string from which it arose. Alignments are shown graphically, as in Figure 1, by drawing lines, which we call connections, from some of the English words to some of the French words. The alignment in Figure I has seven connections: (the, Le), (program, programme), and so on. Following the notation of Brown et al., we write this alignment as (Le programme a ~t~ mis en application I And the(l) program(2) has(3) been(4) implemented(5,6,7)). The list of numbers following an English word shows the positions in the French string of the words to which it is connected. Because And is not connected to any French words here, there is no list of numbers after it. We consider every alignment to be correct with some probability, and so we find (Le programme a ~t~ mis en application I And(I,2,3,4,5,6,7) the program has been implemented) perfectly acceptable. Of course, we expect it to be much less probable than the alignment shown in Figure 1.","In Figure 1 each French word is connected to exactly one English word, but more general alignments are possible and may be appropriate for some translations. For example, we may have a French word connected to several English words as in Figure 2, which we write as (Le reste appartenait aux autochtones I The(l) balance(2) was(3) the(3) territory(3) of(4) the(4) aboriginal(5) people(5)). More generally still, we may have several French words connected to several English words as in Figure 3, which we write as (Les pauvres sont d~munis I The(l) poor(2) don't(3,4) have(3,4) any(3,4) money(3,4)). Here, the four English words don't have any money work together to generate the two French words sont d~munis.","In a figurative sense, an English passage is a web of concepts woven together according to the rules of English grammar. When we look at a passage, we cannot see the concepts directly but only the words that they leave behind. To show that these words are related to a concept but are not quite the whole story, we say that they form a cept. Some of the words in a passage may participate in more than one cept, while 266 Peter F. Brown et al.

When a passage is translated into French, each of its cepts contributes some French words to the translation. We formalize this use of the term cept and relate it to the idea of an alignment as follows.","We call the set of English words connected to a French word in a particular alignment the cept that generates the French word.

Translation Models In this section, we develop a series of five translation models together with the algorithms necessary to estimate their parameters. Each model gives a prescription for computing the conditional probability Pr(f[e), which we call the likelihood of the translation (f, e). This likelihood is a function of a large number of free parameters that we must estimate in a process that we call"]},{"title":"training. The","paragraphs":["likelihood of a set of translations is the product of the likelihoods of its members.

Then, for each position in the French string, we decide how to connect it to the English string and what French word to place there. In Model 1 we assume all connections for each French position to be equally likely. Therefore, the order of the words in e and f does not affect Pr(f]e). In Model 2 we make the more realistic assumption that the probability of a connection depends on the positions it connects and on the lengths of the two strings. Therefore, for Model 2, Pr(f[e) does depend on the order of the words in e and f. Although it is possible to obtain interesting correlations between some pairs of frequent words in the two languages using Models 1 and 2, as we will see later (in Figure 5), these models often lead to unsatisfactory alignments.","In Models 3, 4, and 5, we develop the French string by choosing, for each word in the English string, first the number of words in the French string that will be connected 268 Peter E Brown et al. The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation to it, then the identity of these French words, and finally the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy. It is this last step that determines the connections between the English string and the French string and it is here that these three models differ. In Model 3, as in Model 2, the probability of a connection depends on the positions that it connects and on the lengths of the English and French strings. In Model 4 the probability of a connection depends in addition on the identities of the French and English words connected and on the positions of any other French words that are connected to the same English word. Models 3 and 4 are deficient, a technical concept defined and discussed in Section 4.5. Briefly, this means that they waste some of their probability on objects that are not French strings at all. Model 5 is very much like Model 4, except that it is not deficient.","Models 1-4 serve as stepping stones to the training of Model 5. Models 1 and 2 have an especially simple mathematical form so that iterations of the EM algorithm can be computed exactly. That is, we can explicitly perform sums over all possible alignments for these two models. In addition, Model 1 has a unique local maximum so that parameters derived for it in a series of EM iterations do not depend on the starting point for the iterations. As explained below, we use Model 1 to provide initial estimates for the parameters of Model 2. In Model 2 and subsequent models, the likelihood function does not have a unique local maximum, but by initializing each model from the parameters of the model before it, we arrive at estimates of the parameters of the final model that do not depend on our initial estimates of the parameters for Model 1.","In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models. But, while approaching more closely the complexity of Model 5, they retain enough simplicity to allow an efficient investigation of the neighborhood of probable alignments and therefore allow us to include what we hope are all of the important alignments in each EM iteration.","In the remainder of this section, we give an informal but reasonably precise description of each of the five models and an intuitive account of the EM algorithm as applied to them. We assume the reader to be comfortable with Lagrange multipliers, partial differentiation, and constrained optimization as they are presented in a typical college calculus text, and to have a nodding acquaintance with random variables. On the first time through, the reader may wish to jump from here directly to Section 5, returning to this Section when and if he should desire to understand more deeply how the results reported later are achieved.","The basic mathematical object with which we deal here is the joint probability distribution Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), where the random variables F and E are a French string and an English string making up a translation, and the random variable A is an alignment between them. We also consider various marginal and conditional probability distributions that can be constructed from Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), especially the distribution Pr(F = fie = e). We generally follow the common convention of using uppercase letters to denote random variables and the corresponding lowercase letters to denote specific values that the random variables may take. We have already used I and m to represent the lengths of the strings e and L and so we use L and M to denote the corresponding random variables. When there is no possibility for confusion, or, more properly, when the probability of confusion is not thereby materially increased, we write Pr(f, a, e) for Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), and use similar shorthands throughout.","We can write the likelihood of (fie) in terms of the conditional probability Pr(f, ale ) as","Pr(fle) = Z Pr(f, ale ). (3) a 269 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 The sum here, like all subsequent sums over a, is over the elements of M(e, f). We restrict ourselves in this section to alignments like the one shown in Figure I where each French word has exactly one connection. In this kind of alignment, each cept is either a single English word or it is empty. Therefore, we can assign cepts to positions in the English string, reserving position zero .for the empty cept. If the English string, e = e~ - el e2... el, has 1 words, and the French string, f = f~ =_ flf2.., fro, has m words, then the alignment, a, can be represented by a series, a~ = ala2...am, of m values, each between 0 and I such that if the word in position j of the French string is connected to the word in position i of the English string, then aj = i, and if it is not connected to any English word, then aj = O.","Without loss of generality, we can write m","Pr(f,a[e) = Pr(m[e)HPr(ajla~-l,fJ-l,m,e)Pr(fj[4,f~-l,m,e). j=l (4) This is only one of many ways in which Pr(f, ale) can be written as the product of a series of conditional probabilities. It is important to realize that Equation (4) is not an approximation. Regardless of the form of Pr(f, ale ), it can always be analyzed into a product of terms in this way. We are simply asserting in this equation that when we generate a French string together with an alignment from an English string, we can first choose the length of the French string given our knowledge of the English string. Then we can choose where to connect the first position in the French string given our knowledge of the English string and the length of the French string. Then we can choose the identity of the first word in the French string given our knowledge of the English string, the length of the French string, and the position in the English string to which the first position in the French string is connected, and so on. As we step through the French string, at each point we make our next choice given our complete knowledge of the English string and of all our previous choices as to the details of the French string and its alignment. 4.1 Model 1 The conditional probabilities on the right-hand side of Equation (4) cannot all be taken as independent parameters because there are too many of them. In Model 1, we assume that Pr(mle ) is independent of e and m; that Pr(ajlalJ-l,J -1, m, e), depends only on 1, the length of the English string, and therefore must be (l + 1)-1; and that Pr(fj[alJ,fl j-l, m~ e) depends only on j~ and %. The parameters, then, are ~ -_ Pr(mle ), and t(~]%) -- Pr(djlalJ,AJ-1, m, e), which we call the translation probability of ~ given eaj. We think of ~ as some small, fixed number. The distribution of M, the length of the French string, is unnormalized but this is a minor technical issue of no significance to our computations. If we wish, we can think of M as having some finite range. As long as this range encompasses everything that actually occurs in training data, no problems arise.","We turn now to the problem of estimating the translation probabilities for Model 1.

Each such product corresponds in a natural way to a generative process for developing f and a from e. In the process corresponding to Equation (4), we first choose a length for f. Next, we decide which position in e is connected to fl and what the identity of fl is. Then, we decide which position in e is connected to f2, and so on.

Because the distortion probabilities for assigning positions to later words do not depend on the positions assigned to earlier words, Model 3 wastes some of its probability on what we might call generalized strings, i.e., strings that have some positions with several words and others with none. When a model has this property of not concentrating all of its probability on events of interest, we say that it is deficient. Deficiency is the price that we pay for the simplicity that allows us to write Equation (43).","Deficiency poses no serious problem here. Although Models 1 and 2 are not technically deficient, they are surely spiritually deficient. Each assigns the same probability to the alignments (Je n'ai pas de stylo I I(1) do not(2,4) have(3) a(5) pen(6)) and (Je pas ai ne de stylo I I(1) do not(2,4) have(3) a(5) pen(6)), and, therefore, essentially the same probability to the translations (Je n\" ai pas de stylo I I do not have a pen) and (Je pas ai ne de stylo [ I do not have a pen). In each case, not produces two words, ne and pas, and in each case, 279 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 one of these words ends up in the second position of the French string and the other in the fourth position. The first translation should be much more probable than the second, but this defect is of little concern because while we might have to translate the first string someday, we will never have to translate the second. We do not use our translation models to predict French given English but rather as a component of a system designed to predict English given French. They need only be accurate to within a constant factor over well-formed strings of French words. 4.6 Model 4 Often the words in an English string constitute phrases that are translated as units into French. Sometimes, a translated phrase may appear at a spot in the French string different from that at which the corresponding English phrase appears in the English string. The distortion probabilities of Model 3 do not account well for this tendency of phrases to move around as units. Movement of a long phrase will be much less likely than movement of a short phrase because each word must be moved independently.

Each of these cepts then accounts for one or more French words. In Model 3 the ceptual scheme for an alignment is determined by the fertilities of the words: a word is a cept if its fertility is greater than zero. The empty cept is a part of the ceptual scheme if ¢0 is greater than zero. As before we exclude multi-word cepts.

As described above, the simple form that we assume for the distortion probabilities in Model 3 makes it possible for us to find b °o (a) rapidly for any a.

Let the neighbors of a be ranked so that the first is the neighbor for which Pr(a[e, f; 3) is greatest, the second the one for which Pr(a[e, f; 3) is next greatest, and so on. We define b(a) to be the highest-ranking neighbor of a for which Pr(b(a)[e, f; 4) is at least as large as Pr(aIe, f; 4). We define bi,._j(a) analogously. Here, Pr(a[e, f;3) means Pr(a[e, f) as computed with Model 3, and Pr(ale, f;4) means Pr(a[e, f) as computed with Model 4. We define S for Model 4 by S = A/'(boo (V(f[e; 2))) ~.J"]},{"title":"Uij.M(b~j(Vi,_j(f[e;","paragraphs":["2))). (47) This equation is identical to Equation (47) except that b has been replaced by/~. 4.7 Model 5 Models 3 and 4 are both deficient. In Model 4, not only can several words lie on top of one another, but words can be placed before the first position or beyond the last position in the French string.

If ~b[i] = 1, then 7.[i11 may be placed in any of these vacancies; if ~b[i] = 2, 7-[i]1 may be placed in any but the last of these vacancies; in general, 7-[,11 may be placed in any but the rightmost ~b[,] - 1 of the remaining vacancies.

No incremental evaluation of the likelihood of neighbors is possible with Model 5 because a move or swap may require wholesale recomputation of the likelihood of an alignment. Therefore, when we evaluate expectations for Model 5, we include only the alignments in S as defined in Equation (47). We further trim these alignments by removing any alignment a, for which Pr(ale, f;4) is too much smaller than Pr(b°°(V(fle; 2)le, f; 4).","Model 5 is a powerful but unwieldy ally in the battle to align translations. It must be led to the battlefield by its weaker but more agile brethren Models 2, 3, and 4. In fact, this is the raison d'etre of these models. To keep them aware of the lay of the land, we adjust their parameters as we carry out iterations of the EM algorithm for Model 5. That is, we collect counts for Models 2, 3, and 4 by summing over alignments as determined by the abbreviated S described above, using Model 5 to compute Pr(ale, f). Although this appears to increase the storage necessary for maintaining counts as we proceed through the training data, the extra burden is small because the overwhelming majority of the storage is devoted to counts for t(fle ), and these are the same for Models 2, 3, 4, and 5. 5. Results We have used a large collection of training data to estimate the parameters of the models described above. Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) have described an algorithm with which one can reliably extract French and English sentences that are translations of one another from parallel corpora. They used the algorithm to extract a large number of translations from several years of the proceedings of the Canadian parliament. From these translations, we have chosen as our training data those for which both the English sentence and the French sentence are 30 or fewer words in length. This is a collection 282 Peter F. Brown et al. The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation Table 1 A summary of the training iterations.

In an effort to eliminate some of the typographical errors that abound in the text, we have chosen as our English vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in English sentences in our data, and as our French vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in French sentences in our data. All other words we replace with a special unknown English word or unknown French word accordingly as they appear in an English sentence or a French sentence. We arrive in this way at an English vocabulary of 42,005 words and a French vocabulary of 58,016 words. Some typographical errors are quite frequent, for example, momento for memento, and so our vocabularies are not completely free of them. At the same time, some words are truly rare, and so we have, in some cases, snubbed legitimate words. Adding e0 to the English vocabulary brings it to 42,006 words.","We have carried out 12 iterations of the EM algorithm for this data. We initialized the process by setting each of the 2,437, 020,096 translation probabilities, t(fle), to 1/58,016. That is, we assume each of the 58,016 words in the French vocabulary to be equally likely as a translation for each of the 42,006 words in the English vocabulary. For t(f[e) to be greater than zero at the maximum likelihood solution for one of our models, f and e must occur together in at least one of the translations in our training data. This is the case for only 25,427, 016 pairs, or about one percent of all translation probabilities. On the average, then, each English word appears with about 605 French words.","Table 1 summarizes our training computation. At each iteration, we compute the probabilities of the various alignments of each translation using one model, and collect counts using a second (possibly different) model. These are referred to in the table as the In model and the Out model, respectively. After each iteration, we retain individual values only for those translation probabilities that surpass a threshold; the remainder we set to a small value (10-12). This value is so small that it does not affect the normalization conditions, but is large enough that translation probabilities can be resurrected during later iterations. We see in columns 4 and 5 that even though we lower the threshold as iterations progress, fewer and fewer probabilities survive. By the final iteration, only 1,658,364 probabilities survive, an average of about 39 French words for each English word.","Although the entire t array has 2,437, 020,096 entries, and we need to store it twice, once as probabilities and once as counts, it is clear from the preceeding remarks that we need never deal with more than about 25 million counts or about 12 million probabilities. We store these two arrays using standard sparse matrix techniques. We 283 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 keep counts as pairs of bytes, but allow for overflow into 4 bytes if necessary. In this way, it is possible to run the training program in less than 100 megabytes of memory. While this number would have seemed extravagant a few years ago, today it is available at modest cost in a personal workstation.","As we have described, when the In model is neither Model 1 nor Model 2, we evaluate the count sums over only some of the possible alignments. Many of these alignments have a probability much smaller than that of the Viterbi alignment. The column headed"]},{"title":"Alignments in","paragraphs":["Table 1 shows the average number of alignments for which the probability is within a factor of 25 of the probability of the Viterbi alignment in each iteration. As this number drops, the model concentrates more and more probability onto fewer and fewer alignments so that the Viterbi alignment becomes ever more dominant.","The last column in the table shows the perplexity of the French text given the English text for the In model of the iteration. We expect the likelihood of the training data to increase with each iteration. We can think of this likelihood as arising from a product of factors, one for each French word in the training data. We have 28,850,104 French words in our training data, so the 28,850,104 th root of the likelihood is the average factor by which the likelihood is reduced for each additional French word. The reciprocal of this root is the perplexity shown in the table. As the likelihood increases, the perplexity decreases. We see a steady decrease in perplexity as the iterations progress except when we switch from Model 2 as the In model to Model 3. This sudden jump is not because Model 3 is a poorer model than Model 2, but because Model 3 is deficient: the great majority of its probability is squandered on objects that are not strings of French words. As we have argued, deficiency is not a problem. In our description of Model 1, we left Pr(mle ) unspecified. In quoting perplexities for Models 1 and 2, we have assumed that the length of the French string is Poisson with a mean that is a linear function of the length of the English string.

The second word, Speaker, is connected to the sequence l'Orateur. Like farmers above, it has trained to produce both the word that we naturally think of as its translation and the associated article. In our data, Speaker always has fertility 2 and produces equally often l'Orateur and le president. Later in the sentence, starred is connected to the phrase marquees de un astdrisque. From an initial situation in which each French word is equally probable as a translation of starred, we have arrived, through training, at a situation where it is possible to connect starred to just the right string of four words. Near the end of the sentence, give is connected to donnerai, the first person singular future of donner, which means to give. We should be more comfortable if both will and give were connected to donnerai, but by limiting cepts to no more than one word, we have precluded this possibility. Finally, the last 12 words of the English sentence, I now have the answer and will give it to the House, clearly correspond to the last 7 words of the French sentence, je donnerai la rdponse ?l la Chambre, but, literally, the French is I will give the answer to the House.

If, however, we are given f and asked to discover 4, then we will find that the product Pr(e) Pr(fle ) is too small for long English strings as compared with short ones. As a result, we will improperly favor short English strings. We can counteract this tendency in part by replacing Pr(fJe) with c I Pr(f]e) for some empirically chosen constant c. This is treatment of the symptom rather than treatment of the disease itself, but it offers some temporary relief. The cure lies in better modeling. 6.2 Viterbi Training As we progress from Model 1 to Model 5, evaluating the expectations that give us counts becomes increasingly difficult. For Models 1 and 2, we are able to include the contribution of each of the (1 + 1) m possible alignments exactly. For later models, we include the contributions of fewer and fewer alignments. Because most of the probability for each translation is concentrated by these models on a small number of alignments, this suboptimal procedure, mandated by the complexity of the models, yields acceptable results.","In the limit, we can contemplate evaluating the expectations using only a single, probable alignment for each translation. When that alignment is the Viterbi alignment, we call this"]},{"title":"Viterbi training.","paragraphs":["It is easy to see that Viterbi training converges: at each step, we reestimate parameters so as to make the current set of Viterbi alignments as probable as possible; when we use these parameters to compute a new set of Viterbi alignments, we find either the old set or a set that is yet more probable. Since the probability can never be greater than one, this process must converge. In fact, unlike the EM algorithm in general, it must converge in a finite, though impractically large, number of steps because each translation has only a finite number of alignments.","In practice, we are never sure that we have found the Viterbi alignment. If we reinterpret the Viterbi alignment to mean the most probable alignment that we can find rather than the most probable alignment that exists, then a similarly reinterpreted Viterbi training algorithm still converges. We have already used this algorithm successfully as a part of a system to assign senses to English and French words on the basis of the context in which they appear (Brown et al. 1991a, 1991b). We expect to use it in models that we develop beyond Model 5. 293 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2"]},{"title":"6.3 Multi-Word Cepts","paragraphs":["In Models 1-5, we restrict our attention to alignments with cepts containing no more than one word each. Except in Models 4 and 5, cepts play little r61e in our development. Even in these models, cepts are determined implicitly by the fertilities of the words in the alignment: words for which the fertility is greater than zero make up one-word cepts; those for which it is zero do not. We can easily extend the generative process upon which Models 3, 4, and 5 are based to encompass multi-word cepts. We need only include a step for selecting the ceptual scheme and ascribe fertilities to cepts rather than to words, requiring that the fertility of each cept be greater than zero. Then, in Equation (29), we can replace the products over words in an English string with products over cepts in the ceptual scheme.","When we venture beyond one-word cepts, however, we must tread lightly. An English string can contain any of 42,005 one-word cepts, but there are more than 1.7 billion possible two-word cepts, more than 74 trillion three-word cepts, and so on. Clearly, one must be discriminating in choosing potential multi-word cepts. The caution that we have displayed thus far in limiting ourselves to cepts with fewer than two words was motivated primarily by our respect for the featureless desert that multi-word cepts offer a priori. The Viterbi alignments that we have computed with Model 5 give us a frame of reference from which to expand our horizons to multi-word cepts. By inspecting them, we can find translations for a given multi-word sequence. We need only promote a multi-word sequence to cepthood when these translations differ substantially from what we might expect on the basis of the individual words that it contains. In English, either a boat or a person can be left high and dry, but in French, un bateau is not left haut et sec, nor une personne haute et s~che. Rather, a boat is left ~chou~ and a person en plan. High and dry, therefore, is a promising three-word cept because its translation is not compositional."]},{"title":"6.4 Morphology","paragraphs":["We treat each distinct sequence of letters as a distinct word. In English, for example, we recognize no kinship among the several forms of the verb to eat (eat, ate, eaten, eats, and eating). In French, irregular verbs have many forms. In Figure 7, we have already seen 7 forms of devoir. Altogether, it has 41 different forms. And there would be 42 if the French did not inexplicably drop the circumflex from the masculine plural past participle (dus), thereby causing it to collide with the first and second person singular in the pass~ simple, no doubt a source of endless confusion for the beleaguered francophone.","The French make do with fewer forms for the multitude of regular verbs that are the staple diet of everyday speech. Thus, manger (to eat), has only 39 forms (manger, mange, manges ..... mangeassent). Models 1-5 must learn to connect the 5 forms of to eat to the 39 forms of manger. In the 28~ 850~ 104 French words that make up our training data, only 13 of the 39 forms of manger actually appear. Of course, it is only natural that in the proceedings of a parliament, forms of manger are less numerous than forms of parler (to speak), but even for parler, only 28 of the 39 forms occur in our data. If we were to encounter a rare form of one of these words, say, parlassions or mangeassent, we would have no inkling of its relationship to speak or eat. A similar predicament besets nouns and adjectives as well. For example, composition is the among the most common words in our English vocabulary, but compositions is among the least common words.","We plan to ameliorate these problems with a simple inflectional analysis of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, so that the relatedness of the several forms of the same word is manifest in our representation of the data. For example, we wish to make evident the common pedigree of the different conjugations of a verb in French and 294 Peter E Brown et al. The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation in English; of the singular and plural, and singular possessive and plural possessive forms of a noun in English; of the singular, plural, masculine, and feminine forms of a noun or adjective in French; and of the positive, comparative, and superlative forms of an adjective or adverb in English.","Thus, our intention is to transform (/'e"]},{"title":"mange la p~che I I eat the peach)","paragraphs":["into, e.g., (je"]},{"title":"manger, 13spres la p~che I I eat,x3spres the peach).","paragraphs":["Here,"]},{"title":"eat","paragraphs":["is analyzed into a root,"]},{"title":"eat,","paragraphs":["and an ending,"]},{"title":"x3spres,","paragraphs":["that indicates the present tense form used except in the third person singular.

We hope that this will significantly improve the statistics in our models. 7. Discussion That interesting bilingual lexical correlations can be extracted automatically from a large bilingual corpus was pointed out by Brown et al. (1988). The algorithm that they describe is, roughly speaking, equivalent to carrying out the first iteration of the EM algorithm for our Model 1 starting from an initial guess in which each French word is equally probable as a translation for each English word. They were unaware of a connection to the EM algorithm, but they did realize that their method is not entirely satisfactory. For example, once it is clearly established that in"]},{"title":"(La porte est rouge I The door is red),","paragraphs":["it is"]},{"title":"red","paragraphs":["that produces"]},{"title":"rouge,","paragraphs":["one is uncomfortable using this sentence as support for"]},{"title":"red","paragraphs":["producing"]},{"title":"porte","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"door","paragraphs":["producing"]},{"title":"rouge.","paragraphs":["They suggest removing words once a correlation between them has been clearly established and then reprocessing the resulting impoverished translations hoping to recover less obvious correlations now revealed by the departure of their more prominent relatives.

(1990) describe a model that is essentially the same as our Model 3. They sketch the EM algorithm and show that, once trained, their model can be used to extract word-by-word alignments for pairs of sentences. They did not realize that the logarithm of the likelihood for Model 1 is concave and, hence, has a unique local maximum. They were also unaware of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when evaluating the counts for Models 1 and 2, and of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when transferring parameters from Model 2 to Model 3. As a result, they were unable to handle large vocabularies and so restricted themselves to vocabularies of only 9,000 words. Nonetheless, they were able to align phrases in French with the English words that produce them as illustrated in their Figure 3.","More recently, Gale and Church (1991a) describe an algorithm similar to the one described in Brown et al. (1988). Like Brown et al., they consider only the simultaneous appearance of words in pairs of sentences that are translations of one another. Although algorithms like these are extremely simple, many of the correlations between English and French words are so pronounced as to fall prey to almost any effort to expose them. Thus, the correlation of pairs like"]},{"title":"(eau I water), (lait ] milk), (pourquoi I why), (chambre I house),","paragraphs":["and many others, simply cannot be missed. They shout from the data, and any method that is not stone deaf will hear them.

In some cases, there may be several or even several tens of translations depending on the context in which the word appears, but we should be quite surprised to find a word with hundreds of mutually exclusive translations. Although we use these models as part of an automatic system for translating French into English, they provide, as a byproduct, very satisfying accounts of the word-by-word alignment of pairs of French and English strings.","Our work has been confined to French and English, but we believe that this is purely adventitious: had the early Canadian trappers been Manchurians later to be outnumbered by swarms of"]},{"title":"conquistadores,","paragraphs":["and had the two cultures clung stubbornly each to its native tongue, we should now be aligning Spanish and Chinese. We conjecture that local alignment of the component parts of any corpus of parallel texts is inherent in the corpus itself, provided only that it be large enough. Between any pair of languages where mutual translation is important enough that the rate of accumulation of translated examples sufficiently exceeds the rate of mutation of the languages involved, there must eventually arise such a corpus.","The linguistic content of our program thus far is scant indeed. It is limited to one set of rules for analyzing a string of characters into a string of words, and another set of rules for analyzing a string of words into a string of sentences. Doubtless even these can be recast in terms of some information theoretic objective function. But it is not our intention to ignore linguistics, neither to replace it. Rather, we hope to enfold it in the embrace of a secure probabilistic framework so that the two together may draw strength from one another and guide us to better natural language processing systems in general and to better machine translation systems in particular.

B.2 Iterative Improvement We cannot create a good model or find good parameter values at a stroke. Rather we employ a process of iterative improvement. For a given model we use current parameter values to find better ones, and in this way, from initial values we find locally optimal ones. Then, given good parameter values for one model, we use them to find initial parameter values for another model. By alternating between these two steps we proceed through a sequence of gradually more sophisticated models. Improving Parameter Values. From Jensen's inequality (55), we see that ~b(Po) is greater than ~b(P0) if R(P0, Po) is positive.

Note that for any ~, R(P6, Pe) is non-negative at its maximum in 8, since it is zero for 8 = ~. Thus ~b(Pe) will not decrease from one iteration to the next. Going From One Model to Another. Jensen's inequality also suggests a method for using parameter values 0 for one model P to find initial parameter values 8 for another model P:",". With P and ~ fixed, find the values 8 that maximize R(P~, Pe). In contrast to the case where P = P, there may not be any ~9 for which R(P~, Pa) is non-negative.
