Expressive effects, together with their associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis and absent from generation.","We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that is intended to eventually incorporate three selected components--lexical, syntactic, and semantic. In this paper, we concentrate on certain aspects of syntactic style. We have designed and implemented a computational theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various applications, including machine translation, second-language instruction, and natural language generation.","We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and abstract elements of style. The primitive elements describe the stylistic effects of individual sentence components. These elements are combined into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the abstract elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects common to a group of sentences. Higher-level patterns are built from the abstract elements and associated with specific stylistic goals, such as clarity or concreteness. Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic stylistic grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive elements, abstract elements, and stylistic goals. Grammars for both English and French have been constructed, using the same vocabulary and the same development methodology. Parsers that implement these grammars have also been built.","The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously defined only descriptively. The theory is being applied to various problems in which the form of an utterance conveys an essential part of meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood. 1. Introduction 1.1 An Advocacy of Style Understanding a text requires more than just understanding its propositional content. It requires a sensitivity to the interaction of semantic content, emotional expression, and interpersonal and situational attitudes. This interaction is reflected in the style of the text. Style in language is not just surface appearance, a decorative veneer. Rather, it is an essential part of meaning, part of the author's communication to the reader. So to fully understand the nuances of a text, one must determine not only the propositional content, but also how its communicative effect is colored by the form, which reflects affective content. While propositional content provides the basic tone, the expressive * Department of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1. t Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A4. © 1993 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 form provides the"]},{"title":"tonal quality.","paragraphs":["Together, form and content create style, that which distinguishes both an individual text and a collective body of writing.","Style is created through subtle variation, seemingly minor modulations of exactly what is said, the words used to say it, and the syntactic constructions employed, but the resulting effect on communication can be striking. Consider the following versions of the same text, Matthew 7:27:","1. And descended the storm and came the floods and blew the winds and beat against that house and it fell and the fall of it was great. (Literal translation of the Hellenistic Greek.)","2. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. (Revised Standard Version, 1952.)","3.

Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had! (The New Jerusalem Bible, 1985.)","5. The rains fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and lashed against his house. It collapsed under all this and was completely ruined. (The New American Bible, 1973.) The first variation, a word-by-word translation from the Hellenistic Greek, is actually a good deal less striking than subsequent, widely accepted versions. The placement of the verbs before their subjects is quite normal and the closing is also quite usual. The sense of discord and resulting poetic effect is not as evident as it is in the second variation, from the Revised Standard Version, which is resoundingly poetic in the imitative form of the first five clauses, followed by the inverted form of the final clause. The text begins in strong concord and dissolves into discord, but not unpleasingly so."]},{"title":"Discord,","paragraphs":["as we use the term in this paper, refers to a deviation from the norm, but such deviations can be used to good effect.

Rain descended, floods rose, gales raged and beat upon that dwelling, and it collapsed; and what a fall it had!","7. Rain fell, the water level rose, winds blew and hit that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had! The differences between 4, 6, and 7 are primarily lexical. Example 6 uses rather elegant words, while 7 opts for a more commonplace vocabulary, and 4 lies somewhere between the two in lexical formality. Syntax: Comparing example 2 to example 5, we see that the former uses syntactic structures that create more dramatic effects: a short climactic sentence, and it fell, and a striking inversion, great was the fall of it, close the text on a powerful note. In contrast, 5 ends with a very ordinary, unremarkable, construction. Thematic aspects: Comparing example 2 to example 3, we observe that the two sentence structures bring different elements into focus: great was the fall of it, in contrast to down it fell with a great crash. In general, variations in thematic structure can create different stylistic effects. Semantics: The exact choice of what is said, or not said, also has stylistic consequences. Compare example 4 to the following two constructed versions: . . A serious storm, with rain and gales and floods, struck that house, which collapsed. Rain fell and fell and eventually caused a flood, which rose up to that house; also the winds kept blowing until eventually the combined forces of rain, flood, and wind were too great and caused so much structural damage that the house collapsed. These variations differ in their semantic content: example 4 merely reports the events, but 8 evaluates, a serious storm, while 9 emphasizes technical details, structural damage. These semantic differences are reflected in the texts; and stylistic differences result.","Given that these four parameters--lexical choice, syntax, theme, and semantics-- control stylistic variations, two questions arise: • How do we characterize each type of variation? • How does each variation contribute to an overall stylistic effect? In considering these questions in this paper, we will concentrate on variations of the syntactic parameter.","We emphasize that our intent here is not any form of literary analysis or literary theory. Our main concern will be ordinary, everyday text.

In contrast, our use of the term entails fully automatic computer analysis of the style of any kind of text. 454 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax and de Souza 1990). Even after the propositional content has been decided upon, there are still many linguistic, syntactic, and even semantic decisions that the language producer must make before a sentence can be formed. These decisions are assumed by the audience not to have been made randomly, but rather in specific, deliberate ways that encode additional information, such as opinion, emotional affect, and interpersonal relationships. 6 To the extent that a piece of text exhibits a particular, recognizable style, it also reflects the author's presumed intent to convey the effect associated with that style. Therefore, full understanding of a text must represent not only propositional content, but also stylistic effects.","This becomes most apparent in the case of machine translation.

Similarly, a speaker or writer is accountable for all the stylistic nuances of his or her utterances; it is not possible to utter a sentence in such a way that only the propositional content counts and not the form in which it is expressed. 7 \"Economy is expressed at two levels, lexical and syntactic, which may, however, be related: what is expressed lexically in one language may be realized through syntactic means in the other, and vice versa\" (Vinay and Darbelnet 1958, p. 185, authors\" translation). 455 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 be as general as possible, ideally applicable to the codification of style for the sentence and paragraph levels; appropriate for lexical, syntactic, and semantic style; and applicable to both English and French.

Background to the Study of Style 2.1 Views of Style 2.1.1 The Classical View. The study of style has an ancient history, for the concept first appeared in the fifth century B.C. Scholars of the time conceived the notion that the rhetorical form of a writer's text should reflect his thoughts and intentions. This was to be achieved through the appropriate choice and organization of words and syntactic structures in order to \"evoke the desired response\" (Corbett 1971). Content and form were recognized as inseparable, and as exerting a reciprocal influence upon each other.","Beginning with Corax of Syracuse, rhetoricians developed methods for systematic instruction in the art of writing. The classical scholars, from Isocrates and Aristotle to Cicero and Quintilian, established standards of rhetoric that influenced curricula for centuries. The contribution of Aristotle was particularly notable. He countered Plato's argument that rhetoric was mere sophistry, deceitful reasoning, by providing a system of instruction that treated the theory and practice of style as a valid discipline, designed to appeal simultaneously to reason and emotion.","This classical approach to style flourished into the Middle Ages, for it formed part of a standard university education. The teaching of formal rhetoric in schools and universities continued to play a significant role throughout the Renaissance and into the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic prescriptive rules. This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in writing (Corbett 1971). 2.1.2 The Modern View. Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form. Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal and correct mode of expression. However, normative rules, while necessary in some degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the expression of a writer's individual voice. Universal rules of good style are best used, we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear writing, but"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text. 2.1.3 Our View.

Group style can be subdivided into two major types, each associated with a different view of stylistics:"]},{"title":"literary","paragraphs":["style and"]},{"title":"utilitarian","paragraphs":["456 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax (or functional) style. Utilitarian group styles are distinguished from the literary type by their association with a genre of text that has a particular function or purpose, such as medical textbooks or political newspaper writing. In such styles, the writer adjusts her language to what readers expect in a specific situation. The fact that functional group styles are somewhat more restrictive than literary group styles, as they are characteristic of a particular genre, suggests that the problem of codifying utilitarian style will be more tractable than the literary case. For this reason, we will focus on utilitarian texts in general, drawing most of our examples from newspaper and magazine journalism. (Our main source of examples is the English translations, published in The Guardian Weekly, 8 of articles from Le Monde.) 2.2 The Current State of Computational Stylistics Most of the research to date in computational stylistics has been the development of so-called style-checkers. The UNix-based Writer's Workbench, Grammatik I and II, RightWriter, PC-Style, Punctuation and Style, Electric Webster, and CRITIQUE are examples (Raskin 1986). However, none of these systems is appropriate for our purposes. These programs enforce the basic virtues: be clear, be simple, be precise. They merely check for common grammatical errors such as number disagreement, pronoun case problems, unbalanced punctuation, split infinitives, excessive sentence length, and excessive sentence complexity. There is no systematic approach to constructing a vocabulary of style, no structured representation of stylistic rules. Stylistic knowledge may simply consist, as in the case of CRITIQUE, of an unstructured mass of rules (Jensen et al. 1986, p. 190). These programs have no real understanding of the significance of stylistic parameters.","The other main kind of computational research in stylistics has been statistical (e.g., Cluett 1976, 1990; Milic 1982; Biber 1988, 1989). With this approach, a count is made of the number of occurrences in a sample text of a stylistically significant feature, such as an initial prepositional phrase. A statistical analysis is done to compare the count and type of stylistic features with the corresponding parameters of texts written by authors working in the same or different genres. But the interpretation of the statistical results must be done by a human; the computer system has no real understanding of what the variations in style mean.","Although virtually all computational research in stylistics takes a non-AI approach to the representation and use of stylistic knowledge, the usefulness and degree of so-phistication of some of these programs should not be underestimated. The York Computer Inventory of Prose Style (Cluett 1976, 1990) has been undergoing development since 1970. The principal contribution of the project is its convincing demonstration that the richness and subtlety of literary style could in fact be correlated, to a perhaps surprising degree of accuracy, with a catalog of syntactic patterns. But the program that performs the stylistic analysis has no understanding of the meaning of its statistical results; it relies on human interpretation of the statistics computed. Nevertheless, the York project's findings are still very useful, as they have catalogued the syntactic features that produce particular stylistic effects.","Thus, most current approaches in computational stylistics have not included formal stylistic rules, which are clearly a desirable prerequisite. We now review the extent to which such rules have been developed in theoretical stylistics and used in computational stylistics.","The title of Vinay and Darbelnet's (1958) book, Stylistique comparde du fran¢ais et de 8 Formerly The Manchester Guardian Weekly. 457 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3"]},{"title":"l'anglais,","paragraphs":["is somewhat misleading, for their purpose was not just to deal with comparative stylistics in translation, but also to enumerate the more common rules and procedures in the overall translation process. But they did not construct a specific vocabulary for comparative stylistics and, in fact, virtually all of their 'stylistic' terms refer to basic syntactic constituents. Using their vocabulary of terms, Vinay and Darbelnet defined rules, expressed in ordinary natural language, that encoded knowledge about French-English comparative stylistics. The rules certainly fell short of the repertoire needed by a professional translator, but no one has yet improved upon their codification of comparative stylistics (Brian Fitch, personal communication). Their book is still used as a prescribed text in translation courses. Vinay and Darbelnet did not take an explicitly goal-directed approach, but their book does contain a great deal of information about the correlation of stylistic goals with particular lexical, syntactic, and semantic choices. Unfortunately, however, their rules proved to be too language-dependent for the framework that is proposed in this paper. But the success of a goal-directed codification, albeit an implicit one, supports the approach that we will take below.","Crystal and Davy (1969) hypothesized the creation of a formal stylistic grammar, built upon a vocabulary of stylistic terms and intended to represent the sentence structures characteristic of a particular stylistic sublanguage. However, the grammar that they sketched contained virtually no terms other than purely syntactic ones and no correlations with stylistic goals; it was only a first step, although an ambitious one, toward a codification of the stylistic rules that define a sublanguage. What we have found especially useful to adapt from their work is the overall methodology, the approach to formalizing style, even the belief that style"]},{"title":"can","paragraphs":["be formalized.","Kane's (1983) rhetoric and handbook of style represents the typical textbook that aims to teach the rules of classic good writing. Kane, too, did not take an explicitly goal-directed approach in his stylistic rules, but nevertheless gave numerous references to the stylistic goals associated with particular syntactic structures. The systematic construction of a stylistic vocabulary seems not to have been an explicit goal, but he used many terms unique to stylistics. However, his terminology was apparently augmented whenever the need arose to describe a new feature; there was no underlying structure, no formal representation of rules. The stylistic rules were expressed in ordinary English and achieved, as the author intended, good coverage of plain writing style. This body of rules was 'structured' to the extent that there were hierarchies of stylistic sentence types, but, in general, Kane's rules appear to be just an enumeration of stylistic tenets, not a deliberately constructed organization. Nevertheless, we have found it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic coverage of our grammar.","In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest to us is machine translation (MT). In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT, Loffier-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each language.

PAULINE was able to generate text that conformed to various stylistic and pragmatic constraints that it was given.

Avoid doubtful grammar, popular idioms, slang, and contractions. Although structured in its correlation of the generator's actions with decision points, this approach to representing a goal-directed knowledge of style is essentially heuristic.","Hovy's success in implementing a goal-based notion of style, even though limited in scope and informal in the mode of knowledge representation, encouraged our development of a computational approach to goal-directed style.","2.3 Summary","• From existing research in theoretical stylistics, we have seen that there is","a basis for the codification of group-based, utilitarian, goal-directed","stylistics.","• The need for a vocabulary of stylistic terms is an accepted idea. However, the nature and structure of such a vocabulary for computational use, which must describe more than basic syntax and be amenable to systematic construction, have not yet been addressed. These issues will be subjects of the next section.","• Similarly, while large bodies of stylistic rules already exist, they have not been organized into the formal structure necessary to a computational approach. Section 4 will develop a structured method for representing stylistic rules by constructing formal grammars.","• The feasibility of a goal-directed analysis of style is supported by previous research, but an actual goal-based codification has not previously been attempted.

A Vocabulary of Style 3.1 Stylistic Goals If we hope to build AI-based systems to deal with matters of style, then we must provide a formal knowledge representation: we need a vocabulary of well-defined, expressive terms that will allow our intuitions about style to be stated precisely and 459 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 understood clearly. We will construct a vocabulary from terms that are associated with utilitarian, group-based, goal-directed stylistics. We will start by considering the kinds of stylistic goals to be dealt with in the lexicon.","When a writer composes text, she has certain stylistic goals in mind; such goals might include clarity, or informality, or even the clouding of an unpalatable message.

There are a multitude of goals that could be considered; indeed, the space of possibilities has never been fully explored. For this study, we have chosen six goals that Vinay and Darbelnet (1958) consider to be among the most commonly used, representing the opposite ends of three dimensions. The goals are listed as follows, with an intuitive description of the corresponding characteristics that a sentence of each type would display: • Clarity: Simplicity, harmony, and no ambiguity. Obscurity: Complexity, incongruity, and difficulty of understanding. • Concreteness: Specificity, with an emphasis on certain components. Abstraction: Generality, with no particular emphasis on any one sentence component. • Staticness: Uniformity, predictability, continuity. Dynamism: Deviation from the norm, unexpectedness, action. 3.2 From Theoretical Stylistics to Computational Stylistics We will now develop a vocabulary of basic terms that will describe stylistically significant aspects of syntax. Our development is guided by much in classical rhetorical theory; often, our definitions will be extensions of those of the classical theory. We do this in two stages: first, we outline abstract properties of style suggested by classical rhetoric; second, we convert these properties into definitions of abstract elements that will be used in a grammar of style.","Our starting point is the notion of"]},{"title":"stylistic norm,","paragraphs":["which is defined as the most commonly used structures in a given genre.

Concord simply means conformity with the norm, and discord, deviation from the norm.","Each genre has its own particular norm; for example, the style characteristic of scientific texts may seem disruptive if used in general newspaper writing. This view goes beyond the tenet of prescriptive rhetoric that the stylistic norm merely represents standard, 'good,' style, independent of the use of the text. Rather, we agree with Lanham (1974) that style should be viewed as the tailoring of a text to a specific audience and a specific situation; 'good' style can in fact be quite inappropriate.","The concept of norm will be useful as a means of anchoring the development of our stylistic rules. It is simply the usual, the typical, the stable and concordant. Indeed, discord, deviation from the norm, will play an essential role in our formalization of style, for it is our contention that style arises from the construction of patterns of 460 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax concord and discord, particular combinations of order and disorder that create an overall harmonious arrangement (Crystal and Davy 1969; Cluett 1976, 1990). 3.2.1 The Divisions of the Vocabulary. As the first step in constructing a vocabulary of style for computational use, we will look at the descriptive terms that stylists have developed over many centuries of use.","One of the most important rhetorical influences on sentence style that has been identified is syntactic parallelism, or coordination: the balancing of syntactically similar forms to achieve a harmonious stylistic effect, an idea dating back to the rhetorical schemes of balance (Corbett 1971, p. 463).","But if parallelism or coordination plays an important role in style, so too does subordination: variations in the hierarchical structure of a sentence that can produce correspondingly different stylistic effects. One part of a sentence can dominate another. As with parallelism, the importance to style of syntactic hierarchy is also a well-established principle in classical rhetoric, evident in the schemes of parenthesis, apposition, and climax (Corbett 1971, pp. 466, 468, 476). Thus, modulations in coordinate and subordinate structure are major factors in achieving stylistic expressiveness.","A third major contributor to syntactic style is linear ordering: varying the order of components within a sentence to produce quite marked stylistic differences. The rhetorical terms of anastrophe and parenthesis (Corbett 1971, p. 466) attest to the stylistic importance of the ordering of sentence components.","Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are: • Balance: Parallelism of structure. • Dominance: Structural hierarchy. • Position: Linear ordering of structure. We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary of style. Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each group. 3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style. In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969). All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar clauses. We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976). As well as identifying similar structures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) or syntactic counterpoint (Hendricks 1976). These types of structures are most often interrupted or convoluted sentences (Kane 1983). For inclusion in our vocabulary, we will choose the most representative terms in the balance group: intersentence coordination and intrasentence counterpoint.","There are a variety of terms that can be classified into the dominance group. First, there are sentences that have one trivially dominant clause. These are the simple sentences (Kane 1983) that have only one main, or central, clause with no subordinate clauses. Next, there are many and varied types of sentences built up around a central, dominant clause. The complex sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause and at least one dependent clause. The loose sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause followed by 461 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 a subordinate clause.

We will now use these notions to define abstract elements that are related, in turn, to effects of balance, dominance, and position. 3.3.1 Balance Elements. The first group of abstract elements is related to effects of balance within a sentence. Here, we will be looking at relationships that tend to either perturb or reinforce the balance of a sentence. The first and simplest type of balance element is a homopoise (\"same weight\"):","Homopoise: A sentence with interclausal coordination of syntactically similar components. In other words, there are one or more stylistic 'shapes' in a homopoisal sentence, each contributing the same type of effect to the concordant parallelism of the sentence. In the example below, two very simple clauses, with identically shaped parse trees, are conjoined: 13. The style was formed and the principles were acquired. 9","Sentences that are more complex can have their balance interrupted or perturbed by a heteropoisal (\"different weight\") component:","Heteropoise: A sentence in which one or more parenthetical components are syntactically 'detached' and dissimilar from the other components at the same level in the parse tree. It is difficult to formally characterize this class of structures and the underlying notion of a component being 'detached.' Quirk et al. (1985) also rely on this word to define what they call disjuncts but make no attempt to define it: Disjuncts ... have a superior role as compared with the sentence elements; they are syntactically more detached and in some respects 'superordinate,' in that they seem to have a scope that extends over the sentence as a whole. (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 613) l° Similarly, Nunberg (1990), in defining the related idea of the delimiter comma, can do no better than to characterize the class \"in a rough way\": There is the class of elements delimited by commas, either at both ends (when the elements occur clause-internally) or at one end (roughly, when the elements are either clause-initial or -final) [p. 36] .... It is obviously not possible here to provide an analysis of the syntax and semantics of each of these constructions, much less to try to characterize them in such a way as to say what they have in common. In a rough way, however, we observe that they all involve constituency 9 Adapted from The Manchester Guardian Weekly, 14 February 1988, p. 15. 10 An example of a disjunct is the interrupting prepositional phrase in all frankness in the sentence Your son is not, in all frankness, succeeding in his present job (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 612). 463 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 problems, so that they do not behave as constituents, for example, under such tests as verb-phrase ellipsis. What is more, all of them can be characterized as supplying material that is communicatively supererogatory to the bare propositional content of the lexical clause in which they appear.... This is all very rough, but it does suggest that the content of these comma-delimited elements plays a distinctive role in the representation of the [rhetorical] argument structure of the text. [pp. 38-39]","Despite the difficulty of formal characterization, we agree with Quirk et al. and Nunberg that there is an intuitively clear class of constructions here, and, like these authors, hope that it can be conveyed to the reader by sufficient use of examples.","We divide the class of heteropoise sentences into three types, depending upon the position of the parenthetical component: a heteropoise may be medial, initial, or final. Moreover, we will distinguish between two subtypes at each position: concordant and discordant.","Medial heteropoise: A heteropoise in which the parenthetical component is in medial position.","Concordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the parenthetical component is cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence. (This notion will be made precise when we have introduced the primitive elements in Section 3.4.)","Discordant medial heteropoise: A medial heteropoise in which the parenthetical component is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence. In example 14 below, the relative clause which brought no protests interrupts the main clause, yet, as a postmodifier, it is still a part of the subject noun phrase and so the sentence is a concordant medial heteropoise. But now consider the medial adverbial phrase according to a company spokesman; as a sentence modifier, it is quite detached from the rest of the sentence and so the sentence is simultaneously a discordant medial heteropoise:","14. The measure, which brought no protests, was decided, according to a company spokesman, because of the dangers to which these employees are exposed in travelling to particularly exposed subtropical countries, u","Initial heteropoise\" A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the parenthetical component is in initial position. Sentence 15 contains an initial parenthesis, an appositive noun phrase, that is cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence because it refers to the subject of the main clause. Thus, the sentence is a concordant initial heteropoise:","15. The heir to a fortune, her friend did not care about passing examinations. 12 11 Manchester Guardian Weekly, 21 February 1988, p. 14. 12 Quirk et al. (1985, p. 1314). 464 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax","Final heteropoise: A heteropoise, concordant or discordant, in which the parenthetical component is in final position. Sentence 16 contains a final parenthesis, an 'extraneous' phrase, that is distinct from the main clause, as it is not cohesively linked to the rest of the sentence. Thus, the sentence is a discordant final heteropoise:","16. Stephen and Jennifer are not going to buy the house, according to a spokesman.","We saw in 14 that a heteropoise can contain more than one parenthetical, and one of them might be concordant while another is discordant. Likewise, it can be the case that one parenthetical is, say, medial, while another is initial or final. The following example shows two successive medial parentheticals rather stridently interrupting the main text--the effect is heightened by the use of dashes--as well as a final parenthetical in the same sentence:","17. The idea of combined French and British patrols by nuclear submarines--a proposal once made by the Social Democrat leader David Owen--let alone the plan for \"sharing the work\" where the targets and missiles carried by these submarines are concerned was not even raised, according to a French military spokesman. 13 3.3.2 Dominance Elements. The second type of abstract element deals with stylistic dominance, which is concerned with the hierarchical structure of a sentence. A common type of dominance element is the monoschematic, a very simple sentence:","Monoschematic: A sentence with a single main clause with simple phrasal subordination and no accompanying subordinate or coordinate clauses. Here is an example of a canonical monoschematic sentence: 18. Posterity has not been kind to him. 14","The most common dominance element in the texts that we have studied is the centroschematic:","Centroschematic: A sentence with a central, dominant clause with one or more of the following optional features: complex phrasal subordination, initial dependent clauses, final dependent clauses. Centroschematic sentences can be quite varied in structure, but their shared characteristic is a predominant component that serves as the organizational center for all other components. Such structures are built with subordination and coordination. In 13 Manchester Guardian Weekly, 7 February 1988, p. 13. 14 Adapted from The Manchester Guardian Weekly, 14 February 1988, p. 15. 465 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 the first example below, the main clause is supported by a complex, but subordinate and coordinate, relative clause structure:","19. Neither these devices nor the cramped viewing rooms which are too narrow and whose ceilings are much too low for the big altarpieces manage to spoil the works. 15 Two subordinate clauses, the first of them adverbial and the second of them relative, accompany but do not dominate the main clause in the following sentence:","20. Not all that long ago, the famous collector Charles de Bestegui, when unable to get hold of certain paintings, was quite prepared to adorn the walls of his Venetian palace with copies, which happily rubbed shoulders with his numerous genuine canvases. 16 Finally, the complex but imitative postmodification in the next example incorporates a substantial amount of information without weakening the dominance of the main clause:","21. Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50's, a shrew falsely mellowed by religion, promptly organised prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware meetings. 17","Given that we have a progression in complexity from monoschematic to centroschematic sentences, a natural extension is to the polyschematic:","Polysehematic: A sentence with more than one central dominant clause and at least one dependent clause. Such sentences occur much less frequently than the monoschematic or centroschematic varieties, at least in the corpus used in this research. However, a sentence with obviously disparate components occasionally occurs, as in the following example. There are two dominant clauses (we could think.., and we should not forget ... ) and a dependent clause (if we consider the progress ... ):","22. If we consider the progress already achieved, the opposition that had to be overcome, for example, in order to open schools for girls, and the fact that Saudi Arabia is less than 60 years old, we could think that time will permit resolving the contradictions between the most liberal aspirations of one part of society and the ulemas' determination to keep the country as it is, and we should not forget to mention the Islamic fundamentalist movements which are threatening Saudi Arabia.

(1985, p. 652). 20 Matthew 7:27, Revised Standard Version (1952). 467 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 of stylistics, we observed that two analyses of stylistic structure are possible: connective and hierarchic orderings:","Connective ordering: The result of cohesive bonds drawing together components in a linear ordering.","Hierarchic ordering: The result of bonds of subordination and superordination drawing together components in a nested ordering. These two complementary kinds of analysis are implicit in the work of most stylists and rhetoricians, such as Cluett (1976) and Bureau (1976) (Neil Randall, personal communication).","We will now use these notions of connective and hierarchic orderings to guide the definition of more-primitive stylistic elements that provide a precise syntactic basis to the vocabulary, yet also allow a mapping to the abstract elements. 3.4.2 The Role of Corpus Studies in the Classification of the Primitive Elements of Style. We believe that to establish stylistic classifications and construct a practical stylistic grammar, one must undertake corpus studies in the style of Cluett (1976) and Biber (1988, 1989) to support the exact classifications of stylistic effects. But we also agree with Crystal and Davy that: It is perhaps worth emphasising right away that the first step in any stylistic analysis must be an intuitive one. The stylistician is on precisely the same footing as anyone else here: he notices a linguistic feature which he feels to be stylistically significant. The difference between his approach and that of the untrained observer is that he will have a clearer idea of what is likely to be significant, and will know what to do with his observations once they are made. This last point is the stylistician's main competence: he is able to interrelate his observations within the framework of some theory, and thus piece together any general pattern of linguistic variation which may exist. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 12) Thus, although we have built our grammar of style upon accepted theory, it is currently a prototype for the formal representation of stylistic knowledge, not yet developed as a tool for practical stylistic analysis. 21 For, like Crystal and Davy, our initial objective is to provide a methodology, a vocabulary and apparatus, that will allow others to integrate our approach with analytic procedures to construct useful formalizations of style: All we can do is systematically point to certain significant facts in the language being analysed, suggest some theoretical principles which will account for the occurrence of these facts, emphasise the need for further analysis to validate or refute these preliminary soundings, and illustrate a procedure which will allow people to do this. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 13) 21 See Section 6 for a discussion of work in progress. 468 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax","In the manner of Crystal and Davy, we agree that statistical verification must follow such research, but we believe that, initially, we can use well-motivated intuitions about stylistic frequencies to classify our stylistic elements: Such a [statistical] method would be prerequisite for any serious research work, but it is too detailed for our present purposes. Consequently we make use of the alternative method of expression, making our statements of frequency in more informal terms, using such quantifiers as 'rarely', 'commonly', 'often', 'very often', and so on. This range of adverbials in English cuts up a continuum of frequency very clearly, with very little overlap, and is readily intelligible. It should not be forgotten, however, that any statements of relative frequency in these terms can be referred if necessary to the precise statistical situation which underlies them. (Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 22) 3.4.3 Primitive Stylistic Elements. Primitive stylistic elements are individual constituents that have a particular stylistic effect. But what should we use as the basis for the definition of 'stylistic effect'? We have said that the two analyses of sentence structure, connective and hierarchic, can provide the appropriate guidance. We will define the stylistic effect of an individual component in terms of its contribution to each ordering:","• For the connective view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its degree of cohesiveness, its bonding with other components in the sentence.","• For the hierarchic view, a component acquires its stylistic effect from its degree of subordination, its dependence on other components in the sentence.","We introduce the terms conjunct, antijunct, subjunct, and superjunct (to be defined in the following sections) and we use superscripts on all the terms to indicate the degree of connectivity or subordination. In the connective view, we classify syntactic components as either conjunct 4 (excessively connective), conjunct 3 (strongly connective), conjunct 2 (moderately connective), conjunct 1 (mildly connective), and conjunct ° (neutral). Similarly, we use the terms antijunct ° through antijunct 4 to indicate increasingly disconnective effects; conjunct ° and antijunct ° are the same.","There is a complementary vocabulary of primitive elements for the hierarchic view. The stylistic effects of syntactic components are correlated with the degree of subordination or superordination; the classifications are analogous to the connective: subjunct 4 through subjunct ° (decreasingly subordinate) and superjunct ° through superjunct 4 (increasingly superordinate); subjunct ° and superjunct ° are the same. Connective primitive elements. In assigning connective effects to syntactic components, we adapt Halliday and Hasan's (1976) work on cohesion. Although Halliday and Hasan focused on definitions of cohesion in whole texts, we can apply these definitions to cohesion within the sentence, for, as they point out: Since cohesive relations are not concerned with structure, they may be found just as well within a sentence as between sentences. They attract less notice within a sentence, because of the cohesive strength of grammatical structure; since the sentence hangs together already, 469 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 the cohesion is not needed in order to make it hang together.

These phenomena will be used to classify the hierarchic primitive elements in our stylistic grammar. Embedding is described as: the 'rank shift' by which a clause or phrase comes to function within the structure of a group, like who came to dinner in the man who came to dinner. (Halliday 1985, p. 219) There are various types of embeddings, including prepositional phrases, as in John might arrive as early as tomorrow, but Halliday focuses on those within the nominal group: [The embedded prepositional phrase] is the only instance of embedding other than in a nominal group. All other embedding in English is a form of nominalization, where a group, phrase, or clause comes to function as part of, or in place of (i.e., as the whole of), a nominal group. (Halliday 1985, p. 187) Examples of embedded subordination are finite and nonfinite clauses 3° that function as postmodifiers, as in the house that lack built, or as the head of a nominal group, as in For Jack to build a house would be the best thing (Halliday 1985, p. 220).","Halliday defines hypotaxis as: the binding of elements of unequal status. The dominant element is free, but the dependent element is not. [p. 198] In a hypotactic structure the elements are ordered in dependence, and this ordering is largely independent of the sequence. [p. 199] There are many types of hypotaxis, at the clause, phrase, and word levels. Examples of hypotactic subordination include a dependent clause following a dominant clause, preceding the dominant, enclosed in the dominant, or enclosing the dominant: 34. You never can tell till you try. 31 35. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. 32 36. Picture, if you can, a winkle. 33 37. He might, he said, finish it himself. 34 It should be emphasized that the two types of subordination are quite different: It is important to distinguish between embedding on the one hand and ... hypotaxis on the other. Whereas hypotaxis [is a relation] BETWEEN clauses (or other ranking elements), embedding is not.

A Stylistic Grammar 4.1 A Methodology for Developing a Stylistic Grammar So far, we have constructed a vocabulary of style. We can now define a method for using the vocabulary to systematically build up a syntactic stylistic grammar for both the connective and hierarchic views of style.","To construct the stylistic grammar, we will use a methodology whose steps are as follows: • the classification of primitive stylistic elements;","• the correlation of the stylistic effects of these elements with the abstract stylistic elements; and","• the correlation of patterns of these abstract elements with specific stylistic goals.","The grammar to be constructed in this manner will be stratified with internal branching, as illustrated in Figure 1. As the figure shows, at the bottom level there are three branches--lexical, syntactic, and semantic--each with its own vocabulary 474 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax Grammar of stylistic goals:","A correlation of stylistic goals with patterns of abstract elements.

At the central level, we use a single vocabulary of abstract elements, stylistic terms that are maximally expressive. Rules relate these abstract elements to patterns of lexical, syntactic, and semantic primitive elements. This level is the unifying core of the grammar; as we will note later, the same abstract elements can describe both English and French style, and both syntactic and semantic aspects of style. Finally, at the top level, rules correlate individual stylistic goals with patterns of abstract elements. Together, these levels form a language-independent 4° schema for a goal-directed grammar. 4.2 Grammar of Primitive Elements The stylistic grammar that we have outlined in the previous section shows how lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of style would be integrated within one grammar. Some work has already been done on the development of the lexical and semantic branches (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2), but here we will focus on syntactic style. We will now trace the development of the syntactic component of the stylistic grammar, beginning with the most detailed and most closely syntactic level, the grammar of primitive elements. As we proposed earlier, we will consider two analyses of sentence structure, connective and hierarchic, each with its own stylistic classifications. In this base-level grammar of","40 We expect that a particular stylistic grammar will be applicable to a family of stylistically similar languages. 475 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 primitive elements, the rules are based on syntactic and stylistic rules of Crystal and Davy (1969), Kane (1983), and Quirk et al. (1985).","In the full grammars given by DiMarco (1990) and subsequently by Hoyt (1993), each syntactic category is given both a connective and a hierarchic primitive classification by corresponding rules. Here, we will present only selected rules, mainly those associated with the stylistic effects of various types of premodification and postmodification in the nominal group. We will begin with the elementary components and work up to full sentences. In the presentation of the grammar rules, we will first give the connective rules, then their hierarchic counterparts. Often, we will annotate rules with relevant examples. (Explanatory notes on the terminology are given in Appendix A.) Adjectivals.

That is, a specific part of the sentence seems incongruous, discordant, but this discord is interpreted within the context of the rest of the sentence, so that it may either be 'resolved' by a return to a usual form, or left unresolved. We have formalized these two situations in the abstract elements of resolution and dissolution. A resolution is a shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a move from a relative discord to a concord. A dissolution is a shift in stylistic effect that occurs at the end of a sentence and is a move from a relative concord to a discord.","Rule resolution initial discord and final concord 487 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3","Rule dissolution initial concord and final discord 4.4 Grammar of Stylistic Goals Having completed the central level in the stylistic grammar, the grammar of abstract elements, we can now define the rules at the top level that correlate patterns of the abstract elements with the writer's specific goals.","Stylistic goals, such as clarity, are elusive qualities that up to now have been defined by stylists by means of examples and informal rules. However, with the vocabulary and formal grammar that we have defined, we now have a way of seeing and abstracting what these examples have in common. We can abstract from a plethora of low-level syntactic rules that stylists traditionally have used, and can now define formal rules for specific stylistic goals.","Note that stylistic goals can be organized along orthogonal dimensions. For example, a writer might try to be clear, or obscure, or make no effort either way. Clarity and obscurity are thus opposite ends of a stylistic dimension. Likewise, the goals of concreteness and abstraction form a dimension, and so do staticness and dynamism. Below, we look at one end of each of these dimensions; for details of their duals, see DiMarco (1990) and Hoyt (1993). Clarity. Clarity is a very pervasive stylistic goal. Almost all the advice in textbooks of style and rhetoric is aimed at teaching the writer how to achieve clarity. Clarity, in other words, is thought to be the norm that a writer should strive for. To be clear is to be plain, precise, and predictable. In keeping with stylistic theory, therefore, we interpret the goal of clarity as adherence to the stylistic norm and incorporate accepted definitions of norm, that is, cohesive and concordant structures, in our grammar rule for clarity.","Thus, we can use our stylistic grammar to give precise definitions to the kinds of sentences that Kane (1983), for example, associates with clarity:","• Simple sentences, which consist of one independent clause: these are our monoschematic sentences.","• Centered sentences, which consist of dependent constructions, followed by a main clause, followed by additional dependent clauses. We expand the notion of 'centered sentence' to include any sentence in which there is a dominant, concordant core: these are our centroschematic sentences.","• Parallel sentences, which reduce ambiguity by stressing the same grammatical form: these are our homopoisal sentences. Hence, we define clarity as follows:","Rule clarity monoschematic centroschematic homopoise 488 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax Concreteness.

STYLISTIQUE: A Syntactic Stylistic Parser So far, we have developed a vocabulary and methodology for constructing a stylistic grammar and we have shown how these tools have been applied to the construction of an English syntactic stylistic grammar. In DiMarco (1990), we applied the same vocabulary and methodology to develop a French syntactic stylistic grammar. However, these grammars provide only a theoretical foundation for a computational theory of stylistics. Now we describe the implementation of the stylistic grammars in a computational system. In this section, we will describe the organization of STYLISTIQUE, a syntactic stylistic parser that interprets the stylistic grammar. We will present a short example to illustrate STYLISTIQUE's method of analysis. 5.1 How STYLISTIQUE works The English and French syntactic stylistic grammars are implemented in separate parsers that form the STYLISTIQUE system, a definite clause grammar that consists of 489 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3"]},{"title":"det(conjunct2_determiner,subjunctl_determiner,this,singular). det(conjunct2_determiner,subjunctl_determiner,my,singular). adj(conjunct1_adjective,subjunctl_adjective,large).

The underlying stylistic grammar is highly complex, and so, lacking the aid of semantics, the stylistic parser can produce a number of syntactically grammatical, but not necessarily stylistically correct, parses for a given sentence. The standard PROLOG cut might have constrained backtracking and reduced the number of correct parses, but it seemed too crude and unpredictable to be easily applied to so complex and interdependent a system of rules","47 The English parser is based on a conventional parser written by Kern Luther and Rick MacLean at the University of Toronto, with supplementary rules suggested by Crystal and Davy (1969) and Quirk et al. (1985). The French parser is also based on Luther and MacLean's code, with supplementary rules adapted from Dubois and Dubois-Charlier (1970) and Galichet (1970).","48 The prefix \"c\" in the PROLOG rule indicates that the structure is concordant. 490 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax heteropoisal postmodification conjunct 3 postmodification with parenthesis conjunct 3 postmodification with parenthesis nominal group","build_styl_postmod( StyleTree, styl(c_postmodification,hp_postmodification, StyleTree)) :-","Concordant and heteropoisal postmodification smember(c_nominal_group,StyleTree).

As a simpler solution, we introduced explicit markers of punctuation that provide a form of partial disambiguation, as they do what the system should have done unaided but couldn't, because of the limitations mentioned above. STYLISTIQUE requires this prior disambiguation mostly for reasons of efficiency. For example, most parsers are unable to handle the conjunction and by any means other than trying all possible parses (Snarr 1984). The problem is analogous for or and for the comma (which can be considered a word). In our parser, the situation is complicated by the same conjunctions and the same punctuation markers playing different roles according to their level in the sentence structure. As a consequence, different conjunctions and punctuation markers are used at the sentence, clause, complement, and noun phrase level. 5.2 A Sample Stylistic Parse A corpus of 75 sentences (52 English, 23 French) was used to test the parser. These sentences were chosen to demonstrate a substantial degree of stylistic variation. The following short example illustrates the kind of analysis that STYLISTIQUE produces for the sentence: 45. True, posterity has been kind. In subsequent sections, we will give an interpretation of the following parse tree for this sentence. 49 Stylistic goals of this sentence: [clarity,concreteness,neutral] Abstract stylistic elements (Connective view): [[initial_and_medial_concord,initial_concord], [centroschematic,monoschematic], [initial_hetsropoise,c_initial_heteropoise]] 49 For brevity, we have omitted the hierarchical primitive-element parse. 491 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 Abstract stylistic elements (Hierarchic view): [[], [centroschematic], [initial_heteropoise,c_initial_heteropoise]] .............................................

The effect of coarse-grainedness was observed in the parses of some of the sentences in the sample corpus: Some sentences were parsed as simultaneously having both an initial concord and an initial discord. For example, both the following sentences were analyzed in this inconsistent manner: 46. To tell everybody is the best thing. 47. Telling lies is wrong. Some position elements were incorrectly identified: for example, a final discord was recorded as an initial discord. Some sentences with obviously different degrees of cohesiveness received the same analysis at the abstract-element level. These anomalous results are not due to programming errors, but to the excessive ab-493 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 stractness of the abstract elements and the resulting coarse grain of the grammar. It was a deliberate choice to define elements that were quite abstract. A major limitation of previous work in stylistics was the use of terms that were so specific and so numerous that it was not possible to identify general stylistic features that were common to sentences that were stylistically similar, but not obviously syntactically similar. How-ever, our stylistic terms have occasionally erred on the side of being too abstract. For example, an initial discord in a STYLISTIQUE analysis may correctly identify the presence of a discord in the sentence but, because the scope of the element can be so broad, STYLISTIQUE sometimes cannot distinguish between a true initial discord, which occurs at the start of a sentence, and a noninitial discord that seems to be 'initial' because it affects the whole sentence.","The excessive abstractness of the stylistic elements was further demonstrated by the rules in Section 4.4, where we used the same patterns of elements to define both clarity and staticness. That there may be different types of monoschematic sentences, some merely clear, others static as well, has been overlooked in a stylistic analysis that relies on maximally expressive descriptions. Our grammar currently does not allow for such subtleties; although it fulfills our objective of a formalization of style that captures many generalities, it is not yet sufficiently expressive to distinguish all the subtleties we would wish. 6. Summary and Conclusion In this final section, we will review the contributions of the research described in this paper and conclude with a discussion of some of the new directions that the work is taking. 6.1 Contributions of the Research The problem of style presented advantages as a focus for new research. The codification of stylistic knowledge had been a virtually unexplored problem even within the general research area of computational linguistics. With very few exceptions, previous work had been unambitious (for example, counting word frequencies, or advocating basic rules of composition).","Our aim was to create a formal representation of goal-directed, nonliterary stylistics and, moreover, to do so in a manner applicable to different languages. The solution we proposed was the codification of stylistic knowledge in the form of a stylistic grammar. The construction of a stylistic grammar constitutes a theoretical advance over previous work in stylistics, for researchers had not attempted to produce a formal treatment of style, but had relied simply on unstructured normative or descriptive 'rules.' The work we have done toward a grammar of style has brought together ideas from stylistic theory and knowledge representation and applied them to a hitherto unformalized body of knowledge.","As a result of building English and French stylistic grammars, we were able to give more-formal definitions of stylistic goals. Previously, our understanding had been either purely subjective or based on established but unformalized usage. Now we have a grammar that correlates stylistic goals with specific patterns of abstract properties of text. Our contribution to more-formal definitions of stylistic goals was demonstrated for both syntactic and semantic style, as Ryan (1989, 1992) adapted our vocabulary and methodology to construct a semantic stylistic grammar that correlated the focus structure of paragraphs with the abstract elements, and the abstract elements with specific stylistic goals. In so doing, he augmented the definitions of stylistic goals.","The English and French syntactic stylistic grammars were implemented in STYLIS-494 Chrysanne DiMarco and Graeme Hirst Goal-Directed Style in Syntax TIQUE, a stylistic parser that produced detailed goal-directed stylistic analyses of sentences typical of sophisticated magazine writing. 6.2 Applications of the Research 6.2.1 Style in Machine Translation. We have developed separate English and French stylistic grammars and parsers. DiMarco and Hirst (1990) describes the application of our ideas to machine translation. Given the current French and English stylistic grammars, the next step in building a system that could preserve style in translation was to define a mapping between these grammars. Mah (1991, 1992) adapted and extended our work to add a practical, computational treatment of French-English comparative stylistics to the theory. This work will eventually make possible machine translation systems that would be able to preserve or modify style in translation. Makuta-Giluk (1991; Makuta-Giluk and DiMarco 1993) developed a computational theory of rhetoric that builds upon our theory to deal with the codification of higher-level pragmatic effects of language, such as formality, persuasion, and sincerity. Her work is also applicable to the preservation of stylistic effects in translation. 6.2.2 Natural Language Generation with Stylistic Constraints. The ability to deal with stylistic and pragmatic aspects of language is important not only in natural language understanding, but in generation as well. Our stylistic grammar provides a formal representation of stylistic knowledge that was previously lacking in generation systems that attempted to deal with pragmatic issues. BenHassine (1992) adapted our knowledge representation for stylistics in order to incorporate stylistic constraints into the Penman language generation system (Penman 1988). Green (1992a, 1992b) extended and refined our theory of style by adapting work from functional grammar. Hoyt (1993) and Green have implemented the new theory in an integrated stylistic analyzer and generator, respectively. DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) are looking at lexical choice in natural language generation, including considerations of lexical style. 6.2.3 Second-Language Teaching. What has been learned from developing STYLISTIQUE has also been applied to machine-aided language instruction. Existing language-teaching systems focus almost exclusively on the basics of composition. An instructional version of STYLISTIQUE could systematically develop a student's understanding of the more advanced aspects of language composition. Payette (1990; Payette and Hirst 1992) developed an instructional system that, applying some of our ideas, analyzes input sentences for basic normative style and clarity, and offers feedback to the student. 6.3 Conclusion Stylistic and pragmatic aspects, though necessary in complete understanding of language, have been neglected in computational linguistics research. These problems had been too vague and ill-defined to be dealt with by computational systems. However, in this work, we have developed a novel, formal representation of stylistic knowledge that makes the problem of stylistic analysis more amenable to computational solution.","It is hoped that this research will lead to a system sophisticated enough to deal with a range of stylistic problems. Long-term applications include the development of a stylistic post-editor for use in a machine translation system. In addition, the continuing enhancements of the stylistic analyzer should contribute to a better understanding of the role style plays in language generation and teaching. The ongoing development of a formal framework for the representation of knowledge about stylistics should provide a partial computer model of how people produce style in language. 495 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 Acknowledgments We hereby express our gratitude to Eduard Hovy, who helped to shape the evolution of this research, Brian Fitch, who provided the inspiration and direction to bridge the chasm between translation theory and computational practice, and Henry Schogt, who helped us maintain the linguistic validity of the research.
