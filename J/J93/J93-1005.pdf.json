This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Prepositional phrase attachment is the canonical case of structural ambiguity, as in the timeworn example: Example 1 I saw the man with the telescope. An analysis where the prepositional phrase [pp with the telescope] is part of the object noun phrase has the semantics \"the man who had the telescope\"; an analysis where the PP has a higher attachment (perhaps as daughter of VP) is associated with a semantics where the seeing is achieved by means of a telescope. The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for language models. It looks like it might require extremely complex computation to determine what attaches to what. Indeed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text are represented and reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988). We take this argument to show that reasoning essentially involving reference in a discourse model is implicated in resolving attachment ambiguities in a certain class of cases. If this phenomenon is typical, there is little hope in the near term for building computational models capable of resolving such ambiguities in unrestricted text. 1.1 Structure-Based Ambiguity Resolution There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains. The two main ones are as follows.","• Right Association--a constituent tends to attach to another constituent immediately to its right (Kimball 1973). * AT&T Bell Laboratories, 600 Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974, USA. f The new affiliation of the second author is: Institut ffir maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung, Universit/it Stuttgart. (~) 1993 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1","• Minimal Attachment--a constituent tends to attach to an existing nonterminal using the fewest additional syntactic nodes (Frazier 1978). For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb + object context as in Example 1, these two principles--at least given the version of syntax that Frazier assumes--make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.","Psycholinguistic work on structure-based strategies is primarily concerned with modeling the time course of parsing and disambiguation, and acknowledges that other information enters into determining a final parse. Still, one can ask what information is relevant to determining a final parse, and it seems that in this domain structure-based disambiguation is not a very good predictor. A recent study of attachment of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a \"Wizard of Oz\" travel information experiment shows that neither Right Association nor Minimal Attachment accounts for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990). And experiments by Taraban and McClelland (1988) show that the structural models are not in fact good predictors of people's behavior in resolving ambiguity. 1.2 Resolving Ambiguity through Lexical Associations Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner (1990) found lexical preferences to be the key to resolving attachment ambiguity. Similarly, Taraban and McClelland found that lexical content was key in explaining people's behavior. Various previous proposals for guid-ing attachment disambiguation by the lexical content of specific words have appeared (e.g. Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; Marcus 1980). Unfortunately, it is not clear where the necessary information about lexical preferences is to be found. Jenson and Binot (1987) describe the use of dictionary definitions for disambiguation, but dictionaries are typically rather uneven in their coverage. In the Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner study (1990), the judgment of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for the cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was available. Thus, we are posed with the problem of how we can get a good list of lexical preferences.","Our proposal is to use co-occurrence of verbs and nouns with prepositions in a large body of text as an indicator of lexical preference. Thus, for example, the preposition"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["occurs frequently in the context"]},{"title":"send NP_,","paragraphs":["that is, after the object of the verb"]},{"title":"send.","paragraphs":["This is evidence of a lexical association of the verb"]},{"title":"send","paragraphs":["with"]},{"title":"to.","paragraphs":["Similarly,"]},{"title":"from","paragraphs":["occurs frequently in the context"]},{"title":"withdrawal_,","paragraphs":["and this is evidence of a lexical association of the noun"]},{"title":"withdrawal","paragraphs":["with the preposition"]},{"title":"from.","paragraphs":["This kind of association is a symmetric notion: it provides no indication of whether the preposition is selecting the verbal or nominal head, or vice versa. We will treat the association as a property of the pair of words. It is a separate issue, which we will not be concerned with in the initial part of this paper, to assign the association to a particular linguistic licens-ing relation. The suggestion that we want to explore is that the association revealed by textual distribution--whether its source is a complementation relation, a modification relation, or something else--gives us information needed to resolve prepositional attachment in the majority of cases. 2. Discovering Lexical Association in Text A 13 million-word sample of Associated Press news stories from 1989 were automatically parsed by the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983 and in press), using Church's 104 Donald Hindle and Mats Rooth Structural Ambiguity and Lexical Relations Table 1 A sample of NP heads, preceding verbs, and following prepositions derived from the parsed corpus.","Verb Noun Prep Syntax a. change in -V b. regulation c. aim PRO-+ at d. remedy shortage of e. good in f. DART-PNP g. assuage citizen h. scarcity of i. item as j. wiper k. VING 1. VING part-of-speech analyzer as a preprocessor (Church 1988), a combination that we will call simply \"the parser.\" The parser produces a single partial syntactic description of a sentence. Consider Example 2, and its parsed representation in Example 3. The information in the tree representation is partial in the sense that some attachment information is missing: the nodes dominated by \"?\" have not been integrated into the syntactic representation. Note in particular that many PPs have not been attached. This is a symptom of the fact that the parser does not (in many cases) have the kind of lexical information that we have just claimed is required in resolving PP attachment. Example 2 The radical changes in export and customs regulations evidently are aimed at remedying an extreme shortage of consumer goods in the Soviet Union and assuaging citizens angry over the scarcity of such basic items as soap and windshield wipers. From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser, we extracted a table containing the heads of all noun phrases. For each noun phrase head, we recorded the following preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or not the parser had attached the preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the object of that verb. The entries in Table 1 are those generated from the text above. Each noun phrase in Example 3 is associated with an entry in the Noun column of the table. Usually this is simply the root of the head of the noun phrase: good is the root of the head of consumer goods. Noun phrases with no head, or where the head is not a common noun, are coded in a special way: DARTopNP represents a noun phrase beginning with a definite article and headed by a proper noun, and VING represents a gerundive noun phrase. PRO-+ represents the empty category which, in the syntactic theory underlying the parser, is assumed to be the object of the passive verb aimed. In cases where a prepositional phrase follows the noun phrase, the head preposition appears in the Prep column; attached and unattached prepositional phrases generate the same kinds of entries. If the noun phrase is an object, the root of the governing verb appears in the Verb column: aim is the root of aimed, the verb governing the empty 105 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 Example 3","I I NP AUX VP DART NBAR PP ADV TNS VPRES VPPRT NP"]},{"title":",v_ 7 , , , ,","paragraphs":["The evidently are aimed pro+","ADJ NPL PREP NP","I 1 I I","radical changes in NBAR","I","I I","N NPL","I I ]regulations N CONJ NPL I I I export and customs ? ? ?

We want to use the verb-noun-preposition table to derive a table of bigrams counts, where a bigram is a pair consisting of a noun or verb and an associated preposition (or no preposition). To do this we need to try to assign each preposition that occurs either to the noun or to the verb that it occurs with. In some cases it is fairly certain whether the preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, this is far less certain. Our approach is to assign the clear cases first, then to use these to decide the unclear cases that can be decided, and finally to divide the data in the remaining unresolved cases between the two hypotheses (verb and noun attachment).

Ambiguous Attach 1--Using the table of attachments computed so far, if the LA-score for the ambiguity (a score that compares the probability of noun versus verb attachment, as described below) is greater than 2.0 or less than -2.0, then assign the preposition according to the LA-score.

The current procedure has several advantages. Unlike the t-test used previously, it is sensitive to the magnitude of the difference between the two probabilities, not to our confidence in our ability to estimate those probabilities accurately.

We know of course that other information has a bearing on the attachment decision. For example, we have observed that if the noun phrase object includes a superlative adjective as a premodifier, then noun attachment is certain (for a small sample of 16 cases). We could easily take this into account by setting the prior odds ratio to heavily favor noun attachment: let's suppose that if there is a superlative in the object noun phrase, then noun attachment is say 1000 times more probable than verb attachment; otherwise, they are equally probable. Then following Mosteller and Wallace (1964), we assume that Final attachment odds = log 2(initial odds) + LA.

Testing Attachment To evaluate the performance of the procedure, 1000 test sentences in which the parser identified an ambiguous verb-noun-preposition triple were randomly selected from AP news stories. These sentences were selected from stories included in the 13 million-word sample, but the particular sentences were excluded from the calculation of lexical associations. The two authors first guessed attachments on the verb-noun-preposition triples, making a judgment on the basis of the three headwords alone. The judges were required to make a choice in each instance. This task is in essence the one that we will give the computer--to judge the attachment without any more information than the preposition and the heads of the two possible attachment sites.","This initial step provides a rough indication of what we might expect to be achievable based on the information our procedure is using. We also wanted a standard of correctness for the test sentences. We again judged the attachment for the 1000 triples, 111 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 this time using the full-sentence context, first grading the test sentences separately, and then discussing examples on which there was disagreement. Disambiguating the test sample turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task. While many decisions were straightforward, more than 10% of the sentences seemed problematic to at least one author. There are several kinds of constructions where the attachment decision is not clear theoretically. These include idioms as in Examples 8 and 9, light verb constructions (Example 10), and small clauses (Example 11)."]},{"title":"Example 8","paragraphs":["But over time, misery has given way to mending."]},{"title":"Example 9","paragraphs":["The meeting will take place in Quantico."]},{"title":"Example 10","paragraphs":["Bush has said he would not make cuts in Social Security."]},{"title":"Example 11","paragraphs":["Sides said Francke kept a .38-caliber revolver in his car's glove compartment.

In the situation described by Example 12a, the bar and the described event or events are presumably in the same location, and so there is no semantic reason to decide on one attachment.

The idiom, light verb, and small clause constructions represent cases where the simple distinction between noun attachment and verb attachment perhaps does not make sense, or is very theory-dependent.

If it is often difficult to decide what licenses a prepositional phrase, we need to develop language models that appropriately capture this.

Of these, 586 are noun attachments and 294 are verb attachments. 4.1 Evaluating Performance First, consider how the simple structural attachment preference schemas perform at predicting the outcome in our test set. Right Association predicts noun attachment and does better, since in our sample there are more noun attachments, but it still has an error rate of 33%. Minimal Attachment, interpreted as entailing verb attachment, has the complementary error rate of 67%. Obviously, neither of these procedures is particularly impressive. 113 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 Table 2 Performance on the test sentences for two human judges and the lexical association procedure (LA).

The figures in the entry labeled \"combined precision\" indicate that the human judges had overall error rates of 12-15%. 6 The lexical association procedure is somewhat worse than the human judges, with an error rate of 20%, but this is an improvement over the structural strategies.","The table also gives results broken down according to N vs. V attachment.

The"]},{"title":"recall","paragraphs":["figures indicate the proportion of test items actually belonging to a given category that were assigned to that category: N precision is the fraction of actual N attachments that were identified as N attachments. The LA procedure recognized about 85% of the 586 actual noun attachment examples as noun attachments, and about 70% of the actual verb attachments as verb attachments.","If we restrict the lexical association procedure to choose attachment only in cases where the absolute value of the LA score is greater than 2.0 (an arbitrary threshold indicating that the probability of one attachment is four times greater than the other), we get attachment judgments on 621 of the 880 test sentences, with overall precision of about 89%. On these same examples, the judges also showed improvement, as evident in Table 3. 7 6 Combined precision is the proportion of assigned items that were correctly assigned. Combined recall is the proportion of all items that were correctly assigned. These differ if some items are left unassigned, as in Table 3. 7 The recall figures for the judges do not have the usual interpretation, since the judges did not have the option of passing on test items. The ratios given in parentheses indicate the proportion of items in the relevant category that were both correctly labeled by the judge and had a likelihood ratio score with absolute value greater than 2.0. Thus these figures are of interest only in relation to the recall figures for LA. 114 Donald Hindle and Mats Rooth Structural Ambiguity and Lexical Relations Table 3 Performance for the LA procedure with a cutoff of 2 (] LA I> 2.0), and for the human judges on the sentences classified by LA.

In some applications, this information is useful. For instance, suppose that we wanted to incorporate the PP attachment procedure in a parser such as Fidditch. It might be preferable to achieve increased precision in PP attachment, in return for leaving some PPs unattached. For this purpose, a threshold could be used. Table 4 shows the combined precision and recall levels at various LA thresholds. It is clear that the LA score can be used effectively to trade off precision and recall, with a floor for the forced choice at about 80%.","A comparison of Table 3 with Table 2 indicates, however, that the decline in recall is severe for V attachment. And in general, the performance of the LA procedure is worse on V attachment examples than on N attachments, according to both precision and recall criteria. The next section is concerned with a classification of the test examples, which gives insight into why performance on V attachments is worse. 115 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 Table 5 Performance of the lexical attachment procedure by underlying relationship. relation count %correct argument noun 378 92.1 argument verb 104 84.6 adjunct noun 91 74.7 adjunct verb 101 64.4 light verb 19 57.9 small clause 13 76.9 idiom 19 63.2 locative indeterminacy 42 69.0 systematic indeterminacy 35 62.9 other 78 61.5 4.2 Underlying Relations Our model takes frequency of co-occurrence as evidence of an underlying relationship but makes no attempt to determine what sort of relationship is involved. It is interest-ing to see what kinds of relationships are responsible for the associations the model is identifying. To investigate this we categorized the 880 triples according to the nature of the relationship underlying the attachment. In many cases, the decision was difficult. The argument/adjunct distinction showed many gray cases between clear participants in an action and clear adjuncts, such as temporal modifiers. We made rough best guesses to partition the cases into the following categories: argument, adjunct, idiom, small clause, systematic locative indeterminacy, other systematic indeterminacy, and light verb. With this set of categories, 78 of the 880 cases remained so problematic that we assigned them to the category other.","Table 5 shows the proportion of items in a given category that were assigned the correct attachment by the lexical association procedure. Even granting the roughness of the categorization, some clear patterns emerge. Our approach is most successful at attaching arguments correctly. Notice that the 378 noun arguments constitute 65% of the total 586 noun attachments, while the 104 verb arguments amount to only 35% of the 294 verb attachments. Furthermore, performance with verb adjuncts is worse than with noun adjuncts. Thus much of the problem with V attachments noted in the previous section appears to be attributable to a problem with adjuncts, particularly verbal ones. Performance on verbal arguments remains worse than performance on nominal ones, however.","The remaining cases are all complex in some way, and the performance is poor on these classes, showing clearly the need for a more elaborated model of the syntactic structure that is being identified. 5. Comparison with a Dictionary The idea that lexical preference is a key factor in resolving structural ambiguity leads us naturally to ask whether existing dictionaries can provide information relevant to disambiguation. The Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary (Sinclair et al. 1987) is useful for a comparison with the AP sample for several reasons: it was compiled on the basis of a large text corpus, and thus may be less subject to idiosyncrasy 116 Donald Hindle and Mats Rooth Structural Ambiguity and Lexical Relations Table 6 Count of noun and verb associations for COBUILD and the AP sample. Source Total NOUN VERB COBUILD 4,233 1,942 2,291 AP sample 76,597 56,368 20,229 AP sample (f > 3) 20,005 14,968 5,037 AP sample 7,822 5,286 2,536 (f > 3 and I > 2.0) COBUILD O AP 2,703 1,415 1,288 COBUILD n AP 1,235 671 564 (f > 3 and I > 2.0) than other works, and it provides, in a separate field, a direct indication of prepositions typically associated with many nouns and verbs. From a machine-readable version of the dictionary, we extracted a list of 1,942 nouns associated with a particular preposition, and of 2,291 verbs associated with a particular preposition after an object noun phrase. 8","These 4,233 pairs are many fewer than the number of associations in the AP sample (see Table 6), even if we ignore the most infrequent pairs. Of the total 76,597 pairs, 20,005 have a frequency greater than 3, and 7,822 have a frequency that is greater than 3 and more than 4 times what one would predict on the basis of the unigram frequencies of the noun or verb and the preposition. 9","We can use the fixed lexicon of noun-preposition and verb-preposition associations derived from COBUILD to choose attachment in our test set. The COBUILD dictionary has information on 257 of the 880 test verb-noun-preposition triples. In 241 of those cases, there is information only on noun or only on verb association. In these cases, we can use the dictionary to choose the attachment according to the association indicated. In the remaining 16 cases, associations between the preposition and both the noun and the verb are recorded in the dictionary. For these, we select noun attachment, since it is the more probable outcome in general. For the remaining cases, we assume that the dictionary makes no decision. Table 7 gives the results obtained 8 We included particles in these associations, since these were also included in our corpus of bigrams. 9 The latter condition is spelled out as","f(w,p) > 4f(w) f(p) N N N ~ where U is ~w,J(w, p), the total number of token bigrams. It is equivalent to w and p having a mutual information (defined as I(w, p) = log 2 f@ f_~u ) greater than 2. This threshold of 2, of course, is an arbitrary cutoff. 117 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 Table 7 Performance on the test sentences for a fixed lexicon extracted from the COBUILD dictionary and a fixed lexicon extracted from the AP sample.

The precision figure is similar to that obtained by the lexical association procedure with a threshold of zero, but the recall is far lower: the dictionary provides insufficient information in most cases.","Like the lexicon derived from the COBUILD dictionary, the fixed lexicon of 7,822 corpus-derived associations derived from our bigram table as described above (that is, all bigrams where"]},{"title":"f(w~","paragraphs":["p) > 3 and"]},{"title":"I(w,","paragraphs":["p) > 2) contains categorical information about associations. Using it for disambiguation in the way the COBUILD dictionary was used gives the results indicated in Table 7. The precision is similar to that which was achieved with the LA procedure with a threshold of 2, although the recall is lower. This suggests that while overall coverage of association pairs is important, the information about the relative strengths of associations contributing to the LA score is also significant.","It must be noted that the dictionary information we derived from COBUILD was composed for people to use in printed form. It seems likely that associations were left out because they did not serve this purpose in one way or another. For instance, listing many infrequent or semantically predictable associations might be confusing. Furthermore, our procedure undoubtedly gained advantage from the fact that the test items are drawn from the same body of text as the training corpus. Nevertheless, the results of this comparison suggest that for the purpose of this paper, a partially parsed corpus is a better source of information than a dictionary. This conclusion should not be overstated, however. Table 6 showed that most of the associations in each lexicon are not found in the others. Table 8 is a sample of a verb-preposition association dictionary obtained by merging information from the AP sample and from COBUILD, illustrating both the common ground and the differences between the two lexicons. Each source of information provides intuitively important associations that are missing from the other. 6. Discussion In our judgment, the results of the lexical association procedure are good enough to make it useful for some purposes, in particular for inclusion in a parser such as Fidditch. The fact that the LA score provides a measure of confidence increases this usefulness, since in some applications (such as exploratory linguistic analysis of text 118 Donald Hindle and Mats Rooth Structural Ambiguity and Lexical Relations Table 8 Verb--(NP)-Preposition associations in the COBUILD dictionary and in the AP sample (with"]},{"title":"f(v~","paragraphs":["p) > 3 and"]},{"title":"I(v~ p) >","paragraphs":["2.0).

The performance of the human judges with access just to the verb-noun-preposition triple is a standard of what is possible based on this information, and the lexical association procedure falls somewhat short of this standard. The analysis of underlying relations indicated some particular areas in which the procedure did not do well, and where there is therefore room for improvemenf. In particular, performance on adjuncts was poor. A number of classes of adjuncts, such as temporal ones, are fairly easy to identify once information about the object of the preposition is taken into account. Beginning with such an identification step (which could be conceived of as adding a feature such as [+temporal] to individual prepositions, or replacing individual token prepositions with an abstract temporal preposition) might yield a lexical association procedure that would do better with adjuncts. But it is also possible that a procedure that evaluates associations with individual nouns and verbs is simply inappropriate for adjuncts. This is an area for further investigation.","This experiment was deliberately limited to one kind of attachment ambiguity. However, we expect that the method will be extendable to other instances of PP attachment ambiguity, such as the ambiguity that arises when several prepositional phrases follow a subject NP, and to ambiguities involving other phrases, especially phrases such as infinitives that have syntactic markers analogous to a preposition. 119 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1","We began this paper by alluding to several approaches to PP attachment, specifically work assuming the construction of discourse models, approaches based on structural attachment preferences, and work indicating a dominant role for lexical preference. Our results tend to confirm the importance of lexical preference. However, we can draw no firm conclusions about the other approaches. Since our method yielded incorrect results on roughly 20% of the cases, its coverage is far from complete. This leaves a lot of work to be done, within both psycholinguistic and computational approaches. Furthermore, as we noted above, contemporary psycholinguistic work is concerned with modeling the time course of parsing. Our experiment gives no information about how lexical preference information is exploited at this level of detail, or the importance of such information compared with other factors such as structural .preferences at a given temporal stage of the human parsing process. However, the numerical estimates of lexical association we have obtained may be relevant to a psycholinguistic investigation of this issue.
