In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results.","This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.","However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.","This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text. 1. Introduction There has been a recent trend back towards the statistical analysis of text. This trend has resulted in a number of researchers doing good work in information retrieval and natural language processing in general. Unfortunately much of their work has been characterized by a cavalier approach to the statistical issues raised by the results.","The approaches taken by such researchers can be divided into three rough categories. . . Collect enormous volumes of text in order to make straightforward, statistically based measures work well. Do simple-minded statistical analysis on relatively small volumes of text and either 'correct empirically' for the error or ignore the issue. 3. Perform no statistical analysis whatsoever.","The first approach is the one taken by the IBM group researching statistical approaches to machine translation (Brown et al. 1989). They have collected nearly one * Computing Research Laboratory, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003-0001. © 1993 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 billion words of English text from such diverse sources as internal memos, technical manuals, and romance novels, and have aligned most of the electronically available portion of the record of debate in the Canadian parliament (Hansards). Their efforts have been Augean, and they have been well rewarded by interesting results. The statistical significance of most of their work is above reproach, but the required volumes of text are simply impractical in many settings.","The second approach is typified by much of the work of Gale and Church (Gale and Church this issue, and in press; Church et al. 1989). Many of the results from their work are entirely usable, and the measures they use work well for the examples given in their papers. In general, though, their methods lead to problems. For example, mutual information estimates based directly on counts are subject to overestimation when the counts involved are small, and z-scores substantially overestimate the significance of rare events.","The third approach is typified by virtually all of the information-retrieval literature. Even recent and very innovative work such as that using Latent Semantic Indexing (Dumais et al. 1988) and Pathfinder Networks (Schvaneveldt 1990) has not addressed the statistical reliability of the internal processing. They do, however, use good statistical methods to analyze the overall effectiveness of their approach.","Even such well-accepted techniques as inverse document frequency weighting of terms in text retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983) is generally only justified on very sketchy grounds.","The goal of this paper is to present a practical measure that is motivated by statistical considerations and that can be used in a number of settings. This measure works reasonably well with both large and small text samples and allows direct comparison of the significance of rare and common phenomena. This comparison is possible because the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more traditional measures.","In the following, some sections are composed largely of background material or mathematical details and can probably be skipped by the reader familiar with statistics or by the reader in a hurry. The sections that should not be skipped are marked with **, those with substantial background with *, and detailed derivations are unmarked. This 'good parts' convention should make this paper more useful to the implementer or reader only wishing to skim the paper. 2. The Assumption of Normality * The assumption that simple functions of the random variables being sampled are distributed normally or approximately normally underlies many common statistical tests. This particularly includes Pearson's X 2 test and z-score tests. This assumption is absolutely valid in many cases. Due to the simplification of the methods involved, it is entirely justifiable even in marginal cases.","When comparing the rates of occurrence of rare events, the assumptions on which these tests are based break down because texts are composed largely of such rare events. For example, simple word counts made on a moderate-sized corpus show that words that have a frequency of less than one in 50,000 words make up about 20-30% of typical English language news-wire reports. This 'rare' quarter of English includes many of the content-bearing words and nearly all the technical jargon. As an illustration, the following is a random selection of approximately 0.2% of the words found at least once but fewer than five times in a sample of a half million words of Reuters' reports. 62 Ted Dunning Accurate Methods for the Statistics abandonment aerobics alternating altitude amateur appearance assertion barrack biased bookies broadcaster cadres charging clause collating compile confirming contemptuously corridors crushed deadly demented detailing landscape seldom directorship lobbyists sheet dispatched malfeasances simplified dogfight meat snort duds miners specify eluded monsoon staffing enigmatic napalm substitute euphemism northeast surreptitious experiences oppressive tall fares overburdened terraced finals parakeets tipping foiling penetrate transform gangsters poi turbid guide praised understatement headache prised unprofitable hobbled protector vagaries identities query villas inappropriate redoubtable watchful inflamed remark winter instilling resignations intruded ruin unction scant The only word in this list that is in the least obscure is"]},{"title":"poi","paragraphs":["(a native Hawaiian dish made from taro root). If we were to sample 50,000 words instead of the half million used to create the list above, then the expected number of occurrences of any of the words in this list would be less than one hall well below the point where commonly used tests should be used.","If such ordinary words are 'rare,' any statistical work with texts must deal with the reality of rare events. It is interesting that while most of the words in running text are common ones, most of the words in the total vocabulary are rare.","Unfortunately, the foundational assumption of most common statistical analyses used in computational linguistics is that the events being analyzed are relatively common. For a sample of 50,000 words from the Reuters' corpus mentioned previously, none of the words in the table above is common enough to expect such analyses to work well. 3. The Tradition of Chi-Squared Tests * In text analysis, the statistically based measures that have been used have usually been based on test statistics that are useful because, given certain assumptions, they have a known distribution. This distribution is most commonly either the normal or X 2 distribution. These measures are very useful and can be used to accurately assess significance in a number of different settings. They are based, however, on several assumptions that do not hold for most textual analyses.","The details of how and why the assumptions behind these measures do not hold is of interest primarily to the statistician, but the result is of interest to the statistical consumer (in our case, somebody interested in counting words). More applicable techniques are important in textual analysis. The next section describes one such technique; implementation of this technique is described in later sections. 63 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1"]},{"title":"0.180 0.160 0.140 0.120 0.100 0.080 0.060 0.040 0.02O 0.00","paragraphs":["J I"]},{"title":"0.00 10.00 20.00 30.00 Figure 1","paragraphs":["Normal and binomial distributions. 4. Binomial Distributions for Text Analysis ** Binomial distributions arise commonly in statistical analysis when the data to be analyzed are derived by counting the number of positive outcomes of repeated identical and independent experiments. Flipping a coin is the prototypical experiment of this sort.","The task of counting words can be cast into the form of a repeated sequence of such binary trials comparing each word in a text with the word being counted. These comparisons can be viewed as a sequence of binary experiments similar to coin flipping. In text, each comparison is clearly not independent of all others, but the dependency falls off rapidly with distance. Another assumption that works relatively well in practice is that the probability of seeing a particular word does not vary. Of course, this is not really true, since changes in topic may cause this frequency to vary. Indeed it is the mild failure of this assumption that makes shallow information retrieval techniques possible.","To the extent that these assumptions of independence and stationarity are valid, we can switch to an abstract discourse concerning Bernoulli trials instead of words in text, and a number of standard results can be used. A Bernoulli trial is the statistical idealization of a coin flip in which there is a fixed probability of a successful outcome that does not vary from flip to flip.","In particular, if the actual probability that the next word matches a prototype is p, then the number of matches generated in the next n words is a random variable (K) with binomial distribution"]},{"title":"P(K = k) = pk(1-- p)n-k ( n","paragraphs":["whose mean is"]},{"title":"np","paragraphs":["and whose variance is"]},{"title":"np(1 -p).","paragraphs":["If"]},{"title":"np(1-p)","paragraphs":["> 5, then the distribution of this variable will be approximately normal, and as"]},{"title":"np(1 - p)","paragraphs":["increases beyond that point, the distribution becomes more and more like a normal distribution.

Larger values of n with np held constant give curves that are not visibly different from those shown. For these cases, np ~ np(1 - p).","This agreement between the binomial and normal distributions is exactly what makes test statistics based on assumptions of normality so useful in the analysis of experiments based on counting. In the case of the binomial distribution, normality assumptions are generally considered to hold well enough when np(1 - p) > 5.","The situation is different when np(1 -p) is less than 5, and is dramatically different when np(1 -p) is less than 1. First, it makes much less sense to approximate a discrete distribution such as the binomial with a continuous distribution such as the normal. Second, the probabilities computed using the normal approximation are less and less accurate.","Table 1 shows the probability that one or more matches are found in 100 words of text as computed using the binomial and normal distributions for np = 0.001, np = 0.01, np = 0.1, and np = 1 where n = 100. Most words are sufficiently rare so that even for samples of text where n is as large as several thousand, np will be at the bottom of this range. Short phrases are so numerous that np << 1 for almost all phrases even when n is as large as several million.","Table 1 shows that for rare events, the normal distribution does not even approximate the binomial distribution. In fact, for np -- 0.1 and n = 100, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance of one or more occurrences by a factor of 40, while for np = 0.01, using the normal distribution overestimates the significance by about 4 x 1020. When n increases beyond 100, the numbers in the table do not change significantly.","If this overestimation were constant, then the estimates using normal distributions could be corrected and would still be useful, but the fact that the errors are not constant means that methods dependent on the normal approximation should not be used to analyze Bernoulli trials where the probability of positive outcome is very small. Yet, in many real analyses of text, comparing cases where np -- 0.001 with cases where np > 1 is a common problem. 5. Likelihood Ratio Tests * There is another class of tests that do not depend so critically on assumptions of normality. Instead they use the asymptotic distribution of the generalized likelihood ratio. For text analysis and similar problems, the use of likelihood ratios leads to very much improved statistical results. The practical effect of this improvement is that statistical textual analysis can be done effectively with very much smaller volumes of text than is necessary for conventional tests based on assumed normal distributions, 65 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 and it allows comparisons to be made between the significance of the occurrences of both rare and common phenomenon. 5.1 Parameter Spaces and Likelihood Functions Likelihood ratio tests are based on the idea that statistical hypotheses can be said to specify subspaces of the space described by the unknown parameters of the statistical model being used. These tests assume that the model is known, but that the parameters of the model are unknown. Such a test is called parametric. Other tests are available that make no assumptions about the underlying model at all; they are called distribution-free. Only one particular parametric test is described here. More information on parametric and distribution-free tests is available in Bradley (1968) and Mood, Graybill, and Boes (1974).","The probability that a given experimental outcome described by"]},{"title":"kl,..., kn","paragraphs":["will be observed for a given model described by a number of parameters Pl, p2,.., is called the likelihood function for the model and is written as"]},{"title":"H(pl,p2,...;kl,...,km)","paragraphs":["where all arguments of H left of the semicolon are model parameters, and all arguments right of the semicolon are observed values.

That is,","A = max~f~° H(a;; k) max~en H(a;; k) where f~ is the entire parameter space and f~0 is the particular hypothesis being tested.","The particularly important feature of likelihood ratios is that the quantity -2 log )~ is asymptotically X 2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimension between f~ and f~0.

The rougher curve was computed by a numerical experiment in which p -- 0.01, nl = 100, and n2 = 10000, which corresponds to the situation in Figure 3. The close agreement shows that the likelihood ratio measure produces accurate results over six decades of significance even in the range where the normal X 2 measure diverges radically from the ideal. 68 Ted Dunning Accurate Methods for the Statistics 200.00 150.00 2 100.00 % 50.00 0.00 ° o c~g~"]},{"title":"J","paragraphs":["000 0 0 ° O"]},{"title":"/-","paragraphs":["0.00 Figure 2 Log-likelihood versus Pearson X 2","100.00 -2 log 200.00 500.00 450.00 400.00 350.00 2 300.00 % 250.00 200.00 150.00 100.00 50.00 0.00 0 0","O 0 0","0","0","0","0 0 0","0 0 0","o oo °"]},{"title":"I OoO:","paragraphs":["0.00 2O.O0 -2 log Figure 3 Log-likelihood versus Pearson X 2 40.00 6.

Conclusions Statistics based on the assumption of normal distribution are invalid in most cases of statistical text analysis unless either enormous corpora are used, or the analysis is restricted to only the very most common words (that is, the ones least likely to be of interest). This fact is typically ignored in much of the work in this field. Using such invalid methods may seriously overestimate the significance of relatively rare events. Parametric statistical analysis based on the binomial or multinomial distribution extends the applicability of statistical methods to much smaller texts than models using normal distributions and shows good promise in early applications of the method.","Further work is needed to develop software tools to allow the straightforward analysis of texts using these methods. Some of these tools have been developed and will be distributed by the Consortium for Lexical Research. For further information on this software, contact the author or the Consortium via e-mail at ted@nmsu.edu or lexical@nmsu.edu.","In addition, there are a wide variety of distribution free methods that may avoid even the assumption that text can be modeled by multinomial distributions. Measures based on Fischer's exact method may prove even more satisfactory than the likelihood ratio measures described in this paper. Also, using the Poisson distribution instead of the multinomial as the limiting distribution for the distribution of counts may provide some benefits. All of these possibilities should be tested. 8.
