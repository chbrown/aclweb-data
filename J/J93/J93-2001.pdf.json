It further argues that, due to the importance and systematicity of the linguistic differences among registers, diversified corpora representing a broad range of register variation are required as the basis for general language studies. First, the extent of cross-register differences are illustrated from consideration of individual grammatical and lexical features; these register differences are also important for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammatically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers. Then, corpus-based multidimensional analyses of English are summarized, showing that linguistic features from several structural levels function together as underlying dimensions of variation, with each dimension defining a different set of linguistic relations among registers. Finally, the paper discusses how such analyses, based on register-diversified corpora, can be used to address two current issues in computational linguistics: the automatic classification of texts into register categories and cross-linguistic comparisons of register variation. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["As the use of computer-based text corpora has become increasingly important for research in natural language processing, lexicography, and descriptive linguistics, issues relating to corpus design have also assumed central importance. Two main considerations are important here: 1) the size of the corpus (including the length and number of text samples), and 2) the range of text categories (or"]},{"title":"registers)","paragraphs":["that samples are selected from. 1 Within social science, these considerations are associated with the two main kinds of error that can threaten 'external validity' (the extent to which it is possible to generalize from a sample to a larger target population): 'random error' and 'bias error.'

Box 6032, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-6032; biber@nauvax.bitnet.","1 Corpus designs can differ along several other parameters, including: 1. bounded/static versus unbounded/dynamic; 2. richly encoded versus minimally encoded (e.g., grammatical tagging, phonological/prosodic","encoding, tagging of social characteristics (of participants) and situational characteristics); 3. complete texts versus samples from texts; 4. selection of texts: convenience versus purposeful versus random within strata versus proportional","random. © 1993 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 different from the target population it is intended to represent. Both kinds of error must be minimized to achieve a representative corpus.","Recent debates concerning the design of general purpose corpora have often divided into two opposing camps emphasizing one or the other source of error: those advocating large corpora versus those advocating \"balanced\" corpora (i.e., including a wide range of registers). For example, the ACL Data Collection Initiative (DCI) and the Linguistic Data Consortium are focusing on the rapid collection and dissemina-tion of very large corpora, with relatively little attention to the range of registers; older corpora, such as the Brown Corpus and LOB Corpus, are small by present-day standards but are explicitly structured to 'represent a wide range of styles and varieties' (Francis and Ku~era 1964 [cf. Johansson, Leech, and Goodluck 1978]). Projects such as the COBUILD Corpus, Longman/Lancaster Corpus, and British National Corpus (BNC) combine both emphases to varying extents.","Although all of these corpora could be considered \"representative\" of at least some varieties of English, it is important to address the question of whether the varieties represented match the intended uses of a corpus. For example, studies of a single sublanguage are legitimately based on corpora representing only that variety, such as journal articles on lipoprotein kinetics (Sager 1986), Navy telegraphic messages (Fitzpatrick et al. 1986), weather reports (Lehrberger 1982), and aviation maintenance manuals (Kittredge 1982).","One of the main issues addressed here, though, is whether general language studies must be based on a corpus that is register-diversified as well as large. Some proponents of very large corpora have suggested that size can compensate for a lack of diversity--that if a corpus is large enough, it will represent the range of linguistic patterns in a language, even though it represents only a restricted range of registers. Given this assumption, linguistic analyses of any very large corpus could be generalized to the entire language.","In contrast, I argue here that analyses must be based on a diversified corpus representing a wide range of registers in order to be appropriately generalized to the language as a whole, as in a dictionary or grammar of English, or a general purpose tagging program for English. 2 In fact, global generalizations are often not accurate at all, because there is no adequate overall linguistic characterization of the entire language; rather, there are marked linguistic differences across registers (or sublanguages; cf. Kittredge 1982). Thus a complete description of the language often entails a composite analysis of features as they function in various registers. Such analyses must be based on corpora representing the range of registers.","In the following discussion, I first briefly illustrate the extent of cross-register differences from consideration of individual grammatical and lexical features. Section 2.1 focuses on the marked differences in the distribution of dependent clauses across registers. This section then shows that register differences are also important for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammatically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers. Section 2.2 focuses on adjectives marking 'certainty' to illustrate how lexical patterns are also distributed differently across registers.","Section 3 makes this point more strongly by describing a multidimensional analysis of numerous linguistic features in a register-diversified corpus of English. The analysis shows that linguistic features from all levels function together as underly-2 In other papers (Biber 1990, in press, a), I have explored issues of representativeness relating to corpus size. 220 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies Table 1 Mean frequencies of three dependent clause types (per 1,000 words) in four registers (from Biber 1988, Appendix III).","Relative Causative Adverbial that Complement Register Clauses Subordinate Clauses Clauses Press reports 4.6 .5 3.4 Official documents 8.6 .1 1.6 Conversations 2.9 3.5 4.1 Prepared speeches 7.9 1.6 7.6 ing dimensions of variation, and that there are systematic and important linguistic differences among registers with respect to these dimensions. The extent of those differences clearly shows that linguistic analyses based on a restricted corpus cannot be generalized to the language as a whole.","Section 4, then, shows how multidimensional analyses of register variation can be used to address additional computational issues. First, Section 4.1 discusses the application of the multidimensional model of English to predict the register category of texts automatically with a high degree of accuracy. The predictive power of the model at three levels of abstraction is tested. In Section 4.2, then, I turn to cross-linguistic patterns of register variation, illustrating how multidimensional analyses of register-diversified corpora in English, Nukulaelae Tuvaluan, Korean, and Somali enable register comparisons of a kind not otherwise possible, providing the background for more detailed investigations of particular subregisters or sublanguages. 2. Particular Grammatical and Lexical Features The analyses in this section illustrate the fact that there are systematic and important grammatical and lexical differences among the registers of English; Section 2.1 treats grammatical features and Section 2.2 discusses lexical features. 2.1 Grammatical Issues 2.1.1 Descriptive Analyses. One of the main uses of general text corpora has been to provide grammatical descriptions of particular linguistic features, such as nominal premodification structures, relative clauses, verb and particle combinations, and clefts and pseudoclefts (see the numerous entries in the bibliography of corpus-based studies compiled by Altenberg [1991]). Two findings repeatedly come out of this literature: first, individual linguistic features are distributed differently across registers, and second, the same (or similar) linguistic features can have different functions in different registers.","The linguistic description of dependent clauses in English illustrates these patterns. Although these constructions are often treated as a single coherent system, the various types of structural dependency actually have quite different distributions and functions in English (cf. Biber 1988, 1992). For example, Table 1 shows that relative clauses are quite frequent in official documents and prepared speeches but quite rare in conversation. In contrast, causative adverbial subordination occurs most frequently in conversation and is quite rare in official documents and press reports. Finally, that complement clauses occur most frequently in prepared speeches, and with moderate frequencies in conversations and press reports, but they are rare in official documents. There is further variation within these structural categories. For example, most rel-221 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 ative clauses in official documents have WH rather than"]},{"title":"that","paragraphs":["relative pronouns (7.7 out of 8.6 total), while the two types are evenly split in conversation (1.6 WH relative clauses versus 1.3"]},{"title":"that","paragraphs":["relatives).

The analysis further identifies a fundamental distinction between the discourse complexities of written and spoken registers: written registers exhibit many complexity profiles, differing widely in both the extent and the kinds of complexity, while spoken registers manifest a single major pattern differing only in extent. 2.1.2"]},{"title":"Probabilistic Tagging and Parsing.","paragraphs":["The differing distributions illustrated in Section 2.1.1 have important implications for probabihstic tagging and parsing techniques, which depend on accurate estimates of the relative likelihood of grammatical categories in particular contexts. Two kinds of probabilistic information are commonly used in part-of-speech taggers: 1) for ambiguous lexical items, the relative probability of each grammatical category (e.g.,"]},{"title":"abstract","paragraphs":["as a noun, adjective, and verb); and 2) for groups of ambiguous words, the relative probability of various tag sequences (e.g., the likelihood of a noun being followed by a verb, adjective, or another noun).","To investigate whether grammatically ambiguous words have different distributions across registers, I compiled two separate on-line dictionaries from the LOB Corpus: one based on the expository registers, and one from the fiction registers. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics from a comparison of these two dictionaries. The first observation is that many words occurred in only one of the dictionaries. This is not surprising in the case of exposition, since there were over twice as many lexical entries in the exposition dictionary. However, it is more surprising that there were over 6000 words that occurred only in fiction. These included many common words, such as"]},{"title":"cheek, kissed, grandpa, sofa, wallet, briefcase, intently,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"impatiently.","paragraphs":["A comparison of the probabilities of words occurring in both dictionaries is even more revealing.

The probability differences here are less large than in the other two groups, but they are still important given the central grammatical role that these items serve. The first three of these words (until, before, as) are considerably more likely to occur as a subordinator in fiction than in exposition, while they are more likely to occur as a preposition in exposition.

Although the differences are not as striking, several of them are large enough to be relevant for automatic tagging. For example, prepositions and nouns are considerably more likely to follow singular nouns in exposition than in fiction. Similarly, nouns are more likely to follow adjectives in exposition than in fiction. Passive verbs are considerably more likely to follow the copula be in exposition than in fiction, while progressive verb forms are more likely to follow be in fiction. Other differences are not great, but they are consistent across tag sequences.","Finally, comparisons of this type are also important for syntactic ambiguities, which are the bane of probabilistic parsers.

In fiction, on the other hand, there is a much greater likelihood that a prepositional phrase will be attached as a verbal modifier (78.7%) rather than a nominal modifier (21.3%).","For any automated language processing that depends on probabilistic techniques, whether part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, the input probabilities are crucial. The analyses in this section suggest that it might be advantageous to store separate probabilities for different major registers, rather than using a single set of probabilities for a general-purpose tool. Minimally, these analyses show that input probabilities must be based on the distribution of forms in a diversified corpus representing the major register distinctions; probabilities derived from a single register are likely to produce skewed results when applied to texts from markedly different registers. 2.2 Lexicographic Issues Text corpora have proven to be invaluable resources for research on word use and meaning, as in Sinclair's pioneering work on the COBUILD Dictionary (Sinclair 1987). In fact, corpus-based research shows that our intuitions about lexical patterns are often incorrect (Sinclair 1991; 112 ff). However, similar to the patterns for grammatical structures, for many words there is no general pattern of use that holds across the whole language; rather, different word senses and collocational patterns are strongly preferred in different registers.","This point can be illustrated from an analysis of certainty adjectives in English (exploring in more detail some of the findings of Biber and Finegan 1989). Table 5 presents overall frequencies for three certainty adjectives--certain, sure, and de/inite-- in two text corpora: the Longman/Lancaster Corpus, including written texts from ten 226 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies Table 6 Comparison of frequencies of collocations for certainty adjectives in two text categories of the Longman/Lancaster English Language Corpus: Social Science and Fiction.

The overall pattern shows certain and sure occurring with approximately the same frequency in the written (Longman/Lancaster) corpus. In the spoken (London/Lund) corpus, sure occurs more frequently than certain, and both words are more common than in the written corpus. The word definite is relatively rare in both corpora, although it is slightly more common in the written corpus.","Further, there are striking differences across written registers in the use of these words. In social science, certain is quite common, sure is relatively rare, and definite is common relative to its frequency in the whole written corpus. Fiction shows the opposite pattern: certain is relatively rare, sure is relatively common, and definite is quite rare. These patterns alone show that the semantic domain of certainty in English could not be adequately described without considering the patterns in complementary registers.","Table 6 shows, however, that the actual patterns of use are even more complex. This table presents normalized frequencies (per 1 million words of text) of the major collocational patterns for certain and sure, comparing the distributions in social science and fiction. A single • is used to mark collocations that are much more common in social science, while ~ is used to mark collocations that are much more common 227 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 in fiction. The collocational patterns (confirmed by concordance listings) identify two surprising facts about these words: 1) certain is commonly used to mark uncertainty rather than certainty; and 2) certainty is rarely expressed in social science at all. Thus, the most common collocations for certain in social science reflect a kind of vagueness, marking a referent as possibly being known (by someone) but not specified in the text (e.g., a certain kind of..., in certain cases .... there are certain indications that... ). These collocations are relatively rare in fiction. In contrast, those collocational patterns for certain that directly state that someone or something is certain--he/she/they/you/it + BE + certain and I/we + BE + certain--are extremely rare in social science but relatively common in fiction.","Unlike the word certain, the term sure is most typically used to express certainty. This is apparently the reason why the overall frequency of sure is so low in social science. The difference between certain and sure, and between social science and fiction, is perhaps most striking for the collocations of pronoun + BE + certain~sure. These collocations are very common for sure in fiction; moderately common for certain in fiction; but quite rare for either sure or certain in social science.","These examples illustrate the point that a corpus restricted to only one register would enable at best a partial analysis of lexical use; and if the results were generalized to the entire language, they would be incorrect. Thus, the major registers of English must be treated on their own terms in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of either grammatical structures or lexical patterns of use. 3. Multidimensional Differences among Registers in English The inherent nature of register variation in English is illustrated even more clearly in a series of studies using the multidimensional framework (e.g., Biber 1988, 1989, 1992). These studies have shown that there are systematic patterns of variation among registers; that these patterns can be analyzed in terms of underlying dimensions of variation; and that it is necessary to recognize the existence of a multidimensional space in order to capture the overall relations among registers.","Each dimension comprises a set of linguistic features that co-occur frequently in texts. The dimensions are identified from a quantitative analysis of the distribution of 67 linguistic features in the texts of the LOB and London-Lund Corpora. There is space here for only a brief methodological overview of this approach; interested readers are referred to Biber (1988; especially Chapters 4 and 5) for a more detailed presentation.","First, texts were automatically tagged for linguistic features representing several major grammatical and functional characteristics: tense and aspect markers, place and time adverbials, pronouns and pro-verbs, nominal forms, prepositional phrases, adjectives, adverbs, lexical specificity, lexical classes (e.g., hedges, emphatics), modals, specialized verb classes, reduced forms and discontinuous structures, passives, stative forms, dependent clauses, coordination, and questions. All texts were post-edited by hand to correct mis-tags.","The frequency of each linguistic feature in each text was counted, and all counts were normalized to their occurrence per 1000 words of text. Then a factor analysis was run to identify the major co-occurrence patterns among the features. (Factor analysis is a statistical procedure that identifies groupings of linguistic features that co-occur frequently in texts.) So that texts and registers could be compared with respect to the dimensions, dimension scores were computed for each text by summing the major linguistic features grouped on each dimension. Finally, the dimensions were interpreted functionally based on the assumption that linguistic features co-occur in texts because 228 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies they share underlying communicative functions. Similarly, the patterns of variation among registers were interpreted from both linguistic and functional perspectives.","Five major dimensions are identified and interpreted in Biber (1988; especially Chapters 6 and 7). 3 Each comprises a distinct set of co-occurring linguistic features; each defines a different set of similarities and differences among spoken and written registers; and each has distinct functional underpinnings. The five dimensions are interpretively labeled: 1. Informational versus Involved Production 4 2. Narrative versus Nonnarrative Concerns 3. Elaborated versus Situation-Dependent Reference 4. Overt Expression of Persuasion 5. Abstract versus Nonabstract Style","The primary communicative functions, major co-occurring features, and characteristic registers associated with each dimension are summarized in Table 7. As this table shows, registers differ systematically along each of these dimensions, relating to functional considerations such as interactiveness, involvement, purpose, and production circumstances, all of which have marked correlates in linguistic structure. 5 To illustrate these differences more concretely, Figure 1 presents the differences among nine spoken and written registers within the two-dimensional space defined by Dimension 1: 'Involved versus Informational Production' and Dimension 3: 'Elaborated versus Situation-Dependent Reference.'","The register characterizations on Figure 1 reflect different relative frequencies of the linguistic features summarized in Table 7. For example, academic prose and newspaper reportage have the largest positive scores on Dimension 1, reflecting very frequent occurrences of nouns, adjectives, prepositional phrases, long words, etc. (the 'informational' features grouped on Dimension 1), together with markedly infrequent occurrences of 1st and 2nd person pronouns, questions, reductions, etc. (the 'involved' features on Dimension 1). On Dimension 3, academic prose and professional letters have the largest positive scores, reflecting very frequent occurrences of WH relative clause constructions (the features associated with 'elaborated reference'), together with markedly infrequent occurrences of time and place adverbials (the 'situation-dependent' features). At the other extreme, conversations have the largest negative score on Dimension 1, reflecting very frequent occurrence of the 'involved' features grouped on that dimension (lst and 2nd person pronouns, questions, etc.) together with markedly few occurrences of the 'informational' features (nouns, adjectives, etc.). Conversations also have a quite large negative score on Dimension 3, although broadcasts have the largest negative score, reflecting very frequent occurrences of time and place adverbials together with markedly few WH relative clauses, etc. 3 The factorial structure was derived from a common factor analysis with a Promax rotation. A seven-factor solution was extracted as the most adequate, although only the first five factors are presented here. The first factor in the analysis accounts for 26.8% of the shared variance, while all seven factors together account for 51.9% of the shared variance. Further details are given in Biber (1988). 4 The polarity of Dimension 1 has been reversed to aid in the comparison to Dimensions 3 and 5. 5 See Biber (in press, b) for a comprehensive framework comparing registers with respect to their situational characteristics, such as the relations among participants, purposes, production circumstances, and typical topics. 229 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 INFORMATIONAL","l 15 +"]},{"title":"t","paragraphs":["10 +"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["5 +"]},{"title":"o !","paragraphs":["I 0 + E N S -5 + I i 0"]},{"title":"N I","paragraphs":["-i0 +"]},{"title":"h","paragraphs":["-15 +"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["-20 + I"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["-25 +"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["-30 +"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["-35 +","I","INVOLVED Newspaper reportage * Academic * prose Newspaper * editorials","Broadcasts Q","e Fiction","Professional letters * Personal * letters spontaneous * speeches Q Conversations","..... + ..... + ..... + ..... + ..... +--+--+ ..... + ..... + ..... + .... -9 -7 -5 -3 -i 0 1 3 5 7 SITUATED ELABORATED DIMENSION 3 Figure 1 Linguistic characterization of nine spoken and written registers with respect to Dimension 1 ('Informational versus Involved Production') and Dimension 3 ('Elaborated versus Situation-Dependent Reference'). 230 Douglas Biber Using Register-Diversified Corpora for General Language Studies Table 7 Summary of functions, linguistic features, and characteristic registers for the five major English dimensions identified in Biber (1988).

When all six dimensions are considered, these differences are even more notable. Table 8 further shows that a significant and important amount of variation among texts can be accounted for based on the register distinctions. It is important to emphasize here that the register categories were not considered when the dimensions were originally identified; rather, the dimensions represent the linguistic co-occurrence patterns across texts, regardless of their register category.

A corpus restricted to any one or two of these registers would clearly be excluding much of the English language, linguistically as well as situationally. 4. Further Applications of Corpus-Based Analyses of Register Variation The multidimensional model of register variation summarized in Section 3 can be used to address additional computational issues. In this section, I focus on two of these: the automated prediction of register category and cross-linguistic comparisons. 4.1 Automated Prediction of Registers One issue of current relevance within computational linguistics is the automated prediction of register category, as a preliminary step to work in information retrieval, machine translation, and other kinds of text processing. Because the model of register variation summarized in the last section is multidimensional, with each dimension comprising a different set of linguistic features and representing a different set of relations among registers, it is well suited to this research question.","One statistical procedure commonly used for classificatory purposes is"]},{"title":"discriminant analysis.","paragraphs":["This procedure computes the"]},{"title":"generalized squared distance","paragraphs":["between a text and each text category (or register), and the text is then automatically classified as belonging to the closest category. 8","To illustrate, Figure 2 plots the five-dimensional profiles of three target registers (academic prose, fiction, and newspaper reportage) together with an unclassified text 6 Because registers can be specified at many different levels of generality, there is no \"correct\" set of register distinctions for a language; rather, I have argued elsewhere that registers should be seen as semi-continuous (rather than discrete) constructs varying along multiple situational parameters (Biber, in press, b). Further, since registers are defined situationally rather than on a linguistic basis, they are not equally coherent in their linguistic characteristics. Some registers have quite focused norms and therefore show little internal linguistic variation (e.g., science fiction). Registers such as popular magazine articles, on the other hand, include a wide range of purposes, and thus show extensive linguistic differences among the texts within the register (cf. the investigations in Biber 1988, Chapter 8; Biber 1990). 7 The statistical procedure used to identify linguistically well-defined text types is called cluster analysis. This procedure identifies concentrations of texts such that the texts within each cluster, or text type, are maximally similar to one another in their linguistic characteristics, while the types are maximally distinct from one another. Biber (1989) identifies eight major text types in English, which are interpretively labeled: Intimate Interpersonal Interaction, Informational Interaction, \"Scientific\" Exposition, Learned Exposition, Imaginative Narrative, General Narrative Exposition, Situated Reportage, and Involved Persuasion. Biber (in press, c) compares the text type distinctions in English and Somali. 8 The SAS procedure PROC DISCRIM was used for the discriminant analyses in this section. 233 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 O O C .o C E .-- c~ 10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 -6 NX\" \","]},{"title":"///","paragraphs":["t","i","i","i","Di . 1 Dim. 2 Dim. 3 Dim. 4 Dim. 5","Dimension [ --~- Acaclemic Prose --m- Fiction x Newspaper Report ~ Unclassifed Text"]},{"title":"] Figure 2","paragraphs":["Five-dimensional distance profile of unclassified text to three target registers.

Generalizing over all five dimensions, this text has the smallest distance to academic prose and would be classified into that category.","The predictive power of this five-dimensional model of variation was tested at three levels of abstraction. The first test was based on texts from three high-level register categories: newspaper articles (including press reportage, editorials, and reviews), academic prose (including humanities, social science, medicine, natural science, and engineering), and fiction.

Academic prose and fiction are clearly distinguished, with no misclassifications between these two groups. Newspaper texts are less sharply distinguished from the other two categories: 28.89% of the newspaper texts are incorrectly classified as academic prose; 27.5% of the academic prose texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper texts; and 15.38% of the fiction texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper texts.

Some of the provocative conclusions of that study are: \"the written style of English and French tended to be more similar in specialized technical texts than in general language texts\" (1982, p. 108). \"parallel sublanguages of English and French are much more similar structurally than are dissimilar sublanguages of the same language. Parallel sublanguages seem to correspond more closely when the domain of reference is a technical one\" (1982, p. 108).","The multidimensional framework provides a complementary approach to these issues. From a linguistic perspective, dimensions are more readily compared cross-linguistically than individual features, since structurally similar features often serve quite different functional roles across languages. Similarly, cross-linguistic comparisons of individual registers are more readily interpretable when they are situated relative to the range of other registers in each language, since the 'same' registers can serve quite different functions across languages when considered relative to their respective register systems.","To date, there have been multidimensional analyses of register variation in four languages: English (summarized in Section 3), Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier 1988), Korean (Kim and Biber in press), and Somali (Biber and Hared 1992, in press). In each case, the description is based on analysis of a diversified corpus representing a wide range of spoken and written registers. The cross-linguistic patterns of variation represented by these four languages, both synchronic and diachronic, are discussed in Biber (in press, c). 237 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 12 Summary of functions, linguistic features, and characteristic registers for the five major Somali dimensions identified in Biber and Hared (1992).

There are also many similarities in the co-occurrence patterns among linguistic features. For example, first and second person pronouns, downtoners, stance features, contractions, and questions group together in both languages as markers of involvement; nouns and adjectives group together in both languages as markers of an informational focus; third person pronouns and past tense verbs group together in both languages as markers of narration. In other respects, though, the multi-dimensional structure of the two languages differ. For example, Somali has two dimensions marking different kinds of interaction plus a third dimension relating to production circumstances; all of these functions are combined into a single dimension in English (Dimension 1). Conversely, English Dimension 5 marks a passive, abstract style, which has no counterpart in Somali.","One of the surprising findings from the comparison of all four languages (including Nukulaelae Tuvaluan and Korean) is the extent of the cross-linguistic similarities (see Biber, in press, c). Thus, all four languages have multiple dimensions reflecting oral/literate differences, interactiveness, production circumstances, and an informational focus; these dimensions are defined by similar kinds of linguistic features, and analogous registers have similar cross-linguistic characterizations along these dimensions. In addition, two functional domains that relate to purpose are marked in all four languages: personal stance (toward the content) and narration. These dimensions also have similar structural correlates across the languages.","In contrast, there are fewer major differences among these languages in their patterns of register variation. Dimensions relating to argumentation/persuasion are found in only some languages, and there are other dimensions particular to a single language (such as abstract style in English, and honorification in Korean). Analogous registers show some differences cross-linguistically with respect to these latter dimensions plus the purpose-related dimensions mentioned above (e.g., marking personal stance or narration).","Findings such as these are directly relevant to several of the issues raised in recent studies of sublanguages, since they can be used to specify the linguistic relations among sublanguages both within and across languages. In particular, these analyses support Kittredge's (1982) conclusion that parallel sublanguages across languages are more similar in their linguistic structure than are dissimilar sublanguages within the same language. Romaine (in press) discusses similar findings in a comparison of sports 239 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 reportage in Tok Pisin and English. The multidimensional comparisons summarized here show that even when registers are defined at a high level of generality (e.g., conversation, fiction, academic prose), and even when comparisons are across markedly different language families and cultures, parallel registers are indeed more similar cross-linguistically than are disparate registers within a single language. 5. Conclusion In the present paper I have presented evidence from several different structural levels, as well as different languages, showing that there are important and systematic linguistic differences among registers. These data are used to argue for the general point that corpora representing a broad range of register variation are required as the basis for general language studies. In fact, the extent of register differences reported here suggests that overall linguistic characterizations of a language are often inadequate (or even incorrect). That is, since overall generalizations represent a kind of averaging of the linguistic patterns in a language, they often do not accurately represent the actual patterns of any register; in fact, such generalizations can conceal the systematic patterns found across registers. An alternative approach is to recognize the centrality of register differences and work toward a composite linguistic description of a language in those terms.","Corpus-based analyses of register variation obviously need to be extended in several ways. Future research should be based on larger corpora and include a wider representation of linguistic features and registers. In addition, register distinctions can be made at several levels of abstraction, and the intersection of register and text type analyses needs to be further explored (see notes 6 and 7). The analyses summarized here, though, clearly show the importance of a register perspective, supporting the continuing development and analysis of large register-diversified corpora as the basis for general language studies.
