However, it is also an abstraction of the situation faced by engineers building natural language processing (NLP) systems for more familiar languages. The lexicon is a central component of NLP systems and it is widely agreed that current lexical resources are inadequate. Language engineers have access to some but not all of the grammar, and some but not all of the lexicon. The most easily formalized and most reliable grammatical facts tend to be those involving auxiliaries, rnodals, and determiners, the agreement and case properties of pronouns, and so on. These vary little from speaker to speaker, topic to topic, register to register. Unfortunately, this information is not sufficient to parse sentences completely, a fact that is underscored by the current state of the parsing art. If sentences cannot be parsed completely and reliably then the syntactic frames used in them cannot be determined reliably. How, then, can reliable, easily formalized grammatical information be used to extract syntactic facts about words from a corpus?","This paper suggests the following approach: Do not try to parse sentences completely. Instead, rely on local morpho-syntactic cues such as the following facts about English: (1) The word following a determiner is unlikely to be functioning as a verb; (2) The sequence that the typically indicates the beginning of a clause. Do not try to draw categorical conclusions about a word on the basis of one or a fixed number of examples. Instead, attempt to determine the distribution of exceptions to the expected correspondence between cues and syntactic frames. Use a statistical model to determine whether the cooccurrence of a verb with cues for a frame is too regular to be explained by randomly distributed exceptions. The effectiveness of this approach for inferring the syntactic frames of verbs is supported by experiments using an implementation called Lerner. In the spirit of the problem stated above, Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words--it bootstraps from determiners, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and punctuation. Lerner has two independent components corresponding to the two strategies listed above. The first component identities sentences where a particular verb is likely to be exhibiting a particular syntactic frame. It does this using local cues, such as the that the cue. This component keeps track of the number of times each verb appears with cues for each syntactic frame as well as the total number of times each verb occurs. This process can be described as collecting observations and its output as an observations table. A segment of an actual observations table is shown in Table 4. The observations table serves as input to the statistical modeler, which ultimately decides whether the accumulated evidence that a particular verb manifests a particular syntactic frame in the input is reliable enough to warrant a conclusion.","To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a system that autonomously learns syntactic frames from naturally occurring text. The goal of learning syntactic frames and the learning framework described above lead to three major differences between the approach reported here and most recent work in learning grammar from text. First, this approach leverages a little a priori grammatical knowledge using statistical inference. Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language 244 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991). One exception is Magerman and Marcus (1991), in which a small grammar is used to aid learning. 1 A second difference is that the work reported here uses inferential rather than descriptive statistics. In other words, it uses statistical methods to infer facts about the language as it exists in the minds of those who produced the corpus. Many other projects have used statistics in a way that summarizes facts about the text but does not draw any explicit conclusions from them (Finch and Chater 1992; Hindle 1990). On the other hand, Hindle (1991) does use inferential statistics, and Brill (1992) recognizes the value of inference, although he does not use inferential statistics per se. Finally, many other projects in machine learning of natural language use input that is annotated in some way, either with part-of-speech tags (Brill 1992; Brill and Marcus 1992; Magerman and Marcus 1990) or with syntactic brackets (Pereira and Schabes 1992).","The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the morpho-syntactic cues Lerner uses to collect observations. Section 3 presents the main contribu-tion of this paper--the statistical model and experiments supporting its effectiveness. Finally, Section 4 draws conclusions and lays out a research program in machine learning of natural language."]},{"title":"2. Collecting Observations","paragraphs":["This section describes the local morpho-syntactic cues that Lerner uses to identify likely examples of particular syntactic frames. These cues must address two problems: finding verbs in the input and identifying phrases that represent arguments to the verb. The next two subsections present cues for these tasks. The cues presented here are not intended to be the last word on local cues to structure in English; they are merely intended to illustrate the feasibility of such cues and demonstrate how the statistical model accommodates their probabilistic correspondence to the true syntactic structure of sentences. Variants of these cues are presented in Brent (1991a, 1991b). The final subsection summarizes the procedure for collecting observations and discusses a sample of the observations table collected from the Brown corpus."]},{"title":"2.1 Finding Verbs","paragraphs":["Lerner identifies verbs in two stages, each carried out on a separate pass through the corpus.

The system described here uses rules similar to those of Karttunen and Wittenburg (1983), but it resolves the ambiguities using only the contents of the corpus. This technique will be described in a subsequent paper. 245 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2","Lerner assumes that a potential verb is functioning as a verb unless the context suggests otherwise. In particular, an occurrence of a potential verb is taken as a nonverbal occurrence only if it follows a determiner or a preposition other than to. For example, was talking would be taken as a verb, but a talk would not. This precaution reduces the likelihood that a singular count noun will be mistaken for a verb, since singular count nouns are frequently preceded by a determiner.","Finally, the only morphological forms that are used for learning syntactic frames are the stem form and the -ing form. There are several reasons for this. First, forms ending in -s are potentially ambiguous between third person singular present verbs and plural nouns. Since plural nouns are not necessarily preceded by determiners (I like to take walks), they could pose a significant ambiguity problem. Second, past participles do not generally take direct objects: knows me and knew me are OK, but not • is known me. Further, the past tense and past participle forms of some verbs are identical, while those of others are distinct. As a result, using the -ed forms would have complicated the statistical model substantially. Since the availability of raw text is not generally a limiting factor, it makes sense to wait for the simpler cases. 2.2 Identifying Argument Phrases When a putative occurrence of a verb is found, the next step is to identify the syntactic types of nearby phrases and determine whether or not they are likely to be arguments of the verb.","First, assume that a phrase P and a verb V have been identified in some sentence. Lerner's strategy for determining whether P is an argument to V has two components: . 2. If P is a noun phrase (NP), take it as an argument only if there is evidence that it is not the subject of another clause. Regardless of P's category, take it as an argument only if it occurs to the right of V and there are no potential attachment points for P between V and P. For example, suppose that the sequence that the were identified as the left boundary of a clause in the sentence I want to tell him that the idea won'tfly. Because pronouns like him almost never take relative clauses, and because pronouns are known at the outset, Lerner concludes that the clause beginning with that the is probably an argument of the verb tell. 3 It is always possible that it could be an argument of the previous verb want, but Lerner treats that as unlikely. On the other hand, if the sentence were I want to tell the boss that the idea won'tfly, then Lerner cannot determine whether the clause beginning with that the is an argument to tell or is instead related to boss, as in I want to fire the boss that the workers don't trust.","Now consider specific cues for identifying argument phrases. The phrase types for which data are reported here are noun phrases, infinitive verb phrases (VPs), and tensed clauses. These phrase types yield three syntactic frames with a single argument and three with two arguments, as shown in Table 1. The cues used for identifying these frames are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 defines lexical categories that are referred to in Table 3. The category V in Table 3 starts out empty and is filled as verbs are detected on the first pass. \"cap\" stands for any capitalized word and \"cap+\" for any sequence of capitalized words. These cues are applied by matching them against the string of words immediately to the right of each verb. For example, a verb V is 3 Thanks to Don Hindle for this observation (personal communication). 246 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon Table 1 The six syntactic frames studied in this paper.

The coordinating conjunction makes it unlikely that the pronoun is the subject of another clause, as in I see you like champagne. It also makes it unlikely that the verb has an additional NP argument, as in I'II tell you my secret recipe. 2.3 Summary and Sample Data To summarize, the procedure for collecting observations from a corpus is as follows:","1. Go through the corpus once finding pairs of words such that one is the result of adding the suffix -ing to the other, applying appropriate morphological adjustment rules. List members of such pairs as verbs. 2. Go through the corpus again. At each word w that is on the list of verbs,","(a) If w is not preceded by a preposition or a determiner, increment the number of times that w appears as a verb.","(b) If any of the cues listed in Table 3 match the words immediately following w, increment the number of times that w appears to occur in the corresponding frame. 3. Combine the data for the stem form and the -ing form.","Table 4 shows an alphabetically contiguous portion of the observations table that results from applying this procedure to the Brown Corpus (untagged). Each row represents data collected from one pair of words, including both the -ing form and the stem form. The first column, titled V, represents the total number of times the word occurs in positions where it could be functioning as a verb. Each subsequent column represents a single frame. The number appearing in each row and column represents the number of times that the row's verb cooccurred with cues for the column's frame. Zeros are omitted. Thus recall and recalling occurred a combined total of 42 times, excluding those occurrences that followed determiners or prepositions. Three of those occurrences were followed by a cue for a single NP argument and four were followed by cues for a tensed clause argument. 248 Michael R.

The sentences responsible for these erroneous observations are:"]},{"title":"(2) (a) (b) (c) (d)","paragraphs":["But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead.

Given the data in Table 4, that method yields the judgments in Table 5. 3. Statistical Modeling As noted above, the correspondence between syntactic structure and the cues that Lerner uses is not perfect. Mismatches between cue and structure are problematic because naturally occurring language provides no negative evidence. If a V verb is followed by a cue for some syntactic frame S, that provides evidence that V does occur in frame S, but there is no analogous source of evidence that V does not occur in frame S.","The occurrence of mismatches between cue and structure can be thought of as a random process where each occurrence of a verb V has some non-zero probability of being followed by a cue for a frame S, even if V cannot in fact occur in S. If this model is accurate, the more times V occurs, the more likely it is to occur at least once with a cue for S. The intransitive verb arrive, for example, will eventually occur with a cue for an NP argument, if enough text is considered. A learner that considers a single occurrence of verb followed by a cue to be conclusive evidence will eventually come to the false conclusion that arrive is transitive. In other words, the information 249 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 provided by the cues will eventually be washed out by the noise. This problem is inherent in learning from naturally occurring language, since infallible parsing is not possible. The only way to prevent it is to consider the frequency with which each verb occurs with cues for each frame. In other words, to consider each occurrence of V without a cue for S as a small bit of evidence against V being able to occur in frame S. This section describes a statistical technique for weighing such evidence.","Given a syntactic frame S, the statistical model treats each verb V as analogous to a biased coin and each occurrence of V as analogous to a flip of that coin. An occurrence that is followed by a cue for S corresponds to one outcome of the coin flip, say heads; an occurrence without a cue for S corresponds to tails. 4 If the cues were perfect predictors of syntactic structure then a verb V that does not in fact occur in frame S would never appear with cues for S--the coin would never come up heads. Since the cues are not perfect, such verbs do occur with cues for S. The problem is to determine when a verb occurs with cues for S often enough that all those occurrences are unlikely to be errors.","In the following discussion, a verb that in fact occurs in frame S in the input is described as a +S verb; one that does not is described as a -S verb. The statistical model is based on the following approximation: for fixed S, all -S verbs have equal probability of being followed by a cue for S. Let ~r-s stand for that probability. ~r-s may vary from frame to frame, but not from verb to verb. Thus, errors might be more common for tensed clauses than for NPs, but the working hypothesis is that all intransitives, such as saunter and arrive, are about equally likely to be followed by a cue for an NP argument. If the error probability ~r-s were known, then we could use the standard hypothesis testing method for binomial frequency data. For example, suppose 7r-s = .05--on average, one in twenty occurrences of a -S verb is followed by a cue for S. If some verb V occurs 200 times in the corpus, and 20 of those occurrences are followed by cues for S, that ought to suggest that V is unlikely to have probability .05 of being followed by a cue for S, and hence V is unlikely to be -S. Specifically, the chance of flipping 20 or more heads out of 200 tosses of a coin with a five percent chance of coming up heads each time is less than three in 1000. On the other hand, it is not all that unusual to flip 2 or more heads out of 20 on such a coin--it happens about one time in four. If a verb occurs 20 times in the corpus and 2 of those occurrences are followed by cues for S, it is quite possible that V is -S and that the 2 occurrences with cues for S are explained by the five percent error rate on -S verbs.","The next section reviews the hypothesis-testing method and gives the formulas for computing the probabilities of various outcomes of coin tosses, given the coin's bias. It also provides empirical evidence that, for some values of 7r_s, hypothesis-testing does a good job of distinguishing +S verbs from -S verbs that occur with cues for S because of mismatches between cue and structure. The following section proposes a method for estimating ~r-s and provides empirical evidence that its estimates are nearly optimal."]},{"title":"3.1 Hypothesis Testing","paragraphs":["The statistical component of Lerner is designed to prevent the information provided by the cues from being washed out by the noise. The basic approach is hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data (Kalbfleisch 1985). Specifically, a verb V is shown to 4 Given a verb V, the outcomes of the coins for different S's are treated as approximately independent, even though they cannot be perfectly independent. Their dependence could be modeled using a multinomial rather than a binomial model, but the experimental data suggest that this is unnecessary. 250 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon be +S by assuming that it is -S and then showing that if this were true, the observed pattern of cooccurrence of V with cues for S would be extremely unlikely. 3.1.1 Binomial Frequency Data. In order to use the hypothesis testing method we need to estimate the probability ~r-s that an occurrence of a verb V will be followed by a cue for S if V is -S. In this section it is assumed that 7r_s is known. The next section suggests a means of estimating Tr_s. In both sections it is also assumed that for each +S verb, V, the probability that V will be followed by a cue for S is greater than 7r_s. Other than that, no assumptions are made about the probability that a +S verb will be followed by a cue for S. For example, two verbs with transitive senses, such as cut and walk, may have quite different frequencies of cooccurrence with cues for NP. It does not matter what these frequencies are as long as they are greater than lr_Np.","If a coin has probability p of flipping heads, and if it is flipped n times, the probability of its coming up heads exactly m times is given by the binomial distribution:","n~ P(m,n,p) - m!(n - m)! pm(1 - p)n-m (1) The probability of coming up heads m or more times is given by the obvious sum: n","P(m+, n, p) = ~ P(i, n, p) (2) i=m Analogously, P(m+, n, ~r-s) gives the probability that m or more occurrences of a -S verb V will be followed by a cue for S out of n occurrences total.","If m out of n occurrences of V are followed by cues for S, and if P(m+, n, ~r-s) is quite small, then it is unlikely that V is -S. Traditionally, a threshold less than or equal to .05 is set such that a hypothesis is rejected if, assuming the hypothesis were true, the probability of outcomes as extreme as the observed outcome would be below the threshold. The confidence attached to this conclusion increases as the threshold decreases. 3.1.2 Experiment. The experiment presented in this section is aimed at determining how well the method presented above can distinguish +S verbs from -S verbs. Let p-s be an estimate of 7r_s. It is conceivable that P(m+,n,p-s) might not be a good predictor of whether or not a verb is +S, regardless of the estimate p-s. For example, if the correspondence between the cues and the structures they are designed to detect were quite weak, then many -S verbs might have lower P(m+,n,p-s) than many +S verbs. This experiment measures the accuracy of binomial hypothesis testing on the data collected by Lerner's cues as a function of p-s. In addition to showing that P(m+, n, P-s) is good for distinguishing +S and -S verbs, these data provide a baseline against which to compare methods for estimating the error rate 7r_s.","Method The cues described in Section 2 were applied to the Brown Corpus (untagged version). Equation 2 was applied to the resulting data with a cutoff of P(m+,n,p_s) < .02 and p-s varying between 2 -5 (1 error in every 32 occurrences) and 2 -13 (1 error in every 8192 occurrences). The resulting judgments were compared to the blind judgments of a single judge. One hundred ninety-three distinct verbs were chosen at random from the tagged version of the Brown Corpus for comparison. Common verbs are more likely to be included in the test sample than rare verbs, but 251 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 6 Comparison of automatic classification to hand judgments for tensed-clause complement as a function of estimated error rate p (Brown Corpus).

The only assumption about the distribution of biases is that there is some definite but unknown minimum bias 7r_s. 5 Determining whether or not a verb appears in frame S is analogous to determining, for some randomly selected coin, whether its bias is greater than ~r-s. The only available evidence comes from selecting a number of coins at random and flipping them. The previous section showed how this can be done given an estimate of ~r-s.","Suppose a series of coins is drawn at random from the bag. Each coin is flipped N times. It is then assigned to a histogram bin representing the number of times it came up heads. At the end of this sampling procedure bin i contains the number of coins that came up heads exactly i times out of N. Such a histogram is shown in Figure 1, where N = 40. If N is large enough and enough coins are flipped N times, one would expect the following:","1. The coins whose probability of turning up heads is ~r-s (the minimum) should cluster at the low-heads end of the histogram. That is, there should be some 0 __G j0 _< N such that most of the coins that turn up j0 heads or fewer have probability 7r_s, and, conversely, most coins with probability ~r-s turn up j0 heads or fewer.","2. Suppose j0 were known. Then the portion of the histogram below j0 should have a roughly binomial shape. In Figure 1, for example, the first eight bins have roughly the shape one would expect if j0 were 8. In contrast, the first 16 bins do not have the shape one would expect if j0 5 If the number of coins is taken to be infinite, then the biases must be not only greater than ~r-s but bounded above ~r-s. 253 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Number of Coins 0","0 8 16 24 32 40 Number of Heads Hipped Figure 1 A histogram illustrating a binomially shaped distribution in the first eight bins. . were 16---their height drops to zero for two stretches before rising significantly above zero again.

Suppose again that j0 were known. Then the average rate at which the coins in bins j0 or lower flip heads is a good estimate of ~r-s. The estimation procedure tries out each bin as a possible estimate of j0. Each estimate of j0 leads to an estimate of ~r-s and hence to an expected shape for the first j0 histogram bins. Each estimate j of j0 is evaluated by comparing the predicted distribution in the first j bins to the observed distribution--the better the fit, the better the estimate.","Moving from coins to verbs, the procedure works as follows. For some fixed N, consider the first N occurrences of each verb that occurs at least N times in the input. (A uniform sample size N is needed only for estimating 7r-s.

General Discussion","paragraphs":["This paper explores the possibility of using simple grammatical regularities to learn lexical syntax. The data presented in Tables 6, 7, and 8 provide evidence that it is possible to learn significant aspects of English lexical syntax in this way. Specifically, these data suggest that neither a large parser nor a large lexicon is needed to recover enough syntactic structure for learning lexical syntax. Rather, it seems that significant 256 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon lexical syntactic information can be recovered using a few approximate cues along with statistical inference based on a simple model of the cues' error distributions. 4.1 Other Syntactic Frames The lexical entry of a verb can specify other syntactic frames in addition to the six studied here. In particular, many verbs take prepositional phrases (PPs) headed by a particular preposition or class of prepositions. For example, put requires a location as a second argument, and locations are often represented by PPs headed by locative prepositions.","Extending Lerner to detect PPs is trivial. Since the set of prepositions in the language is essentially fixed, all prepositions can be included in the initial lexicon. Detecting a PP requires nothing more than detecting a preposition. 6 The statistical model can, of course, be applied without modification.","The problem, however, is determining which PPs are arguments and which are adjuncts. There are clearly cases where a prepositional phrase can occur in a clause not by virtue of the lexical entry of the verb but rather by virtue of nonlexical facts of English syntax. For instance, almost any verb can occur with a temporal PP headed by on, as in John arrived on Monday. Such PPs are called adjuncts. On the other hand, the sense of on in John sprayed water on the ceiling is quite different. This sense, it can be argued, is available only because the lexical entry of spray specifies a location argument that can be realized as a PP. If anything significant is to be learned about individual words, the nonspecific cooccurrences of verbs with PPs (adjuncts) must be separated from the specific ones (arguments). It is not clear how a machine learning system could do this, although frequency might provide some clue. Worse, however, there are many cases in which even trained linguists lack clear intuitions. Despite a number of attempts to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the argument/adjunct distinction (e.g., Jackendoff 1977), there are many cases for which the various criteria do not agree or the judgments are unclear (Adams and Macfarland 1991). Thus, the Penn Treebank does not make the argument/adjunct distinction because their judges do not agree often enough. Until a useful definition that trained humans can agree on is developed, it would seem fruitless to attempt machine learning experiments in this domain. 4.2 Limitations of the Statistical Model Although the results of this study are generally encouraging, they also point to some limitations of the statistical model presented here. First, it does not take into account variation in the percentage of verbs that can appear in each frame. For example, most verbs can take an NP argument, while very few can take an NP followed by a tensed clause. This results in too few verbs being classified as +NP and too many being classified as +NPcl, as shown in Table 8. Second, it does not take into account the fact that for some words with verbal senses most of their occurrences are verbal, whereas for others most of their occurrences are nonverbal. For example, operate occurs exclusively as a verb while board occurs much more often as a noun than as a verb. Since the cues are based on the assumption that the word in question is a verb, board presents many more opportunities for error than operate. This violates the assumption that the probability of error for a given frame is approximately uniform across verbs. 6 The preposition/particle distinction is set aside here in order to focus on the more problematic argument/adjunct distinction. 257 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Table 9 Distribution of occurrences among morphological forms in the Brown Corpus.

For example, an applied system can be provided with the rough estimates that 80-95 percent of verbs take a direct object, while 1-2 percent take a direct object followed by a tensed clause. Such estimates can be expected to reduce misclassifica-tion significantly. Further, an existing dictionary could be used to \"train\" a statistical model on familiar verbs. A trained system would probably be more accurate in classifying new verbs. Finally, the lexical ambiguity problem could probably be reduced substantially in the applied context by using a statistical tagging program (Brill 1992; Church 1988).","For addressing basic questions in machine learning of natural language the solutions outlined above are not attractive. All of those solutions provide the learner with additional specific knowledge of English, whereas the goal for the machine learning effort should be to replace specific knowledge with general knowledge about the types of regularities to be found in natural language.","There is one approach to the lexical ambiguity problem that does not require giving the learner additional specific knowledge. The problem is as follows: words that occur frequently as, say, nouns are likely to have a different error rate from unambiguous verbs. If it were known which words occur primarily as verbs and which occur primarily as nouns then separate error rate estimates could be made for each. This would reduce the rate of false positive errors even without any further information about which"]},{"title":"particular","paragraphs":["occurrences are nominal and which are verbal.

Recognizing such ambiguity patterns automatically would allow a separate error rate to be estimated for the highly ambiguous words. 4.3 Future Work From the perspective of computational language acquisition, a natural direction in which to extend this work is to develop algorithms for learning some of the specific knowledge that was programmed into the system described above. Consider the mor-258 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon phological adjustment rules according to which, for example, the final \"e\" of bite is deleted when the suffix -ing is added, yielding biting rather than ,\"biteing.\" Lerner needs to know such rules in order to determine whether or not a given word occurs both with and without the suffix -ing. Experiments are under way on an unsupervised procedure that learns such rules from English text, given only the list of English verbal suffixes. This work is being extended further in the direction of discovering the morphemic suffixes themselves and discovering the ways in which these suffixes alternate in paradigms. The short-term goal is to develop algorithms that can learn the rules of inflection in English starting from only a corpus and a general notion of the nature of morphological regularities.","Ultimately, this line of inquiry may lead to algorithms that can learn much of the grammar of a language starting with only a corpus and a general theory of the kinds of formal regularities to be found in natural languages. Some elements of syntax may not be learnable in this way (Lightfoot 1991), but the lexicon, morphology, and phonology together make up a substantial portion of the grammar of a language. If it does not prove possible to learn these aspects of grammar starting from a general ontology of linguistic regularities and using distributional analysis then that, too, is an interesting result. It would suggest that the task requires a more substantive initial theory of possible grammars, or some semantic information about input sentences, or both. In any case this line of inquiry promises to shed light on the nature of language, learning, and language learning. References","Adams, L., and Macfarland, T.
