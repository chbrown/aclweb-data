However, his characterization of a superautomaton as a variety of Moore machine (Moore 1956) is very misleading. Inasmuch as the concept is central to the main argument of the book, I would like to describe it here in enough detail to cover the idea I really intended.","I specify, but do not offer a design or model of, an executive Turing machine T p that (a) comprehends a finite number of finite automata connected in parallel, which it monitors; (b) has access to a stored encoded table representing the transition functions of each component automaton T; (c) includes means for deciding whether a given state of a component automaton can reach a final state. This complex device T t is a \"superautomaton\".","The way it works is this. If an input string x to a component automaton T includes undefined (vague, degraded, or unclear) symbols u, then when T reach u it ceases processing. T r decides whether there is a string y that could drive T to a final state. If not, it rejects x as not acceptable to T. If there is a string, T' consults the table of T and determines by random choice a symbol s defined for T that drives T to a state for which there is a string leading to a final state. Then the undefined symbol u is"]},{"title":"taken","paragraphs":["to be s, and the computation of the","string x continues.

It also entails that the executive part of T' must be, in terms of competence, a twoway tape Turing machine, not a Moore machine.

By the recursion theorem of mathematical logic (Rogers 1967), some such thing must exist - i.e., there are self-describing Turing machines. There are also concrete analogous instances, i.e., generic codes.","I think this kind of idea is significantly relevant to computational theory and cognitive science, not just to the concerns of my book (which is meant to be a philosophical argument for the plausibility of computationalist theories of mind and cognition), but also to the very pervasive current employment of"]},{"title":"self-reference","paragraphs":["in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.
