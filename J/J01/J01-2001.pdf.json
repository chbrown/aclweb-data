We develop a set of heuristics that rapidly develop a probabilistic morphological grammar, and use MDL as our primary tool to determine whether the modifications proposed by the heuristics will be adopted or not. The resulting grammar matches well the analysis that would be developed by a human morphologist. In the final section, we discuss the relationship of this style of MDL grammatical analysis to the notion of evaluation metric in early generative grammar. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["This is a report on the present results of a study on unsupervised acquisition of morphology. 1 The central task of morphological analysis is the segmentation of words into the components that form the word by the operation of concatenation. While that view is not free of controversy, it remains the traditional conception of morphology, and the one that we shall employ here. 2 Issues of interface with phonology, traditionally known as morphophonology, and with syntax are not directly addressed. 3 While some of the discussion is relevant to the unrestricted set of languages, some of the assumptions made in the implementation restrict the useful application of the algorithms to languages in which the average number of affixes per word is less than what is found in such languages as Finnish, Hungarian, and Swahili, and we restrict our testing in the present report to more widely studied European languages. Our general goal, however, is the treatment of unrestricted natural languages. * Department of Linguistics, University of Chicago, 1010 E. 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637.

A first version was written in September, 1998, and a much-revised version was completed in December, 1999. This work was also supported in part by a grant from the Argonne National Laboratory-University of Chicago consortium, which I thank for its support. I am also grateful for helpful discussion of this material with a number of people, including Carl de Marcken, Jason Eisner, Zhiyi Chi, Derrick Higgins, Jorma Rissanen, Janos Simon, Svetlana Soglasnova, Hisami Suzuki, and Jessie Pinkham. As noted below, I owe a great deal to the remarkable work reported in de Marcken's dissertation, without which I would not have undertaken the work described here. I am grateful as well to several anonymous reviewers for their considerable improvements to the content of this paper. 2 Sylvain Neuvel has recently produced an interesting computational implementation of a theory of morphology that does not have a place for morphemes, as described at http://www.neuvel.net. It is well established that nonconcatenative morphology is found in some scattered language families, notably Semitic and Penutian. African tone languages require simultaneous morphological analyses of the tonal and the segmental material. 3 But see the following note. @ 2001 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2","The program in question takes a text file as its input (typically in the range of 5,000 to 1,000,000 words) and produces a partial morphological analysis of most of the words of the corpus; the goal is to produce an output that matches as closely as possible the analysis that would be given by a human morphologist. It performs unsupervised learning in the sense that the program's sole input is the corpus; we provide the program with the tools to analyze, but no dictionary and no morphological rules particular to any specific language. At present, the goal of the program is restricted to providing the correct analysis of words into component pieces (morphemes), though with only a rudimentary categorical labeling.","The underlying model that is utilized invokes the principles of the minimum description length (MDL) framework (Rissanen 1989), which provides a helpful perspective for understanding the goals of traditional linguistic analysis. MDL focuses on the analysis of a corpus of data that is optimal by virtue of providing both the most compact representation of the data and the most compact means of extracting that compression from the original data. It thus requires both a quantitative account whose parameters match the original corpus reasonably well (in order to provide the basis for a satisfactory compression) and a spare, elegant account of the overall structure.","The novelty of the present account lies in the use of simple statements of morphological patterns (called signatures below), which aid both in quantifying the MDL account and in constructively building a satisfactory morphological grammar (for MDL offers no guidance in the task of seeking the optimal analysis). In addition, the system whose development is described here sets reasonably high goals: the reformulation in algorithmic terms of the strategies of analysis used by traditional morphologists.","Developing an unsupervised learner using raw text data as its sole input offers several attractive aspects, both theoretical and practical. At its most theoretical, unsupervised learning constitutes a (partial) linguistic theory, producing a completely explicit relationship between data and analysis of that data. A tradition of considerable age in linguistic theory sees the ultimate justification of an analysis A of any single language L as residing in the possibility of demonstrating that analysis A derives from a particular linguistic theory LT, and that that LT works properly across a range of languages (not just for language L). There can be no better way to make the case that a particular analysis derives from a particular theory than to automate that process, so that all the linguist has to do is to develop the theory-as-computer-algorithm; the application of the theory to a particular language is carried out with no surreptitious help.","From a practical point of view, the development of a fully automated morphology generator would be of considerable interest, since we still need good morphologies of many European languages and to produce a morphology of a given language \"by hand\" can take weeks or months. With the advent of considerable historical text available on-line (such as the ARTFL database of historical French), it is of great interest to develop morphologies of particular stages of a language, and the process of automatic morphology writing can simplify this stage--where there are no native speakers available---considerably.","A third motivation for this project is that it can serve as an excellent preparatory phase (in other words, a bootstrapping phase) for an unsupervised grammar acquisition system. As we will see, a significant proportion of the words in a large corpus can be assigned to categories, though the labels that are assigned by the morphological analysis are corpus internal; nonetheless, the assignment of words into distinct morphologically motivated categories can be of great service to a syntax acquisition device. 154 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language Table 1 Some signatures from"]},{"title":"Tom Sawyer.","paragraphs":["Signature Example Stem Count (type) Token Count NULL.ed.ing betray betrayed betraying 69 864 NULL.ed.ing.s remain remained remaining remains 14 516 NULL.s. cow cows 253 3,414 e.ed.es.ing notice noticed notices noticing 4 62","The problem, then, involves both the determination of the correct morphological split for individual words, and the establishment of accurate categories of stems based on the range of suffixes that they accept: . ."]},{"title":"Splitting words:","paragraphs":["We wish to accurately analyze any word into successive morphemes in a fashion that corresponds to the traditional linguistic analysis.

Finally, I will offer some speculative observations about the larger perspective that this work suggests and work in progress (Section 11). 2. Previous Research in this Area The task of automatic word analysis has intrigued workers in a range of disciplines, and the practical and theoretical goals that have driven them have varied considerably. Some, like Zellig Harris (and the present writer), view the task as an essential one in defining the nature of the linguistic analysis. But workers in the area of data compression, dictionary construction, and information retrieval have all contributed to the literature on automatic morphological analysis. (As noted earlier, our primary concern here is with morphology and not with regular allomorphy or morphophonology, which is the study of the changes in the realization of a given morpheme that are dependent on the grammatical context in which it appears, an area occasionally confused for morphology. Several researchers have explored the morphophonologies of natural language in the context of two-level systems in the style of the model developed by Kimmo Koskenniemi [1983], Lauri Karttunen [1993], and others.) The only general review of work in this area that I am aware of is found in Langer (1991), which is ten years old and unpublished.","Work in automatic morphological analysis can be usefully divided into four major approaches. The first approach proposes to identify morpheme boundaries first, and thus indirectly to identify morphemes, on the basis of the degree of predictability of the n + 1st letter given the first n letters (or the mirror-image measure). This was first proposed by Zellig Harris (1955, 1967), and further developed by others, notably by Hafer and Weiss (1974). The second approach seeks to identify bigrams (and trigrams) that have a high likelihood of being morpheme internal, a view pursued in work discussed below by Klenk, Langer, and others. The third approach focuses on the discovery of patterns (we might say, of rules) of phonological relationships between pairs of related words. The fourth approach, which includes that used in this paper, is top-down, and seeks an analysis that is globally most concise. In this section, we shall review some of the work that has pursued these approaches--briefly, necessarily. 6 While not all of the approaches discussed here use no prior language-particular knowledge (which is the goal of the present system), I exclude from discussions those systems that are based essentially on a prior human-designed analysis of the grammatical morphemes of a language, aiming at identifying the stem(s) and the correct parsing; such is the 6 Another effort is that attributed to Andreev (1965) and discussed in Altmann and Lehfeldt (1980), especially p. 195 and following, though their description does not facilitate establishing a comparison with the present approach. 156 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language case, for example, in Pacak and Pratt (1976), Koch, K~stner, and Riidiger (1989), and Wothke and Schrnidt (1992). With the exception of Harris's algorithm, the complexity of the algorithms is such as to make implementation for purposes of comparison prohibitively time-consuming.","At the heart of the first approach, due to Harris, is the desire to place boundaries between letters (respectively, phonemes) in a word based on conditional entropy, in the following sense. We construct a device that generates a finite list of words, our corpus, letter by letter and with uniform probability, in such a way that at any point in its generation (having generated the first n letters 111213 • • • In) we can inquire of it what the entropy is of the set consisting of the next letter of all the continuations it might make. (In current parlance, we would most naturally think of this as a path from the root of a trie to one of its terminals, inquiring of each node its associated one-letter entropy, based on the continuations from that node.) Let us refer to this as the prefix conditional entropy; clearly we may be equally interested in constructing a trie from the right edge of words, which then provides us with a suffix conditional entropy, in mirror-image fashion.","Harris himself employed no probabilistic notions, and the inclusion of entropy in the formulation had to await Hafer and Weiss (1974); but allowing ourselves the anachronism, we may say that Harris proposed that local peaks of prefix (and suffix) conditional entropy should identify morpheme breaks. The method proposed in Harris (1955) appealed to what today we would call an oracle for information about the language under scrutiny, but in his 1967 article, Harris implemented a similar procedure on a computer and a fixed corpus, restricting his problem to that of finding morpheme boundaries within words. Harris's method is quite good as a heuristic for finding a good set of candidate morphemes, comparable in quality to the mutual information-based heuristic that I have used, and which I describe below. It has the same problem that good heuristics frequently have: it has many inaccuracies, and it does not lend itself to a next step, a qualitatively more reliable approximation of the correct solution. 7","Hafer and Weiss (1974) explore in detail various ways of clarifying and improving on Harris's algorithm while remaining faithful to the original intent. A brief summary does not do justice to their fascinating discussion, but for our purposes, their results confirm the character of the Harrisian test as heuristic: with Harris's proposal, a quantitative measure is proposed (and Hafer and Weiss develop a range of 15 different measures, all of them rooted in Harris's proposal), and best results for morphological analysis are obtained in some cases by seeking a local maximum of prefix conditional entropy, in others by seeking a value above a threshold, and in yet others, good results are obtained only when this measure is paired with a similar measure constructed in mirror-image fashion from the end of the word--and then some arbitrary thresholds are selected which yield the best results. While no single method emerges as the best, one of the best yields precision of 0.91 and recall of 0.61 on a corpus of approximately 6,200 word types. (Precision here indicates proportion of predicted morpheme breaks that are correct, and recall denotes the proportion of correct breaks that are predicted.)","The second approach that can be found in the literature is based on the hypothesis that local information in the string of letters (respectively, phonemes) is sufficient to identify morpheme boundaries. This hypothesis would be clearly correct if all morpheme boundaries were between pairs of letters 11-12 that never occur in that sequence 7 But Harris's method does lend itself to a generalization to more difficult cases of morphological analysis going beyond the scope of the present paper. In work in progress, we have used minimization of mutual information between successive candidate morphemes as part of a heuristic for preferring a morphological analysis in languages with a large number of suffixes per word. 157 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 morpheme internally, and the hypothesis would be invalidated if conditional probabilities of a letter given the previous letter were independent of the presence of an intervening boundary. The question is where real languages distribute themselves along the continuum that stretches between these two extremes.","A series of publications has explored this question, including Janssen (1992), Klenk (1992), and Flenner (1994, 1995). Any brief description that overlooks the differences among these publications is certain to do less than full justice to all of them. The procedure described in Janssen (1992) and Flenner (1994, 1995) begins with a training corpus with morpheme boundaries inserted by a human, and hence the algorithm is not in the domain of unsupervised learning. Each bigram (and the algorithm has been extended in the natural way to treating trigrams as well) is associated with a triple (whose sum must be less than or equal to 1.0) indicating the frequency in the training corpus of a morpheme boundary occurring to the left of, between, or to the right of that bigram.

The major question to carry away from this approach is this: can the information that is expressed in the division of a set of words into morphemes be compressed into local information (bigrams, trigrams)? The answer, I believe, is in general negative. Morphology operates at a higher level, so to speak, and has only weak statistical links to local sequencing of phonemes or letters, s 8 On this score, language will surely vary to some degree. English, for example, tends to employ rules of morphophonology to modify the surface form of morphologically complex words so as to better match the phonological pattern of unanalyzed words. This is discussed at length in Goldsmith (1990, Chap. 5). 158 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language","The third approach focuses on the discovery of patterns explicating the overt shapes of related forms in a paradigm. Dzeroski and Erjavec (1997) report on work that they have done on Slovene, a South Slavic language with a complex morphology, in the context of a similar project. Their goal essentially was to see if an inductive logic program could infer the principles of Slovene morphology to the point where it could correctly predict the nominative singular form of a word if it were given an oblique (nonnominative) form. Their project apparently shares with the present one the requirement that the automatic learning algorithm be responsible for the decision as to which letters constitute the stem and which are part of the suffix(es), though the details offered by Dzeroski and Erjavec are sketchy as to how this is accomplished. In any event, they present their learning algorithm with a labeled pair of words--a base form and an inflected form. It is not clear from their description whether the base form that they supply is a surface form from a particular point in the inflectional paradigm (the nominative singular), or a more articulated underlying representation in a generative linguistic sense; the former appears to be their policy.","Dzeroski and Erjavec's goal is the development of rules couched in traditional linguistic terms; the categories of analysis are decided upon ahead of time by the programmer (or, more specifically, by the tagger of the corpus), and each individual word is identified with regard to what morphosyntactic features it bears.

His goal is to acquire derivational rules from an inflectional lexicon, thus insuring that his algorithm has access to the lexical category of the words it deals with (unlike the present study, which is allowed no such access). Using the terminology of the present paper, Gaussier considers candidate suffixes if they appear with at least two stems of length 5.

He associated each of the 120 words (respectively, 39) with an integer (between 1 and the length of the word minus 1) indicating where the morphological split was to be, and measured the fitness of that grammar in terms of its decrease in number of total letters. He does not describe the fitness function used, but seems to suggest that the metric more complex than the familiar minimum edit distance, but no results are offered in support of the choice of the additional complexity.","15 I am grateful to Scott Meredith for drawing my attention to this paper. 161 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 single top-performing grammar of each generation is preserved, all others are eliminated, and the top-performing grammar is then subjected to mutation. That is, in a case-by-case fashion, the split between stems and suffixes is modified (in some cases by a shift of a single letter, in others by an unconstrained shift to another location within the word) to form a new grammar. In one experiment described by Kazakov, the population was set to 800, and 2,000 generations were modeled. On a Pentium 90 and a vocabulary of 120 items, the computation took over eight hours.","Work by Michael Brent (1993) and Carl de Marcken (1995) has explored analyses of the fourth type as well. Researchers have been aware of the utility of the information-theoretic notion of compression from the earliest days of information theory, and there have been efforts to discover useful, frequent chunks of letters in text, such as Radhakrishnan (1978), but to my knowledge, Brent's and de Marcken's works were the first to explicitly propose the guiding of linguistic hypotheses by such notions. Brent's work addresses the question of determining the correct morphological analysis of a corpus of English words, given their syntactic category, utilizing the notion of minimal encoding, while de Marcken's addresses the problem of determining the \"breaking\" of an unbroken stream of letters or phonemes into chunks that correspond as well as possible to our conception of words, implementing a well-articulated algorithm couched in a minimum description length framework, and exploring its effects on several large corpora.","Brent (1993) aims at finding the appropriate set of suffixes from a corpus, rather than the more comprehensive goal of finding the correct analysis for each word, both stem and suffix, and I think it would not be unfair to describe it as a test-of-concept trial on a corpus ranging in size from 500 to 8,000 words; while this is not a small number of words, our studies below focus on corpora with on the order of 30,000 distinct words. Brent indicates that he places other limitations as well on the hypothesis space, such as permitting no suffix which ends in a sequence that is also a suffix (i.e., if s is a suffix, then less and ness are not suffixes, and if y is a suffix, ity is not). Brent's observation is very much in line with the spirit of the present analysis: \"The input lexicons contained thousands of non-morphemic endings and mere dozens of morphemic suffixes, but the output contained primarily morphemic suffixes in all cases but one. Thus, the effects of non-morphemic regularities are minimal\" (p. 35). Brent's corpora were quite different from those used in the experiments reported below; his were based on choosing the n most common words in a Wall Street Journal corpus, while the present study has used large and heterogeneous sources for corpora, which makes for a considerably more difficult task. In addition, Brent scored his algorithm solely on how well it succeeded in identifying suffixes (or combinations of suffixes), rather than on how well it simultaneously analysed stem and suffix for each word, the goal of the present study. ~6 Brent makes clear the relevance and importance of information-theoretic notions, but does not provide a synthetic and overall measure of the length of the morphological grammar.","16 Brent's description of his algorithm is not detailed enough to satisfy the curiosity of someone like the present writer, who has encountered problems that Brent's approach would seem certain to encounter equally. As we shall see below, the central practical problem to grapple with is the fact that when considering suffixes (or candidate suffixes) consisting of only a single letter (let us say, s, for example), it is extremely difficult to get a good estimate of how many of the potential occurrences (of word-final s) are suffixal s and how many are not. As we shall suggest towards the end of this paper, the only accurate way to make an estimate is on the basis of a multinomial estimate once larger suffix signatures have been established. Without this, it is difficult not to overestimate the frequency of single-letter suffixes, a result that may often, in my experience, deflect the learning algorithm from discovering a correct two-letter suffix (e.g., the suffix -al in French). 162 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language","De Marcken (1995) addresses a similar but distinct task, that of determining the correct breaking of a continuous stream of segments into distinct words. This problem has been addressed in the context of Asian (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) languages, where standard orthography does not include white space between words, and it has been discussed in the context of language acquisition as well. De Marcken describes an unsupervised learning algorithm for the development of a lexicon using a minimum description length framework. He applies the algorithm to a written corpus of Chinese, as well as to written and spoken corpora of English (the English text has had the spaces between words removed), and his effort inspired the work reported here. De Marcken's algorithm begins by taking all individual characters to be the baseline lexicon, and it successively adds items to the lexicon if the items will be useful in creating a better compression of the corpus in question, or rather, when the improvement in compression yielded by the addition of a new item to the codebook is greater than the length (or \"cost\") associated with the new item in the codebook. In general, a lexical item of frequency F can be associated with a compressed length of - log F, and de Marcken's algorithm computes the compressed length of the Viterbi-best parse of the corpus, where the compressed length of the whole is the sum of the compressed lengths of the individual words (or hypothesized chunks, we might say) plus that of the lexicon. In general, the addition of chunks to the lexicon (beginning with such high-frequency items as th) will improve the compression of the corpus as a whole, and de Marcken shows that successive iterations add successively larger pieces to the lexicon. De Marcken's procedure builds in a bottom-up fashion, looking for larger and larger chunks that are worth (in an MDL sense) assigning the status of dictionary entries. Thus, if we look at unbroken orthographic texts in English, the two-letter combination th will become the first candidate chosen for lexical status; later, is will achieve that status too, and soon this will as well. The entry this will not, in effect, point to its four letters directly, but will rather point to the chunks th and is, which still retain their status in the lexicon (for their robust integrity is supported by their appearance throughout the lexicon). The creation of larger constituents will occasionally lead to the elimination of smaller chunks, but only when the smaller chunk appears almost always in a single larger unit.","An example of an analysis provided by de Marcken's algorithm is given in (1), taken from de Marcken (1995), in which I have indicated the smallest-level constituent by placing letters immediately next to one another, and then higher structure with various pair brackets (parentheses, etc.) for orthographic convenience; there is no theoretical significance to the difference between \"( )\" and \"0\", etc. De Marcken's analysis succeeds quite well at identifying words, but does not make any significant effort at identifying morphemes as such. ([the]{([unit]ed)([stat]es)})(of{ame([ric])a}) (1)","Applying de Marcken's algorithm to a \"broken\" corpus of a language in which word boundaries are indicated (for example, English) provides interesting results, but none that provide anything even approaching a linguistic analysis, such as identification of stems and affixes. The broken character of the corpus serves essentially as an upper bound for the chunks that are postulated, while the letters represent the lower bound.","De Marcken's MDL-based figure of merit for the analysis of a substring of the corpus is the sum of the inverse log frequencies of the components of the string in question; the best analysis is that which minimizes that number (which is, again, the optimal compressed length of that substring), plus the compressed length of each 163 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 of the lexical items that have been hypothesized to form the lexicon of the corpus. It would certainly be natural to try using this figure of merit on words in English, along with the constraint that all words should be divided into exactly two pieces. Applied straightforwardly, however, this gives uninteresting results: words will always be divided into two pieces, where one of the pieces is the first or the last letter of the word, since individual letters are so much more common than morphemes. 17 (I will refer to this effect as peripheral cutting below.) In addition--and this is less obvious--the hierarchical character of de Marcken's model of chunking leaves no place for a qualitative difference between high-frequency \"chunks,\" on the one hand, and true morphemes, on the other: str is a high-frequency chunk in English (as schl is in German), but it is not at all a morpheme. The possessive marker ~s, on the other hand, is of relatively low frequency in English, but is clearly a morpheme.","MDL is nonetheless the key to understanding this problem. In the next section, I will present a brief description of the algorithm used to bootstrap the problem, one which avoids the trap mentioned briefly in note 21. This provides us with a set of candidate splittings, and the notion of the signature of the stem becomes the working tool for determining which of these splits is linguistically significant. MDL is a framework for evaluating proposed analyses, but it does not provide a set of heuristics that are nonetheless essential for obtaining candidate analyses, which will be the subject of the next two sections. 3. Minimum Description Length Model The central idea of minimum description length analysis (Rissanen 1989) is composed of four parts: first, a model of a set of data assigns a probability distribution to the sample space from which the data is assumed to be drawn; second, the model can then be used to assign a compressed length to the data, using familiar information-theoretic notions; third, the model can itself be assigned a length; and fourth, the optimal analysis of the data is the one for which the sum of the length of the compressed data and the length of the model is the smallest. That is, we seek a minimally compact specification of both the model and the data, simultaneously. Accordingly, we use the conceptual vocabulary of information theory as it becomes relevant to computing the length, in bits, of various aspects of the morphology and the data representation. 3.1 A First Model Let us suppose that we know (part of) the correct analysis of a set of words, and we wish to create a model using that knowledge. In particular, we know which words have no morphological analysis, and for all the words that do have a morphological analysis, we know the final suffix of the word. (We return in the next section to how we might arrive at that knowledge.) An MDL model can most easily be conceptualized if we encode all such knowledge by means of lists; see Figure 2. In the present case, we have three lists: a list of stems, of suffixes, and of signatures. We construct a list of the stems of the corpus defined as the set of the unanalyzed words, plus the material that precedes the final suffix of each morphologically analyzed word. We also construct a list of suffixes that occur with at least one stem. Finally, each stem is empirically associated with a set of suffixes (those with which it appears in the corpus); we call this set the stem's signature, and we construct a third list, consisting of the signatures that appear in this corpus. This third list, however, contains no letters (as the other 17 See note 21 below. 164 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language A. Affixes: 6 1.

We do this, in one sense, because our goal is to construct the smallest morphology, and in general a pointer requires less information than an explicit set of letters. But in a deeper sense, it is the signatures whose compactness provides the explicit measurement of the conciseness of the entire analysis. Note that by construction, each stem is associated with exactly one signature. 165 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 Since"]},{"title":"stem, suffix,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"signature","paragraphs":["all begin with s, we opt for using t to represent a stem, f to represent a suffix, and cr to represent a signature, while the uppercase T, F, E represent the sets of stems, suffixes, and signatures, respectively.

Logically a signature consists of two lists of pointers, one a list of pointers to stems, the other a list of pointers to suffixes. To specify a list of length N, we must specify at the beginning of the signature that N items will follow, and this requires just slightly more than log 2 N bits to do (see Rissanen [1989, 33-34] for detailed discussion); I will use the notation A(N) to indicate this function.","A pointer to a stem t, in turn, is of length -log prob (t), a basic principle of information theory (Li and Vit8nyi 1997). Hence the length of a signature is the sum of the (inverse) log probabilities of its stems, plus that of its suffixes, plus the number of bits it takes to specify the number of its stems and suffixes, using the A function. We will return in a moment to how we determine the probabilities of the stems and suffixes; looking ahead, it will be the empirical frequency.","Let us consider the length of stem list T. As we have already observed, its length is ),((T))--this is the length of the information specifying how long the list is--plus the length of each stem specification.

A more refined measure would take the length of a letter to be -1 times the binary log of its frequency. A still more refined measure would base the probability of a letter on bigram context; this matters for English, where stem final t is very common. In addition, there is information in the linear order in which the letters are stored, roughly equal to n ~-~ log 2 k k=l for a string of length n (compare the information that distinguishes the lexical representation of anagrams).

Thus while stems and suffixes, which are defined relative to a particular morphological model, are assigned their empirical frequency as their probability, words are assigned a probability based on the model, one which will always depart from the empirical frequency. The compression to the corpus is thus worse than would be a compression based on word frequency alone, 19 or to put it another way, the morphological analysis in which all words are unanalyzed is the analysis in which each word is trivially assigned its own empirical frequency (since the word equals the stem).

Heuristics for Word Segmentation The MDL model designed in the preceding section will be of use only if we can provide a practical means of creating one or more plausible morphologies for a given corpus. That is, we need bootstrapping heuristics that enable us to go from a corpus to such a morphology. As we shall see, it is not in fact difficult to come up with a plausible initial morphology, but I would like to consider first an approach which, though it might seem like the most natural one to try, fails, and for an interesting reason.","The problem we wish to solve can be thought of as one suited to an expectationmaximization (EM) approach (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).

Probability mass for the stem and the suffix in each such cut is then augmented by an amount equal to the frequency of word w times the probability of the cut. After several iterations (approximately four), estimated probabilities stabilize, and each word is analyzed on the basis of the cut with the largest probability.","This initially plausible approach fails because it always prefers an analysis in which either the stem or (more often) the suffix consists of a single letter. More importantly, the probability that a sequence of one or more word-final letters is a suffix is very poorly modeled by the sequence's frequency. 21 To put the point another way, even the initial heuristic analyzing one particular word must take into account all of the other analyses in a more articulated way than this particular approach does.","I will turn now to two alternative heuristics that succeed in producing an initial morphological analysis (and refer to a third in a note). It seems likely that one could construct a number of additional heuristics of this sort. The point to emphasize is that the primary responsibility of the overall morphology is not that of the initial heuristic, but rather of the MDL model described in the previous section. The heuristics described in this section create an initial morphology that can serve as a starting point in a search for the shortest overall description of the morphology. We deal with that process in Section 5. 4.1 First Heuristic A heuristic that I will call the take-all-splits heuristic, and which considers all cuts of a word of length 1 into stem+suffix Wl,i -t- Wi+l,l, where 1 G i < 1, much like the EM approach mentioned immediately above, works much more effectively if the probability is assigned on the basis of a Boltzmann distribution; see (4) below. The function H(.) in (4) assigns a value to a split of word w of length h w U + wi+l,l. H does not assign a proper distribution; we use it to assign a probability to the cut of w into w~,i + wi+u as in (5).

Now, the ratio of the frequency of words that begin with diploma and those that begin with diplomac is less than 3, while the ratio of the frequency of words that end in y and those that end in cy is much greater. In graphical terms, we might note that tries (the data structure) based on forward spelling have by far the greatest branching structure early in the word, while tries based on backward spelling have the greatest branching structure close to the root node, which is to say at the end of the word. 171 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 where n--1"]},{"title":"Z = ~ H(Wl,i q- Wi+l,1)","paragraphs":["i=1","For each word, we note what the best parse is, that is, which parse has the highest rating by virtue of the H-function.

Each word member of the signature, however, now becomes a separate stem, with all of the increase in pointer length that that entails, as well as increase in letter content for the stem component.","One may draw the following conclusions, I believe, from the straightforward application of such a measure. On the whole, the effects are quite good, but by no means as close as one would like to a human's decisions in a certain number of cases. In addition, the effects are significantly influenced by two decisions that we have already discussed: (i) the information associated with each letter, and (ii) the decision as to whether to model suffix frequency based solely on signature-internal frequences, or based on frequency across the entire morphology. The greater the information associated with each letter, the more worthwhile morphology is (because maintaining multiple copies of nearly similar stems becomes increasingly costly and burdensome). When suffix frequencies (which are used to compute the compressed length of any analyzed word) are based on the frequency of the suffixes in the entire lexicon, rather than conditionally within the signature in question, the loss of a signature entails a hit on the compression of all other words in the lexicon that employed that suffix; hence triage is less dramatic under that modeling assumption.","Consider the effect of this computation on the signatures produced from a 500,000-word corpus of English.

It appears at this time that the unavailability of this information is the single most significant cause of inaccuracies in the present algorithm. It is thus of considerable importance to get a handle on such estimates. 32 10. Remaining Issues A number of practical questions remain at this point. The most important are the following:",".

We may represent a subsignature of that signature as a string of 0s and ls (a Boolean string b, of the form {0,1}*, abbreviated bk) indicating whether (or not) the ith suffix is contained in the subsignature. If a stem t occurs [t] times, then the probability that it occurs without a particular suffix~ is (1 -prob(fi))[tJ; the probability that it occurs without all of the suffixes missing from the particular subsignature b = {bk} is","I-I(1 -- bk)(1 -- prob(fi))[t];","k","and the probability that the particular subsignature b will arise at all is the sum of those values over","all of the stems in the signature:","l-I(1 - bk)(1 -- probOCi)) [tn] . tn C stems(G) k Thus all that is necessary is to estimate the hidden parameters of the frequencies of the individual suffixes in the entire paradigm. See the following note as well.","32 There may appear to be a contradiction between this observation about paradigms and the statement in the preceding paragraph that MDL rejects signature mergers--but there is no contradiction. The rejection of signature mergers is performed (so to speak) by the model which posits that frequencies of suffixes inside a signature are based only on suffix frequencies of the stems that appear with exactly the same set of suffixes in the corpus. It is that modeling assumption that needs to be dropped, and replaced by a multinomial-based frequency prediction based on counts over the 2 n - 1 signatures belonging to each paradigm of length n. 187 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 . . . . Identifying paradigms from signatures. We would like to automatically identify NULL.ed.ing as a subcase of the more general NULL.ed.ing.s. This is a difficult task to accomplish well, as English illustrates, for we would like to be able to determine that NULL.s is primarily a subcase of 's.NULL.s, and not of (e.g.) NULL.ed.s. 33 Determining the relationship between prefixation and suffixation. The system currently assumes that prefixes are to be stripped off the stem that has already been identified by suffix stripping. In future work, we would like to see alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship of prefixation and suffixation tested by the MDL criterion. Identifying compounds. In work reported in Goldsmith and Reutter (1998), we have explored the usefulness of the present system for determining the linking elements used in German compounds, but more work remains to be done to identify compounds in general. Here we run straight into the problem of assigning very short strings a lower likelihood of being words than longer strings. That is, it is difficult to avoid positing a certain number of very short stems, as in English m and an, the first because of pairs such as me and my, the second because of pairs such as an and any, but these facts should not be taken as strong evidence that man is a compound. As noted at the outset, the present algorithm is limited in its ability to discover the morphology of a language in which there are not a sufficient number of words with only one suffix in the corpus. In work in progress, we are developing a related algorithm that deals with the","33 We noted in the preceding section that we can estimate the likelihood of a subsignature assuming a multinomial distribution. We can in fact do better than was indicated there, in the sense that for a given observed signature a*, whose suffixes constitute a subset of a larger signature ~r, we can compute the likelihood that a is responsible for the generation of ¢*, where {¢i} are the frequencies (summing to 1.0) associating with each of the suffixes in a, and {ci} are the counts of the corresponding suffixes in the observed signature a*:"]},{"title":"it1 ) it[,","paragraphs":["~,[Cl], [c2] .....

Conclusion Linguists face at the present time the question of whether, and to what extent, information-theoretic notions will play a significant role in our understanding of linguistic theory over the years to come, and the present system perhaps casts a small ray of light in this area. As we have already noted, MDL analysis makes clear what the two areas are in which an analysis can be judged: it can be judged in its ability to deal with the data, as measured by its ability to compress the data, and it can be judged on its complexity as a theory. While the former view is undoubtedly controversial when viewed from the light of mainstream linguistics, it is the prospect of being able to say something about the complexity of a theory that is potentially the most exciting. Even more importantly, to the extent that we can make these notions explicit, we stand a chance of being able to develop an explicit model of language acquisition employing these ideas.","A natural question to ask is whether the algorithm presented here is intended to be understood as a hypothesis regarding the way in which human beings acquire morphology. I have not employed, in the design of this algorithm, a great deal of innate knowledge regarding morphology, but that is for the simple reason that knowledge of how words divide into subpieces is an area of knowledge which no one would take to be innate in any direct fashion: if"]},{"title":"sanity","paragraphs":["is parsed as"]},{"title":"san + ity","paragraphs":["in one language, it may perfectly well be parsed as"]},{"title":"sa + nity in","paragraphs":["another language.","That is, while passion may flame disagreements between partisans of Universal Grammar and partisans of statistically grounded empiricism regarding the task of syntax acquisition, the task which we have studied here is a considerably more humble one, which must in some fashion or other be figured out by grunt work by the language learner. It thus allows us a much sharper image of how powerful the tools are likely to be that the language acquirer brings to the task. And"]},{"title":"does","paragraphs":["the human child perform computations at all like the ones proposed here?","From most practical points of view, nothing hinges on our answer to this question, but it is a question that ultimately we cannot avoid facing. Reformulated a bit, one might pose the question, does the young language learner--who has access not only to the spoken language, but perhaps also to the rudiments of the syntax and to the intended meaning of the words and sentences--does the young learner have access to additional information that simplifies the task of morpheme identification? It is the belief that the answer to this question is"]},{"title":"yes","paragraphs":["that drives the intuition (if one has 189 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 this intuition) that an MDL-based analysis of the present sort is an unlikely model of human language acquisition.","But I think that such a belief is very likely mistaken. Knowledge of semantics and even grammar is unlikely to make the problem of morphology discovery significantly easier. In surveying the various approaches to the problem that I have explored (only the best of which have been described here), I do not know of any problem (of those which the present algorithm deals with successfully) that would have been solved by having direct access to either syntax or semantics. To the contrary: I have tried to find the simplest algorithm capable of dealing with the facts as we know them. The problem of determining whether two distinct signatures derive from a single larger paradigm would be simplified with such knowledge, but that is the exception and not the rule.","So in the end, I think that the hypothesis that the child uses an MDL-like analysis has a good deal going for it. In any event, it is far from clear to me how one could use information, either grammatical or contextual, to elucidate the problem of the discovery of morphemes without recourse to notions along the lines of those used in the present algorithm.","Of course, in all likelihood, the task of the present algorithm is not the same as the language learner's task; it seems unlikely that the child"]},{"title":"first","paragraphs":["determines what the words are in the language (at least, the words as they are defined in traditional orthographic terms) and then infers the morphemes. The more general problem of language acquisition is one that includes the problems of identifying morphemes, of identifying words both morphologically analyzed and nonanalyzed, of identifying syntactic categories of the words in question, and of inferring the rules guiding the distribution of such syntactic categories. It seems to me that the only manageable kind of approach to dealing with such a complex task is to view it as an optimization problem, of which MDL is one particular style.","Chomsky's early conception of generative grammar (Chomsky 1975 [1955]; henceforth"]},{"title":"LSLT)","paragraphs":["was developed along these lines as well; his notion of an evaluation metric for grammars was equivalent in its essential purpose to the description length of the morphology utilized in the present paper. The primary difference between the"]},{"title":"LSLT","paragraphs":["approach and the MDL approach is this: the"]},{"title":"LSLT","paragraphs":["approach conjectured that the grammar of a language could be factored into two parts, one universal and one language-particular; and when we look for the simplest grammatical description of a given corpus (the child's input) it is only the language-particular part of the description that contributes to complexity--that is what the theory stipulates. By contrast, the MDL approach makes minimal universal assumptions, and so the complexity of everything comprising the description of the corpus must be counted in determining the complexity of the description. The difference between these hypotheses vanishes asymptotically (as Janos Simon has pointed out to me) as the size of the language increases, or to put it another way, strong Chomskian rationalism is indistinguishable from pure empiricism as the information content of the (empiricist) MDL-induced grammar increases in size relative to the information content of UG. Rephrasing that slightly, the significance of Chomskian-style rationalism is greater, the simpler language-particular grammars are, and it is less significant as language-particular grammars grow larger, and in the limit, as the size of grammars grows asymptotically, traditional generative grammar is indistinguishable from MDL-style rationalism. We return to this point below.","There is a striking point that has so far remained tacit regarding the treatment of this problem in contemporary linguistic theory. That point is this: the problem addressed in this paper is not mentioned, not defined, and not addressed. The problem of dividing up words into morphemes is generally taken as one that is so trivial and 190 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language devoid of interest that morphologists, or linguists more generally, simply do not feel obliged to think about the problem. 34 In a very uninteresting sense, the challenge presented by the present paper to current morphological theory is no challenge at all, because morphological theory makes no claims to knowing how to discover morphological analysis; it claims only to know what to do once the morphemes have been identified.","The early generative grammar view, as explored in LSLT, posits a grammar of possible grammars, that is, a format in which the rules of the morphology and syntax must be written, and it establishes the semantics of these rules, which is to say, how they function. This grammar of grammars is called variously Universal Grammar, or Linguistic Theory, and it is generally assumed to be accessible to humans on the basis of an innate endowment, though one need not buy into that assumption to accept the rest of the theory. In Syntactic Structures (Chomsky 1957, 51ff.), Chomsky famously argued that the goal of a linguistic theory that produces a grammar automatically, given a corpus as input, is far too demanding a goal. His own theory cannot do that, and he suggests that no one else has any idea how to accomplish the task. He suggests furthermore that the next weaker position--that of developing a linguistic theory that could determine, given the data and the account (grammar), whether this was the best grammar--was still significantly past our theoretical reach, and he suggests finally that the next weaker position is a not unreasonable one to expect of linguistic theory: that it be able to pass judgment on which of two grammars is superior with respect to a given corpus.","That position is, of course, exactly the position taken by the MDL framework, which offers no help in coming up with analyses, but which is excellent at judging the relative merits of two analyses of a single corpus of data. In this paper, we have seen this point throughout, for we have carefully distinguished between heuristics, which propose possible analyses and modifications of analyses, on the one hand, and the MDL measurement, which makes the final judgment call, deciding whether to accept a modification proposed by the heuristics, on the other.","On so much, the early generative grammar of LSLT and MDL agree. But they disagree with regard to two points, and on these points, MDL makes clearer, more explicit claims, and both claims appear to be strongly supported by the present study. The two points are these: the generative view is that there is inevitably an idiosyncratic character to Universal Grammar that amounts to a substantive innate capacity, on the grounds (in part) that the task of discovering the correct grammar of a human language, given only the corpus available to the child, is insurmountable, because this corpus is not sufficient to home in on the correct grammar. The research strategy associated with this position is to hypothesize certain compression techniques (generally called \"rule formalisms\" in generative grammar) that lead to significant reduction in the size of the grammars of a number of natural languages, compared to what would have been possible without them. Sequential rule ordering is one such suggestion discussed at length in LSLT.","To reformulate this in a fashion that allows us to make a clearer comparison with MDL, we may formulate early generative grammar in the following way: To select the correct Universal Grammar out of a set of proposed Universal Grammars {UGi}, given corpora for a range of human languages, select that UG for which the sum of the sizes of the grammars for all of the corpora is the smallest. It does not follow--it need not be the case--that the grammar of English (or German, etc.) selected by the winning 34 Though see Dobrin (1999) for a sophisticated look at this problem. 191 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 UG is the shortest one of all the candidate English grammars, but the winning UG is all-round the supplier of the shortest grammars around the worldJ s","MDL could be formulated in those terms, undoubtedly, but it also can be formulated in a language-particular fashion, which is how it has been used in this paper. Generative grammar is inherently universalist; it has no language-particular format, other than to say that the best grammar for a given language is the shortest grammar.","But we know that such a position is untenable, and it is precisely out of that knowledge that MDL was born. The position is untenable because we can always make an arbitrarily small compression of a given set of data, if we are allowed to make the grammar arbitrarily complex, to match and, potentially, to overfit the data, and it is untenable because generative grammar offers no explicit notion of how well a grammar must match the training data. MDUs insight is that it is possible to make explicit the trade-off between complexity of the analysis and snugness of fit to the data-corpus in question.","The first tool in that computational trade-off is the use of a probabilistic model to compress the data, using stock tools of classical information theory. These notions were rejected as irrelevant by early workers in early generative grammar (Goldsmith 2001). Notions of probabilistic grammar due to Solomonoff (1995) were not integrated into that framework, and the possibility of using them to quantify the goodness of fit of a grammar to a corpus was not exploited.","It seems to me that it is in this context that we can best understand the way in which traditional generative grammar and contemporary probabilistic grammar formalism can be understood as complementing each other. I, at least, take it in that way, and this paper is offered in that spirit."]},{"title":"Appendix","paragraphs":["Since what we are really interested in computing is not the minimum description length as such, but rather the difference between the description length of one model and that of a variant, it is convenient to consider the general form of the difference between two MDL computations. In general, let us say we will compare two analyses $1 and $2 for the same corpus, where $2 typically contains some item(s) that $1 does not (or they may differ by where they break a string into factors). Let us write out the difference in length between these two analyses, as in (7)-(11), calculating the length of $1 minus the length of $2. The general formulas derived in (7)-(11) are not of direct computational interest; they serve rather as a template that can be filled in to compute the change in description length occasioned by a particular structural change in the morphology proposed by a particular heuristic. This template is rather complex in its most general form, but it simplifies considerably in any specific application. The heuristic determines which of the terms in these formulas take on nonzero values, and what their values are; the overall formula determines whether the change in question improves the description length. In addition, we may regard the formulas in","35 As the discussion in the text may suggest, I arn skeptical of the generative position, and I would like to identify what empirical result would confirm the generative position and dissolve my skepticism. The result would be the discovery of two grammars of English, G1 and G2, with the following properties: G1 is inherently simpler than G2, using some appropriate notion of Turing machine program complexity, and yet G2 is the correct grammar of English, based on some of the complexity of G2 being the responsibility of linguistic theory, hence \"free\" in the complexity competition between G1 and G2. That is, the proponent of the generative view must be willing to acknowledge that overall complexity of the grammar of a language may be greater than logically necessary due to evolution's investment in one particular style of programming language. 192 Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language (7)-(11) as offering us an exact and explicit statement of how a morphology can be improved.","The notation can be considerably simplified if we take some care in advance. Note first that in (7) and below, several items are subscripted to indicate whether they should be counted as in $1 or $2. Much of the simplification comes from observing, first, that log MI~ _ log 9 = log M22 - log ; second, that this difference is generally computed inside a summation over a set of morphemes, and hence the first term simplifies to a constant times the type count of the morphemes in the set in question. Indeed, so prevalent in these calculations is the formula log"]},{"title":"X~t~t~l","paragraphs":["Xstate2 that the introduction of a new abbreviation considerably simplifies the notation. We use A(x) to denote log ~, where the numerator is a count in $1, and the denominator a count of the same variable in $2; if no confusion would result, we write Ax. 36","Let us review the terms listed in (7)-(11). AN is a measure of the change in the number of total words due to tile proposed modification (the difference between the $1 and $2 analyses); an increase in the total number of words results in a slightly negative value.

Observe the final formulation, in which the first two terms involve suffixes present in both $1 and $2, while the third term involves suffixes present only in $1 and the fourth term involves suffixes present only in $2. This format will appear in all of the components of this computation. Recall that the function Ltypo specifies the length of a string in bits, which we may take here to be simply log(26) times the number of characters in the string.","In (9), we derive the corresponding formula for the stem component.","The general form of the computation of the change to the signature component (10) is more complicated, and this complexity motivates a little bit more notation to simplify it. First, we can compute the change in the pointers to the signatures, and the information that each signature contains regarding the count of its stems and suffixes","36 We beg the reader's indulgence in recognizing that we prepend the operator A immediately to the left of the name of a set to indicate the change in the size of the counts of the set, which is to say, \"AW\" is shorthand for \"A([W])\", and \"A(W}\" for \"A((W))\". 193 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 as in (10a). But the heart of the matter is the treatment of the stems and suffixes within the signatures, given in (10b)-(10d).","Bear in mind, first of all, that each signature consists of a list of pointers to stems, and a list of pointers to suffixes. The treatment of suffixes is given in (10d), and is relatively straightforward, but the treatment of stems (10c) is a bit more complex. Recall that all items on the stem list will be pointed to by exactly one stem pointer, located in some particular signature. All stem pointers in a signature that point to stems on the suffix list are directly described a \"simple\" word, a notion we have already encountered: a word whose stem is not further analyzable. But other words may be complex, that is, may contain a stem whose pointer is to an analyzable word, and hence the stem's representation consists of a pointer triple: a pointer to a signature, a stem within the signature, and a suffix within the signature. And each stem pointer is preceded by a flag indicating which type of stem it is.","We thus have three things whose difference in the two states, $1 and $2, we wish to compute. The difference of the lengths of the flag is given in (10c.i). In (10c.ii), we need change in the total length of the pointers to the stems, and this has actually already been computed, during the computation of (9). 37 Finally in (10c.iii), the set of pointers from certain stem positions to words consists of pointers to all of the words that we have already labeled as being in Wo and we can compute the length of these pointers by adding counts to these words; the length of the pointers to these words needs to be computed anyway in determining the compressed length of the corpus. This completes the computations needed to compare two states of the morphology.","In addition, we must compute the difference in the compressed length of the corpus in the two states, and this is given in (11).

The figure computed in (9) describes an aspect of the complexity of the morphology as a whole, whereas the computation described here in the text is what it is because we have made the assumption that each stem occurs in exactly one signature. That assumption is not, strictly speaking, correct in natural language; we could well imagine an analysis that permitted the same stem to appear in several distinction signatures, and in that case, the computation here would not reduce to (9).
