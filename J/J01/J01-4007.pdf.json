What Is Centering?","paragraphs":["Centering theory (henceforth CT) is a theory of local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text. The main assumptions of the theory as presented by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) (GJW) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) can be summarized as follows: . . . For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity that is the center of attention. There is a preference, formalized as Rule 2, (1) for consecutive utterances within a discourse segment to keep the same entity as the center of attention, and (2) for the entity most prominently realized in an utterance to be identified as the center of attention. The center of attention is the entity that is most likely to be pronominalized: this preference is formalized as Rule 1. These principles are more precisely explicated in Section 2.","An entity may become prominent as a referential link between successive utterances, or it may deliberately be made prominent, for example, through a less oblique grammatical role or by being mentioned early in a sentence. An attraction for natural language processing practitioners has been that CT's predictions are based on easily computable structural properties of utterances rather than costly content-based reasoning.","Standard expositions of CT hold that there is a total preference ordering over types of transitions between utterances defined in terms of the tests mentioned in Point 2 above and formulated as Rule 2 in Table 1.

On the one hand, the stipulated preference for Retain over Smooth Shift has not been confirmed by empirical evidence, and cannot be naturally incorporated in standard generation architectures. On the other hand, there is no mechanism within the theory to predict specific cases where a Retain or a Shift may be preferred over a Continue transition, as in the Retain-Shift pattern that has been argued to signal the introduction of a new discourse topic (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987 [BFP]; Strube and Hahn 1999). I aim to overcome these difficulties under an analysis that gives a partial ordering of the classic transitions, incorporating a \"streamlined\" version of Strube and Hahn's notion of \"cheapness\" to handle the Retain-Shift pattern.

They note that the BFP ranking is not appropriate for German, which they say is a free-word-order language (page 310); more accurately, relative order of NPs within a clause is not determined by grammatical role to the extent that it is in English. For the purposes of this paper, there is no need to commit to either BFP's or Strube and Hahn's rankings, or to go into the details of the latter's \"functional centering\" model, as both make the same predictions for the examples considered. Strube and Hahn themselves (page 334) state that the grammatical and functional analyses achieved consistent results for all examples in GJW. I adopt the ranking by grammatical role for purposes of exposition. 2.1 \"Salience\" and \"Cohesion\" Transitions are defined in terms of two tests: whether the Cb stays the same (Cb(Un) = Cb(U,~-I)), and whether the Cb is realized as the most prominent NP (grammatically or otherwise): Cb(Un) = Cp(Un). For the sake of convenience and concision, I refer to the first of these tests as cohesion and the second as salience; it is important to keep in mind that I use the terms in these defined and limited ways, and to disregard (for the time being) other uses of the terms in the literature. There are four possible combinations, which are displayed in Table 2, resulting in the named transitions Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and Rough Shift. The optimal case, where both salience and cohesion obtain, is Continue; the least preferred is Rough Shift. Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998), following BFP, stipulate that Retain is preferred over Smooth Shift, which implies that cohesion is a stronger requirement than salience. However, corpus analyses reported by di Eugenio (1998, page 127), Hurewitz (1998, pages 280ff.), and Passoneau (1998, pages 338ff.) do not support this claim. In fact, all these researchers found a higher percentage of Smooth Shifts than Retains. In a spoken corpus, Passoneau found more Shifts than Continues.","A preponderance of Shifts over Continues may reflect the domain and content of a text rather than the author's organizational goals. In fact, it can be seen that sequences of Smooth Shifts are rather natural in certain kinds of narrative or descriptive texts; see Example 1 (adapted from a pharmaceutical leaflet).","Example 1 a. The name of your medicine / is Compound X.","b. Iti contains budesonideJ. (Continue) 581 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4","c. Thisj is one of a group of medicines called corticosteroids k. (Smooth Shift)","d. Thesek can help to relieve the symptoms of hay fever or rhinitis. (Smooth Shift) This does not appear to be an incoherent text, but there is no way that the content could be rearranged to turn the Shifts into Continues. However, we can see that the author has maintained centering coherence as far as the content allows.","We may conclude that not only does corpus evidence fail to confirm the canonical ordering, but in fact corpus analysis itself is not sufficient to evaluate the claims of CT without taking into account the underlying semantic content of a text. That is, statistics about the relative frequency of occurrences of different transition types do not in themselves tell us much about which transitions are preferred in particular situations since they do not take account of the choices available to an author. 1 A more promising approach is that of Brennan (1998), who gave subjects the controlled narrative task of providing a running commentary on a video recording of a basketball game, and used the videotape itself to construct a \"propositional script\" listing the sequence of events and their participants, and identifying players who were likely to continue as the center of attention over a sequence of incidents. 2.2 Rule 2 Applied to Generation Reiter (1994) claimed that existing generation systems converged on a \"consensus,\" generic natural language generation (NLG) architecture consisting of the following tasks:","• Content determination/text planning: deciding the content of a message and organizing the component propositions into a text tree;","• Sentence planning: aggregating propositions into clausal units and choosing lexical items corresponding to concepts in the knowledge base, including referring expressions;","• Linguistic realization: taking care of surface details such as agreement and orthography. I have argued elsewhere (Kibble 1999) that if CT is to be implemented in an NLG system, the principles I call \"salience\" and \"cohesion\" belong to different tasks within this scheme: \"salience\" is a matter for sentence planning, choosing a verb form or some other construction that makes the"]},{"title":"Cb","paragraphs":["prominent within a clause or sentence, while \"cohesion\"---ordering propositions in a text to maintain referential continuity-- is a matter for text planning.

(Strube and Hahn 1999, page 334) This claim is supported by analysis of a variety of German texts.

Note that the absence of salience against (d) is not penalized for reasons explained above. 585 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4","This example suggests a need for optimization over sequences of more than two utterances. In a sequence Continue-Retain-Smooth Shift, the Shift is predicted in its local context but the Retain is not; although Retain is a cheap transition following Continue, another Continue would be cheap as well. The Retain is motivated as it allows a new topic to be introduced with a \"cheap\" Smooth Shift, and so we need to evaluate the whole sequence Continue-Retain-Smooth Shift. This illustrates that while a sequence that conforms to the cheapness principle may reduce the cognitive load on the hearer, it can actually increase the load on the speaker owing to the need to plan ahead beyond the current utterance. In fact, the proposals outlined here do not entail that speakers must plan the entire content and structure of sentences so far in advance. Rather, they entail that a speaker knows when uttering Un that he or she intends to express a particular fact about a particular entity E in utterance U,,+2; and it entails that the speaker would do well to prepare the hearer for this by making E prominent in utterance Un+l. The hypothesis is that speakers will make a degree of effort to help hearers to process their utterances smoothly, rather than opportunistically planning and realizing sentences one by one, but not to the extent of planning all the transitions in a discourse segment in advance of uttering anything. 4. Conclusion Comparison of the standard preference ordering for centering transitions and Strube and Hahn's (1999) variant has established the following points:","1. The strict ordering of canonical transitions assumed by GJW and others has not (so far) been confirmed by corpus evidence and does not naturally fit into generation architectures. There is no mechanism to predict the Retain-Shift sequence to introduce a new discourse topic.","2. By reducing Rule 2 to a requirement for cheap transition pairs, Strube and Hahn weaken the predictive power of the theory while complicating the apparatus with two additional transitions and a 36-position table of cheap versus expensive pairs.","I have argued that in fact we can dispense with not only Strube and Hahn's two new transition types but the four old ones as well, retaining them only for descriptive convenience. The various different transitions can be seen to emerge in a partial, contextdependent ordering as a result of the interaction of cohesion, salience, and cheapness. Following established practice in empirical work such as that discussed in Section 2.1, centering coherence is applied to inter- as well as intrasegmental transitions. The modified proposal is still weaker than GJW's original formulation as a wider variety of texts is tolerated. This underscores the fact that referential continuity as specified by CT may play an essential part in computing the overall coherence of utterance transitions but it is only one of the determinants of discourse structure.
