The purpose of this paper is twofold:first, to suggest the use of a complementary \"backup\" method to increase the robustness of any hand-crafted or machine-learning-based NE tagger; and second, to explore the effectiveness of using more fine-grained evidence--namely, syntactic and semantic contextual knowledge--in classifying NEs. 1. Proper Noun Classification","paragraphs":["In this paper we present a corpus-driven statistical technique that uses a learning corpus to acquire contextual classification cues, and then uses the results of this phase to classify unrecognized proper nouns (PN) in an unlabeled corpus. Training examples of proper nouns are obtained using any available named entity (NE) recognizer (in our experiments we used a rule-based recognizer and a machine-learning-based recognizer). The contextual model of PN categories is learned without supervision.","The approach described in this paper is complementary to current methods for NE recognition: our objective is to improve, without additional manual effort, the robustness of any available NE system through the use of more \"fine-grained\" contextual knowledge, best exploited at a relatively late stage of analysis. The method is particularly useful when an available NE system must be rapidly adapted to another language or to another domain, provided the shift is not dramatic.","Furthermore, our study provides experimental evidence relating to two issues still under debate: i) the effectiveness, in practical NLP applications, of using syntactic relations (most systems use plain collocations and morphological features), and ii) context expansion based on thesauri. While we do not provide a definitive argument in favor of syntactic contexts and semantic expansion for word sense disambiguation tasks in general, we do show that they can be successfully used for unknown proper noun classification. Proper nouns have particular characteristics, such as low or zero ambiguity, which makes it easier to characterize their contexts. 2. Description of the U_PN Classification Method In this section we briefly summarize the corpus-based tagging technique for the classification of unknown proper nouns (for more details, see Cucchiarelli, Luzi, and Velardi [1998]). * Istituto di Informatica, Via Brecce Bianche 1-60131 Ancona, Italy.

Experimental Discussion The purpose of experimental evaluation is twofold: To test the improvement in robustness of a state-of-the-art NE recognizer. To study the effectiveness of syntactic contexts and of a \"cautious\" context generalization on the performance of the U_PN tagger, analyzed in isolation. The effect of generalization is studied by gradually relaxing the notion of similarity in the formula of evidence and by tuning, through the factors a and fl, the contribution of generalized contexts to the formula of evidence.","In our experiment, we used the Italian Sole24Ore half-million-word corpus on financial news, the one-million-word Wall Street Journal corpus, and WordNet, as standard on-line available resources, as well as a series of computational tools made available for our research:","• the VIE system (Humphreys et al. 1996) for initial detection of Proper Nouns from the learning corpus; for the same purpose we also used a machine learning method based on decision lists, described in Paliouras, Karkaletsis, and Spyropolous (1998).","• the SSA shallow syntactic analyzer (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1994) for surface corpus parsing. 6","• the tool described in Cucchiarelli and Velardi (1998) for corpus-driven WordNet pruning. 7 4.1 Experiment 1: Improving Robustness of NE Recognizers The objective of Experiment 1 is to verify the improvement in robustness of existing NE recognizers, through the use of our tagger. In Figure 1, three testing experiments are shown. The table measures the local performance of the NE tagging task achieved by the early NE recognizer, by our untrained tagger, and finally, the joint performance of the two methods.","In the first test, we used the Italian Sole24Ore corpus. Due to the unavailability of WordNet in Italian, we used a dictionary of strict synonyms for context expansion. In this test, we \"loosely\" adapted the English VIE system (as used in MUC-6) to Italian. 5 In Velardi and Cucchiarelli (2000) we formally studied the relation between category type and learnability of contextual cues for WSD. 6 We also used the GATE partial parser. We were not as successful with this parser because it is not designed for high-performance VP3?P and NP-PP detection, but prepositional contexts are often the most informative indicators. 7 This method produces a 20-30% reduction of the initial WordNet ambiguity, depending on the specific corpus. 127 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1","A B C D E F G H I J K L Test 1 239 355 67.32% 339 70.50% 60 83 72.29% 75 80.00% 84.23% 88.20% Test 2 650 793 81.90% 759 85.63% 67 83 80.72% 80 83.75% 90.42% 94.47% Test 3 3,040 4,168 72.94% 3,233 94.03% 585 935 62.57% 810 72.22% 86.97% 89.66%","Legend A: PNs correctly tagged by the early NE recognizer B: Total PNs in the Test Corpus C: Local Recall of the early NE recognizer (A/B) D: Total PNs detected by the early NE recognizer (D = A + A1 (errors) + G(unknown) E: Local Precision of the early NE recognizer (A/D) F: UPNs correctly tagged by the UPN tagger in the Test Corpus G: Total UPNs not detected by the early NE recognizer H: Local recall of UPN tagger (Phase2) (F/G) I: Total UPNs for which a decision was possible by the UPN tagger ]: Local precision of the UPN tagger K: Joint Recall of the two methods (A + F)/B L: Joint Precision of the two methods (A+F)/D Figure 1 Outline of results on the Sole24Ore corpus. We used the English gazetteer as it was and we applied simple \"language porting\" to the NE grammar (e.g., replacing English words and prepositions with corresponding Italian words, and little more), s This justifies the low performance of the rule-based classifier. Note that our context-based tagger produces a considerable improvement in performance (around 18%), therefore the global performance (column K and L) turns out to be comparable with state-of-the-art systems, without a significant readaptation effort.","In the second test, we used again VIE, on the English Wall Street Journal corpus. We used a version of VIE that was designed to detect NE in a management succession domain (we are testing the effect of a domain shift here). Local performance was somewhat lower than in MUC-6. Again, we measured a 9% improvement using our tagger, and very high global performance.","The third test was the most demanding. Here, we used only half of the named entity gazetteer used in previous experiments. The purpose of this test was also to verify the effect on performance of a poorly populated gazetteer. In this test, rather than using LASIE, we used a machine learning method described in Paliouras, Karkaletsis and Spyropolous (1998). This method uses as a training set the available half of the gazetteer to learn a context-based decision list for NE classification.","As shown in Test 3, column B, the initial number of PNs in the test corpus is now considerably higher. The decision-list classifier is tuned to classify with high precision and lower recall. Therefore, only the \"hardest\" cases are submitted to our untrained classifier. In fact, local performance of our classifier is around 10% lower than for previous tests, but nevertheless, global performance (in terms of joint precision and recall) shows an improvement. Finally, we observe that the performance figures reported in Figure 1 say nothing about the various sources of errors. Errors and misses occur both during the off-line learning phase (as we said, NE instances and syntactic contexts 8 Most location and company names known worldwide (e.g., NewYork, IBM) are in fact mentioned in economic journals regardless of the language. 128 Cucchiarelli and Velardi Unsupervised Named Entity Recognition are not inspected for correctness, therefore the contextual knowledge base is error prone) and prior to the U_PN tagging phase: a compound PN may be incompletely recognized during POS tagging, causing the generation of an uninformative syntactic context (e.g., \"Owens Illinois\" at the beginning of a sentence is recognized as \"owens Illinois\", causing a spurious NdN(owen,Illinois) context to be generated).","Because all these \"external\" sources of noise are not filtered out, we may then reliably conclude that our tagger is effective at improving the robustness of proper noun classification, though clearly the amount of improvement depends upon the baseline performances of the early method used for PN classification.","Although the classification evidence provided by syntactic contexts is somewhat noise prone, it proves to be useful as a \"backup,\" when other \"simpler\" contextual evidence does not allow a reliable decision. 4.2 Effectiveness of Syntactic and Semantic Cues for Semantic Classification In a second experiment, we used the experimental set up of Test 2 (WSJ+VIE described above) to evaluate the effectiveness of context expansion on system performance. We applied a pruning method on WordNet (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 1998) to reduce initial ambiguity of contexts. This pruning method allowed an average of 27% reduction in the initial ambiguity of the total number of the 13,428 common nouns in the Wall Street Journal corpus. The objective of this experiment was to allow a more detailed evaluation of our method, with respect to several parameters.","We built four test sets with the same distribution of PN categories and frequency distribution as in the application corpus. We selected four frequency ranges (1, 2, 3-9, > 10) and in each range we selected 100 PNs, reflecting the frequency distribution in the corpus of the three main PN semantic categories--Person, Organization, and Location. We then built another test set, called TSAll, with 400 PNs again reflecting the frequency and category distribution of the corpus. The 400 PNs were then removed from the set of 37,018 esls extracted by our parser and from the gazetteer (whenever included).","In this experiment, we wanted to measure the performance of the U_PN tagger over the 400 words in the test set, in terms of F-measure, according to several varying factors: • the category type;","• the amount of initial contextual evidence (i.e., the frequency range, reflected by the different test sets); • the factors oe and fl, i.e., the influence of local and generalized contexts; • the level of generalization L.","Figures 2 summarizes the results of the experiment. Figure 2(a) shows the increase in performance as a function of the values of oe and fl and the generalization level. N means no generalization, only the evidence provided by ESLA is computed; 0 means that ESLB collects the evidence provided by contexts in which w is a strict synonym of x according to WordNet; 1, 2, and 3 refer to incremental levels of generalization in the (pruned) WordNet hierarchy. The figure shows that context generalization produces up to 7% improvement in performance. Best results are obtained with L = 2 and ~ = 0.7, fl = 0.3. Further generalization may cause a drop in performance. High ambiguity is the cause of this behavior, despite WordNet pruning (without WordNet pruning, we observed a performance inversion at level 1; this experiment is not reported due to 129 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 hi1% i ..,\" .,\" \"//(l=o ?, ]3 0 3 ~% 4 o 3 I~ 41 7 76% 9S~, I","N \" Level of Gen~ralizatlon (a) Figure 2 Evaluation of the effectiveness of context expansion. f:2 t~ (b) limitations of space). Figure 2(b) illustrates the influence of initial contextual evidence. Recognition of singleton PNs remains almost constant as the contribution of generalized and nongeneralized contexts varies. Looking more in detail, we observe that recall increases with fl -- (1- c~), but precision decreases. Generalization on the basis of a unique context does not allow any filtering of spurious senses, while when grouping several contexts, spurious senses gain lower evidence (as anticipated in Section 3).","Finally, we designed an experiment to evaluate the influence of the test set com-position on the U_PN tagger performances. We performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA test [Hoel 1971]) on the results obtained by processing nine different test sets of 400 PNs each, selected randomly. In all our experiments the details of which we omit, for lack of space), we found that the U-PN tagging method performances were independent of the variations of the test set.","References","Agirre, Eneko and German Rigau. 1996.
