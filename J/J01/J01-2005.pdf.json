In this paper, we show that, under certain conditions, Shieber ' s algorithm produces what we call a nonminimal derivation: a parse tree which contains additional features that are not in the licensing productions. While Shieber's definition of parse tree allows for such nonminimal derivations, we claim that they should be viewed as invalid. We describe the sources of the nonminimal derivation problem, and propose a precise definition of minimal parse tree, as well as a modification to Shieber's algorithm which ensures minimality, although at some computational cost. 1. Introduction Unification grammar is a term often used to describe a family of feature-based grammar formalisms, including GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985), PATR-II (Shieber 1986), DCG (Pereira and Warren 1980), and HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994). In an effort to formalize the common elements of unification-style grammars, Shieber (1992) developed a logic for describing them, and used this logic to define an abstract parsing algorithm. The algorithm uses the same set of operations as Earley's (1970) algorithm for context-free grammars, but modified for unification grammars.","In this paper, we show that, under certain conditions, Shieber's algorithm produces unintended, spurious parses in addition to the intended ones. We call these spurious parses nonminimal derivations (or nonminimal parse trees), because they contain extra features which are not in the productions that license the parse, a We claim that such nonminimal derivations are invalid. The basis of our claim is that the unification operation as set union preserves minimality; thus any correct unification-based parsing algorithm should produce parses that contain all and only features from the licensing productions (i.e., minimal derivations or minimal parse trees). Nonminimal derivations are also undesirable in practice because, given a parse tree, we cannot tell whether a particular feature should be in the model or not unless we reconstruct the whole tree.","Despite the nonminimal derivations, Shieber (1992) proved the correctness of his algorithm.

However, in this paper we focus on parse trees as the final result of derivation, thus we mean that a derivation is nonminimal when its result is a nonminimal parse, in contrast to a minimal derivation which produces a minimal parse. Unfortunately, formal definitions of minimal and nonminimal derivations are outside the scope of this short paper; interested readers are encouraged to read Tomuro (1999).

To solve this twofold problem, we propose an alternate definition of minimal parse tree for unification grammars, and present a modification to Shieber's algorithm which ensures minimality.","It is important to note that the same spurious parses also occur in context-free parsing, specifically in Earley's algorithm. However, since the only information a constituent carries in context-free grammar is the grammar symbol, the spurious derivations only produce exactly the same results as the normal ones. When the algorithm is extended to unification grammar, however, these spurious parses are a problem. 2. Unification Grammar and Parse Trees Shieber (1992) defines a unification grammar as a 3-tuple (G, P, p0), where ~ is the vocabulary of the grammar, P is the set of productions, and P0 E P is the start production. G contains L, a set of labels (feature names); C, a set of constants (feature values); and W, a set of terminals. There are two kinds of productions in P: phrasal and lexical. A phrasal production is a 2-tuple (a, ~), where a is the arity of the rule (the number of right-hand-side [RHS] constituents), and ~ is a logical formula. Typically, q~ is a conjunction of equations of the form pl - p2 or pl -\" c, where pl, p2 E L* are paths, and c E C. In an equation, any path which begins with an integer i (1 < i < a) represents the ith RHS constituent of the rule. 2 A lexical production is a 2-tuple (w, ~), where w E W and q~ is the same as above, except that there are no RHS constituents. Figure 1 shows some example phrasal and lexical productions (P0 corresponds to the context-free rule S --+ NP VP and is the start production). Then a model M relates to a formula q~ by a satisfaction relation ~ as usual (M ~ ~), and when q~ is the formula in a production p = (a, ~), p is said to license M.","Based on the logic above, Shieber defines a parse tree and the language of a grammar expressed in his formalism.

Then the expectation is unified with a production (~'), which can consistently rewrite it.

Both rules perform the correct unification by utilizing the embedding operator (signified by \\), which places a model M under a path p (M\\p).","We illustrate these operators with a simple step-by-step example parse. Consider the grammar that consists of the rules presented in Figure 1. Using this grammar, Figure 3 shows the parse of the sentence John sleeps. First, the Initial Item operator is applied, producing item I0, whose model is mm(~o). Next, the Scanning operator scans the word John, producing 11. The Prediction operator then produces 12. Next, the word sleeps is scanned (since the first subconstituent of the model in 12 is a V), producing 13. Finally, since the item in 13 is complete (d = 1, the arity of production p2), Completion is applied to items 11 and/3, producing 14. Model M4 is the final parse of the sentence. 4. Nonminimal Derivations In Section 2, we noted that Shieber's definition of parse trees allows them to be nonminimal. We consider these to be invalid based on a principle that, since the unification operation as set union preserves minimality (as proved in Shieber, [1992]), repeated applications of unification using licensing productions should result in parses that contain features only from those productions and nothing more.

In the example, items 12 = (1,1, p2, M2, 0/ and I~ -- (1,1, P4, M~, 0) (as well as I2 and I~ ~ = (1,1, p2, M~ ~, 0/) are two such items. Since the two predictions did not have any conflicting features from the beginning, a situation may occur where a completion generated from one prediction can fill the other prediction without causing conflict. When this happens, features that were in the other prediction but not the original one become nonminimal in the resulting model.","As to what causes nonminimal situations, we speculate that there are a number of possibilRies. First, nonminimal derivations occur when a prediction is filled by a complete item that was not generated from the prediction. This mismatch will not happen if parsing is done in one direction only (e.g. purely top-down or bottom-up parsing). Thus, the mixed-direction parsing strategy is a contributing factor.","Second, wrong complete items are retrieved because Shieber's item-based algorithm makes all partial results available during parsing, as if they are kept in a global structure (such as a chart in chart parsing). But if the accessibility of items were some-how restricted, prediction-completion mismatch would not happen. In this respect, other chart-based algorithms for unification grammars which adopt mixed-direction parsing strategy, including head-corner parsing (van Noord 1997) and left-corner parsing (Alshawi 1992), are subject to the same problem.","Third, extra features can only appear when the grammar contains rules which interact in a certain way (such as rules P2 and P4 above). If the grammar contained no such rules, or if p (the filtering function applied in Prediction) filtered out those features, even the prediction-completion mismatch would not produce nonminimal derivations.","As we stated in the beginning of this section, we consider nonminimal parses to be invalid on the basis of minimality. It then immediately follows that any parsing algorithm that produces nonminimal parses is considered to be unsound; in particular, Shieber's algorithm is unsound. However, since nonminimal parse trees have the same yield as their minimal counterparts, his algorithm does indeed recognize exactly the language of a given grammar. So, Shieber's algorithm is sound as a recognizer, 6 but not as a transducer or parser (as in van Noord, [1997]) where the correctness of output models (i.e., parse trees) is critical. In other words, Shieber's algorithm is correct"]},{"title":"up to","paragraphs":["5 Note that adding (head modified) -- false to ~2 (VP --* V) or ~3"]},{"title":"(sleeps)","paragraphs":["is not feasible, because they cannot specify the"]},{"title":"modified","paragraphs":["feature at their level, 6 In fact, Shieber hints at this: \"The process of parsing (more properly, recognition)...\" (Shieber 1992, 78). 282 Tomuro and Lytinen Nonminimal Derivations licensing, but incorrect on the basis of a stronger criteria of minimality. Thus, to guarantee correctness based on minimality, we need another algorithm; such an algorithm is exactly the solution to the nonminimal derivation problem. 5. Practical Techniques Before presenting our solution to the nonminimal derivation problem, we discuss several possible practical techniques to get around the problem in implemented systems. These are known techniques, which have been applied to solve other problems in unification-based systems. However, most of them only offer partial solutions to the nonminimal derivation problem. First, whenever Shieber's algorithm produces a nonminimal derivation, it also produces a corresponding minimal derivation (Tomuro 1999). Thus, one possible solution is to use subsumption to discard items that are more specific than any other items that are produced. Subsumption has often been used in unification-based systems to pack items or models (e.g., Alshawi 1992). However, simple subsumption may filter out valid parses for some grammars, thus sacrificing completeness. 7","Another possibility is to filter out problematic features in the Prediction step by using the function p. However, automatic detection of such features (i.e., automatic derivation of p) is undecidable for the same reason as the prediction nontermination problem (caused by left recursion) for unification grammars (Shieber 1985). Manual detection is also problematic: when a grammar is large, particularly if semantic features are included, complete detection is nearly impossible. As for the techniques developed so far which (partially) solve prediction nontermination (e.g., Shieber 1985; Haas 1989; Samuelsson 1993), they do not apply to nonminimal derivations because nonminimal derivations may arise without left recursion or recursion in general s One way is to define p to filter out all features except the context-free backbone of predictions. However, this severely restricts the range of possible instantiations of Shieber's algorithm. 9","A third possibility is to manually fix the grammar so that nonminimal derivations do not occur, as we noted in Section 4. However, this approach is problematic for the same reason as the manual derivation of p mentioned above. 6. Modified Algorithm Finally, we propose an algorithm that does not produce nonminimal derivations. It is a modification of Shieber's algorithm that incorporates parent pointers. Figure 6 shows 7 For example, when there are two predictions M1 and M2 for category C and a production p where M1 : {<cat> -- C, <x> - a}, M2 : {<cat> - C, <y> - b}, and p = <1, {<cat> - C, <1 cat> \"- D, <x> - a}> respectively, the resulting model M2 ~ = {<cat> - C, <1 cat> - D, <x> -- a, <y> -- b} will have strictly more information than the other resulting model MI' = {<cat> ~ C, <1 cat> - D, <x> - a}, although both models are minimal. 8 We do not show any particular example here, but if we change the left-recursive VP rule in the earlier example to a non-left-recursive rule, for instance VP --* VP2 ADV, and add some rules, a nonrninimal parse will indeed arise.","Note also that some (but not all) cases of prediction nontermination will produce nonminimal derivations. Those cases occur when there is a prediction for a category, and repeated applications of some left-recursive rule(s) generate predictions for the same category that are not mutually exclusive to the original prediction or each other. 9 In head-corner parsing, Sikkel (1997) proposes the use of transitive features: features that propagate only through head arcs. However, this method does not solve nonminimal derivations either, because problematic features may be subfeatures of a head (such as the example case shown earlier), which will not be filtered. 283 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 2 INITIAL ITEM: PREDICTION:"]},{"title":"(id, nil, (O,O, po, mm( ~o),O) )","paragraphs":["' where"]},{"title":"id","paragraphs":["is a new symbol"]},{"title":"(id, pid, (i,j,p","paragraphs":["= (a,"]},{"title":"~),M,d) )","paragraphs":["(id',"]},{"title":"id, (j,j,","paragraphs":["p',"]},{"title":"p(M/ (d+l) ) U","paragraphs":["mm(~I,'), 0))' where"]},{"title":"id I","paragraphs":["is a new symbol, and d ( a and pl = (ar,~t) C P SCANNING: COMPLETION:"]},{"title":"(id, pid, (i,j,p = (a, ~),M,d) ) (id, pid, (i,j+l,p,M U mm( ~') \\","paragraphs":["(d+l),d+l)) ' where d < a and"]},{"title":"(wj+D ~') E P (id, pid,(i,j,p,M,d)) (id\",id,(j,k,p',M',a'))","paragraphs":["where d < a"]},{"title":"(ia, pie, (i,k,p, UU (U' \\","paragraphs":["(d+l)),d+l)) ' Figure 6 Shieber's parsing operations modified. the modified algorithm.
