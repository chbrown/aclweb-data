Vijay-Shankert University of Delaware There is considerable interest among computational linguists in lexicalized grammatical frameworks; lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) is one widely studied example. In this paper, we investigate how derivations in LTAG can be viewed not as manipulations of trees but as manipulations of tree descriptions. Changing the way the lexicalized formalism is viewed raises questions as to the desirability of certain aspects of the formalism. We present a new formalism, d-tree substitution grammar (DSG). Derivations in DSG involve the composition of d-trees, special kinds of tree descriptions. Trees are read off from derived d-trees. We show how the DSG formalism, which is designed to inherit many of the characterestics of LTAG, can be used to express a variety of linguistic analyses not available in LTAG. 1. Introduction There is considerable interest among computational linguists in lexicalized grammatical frameworks. From a theoretical perspective, this interest is motivated by the widely held assumption that grammatical structure is projected from the lexicon. From a practical perspective, the interest stems from the growing importance of word-based corpora in natural language processing. Schabes (1990) defines a lexicalized grammar as a grammar in which every elementary structure (rules, trees, etc.) is associated with a lexical item and every lexical item is associated with a finite set of elementary structures of the grammar. Lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Joshi and Schabes 1991) is a widely studied example of a lexicalized grammatical formalism. 1","In LTAG, the elementary structures of the grammar are phrase structure trees. Because of the extended domain of locality of a tree (as compared to a context-free string rewriting rule), the elementary trees of an LTAG can provide possible syntactic contexts for the lexical item or items that anchor the tree, i.e., from which the syntactic structure in the tree is projected. LTAG provides two operations for combining trees: substitution and adjunction. The substitution operation appends one tree at a frontier node of another tree. The adjunction operation is more powerful: it can be used to insert one tree within another. This property of adjoining has been widely used in the LTAG literature to provide an account for long-distance dependencies.

This shows that adjunction changes the structural relationship between some of the nodes in the tree into which adjunction occurs.","In LTAG, the lexicalized elementary objects are defined in such a way that the structural relationships between the anchor and each of its dependents change during the course of a derivation through the operation of adjunction, as just illustrated. This approach is not the only possibility. An alternative would be to define the relationships between the nodes of the elementary objects in such a way that these relationships hold throughout the derivation, regardless of how the derivation proceeds.","This perspective on the LTAG formalism was explored in Vijay-Shanker (1992) where, following the principles of d-theory parsing (Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck 1983), LTAG was seen as a system manipulating descriptions of trees rather than as a tree 2 The same analysis holds for wh-movement, but we use topicalization as an example in order to avoid the superficial complication of the auxiliary needed in English questions.

Elementary objects are descriptions of possible syntactic contexts for the anchor, formalized in a logic for describing nodes and the relationships (dominance, immediate dominance, linear precedence) that hold between them.","From this perspective, instead of positing the elementary tree ~ in Figure 1, we can describe the projection of syntactic structure from the transitive verb. This description is presented pictorially as c~ ~ in Figure 2. The solid lines indicate immediate domination, whereas the dashed lines indicate a domination of arbitrary length. The description a ~ not only partially describes the tree c~ (by taking the dominations to be those of length 0) but also any tree (such as \"~) that can be derived by using the operations of adjunction and substitution starting from c~. In fact, (~t describes exactly what is common among these trees.","By expressing elementary objects in terms of tree descriptions, we can describe syntactic structure projected from a lexical item in a way that is independent of the derivations in which it is used. This is achieved by employing composition operations that produce descriptions that are compatible with the descriptions being combined. For instance, adjoining, seen from this perspective, serves to further specify the underspecified dominations. In Figure 2, the description -y~ is obtained by additionally stating that the domination between the two nodes labeled S in c~ ~ is now given by the domination relation between the two nodes labeled S in fl~.","As we will explore in this paper, changing the way the lexicalized formalism is viewed, from tree rewriting to tree descriptions, raises questions as to the desirability 89 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1"]},{"title":"S NP~ S NP VP ' I ' ! ! many of us VP John VP to meet","paragraphs":["NPi V VP"]},{"title":"I I e hopes Figure 3","paragraphs":["A problem for LTAG. of certain aspects of the formalism. Specifically, we claim that the following two aspects of LTAG appear unnecessarily restrictive from the perspective of tree description: . . In LTAG, the root and foot of auxiliary trees must be labeled by the same nonterminal symbol. This is not a minor issue since it derives from one of the most fundamental principles of LTAG, factoring of recursion. This principle states that auxiliary trees express factored out recursion, which can be reintroduced via the adjunction operation. It has had a profound influence on the way that the formalism has been applied linguistically. 3 An example of how this can create problems is shown in Figure 3. In this case, the \"adjoined\" tree has a root labeled S and a foot labeled VP, something that is not permissible in LTAG. Note that without this constraint, the combination would appear to be exactly like adjoining. We consider this aspect in more detail in Section 4.1. The adjunction operation embeds all of the adjoined tree within that part of the tree at which adjunction occurs. This is illustrated in -y' (Figure 2) where both parts (separated by domination) of fl~ appear within one underspecified domination relationship in c~'.

The","paragraphs":["adjunction operation accomplishes the role of expanding this argument node. Unlike the substitution operation, where an entire tree is inserted below the argument node, with adjunction, only a subtree of ~ appears below the argument node; the remainder appears in its entirety above the root node of ft. However, if we view the trees as descriptions, as in Figure 2, and if we take the expansion of the foot node as the main goal served by adjunction, it is not clear why the composition should have anything to say about the domination relationship between the other parts of the two objects being combined. In the description approach, in order to obtain 3/we (in a 3 Note that in feature-based LTAG there is no restriction that the two feature structures be the same, or even that they be compatible. 90 Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars"]},{"title":"PP S ,","paragraphs":["I i To some of us"]},{"title":"VP V PP I I appears e Figure 4","paragraphs":["Another problem for LTAG."]},{"title":"VP S NP VP I '","paragraphs":["I i John"]},{"title":"VP to be happy","paragraphs":["sense to be made precise later) substitute the second component of ~ (rooted in S) at the foot node of fl'. This operation does not itself entail any further domination constraints between the components of ~P and fl~ that are not directly involved in the substitution, specifically, the top components of o/and fl'. In the trees described it is possible for either one to dominate the other. 4 However, adjunction further stipulates that the rest of ~' will appear above all of fl'. This additional constraint makes certain analyses unavailable for the LTAG formalism (as is well known). For instance, given the two lexical projections in Figure 4, the subtrees must be interleaved in a fashion not available with adjoining to produce the desired result. This aspect of adjoining is the focus of the discussion in Section 4.2.","In this paper, we describe a formalism based on tree descriptions called d-tree substitution grammars (DSG). 5 The elementary tree descriptions in DSG can be used to describe lexical items and the grammatical structure they project. Each elementary tree description can be seen as describing two aspects of the tree structure: one part of the description specifies phrase structure rules for lexical projections, and a second part of the description states domination relationships between pairs of nodes. DSG inherits from LTAG the extended domain of locality of its elementary structures, and, in DSG as in LTAG, this extended domain of locality allows us to develop a lexicalized grammar in which lexical items project grammatical structure, including positions for arguments. But DSG departs from LTAG in that it does not include factoring of recursion as a constraint on the makeup of the grammatical projections. Furthermore, in DSG, arguments are added to their head by a single operation that we call generalized substitution, whereas in LTAG two operations are used: adjunction and substitution.","DSG is intended to be a simple framework with which it is possible to provide analyses for those cases described with LTAG as well as for various cases in which extensions of LTAG have been needed, such as different versions of multicomponent 4 Of course, the node labels further restrict possible dominance in this case. 5 This paper is based on Rarnbow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir (1995), where DSG was called DTG (d-tree grammar). 91 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1"]},{"title":"Z%","paragraphs":["{Xl ~ X2, {Ul ~ U2, Xl /k X3, ~3 U3 ~1 /k U3~ X2 -~ 3:3~ U2 \"~ ~3~ X3 '/~ Yl, I I yl /k y2, I I Zl /~ Z2, Yl /X Y3'"]},{"title":"O~ O~ zl /X za' y2 -~ Y3} z2 -~ z3} Y3 z3 Figure 5","paragraphs":["A pair of tree descriptions (which are also d-trees).

Definition of DSG D-trees are the primitive elements of a DSG. D-trees are descriptions of trees, in particular, certain types of expressions in a tree description language such as that of Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (1992). In this section we define tree descriptions and substitution of tree descriptions (Section 2.1) and d-trees (Section 2.2) together with some associated terminology and the graphical representation (Section 2.3). We then define d-tree substitution grammars, along with derivations of d-tree substitution grammars (Section 2.4) and languages generated by these grammars (Section 2.5), and close with an informal discussion of path constraints (Section 2.6). 2.1 Tree Descriptions and Substitution In the following, we are interested in a tree description language that provides at least the following binary predicate symbols: A, /~, and -~. These three predicate symbols are intended to be interpreted as the immediate domination, domination, and precedence relations, respectively. That is, in a tree model, the literal x/~ y would be interpreted as node (referred to by the variable) x immediately dominates node (referred to by) y, the literal x/~ y would be interpreted such that x dominates y, and x -~ y indicates that x is to the left of y. In addition to these predicate symbols, we assume there is a finite set of unary function symbols, such as label, which are to be used to describe node labeling. Finally, we assume the language includes the equality symbol.","We will now introduce the notion of tree description. Definition A tree description is a finite set (conjunction) of positive literals in a tree description","language.","In order to make the presentation more readable, tree descriptions are usually presented graphically rather than as logical expressions.

Although feature structures will be used in the linguistic examples presented in Section 4, for the remainder of this section we will assume that each node is labeled with a symbol by the function label. Furthermore, we assume that these symbols come from two pairwise distinct sets of symbols, the terminal and nonterminal labels. (Note that the examples in this section do not show labels for nodes, but rather their names, while the examples in subsequent sections show the labels.)","In the following, we consider a tree description to be satisfiable if it is satisfied by a finite tree model. For our current purposes, we assume that a tree model will be defined as a finite universe (the set of nodes) and will interpret the predicate symbols: G, ,~,, and -~ as the immediate domination, domination, and precedence relations, respectively.

In describing syntactic structure, we are interested in two kinds of primitive tree descriptions. The first kind of primitive tree description, which we call parent-child descriptions, involves n + 1 (n _> 1) variables, say x, xl,. •., Xn, and in addition to specifying categorial information associated with these variables, specifies tree structure of the form {X & I1 ..... X A Xn, Xl \"g X2 ..... Xn-1 \"¢, Xn} A parent-child description corresponds to a phrase structure rule in a context-free grammar, and by extension, to a phrase structure rule in X-bar theory, to the instantiation of a rule schema in HPSG, or to a c-structure rule in LFG. As in a context-free grammar, in DSG we assume the siblings Xl,..., Xn are totally ordered by precedence, s","The second kind of primitive description, which we call a domination description, has the form {x & y}, where x and y are variables. In projecting from a lexical item to obtain the elementary objects of a grammar, this underspecified domination statement allows for structures projected from other lexical items to be interspersed during the derivation process. Definition A d-tree is a satisfiable description in the smallest class of tree descriptions obtained","by closing the primitive tree descriptions under the substitution operation.","For example, Figure 9 shows how the d-tree in Figure 6 is produced by using six parent-child descriptions and two domination descriptions. The ovals show cases of substitution; the circle represents a case of two successive substitutions. Figure 10 shows a tree description that is not a d-tree: it is not a parent-child description, nor 8 One could, of course, relax this constraint and assume that they are only partially ordered. However, for now, we do not consider such an extension.

Given a d-tree d, we say that a pair of nodes, x and y (variables in vars(d)), are related by an i-edge if d ::~ xAy. We say that x is an i-parent and y is an i-child. Given a d-tree d, we say that a pair of nodes, x and y, are related by a d-edge if it is known from d that x dominates y, it is not known from d that x immediately dominates y, and there is no other variable in d that is known to be between them. That is, a pair of nodes x and y, x ~ y, are related byad-edgeifd ~ x~y,d ~ xGy, and for allz E vars(d),ifd ~ (x&zAz~y) then z = x or z = y. If x and y are related by a d-edge, then we say that they are d-parent and d-child, respectively. Note that a node in a d-tree (unlike a node in a tree description) cannot be both an i-parent and a d-parent at the same time. 2.3 Graphical Presentation of a D-Tree We usually find it more convenient to present d-trees graphically. When presenting a d-tree graphically, i-edges are represented with a solid line, while d-edges are represented with a broken line. All immediate dominance relations are always represented graphically, but only the domination relations corresponding to d-edges are shown explicitly in graphical presentations.","By definition of d-trees, each component of a d-tree is fully specified with respect to immediate domination. Thus, all immediate domination relations between nodes in a component are indicated by i-edges. Also, by definition, components must be fully specified with respect to precedence.

Thus, we obtain the following procedure for removing d-edges: Consider a d-edge with a node x as the d-parent and with a d-child y. By definition of d-trees, x is on the frontier of a component. The d-child y can either be a root of a component or not. Let us first consider the case in which y is a root of a component. To remove this d-edge, we equate x with y.9 This gives us the minimal reading that meets the above requirement (that no i-edges are added which are not already specified in the components, and that those i-edges that are distinct prior to the process of reading off remain distinct after the removal of the d-edge). Now we consider the alternate case in which the d-child is not the root of its component. Let z be the root of the component containing y. Now both z and x are known to dominate y and hence in any model of the description, either z will dominate x or vice versa. Equating x with y (the two nodes in the d-edge under consideration) has the potential of requiring the collapsing of i-edges (e.g., i-edges between x and its parent and y and its parent in the component including z). As a consequence of our requirement, the only way to remove the d-edge is by equating the nodes x and z. If we equated x with any other node dominated by z (such as y), we would also be collapsing i-edges from two distinct components and equating more than one pair of nodes, contrary to our requirement. The removal of the d-edge by equating x and z can also be viewed as adding a d-edge from x to z (which, as mentioned, is compatible with the given description and does not have the potential for collapsing i-edges). Now since this d-edge is between a frontier of a component and the root of another, it can be removed by equating the two nodes. Definition A tree t can be read off from a d-tree d iff t is obtained from d by removing the d-edges","of d in any order using the d-edge removal algorithm.","By selecting d-edges for removal in different orders, different trees can be produced. Thus, in general, we can read off several trees from each d-tree in T(G). For example, the d-tree in Figure 6 can produce two trees: one rooted in xl (if we choose to collapse the edge between y4 and zl first) and one rooted in yl (if we choose to collapse the edge between x3 and z2 first). The fact that a d-tree can have several minimal readings can be exploited to underspecify different word orderings (see Section 4.4). 9 This additional equality to obtain the minimal readings is similar to unification of the so-called top and bottom feature structures associated with a node in tree adjoining grammars, which happens at the end of a derivation. In DSG, if the labeling specifications on x and y are incompatible, then the additional equality statement does not lead to any minimal tree model, just as in TAG, a derivation cannot terminate if the top and bottom feature structures associated with a node do not unify. 98 Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars","Thus, while a single d-tree may describe several trees, only some of these trees will be read off in this way. This is because of our assumptions about what is being implicitly stated in a d-tree--for example, our requirement that i-edges can be neither destroyed nor created in a derivation. Assumptions such as these about the implicit content of d-trees constitute a theory of how to read off from d-trees. Variants of the DSG formalism can be defined, which differ with respect to this theory.","We now define the tree and string languages of a DSG. Definition Let G be a DSG. The tree language T(G) generated by G is the set of trees that can be","read off from sentential d-trees in T(G).

There is no requirement placed on the nodes that appear on such paths. In this section, we informally define an extension to DSG that allows for additional statements constraining the paths.","Path constraints can be associated with domination statements to constrain which nodes, in terms of their labels, can or cannot appear within a path instantiating a d-edge. 1° Path constraints do not directly constrain the length of the domination path, which still remains underspecified. Path constraints are specified in DSG by associating with domination statements a set of labels that defines which nodes cannot appear within this path. u Suppose we have a statement x A y with an associated path constraint set, P, then logically this pair can be understood as x A y A Vz(z ~ x A z y~ y AxAzAzA y) ~ label(z) ~P.","Note that during the process of derivation involving substitution, the domination statements in the two descriptions being composed continue to exist and do not play any role in the composition operation itself. The domination statements only affect the reading off process. For this reason, we can capture the effect of path constraints by merely defining how they affect the reading off process. Recall that the reading off process is essentially the elimination of d-edges to arrive at a single component d-tree. If there is a d-edge between x and y, we consider two situations: is the d-child y the root of a component, or not? When y is the root of a component, then x and y are collapsed. Clearly any path constraint on this d-edge has no effect. However, when y is not the root of a component, and z is the root of the component containing y, then the tree we obtain from the reading off process is one where x dominates z and not where z properly dominates x. That is, in this case, we replace the d-edge between x and y with a d-edge between x and z, which we then eliminate in the reading off process by equating x and z. But in order to replace the d-edge between x and y with a d-edge between x and z, we need to make sure that the path between z and y does not violate the path constraint associated with the d-edge between x and y. 10 In Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir (1995), path constraints are called \"subsertion-insertion","constraints.\" 11 Rambow (1996) uses regular expressions to specify path constraints. 99 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 A A","a A a A I I I I , o B B","b B b B I I !

Properties of the Languages of DSG It is clear that any context-free language can be generated by DSG (a context-free grammar can simply be reinterpreted as a DSG). It is also easy to show that the weak generative capacity of DSG exceeds that of context-free grammars. Figure 11 shows three d-trees (including two copies of the same d-tree) that generate the non-context-free language { anb'c\" In > 1 }. Figure 12 shows the result of performing the first of two substitutions indicated by the arrows (top) and the result of performing both substitutions (bottom). Note that although there are various ways that the domination edges can be collapsed when reading off trees from this d-tree, the order in which we collapse domination edges is constrained by the need to consistently label nodes being equated. This is what gives us the correct order of terminals.","Figure 13 shows a grammar for the language { w E { a, b, c }* ] w has an equal nonzero number of a's, b's and c's }, which we call Mix. This grammar is very similar to the previous one. The only difference is that node labels are no longer used to constrain word order. Thus the domination edges can be collapsed in any order.","Both of the previous two examples can be extended to give a grammar for strings containing an equal number of any number of symbols simply by including additional components in the elementary d-trees for each symbol to be counted. Hence, DSG generates not only non-context-free languages but also non-tree adjoining languages, since LTAG cannot generate the language { anbncndnen i n _~ 1 } (Vijay-Shanker 1987).","However, it appears that DSG cannot generate all of the tree adjoining languages, and we conjecture that the classes are therefore incomparable (we offer no proof of this claim in this paper). It does not appear to be possible for DSG to generate the copy language { ww [ w c { a, b }* }. Intuitively, this claim can be motivated by the observation that nonterminal labels can be used to control the ordering of a bounded number of terminals (as in Figure 12), but this cannot be done in an unbounded way, as would be required for the copy language (since the label alphabet is finite). 100 Rainbow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars A A","a A a A t I I I o n B B","b B b B ! / o / c 6' c 6' A A A","a A a A a B I I !

UVG-DL and {}-LIG, when lexicalized, generate only context-sensitive languages.","Finally, Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Rainbow (1995), using techniques developed for UVG-DL (Rainbow 1994a; Becker and Rambow 1995), show that the languages generated by lexicalized DSG can be recognized in polynomial time. This can be shown with a straightforward extension to the usual bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm for context-free grammars. In the DSG case, the nonterminals in the chart are paired with multisets. The nonterminals are used to verify that the immediate dominance relations (i.e., the parent-child descriptions) hold, just as in the case of CFG. The multisets record the domination descriptions whose lower (dominated) node has been found but whose upper (dominating) node still needs to be found in order for the parse to find a valid derivation of the input string (so-called open domination descriptions). The key to the complexity result is that the size of the multisets is linearly bounded by the length of the input string if the grammar is lexicalized, and the number of multisets of size n is polynomial in n. Furthermore, if the number of open domination descriptions in any chart entry is bounded by some constant independent 102 Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars of the length of the input string (as is plausible for many natural languages including English), the parser performs in cubic time."]},{"title":"4.

In fact, the compilation produces structures just like those (described) in Figure 3. Kasper et al.

Technically, the tree on the right of Figure 3 caimot be an auxiliary tree. Kasper et al. (1995) overcome the problem by making the node label a feature (with all nodes having a default label of no significance). This determination of the foot node is independent of the node labels of the frontier nodes. Instead, the foot node is chosen because it shares certain crucial features (other than label!) with the root node. These shared features are extracted from the HPSG rule schema and are used to define the localization of dependencies in the compiled TAG grammar. See Kasper et al.

We contrast this with the case of DSG, which, through the use of domination in describing elementary structures projected from a lexical item, allows for the interleaving of components projected from lexical items during a derivation.","Consider the raising example introduced in Section 1 repeated here as (4a), along with its nontopicalized version (4b), which indicates a possible original position for 107 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1"]},{"title":"g PPi S /,,,, ,","paragraphs":["I i"]},{"title":"To many of us VP S I '","paragraphs":["I t"]},{"title":"John VP V PP VP to be happy I I appears e Figure 18","paragraphs":["Topicalization out of the clause of a raising verb. the topicalized phrase) 4 (4) a.

Because of the nesting property of adjunction, the interleaving required to obtain the relevant phrase structure for the sentence (4a) cannot be realized using LTAG with the assumed lexical projections (or any other reasonable structures where the topicalized PP and the verb appear are in the same projected structure). In contrast, with these projections, using generalized substitution in DSG (i.e., equating the VP argument node of the verb and the root of the infinitival VP), the only possible derived tree is the desired one.","We will now consider an example that does not involve a wh-type dependency: (5) Didn't John seem to like the gift?","Following the principles laid out in Frank (1992) for constructing the elementary trees of TAG, we would obtain the projections described in Figure 19 (except for the node labels).

Clearly the TAG operations could never yield the necessary phrase structure given this localization.

Rather, the auxiliary gets included by separately adjoining a tree","14 Throughout this section, we underline the embedded clause with all of its arguments, such as here, the raised subject. 108 Rainbow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars"]},{"title":"I Didn't V VP I seem Figure 19","paragraphs":["Raising verb with a fronted auxiliary."]},{"title":"S S I","paragraphs":["I I i i"]},{"title":"VP John VP to like the gift","paragraphs":["projected from the auxiliary verb.

We conclude that complex interspersing is a fairly common phenomenon in natural language. As in the case of factoring of recursion, sometimes we find that the definition of adjunction precludes certain linguistically plausible analyses but allows others; in other cases, TAG does not seem to allow any linguistically plausible analysis at all. However, in each case, we can use standard LTAG practices for projecting structures from lexical items and combine the resulting structures using the generalized substitution operation of DSG to obtain the desired analyses, thus bringing out the underlying similarity of related constructions both within languages and cross-linguistically. 4.3 Linguistic Use of Path Constraints In the examples discussed so far, we have not had the need to use path constraints. The d-edges seen so far express any domination path.

If we make the intermediate raising verb appear nonfinite (and hence without a subject), as in (11c), the sentence is again grammatical.","Now consider the DSG analysis for (11a) shown in Figure 21.

We substitute the float d-tree into the appear d-tree, and the result into the seem d-tree, as indicated by the solid arrows in Figure 21. Given the reading off process, this derived d-tree can be seen to express two possibilities, depending on where the wood component and the expletive it end up. These two possibilities correspond to (11a) and (11b).","To exclude the ungrammatical result, we use the path constraints discussed in Section 2.6. Let us make the uncontroversial assumption that as we project from a verb, we will project to a VP before projecting to an S. But we will interpret this notion of projection as also applying to the d-edges between nodes labeled VP: we annotate the d-edge between the VP nodes in the float tree (and in fact in all trees, of course) as having a path constraint that does not allow an S node on this path. This is, after all, what we would expect in claiming that the float tree represents a structure lexically projected from the verb float. 16 Given this additional grammatical expression, after the substitution at the S node of the seems tree, it is no longer possible to read off from the d-tree in Figure 21 a tree whose yield is the ungrammatical (11b). The only possible way of reading off from the derived d-tree yields (11a).","What is striking is that this particular path constraint disallowing S nodes between VP nodes in structures projected from a verb can be used in other cases as well. In fact, this same path constraint on its own, when applied to the English examples considered so far, predicts the correct arrangement of all components among the two d-trees being combined, regardless of whether the nesting constraint of adjoining must be met (extraction out of clausal or VP complements, extraction from NP or PP complements), or not (extraction from the clause of a raising verb, raising verb with fronted auxiliary, or extraction from an adjunct). For example, in Figure 18, after substituting the to be happy component at the VP node of the appears d-tree, a path constraint on the d-edge between the two VP nodes of the to be happy tree makes it impossible for the to any of us component to intervene, thus leaving the interspersed tree as the only possible result of the reading off process, even if we relaxed the requirement on label equality for the removal of d-edges during the reading off process.","Note that while the same path constraints apply in all cases, in LTAG, as we have seen, the nesting constraint of adjoining precludes deriving the correct order in some cases, and the use of extensions such as multicomponent adjoining has been suggested. In fact, because there are both situations in which the arrangement of components of the lexically projected structures corresponds to adjoining and situations in which this arrangement is inappropriate, Vijay-Shanker (1992) raises the question of whether the definition of the formalism should limit the arrangement of components of the lexically projected structures, or whether the possible arrangements should be derived from the linguistic theory and from intuitions about the nature of the elementary objects of a grammar. This subsection partially addresses this question and shows","15 The point we are making in this section relies on there being some distinction between the labels of the roots of the appear and float clauses, a linguistically uncontroversial assumption. Here, we use the categorial distinction between S and VP for convenience only; we could also have assumed a difference in feature content.","16 Bleam (2000) uses informal path constraints in much the same way in order to restrict Spanish clitic climbing in an LTAG analysis. 113 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 how the path constraint expressing the nature of projection from a lexical item can be used to derive the arrangements of components corresponding to adjoining in some cases as well as predict when the nesting condition of adjoining is too limiting in the others. 4.4 Underspecification of Linear Precedence In our proposed tree description language, we provide for underspecified dominance but not for underspecified linear precedence. As a consequence, in the graphical representations of d-trees, we assume that sister nodes are always ordered as shown. This may seem arbitrary at first glance, especially since in many linguistic frameworks and theories it is common to specify linear precedence (LP) separately from syntactic structure (GPSG, HPSG, LFG, ID/LP-TAG [Joshi 1987] and FO-TAG [Becker, Joshi, and Rambow 1991], various dependency-based formalisms, and so on). This separate specification of LP rules allows for underspecified LP rules, which is useful in cases in which word order is not fully fixed.","In principle, an underspecification of LP could easily be added to DSG without profoundly changing its character or formal properties. The reason we have not done so is that in all cases, the same effect can be achieved using underspecified dominance alone, though at the cost of forcing a linguistic analysis that uses binary branching phrase structure trees rather than n-ary branching ones. We will illustrate the point using examples from German, which allows for scrambling of the arguments.","Consider the following German examples. 17 (12) a. dat~ die Kinder dem Lehrer das Buch geben that [the children]NOM [the teacher]DAT [the book]Acc give that the children give the teacher the book b. dat~ dem Lehrer die Kinder das Buch geben c. dat~ dem Lehrer das Buch die Kinder geben","All orders of the three arguments are possible, resulting in six possible sentences (three of which are shown in (12)).

TM The arguments of the verb have no dominance specified among them, so that when using this d-tree (which is of course not yet a tree) in a derivation, we can choose whichever dominance relations we want when we read off a tree at the end of the derivation. As a result, we obtain any ordering of the arguments.","As mentioned previously, while we can derive any ordering, we cannot, in DSG, obtain a flat VP structure.

Modeling Syntactic Dependency In the previous sections, we have presented DSG and have shown how it can be used to provide analyses for a range of linguistic phenomena. In this section, we conclude our introduction of DSG by discussing the relationship between derivations in DSG and syntactic dependency. Recently, syntactic dependency has emerged as an important factor for applications in natural language processing.","In lexicalized formalisms such as LTAG, the operations of the formalism (i.e., in the case of LTAG, substitution and adjunction) relate structures associated with two lexical items. It is therefore natural to interpret these operations as establishing a direct syntactic relation between the two lexical items, i.e., a relation of syntactic dependency. There are at least two types of syntactic dependency: a relation of complementation (predicate-argument relation) and a relation of modification (predicate-adjunct relation). 2° Syntactic dependency represents an important linguistic intuition, provides a uniform interface to semantics, and is, as Schabes and Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks. In fact,","19 This kind of construction has been extensively analyzed in the Germanic syntax literature. Following the descriptive notion of \"coherent construction\" proposed by Bech (1955), Evers (1975) proposes that in German (and in Dutch, but not in English) a biclausal structure undergoes a special process to produce a monoclausal structure, in which the argument lists of the two verbs are merged and the verbs form a morphological unit. This analysis has been widely adopted (in one form or another) in the formal and computational syntax literature by introducing special mechanisms into the underlying formal system. If the special mechanism produces a single (flat) VP for the new argument list, then LP rules for the simplex case can also apply to the complex case. However, the DSG analysis has the advantage that it does not involve a special mechanism, and the difference between German and English complex clauses is related simply to the difference in word orders allowable in the simplex case (i.e., German but not English allows scrambling). Furthermore, the DSG analysis correctly predicts some \"interleaved\" word orders to be grammatical. See Rambow (1995) for details.","20 In addition, we may want to identify the relation between a function word and its lexical headword (e.g., between a determiner and a noun) as a third type of relation. 116 Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars adore claim he seem Mary /"]},{"title":"OBJ","paragraphs":["\\ seems I COMP I hotdog claim adore"]},{"title":"I SUB J SUBJ~~~ BJ","paragraphs":["he Mary hotdog"]},{"title":"Figure 25","paragraphs":["LTAG derivation tree for (14) (left); dependency tree for (14) (right). recent advances in parsing technology are due to the explicit stochastic modeling of dependency information (Collins 1997).","Purely CFG-based approaches do not represent syntactic dependency, but other frameworks do, e.g. the f-structure (functional structure) of LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), and dependency grammars (see, for example, Mel'~uk [1988]), for which syntactic dependency is the sole basis for representation. As observed by Rambow and Joshi (1997), for LTAG, we can see the derivation structure as a dependency structure, since in it lexemes are related directly.","However, as we have pointed out in Section 4.1, the LTAG composition operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation. 21 Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in the directionality of the substitution operation and those uses of adjunction for clausal complementation: in LTAG, nominal complements are substituted into their governing verb's tree, while the governing verb's tree is adjoined into its own clausal complement. The fact that adjunction and substitution are used in a linguistically heterogeneous manner means that (standard) LTAG derivation trees do not provide a direct representation of the dependencies between the words of the sentence, i.e., of the predicate-argument and modification structure. In DSG, this problem is overcome straightforwardly, since DSG uses generalized substitution for all complementation (be it nominal or clausal), while still allowing long-distance effects. =","There is a second, more serious problem with modeling syntactic dependency in LTAG, as can be seen from the following example: (14) Hot dogs he claims Mary seems to adore","The problem is that in the standard LTAG derivation, we adjoin both the trees for claim and seem into the tree for adore (Figure 25, left), while in the (commonly assumed) dependency structure, seem depends on claim, and adore depends on seem (Figure 25, right). The problem is in fact related to the interleaving problem discussed in Section 4.2, and can easily be solved in DSG by proposing a structure such as that","21 Clausal complementation cannot be handled nniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic phenomena such as long-distance wh-movement in English.","22 Modification can be handled by some other operation, such as sister adjunction (Rainbow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir 1995), and is thus distinguished from complementation. We do not discuss modification in this paper. 117 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1"]},{"title":"S","paragraphs":["I I i"]},{"title":"VP V VP I","paragraphs":["seems Figure 26 Elementary d-tree for finite seems. in Figure 26 for seems, which we have already seen in Figure 21. (This structure can be justified on linguistic grounds independently from the dependency considerations, by assuming that all finite verbs--whether raising or not--project to at least S [= IP]. Raising verbs simply lack a subject of their own, but the S node is justified by the finiteness of the verb, not by the presence or absence of a subject.) Thus, DSG can be used to develop grammars in which the derivation faithfully and straightforwardly reflects syntactic dependency. 23 6. Related Work In this section, we mention some related theoretical work and some applicationoriented work that is based on DSG.","On the theoretical side, Kallmeyer (1996, 1999) presents an independently conceived formalism called tree description grammar (TDG). TDG is similar to DSG: in both formalisms, descriptions of trees are composed during derivations through conjunction and equation of nodes. Furthermore, like DSG, TDG does not allow the conflation of immediate dominance structure specified in elementary structures. However, TDG allows for more than one node to be equated in a derivation step: nodes are \"marked\" and all marked nodes are required to be equated with other nodes in a derivation step. (Equating more than one pair of nodes in each derivation step shifts some of the work done in reading off in DSG to the derivation in TDG.) In DSG, we have designed a simple generative system based on tree descriptions involving dominance, using an operation that directly correspond to the linguistic notion of complementation. Additional mechanisms, such as the marking of nodes and their simultaneous involvement in a derivation step, are not available in DSG.","Hepple (1998) relates DSG to a system he has previously proposed in which deductions in implicational linear logic are recast as deductions involving only first-order formulas (Hepple 1996). He shows how this relation can be exploited to give derivations in DSG a functional semantics.","There is an ongoing effort to evaluate the theoretical proposals presented in this paper through the development of a wide-coverage DSG-based parsing system that provides analysis in a broadly HPSG style (Carroll et al. 2000). One aspect of this work involves exploiting the extended domain of locality that DSG shares with TAG in order","23 Candito and Kahane (1998) propose to use derivations in DSG to model semantic (rather than syntactic) dependency. 118 Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir D-Tree Substitution Grammars to maximize localization of syntactic dependencies within elementary tree descriptions, thereby avoiding the need for unification during parsing (Carroll et al. 1999).","Nicolov and Mellish (2000) use DSG as the formalism in a generation application. The principal motivation for using DSG is that DSG is a lexicalized formalism which can provide derivations that correspond to the traditional notion of (deep) syntactic dependency (see Section 5), which is often considered to be the input to the syntactic component of a generation system. 7. Conclusions We have introduced the grammar formalism of d-tree substitution grammars by show-ing how it emerges from a tree-description-theoretic analysis of tree adjoining grammars. Derivations in DSG involve the composition of d-trees, special kinds of tree descriptions. Trees are read off from derived d-trees.","We have shown that the DSG formalism can be used to express a variety of linguistic analyses, including styles of analysis that do not appear to be available with the LTAG approach, and analyses for constructions that appear to be beyond the descriptive capacity of LTAG. Furthermore, linguistic analyses of syntactic phenomena are uniform, both language-internally and cross-linguistically. Finally, DSG allows for a consistent modeling of syntactic dependency.","References","AbeillG Anne. 1991. Une grammaire lexicalisde d'arbres adjoints pour le fran¢ais.
