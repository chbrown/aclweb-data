address and email changes. Journal copies returned due to bad addresses will not be remailed until a $5.00 postage/handling fee is remitted. E-mail (if available) is used to distribute meeting, membership, and other announcements. MEMBERSHIP in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, fund donations, back issues, and proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. Important Note: Renewals must be received no later than 1 April 2001 to avoid late payment fee (for postage/handling) assessment. Membership categories include Regular Members (for 1, 3 or 5 years) and the following: Couples with the same mailing address may be Joint Members (for 1, 3, or 5 years); they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may become Student Members with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members because of their income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed memberships. If no indication is provided of multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does not apply to new memberships. The ACL and the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) have agreed to offer 25% discounts on membership fees of either organization who are not currently members of the other organization. For example, ACL members who are not currently members of ISCA may save 25% on the ISCA membership fee and visa versa. The ACL and the American Machine Translation Association (AMTA) have also agreed to offer reciprocal discounts of 10% to members of the other organization. Both discount membership agreements are for first-time memberships and only apply for one (the first) year of membership. SPECIAL FUNDS: INTERNATIONAL FUND: Allows ACL memberships and publications to be available to colleagues having difficulty using their national currencies or for whom membership would otherwise be impossible. Contributions may be tax deductible; check local regulations. Receipts are available upon request.

Each paper is reviewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication to another refereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures: Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive expedited review by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, c6ntain a description of a single experiment, algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit final versions within 8 weeks of notification. Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These submissions should normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words). All submissions, regardless of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and presentation quality. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to: Julia Hirschberg, CL Editor AT&T Labs-Research Room A257 180 Park Avenue P.O.

A European chapter was established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
