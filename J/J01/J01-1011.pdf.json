Each paper is reviewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication to another refereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication,, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures: Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive expedited review by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain a description of a single experiment, algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit final versions within 8 weeks of notification. Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These submissions should normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words). All submissions, regardiess of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and presentation quality. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to: Julia Hirschberg, CL Editor AT&T Labs-Research Room A257 180 Park Avenue P.O.

A European chapter was established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed others are likely to be added.","President (2000) Eduard Hovy USC Information Sciences Institute Vice-President (2000) Vice President-elect (2001) Treasurer (2001-2003) Secretary (2001-2003) Past-President (2000) Business Manager (1999-01) Executive Committee (1999-01) (2000-02) (2000-02) (2001-03) Journal Editor Chair of the EACL (1999-2000) Chair of the NAACL (2000-2001) Nominating Committee (1999-01) (2000-02) (2001-03) 4676 Admiralty Way Marina del Rey, CA 90292-6695 USA (+1-310) 448-8731; (+1-310) 823-6714 fax; hovy@isi.edu John Nerbonne University of Groningen P.O.
