Introduction We present an estimate of an upper bound for the entropy of characters in printed English. The estimate is the cross-entropy of the 5.96 million character Brown Corpus (Kucera and Francis 1967) as measured by a word trigram language model that we constructed from 583 million words of training text.

Even quite subtle use of knowledge of the test sample can have a profound effect on the cross-entropy. For example, the cross-entropy would be noticeably lower had we restricted ourselves to characters that appear in the test sample rather than to all printable ASCII characters, and would be lower still had we used the actual vocabulary of the test sample. But these values could not be trumpeted as upper bounds to the entropy of English since Equation (13) would no longer be valid. 3. The Language Model In this section, we describe our language model. The model is very simple: it captures the structure of English only through token trigram frequencies. Roughly speaking, the model estimates the probability of a character sequence by dissecting the sequence into tokens and spaces and computing the probability of the corresponding token sequence. The situation is slightly more complicated than this since, for a fixed token vocabulary, some character sequences will not have any such dissection while others will have several.

For the unknown_token and sentence_boundary_token, this cased spelling is the same as the spelling. For all other tokens, the cased spelling is obtained by modifying the uncased spelling to conform with one of the eight possible patterns L + U + UL + ULUL + ULLUL + UUL + UUUL + LUL + Here U denotes an uppercase letter, L a lowercase letter, U + a sequence of one or more uppercase letters, and L + a sequence of one or more lowercase letters. The case pattern only affects the 52 uppercase and lowercase letters.","The case pattern C for a token t is generated by a model of the form: Mcase(C [ t,b) =/~2(t)f(CIt, b) +/~l(t)f(C I b) + ,~0(t). (19) Here b is a bit that is 1 if the previous token is the sentence_boundary_token and is 0 otherwise. We use b to model capitalization at the beginning of sentences. 3.4 The Spacing Model The spacing model generates the spacing string between tokens, which is either null, a dash, an apostrophe, or one or more blanks. It is generated by an interpolated model similar to that in Equation (19). The actual spacing that appears between two tokens should depend on the identity of each token, but in our model we only consider the dependence on the second token. This simplifies the model, but still allows it to do 35 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 1 a good job of predicting the null spacing that precedes many punctuation marks. For strings of blanks, the number of blanks is determined by a Poisson distribution. 3.5 The Entropy Bound According to the paradigm of Section 2.2 (see Equation (13)), we can estimate an upper bound on the entropy of characters in English by calculating the language model probability"]},{"title":"M(character_string)","paragraphs":["of a long string of English text.

The twenty most frequently occurring tokens in the Brown Corpus not contained in our vocabulary appear in Table 2. The first two, *J and *F, are codes used in the Brown Corpus to denote formulas and special symbols. 5. Results and Conclusion The cross-entropy of the Brown Corpus and our model is 1.75 bits per character. Table 3 shows the contributions to this entropy from the token, spelling, case, and spacing components (see Equation (21)). The main contribution is, of course, from the token model: The contribution from the spelling model comes entirely from predicting the spelling of the unknown_token. The model here is especially simple-minded, predicting each of the 95 printable ASCII characters with equal probability. While we can easily do better, even if we were able to predict the characters in unknown tokens as well as we predict those in known tokens, the contribution of the spelling model to the entropy would decrease by only 0.04 bits. Likewise, we can entertain improvements to the case and spacing models but any effect on the overall entropy would be small.","Our bound is higher than previous entropy estimates, but it is statistically more reliable since it is based on a much larger test sample. Previous estimates were necessarily based on very small samples since they relied on human subjects to predict characters. Quite apart from any issue of statistical significance, however, it is probable that people predict English text better than the simple model that we have employed here.","The cross-entropy of a language model and a test sample provides a natural quantitative measure of the predictive power of the model. A commonly used measure of the difficulty of a speech recognition task is the word perplexity of the task (Bahl et 38 Brown et al. An Estimate of an Upper Bound for the Entropy of English Table 3 Component contributions to the cross-entropy. Component Cross-Entropy (bits) Token 1.61 Spelling 0.08 Case 0.04 Spacing 0.02 Total 1.75 al. 1977). The cross-entropy we report here is just the base two logarithm of the character perplexity of a sample of text with respect to a language model. For a number of natural language processing tasks, such as speech recognition, machine translation, handwriting recognition, stenotype transcription, and spelling correction, language models for which the cross-entropy is lower lead directly to better performance.","We can also think of our cross-entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the data in the Brown Corpus. The ASCII cod4 for the characters in the Brown Corpus has 8 bits per character. Because only 95 of the characters are printable, it is a straightforward matter to reduce this to 7 bits per character. With a simple Huffman code, which allots bits so that common characters get short bit strings at the expense of rare characters, we can reach 4.46 bits per character. More exotic compression schemes can reach fewer bits per character. For example, the standard UNIX command compress, which employs a Lempel-Ziv scheme, compresses the Brown Corpus to 4.43 bits per character. Miller and Wegman (1984) have developed an adaptive Lempel-Ziv scheme that achieves a compression to 4.20 bits per character on the Brown Corpus. Our language model allows us to reach a compression to 1.75 bits per character.","We do not doubt that one can reduce the cross-entropy below 1.75 bits per character. A simple way to do this is to find more reliable estimates of the parameters of the model by using a larger collection of English text for training. We might also consider structural changes to the model itself. Our model is static. One can imagine adaptive models that profit from the text in the early part of the corpus to better predict the later part. This idea is applicable to the token model and also to the spelling model.","From a loftier perspective, we cannot help but notice that linguistically the trigram concept, which is the workhorse of our language model, seems almost moronic. It captures local tactic constraints by sheer force of numbers, but the more well-protected bastions of semantic, pragmatic, and discourse constraint and even morphological and global syntactic constraint remain unscathed, in fact unnoticed. Surely the extensive work on these topics in recent years can be harnessed to predict English better than we have yet predicted it.","We see this paper as a gauntlet thrown down before the computational linguistics community. The Brown Corpus is a widely available, standard corpus and the subject of much linguistic research. By predicting the corpus character by character, we obviate the need for a common agreement on a vocabulary. Given a model, the computations required to determine the cross-entropy are within reach for even a modest research budget. We hope by proposing this standard task to unleash a fury of competitive energy that will gradually corral the wild and unruly thing that we know the English language to be. 39 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 1","References","Algoet, P. and Cover, T.
