Our study serves to highlight some of the most useful tools available for structured lexical representation, in particular (multiple) inheritance, default specification, and lexical rules. It then illustrates the value of these mechanisms in illuminating one corner of the lexicon involving an unusual kind of complementation among a group of adjectives exemplified by easy. The virtues of the structured lexicon are its succinctness and its tendency to highlight significant clusters of linguistic properties. From its succinctness follow two practical advantages, namely its ease of maintenance and modification. In order to suggest how important these may be practically, we extend the analysis of adjectival complementation in several directions. These further illustrate how the use of inheritance in lexical representation permits exact and explicit characterizations of phenomena in the language under study. We demonstrate how the use of the mechanisms employed in the analysis of easy enables us to give a unified account of related phenomena featuring nouns such as pleasure, and even the adverbs (adjectival specifiers) too and enough. Along the way we motivate some elaborations of the HPSG (head-driven phrase structure grammar) framework in which we couch our analysis, and offer several avenues for further study of this part of the English lexicon. 1. Introduction The lexicon is a large and complex set of information about the words used in a grammar or natural language processing system. Its importance has become more central in the research of the past decade, which has seen the rise of radically lexicalized theories such as head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), in which phrase structure rules play a vestigial role. Newer theories place increasingly high demands on lexical representation. A simple calculation may illustrate the quandary of lexical representation: feature systems for contemporary systems normally distinguish at least 30 features (while 40 or 50 is not rare). The number of values a feature takes ranges from 2 to the number of categories (more exactly, to the number of sequences or sets of a small size, where all the members of the sequence, etc. are categories). Under the undoubtedly optimistic assumption that feature value ranges could be reduced to booleans, we still are faced with 230 -=- 109 feature combinations--whose individual * 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1126, flickinger@hplabs.hp.com. t Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3, D-6600 Saarbr/icken 11, Germany, nerbonne@dfki.uni-sb.de. (~) 1992 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 representation is clearly to be avoided, not \"solved. ''1 The natural tack is certainly to represent just the categories actually used in the vocabulary, but this could incur a good deal of redundancy if it meant that each feature combination were represented separately on each word.","The structured or hierarchical lexicon solves this difficulty (cf. Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow 1985 and Flickinger 1987). In structured lexicons, word classes may stand in a relationship of inheritance to one another, in which case the properties of the bequeathing class accrue automatically to the inheriting class. Once we allow that a single class may be heir to more than one bequeathing class, we allow, in principle, that no word class property ever need be examined more than once. Thus we eliminate one central source of redundancy in lexical specification. One of the goals of this paper is to motivate the use of inheritance in lexical specification. To do this, we take a narrowly circumscribed phenomenon in English grammar--that of vp-complement-taking adjectives, as in hard + to deliver--and spell out the lexical specifications a thorough treatment demands. The sheer complexity of these specifications cries out for a redundancy-eliminating approach, and we propose a structured lexicon treatment. The grammatical analysis not only serves to motivate the general approach, it also illustrates several key issues in the design of structured lexicons, such as the use of default inheritance, the need for lexical rules, and the range of phenomena amenable to this sort of treatment.","The goals of this paper are to introduce the structured lexicon in a fairly simple form, to motivate its basic theoretical device, that of inheritance, with a real example taken from an existing system, and finally to show how the elimination of redundancy achieved with the structured lexicon aids in maintaining the lexicon. We argue for improved maintainability by examining concrete extensions and potential modifications of the grammatical description provided. We turn now to a brief characterization of this phenomenon.","The rich collection of syntactic and semantic phenomena exhibited by a familiar group of adjectives such as tough and easy present a challenge to those who seek to provide explicit formal characterizations of linguistic properties. We offer here a detailed description of the properties of these adjectives, involving optional and obligatory complementation, control, long-distance dependence, optional modification, and specification. The purpose of this description here is not the linguistic analysis itself (which we find interesting nonetheless), but rather its use in demonstrating the practical utility of inheritance as a tool for linguistic description, and also the predictive analytical power that inheritance affords in the study of the lexicon. In illustration of the latter, we extend our analysis of easy adjectives to a similar group of nouns such as pleasure, and then to the unusual adverbs too and enough, which function as specifiers in adjectival gradation.","The fundamental data are illustrated in (1); examples such as these have not at-tracted attention in computational linguistics, even if they have often appeared in studies within the generative framework. An early discussion of them is found in Miller and Chomsky (1963), with a score and more of additional studies published in the years since. Most of the salient properties of these adjectives have already been brought to light, but in piecemeal fashion and most often as part of a larger debate about the nature of unbounded dependencies, where detailed syntactic and semantic characterizations of these missing object constructions proved less important. 2 We 1 Cf. Gazdar et al. 1985, Appendix for a small grammar that nonetheless exceeds the size speculated on here. 2 Related work in theoretical and descriptive linguistics includes Chomsky (1965), Rosenbaum (1967), 270 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation return to the characteristic properties of these adjectives in Section 3, where they are catalogued and given formal representation."]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["a. Bill is easy to talk to. b. It is easy to talk to Bill. c. Bill is easy for Mary to talk to. d. It is easy for Mary to talk to Bill.","We chose this phenomenon as a vehicle to recommend lexical inheritance because it illustrates a wide range of grammatical phenomena, aH of which make demands on lexical resources (at least in the lexicalized grammar in which the analysis is framed). In addition to the grammatical demands, the data justify the use of a lexical rule (derivational rule) to relate pairs such as (a) and (b) in (1)--so we shall argue at any rate--thus illustrating a further inheritance-like relationship in the lexicon.","The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the aspects of HPSG that are important to our proposal, and Section 3 develops the fundamental analysis that Section 4 illustrates in a series of analytical \"snapshots\" of a single example. Section 5 suggests extensions of the fundamental analysis, especially to further lexical classes (developing the argument that structured lexicons are easily maintained and extended), and a final section summarizes and suggests directions for future work. Appendix A presents the framework for lexical description developed in Flickinger et al. (1985) and Flickinger (1987). The framework is convenient for feature-based grammars, but it allows the specification of other lexical properties as well. This Appendix presents a notation that is precise while avoiding redundancy, e.g., in characterizing the kinds of complements that these adjectives permit, and in expressing the relationships that hold between pairs like the easy of (la) and that of (lb). Since a fundamental claim of hierarchical lexicons is that they eliminate redundancy and thus improve modifiability, there is a second appendix, Appendix B, which demonstrates the modifiability of the structured lexicon. 2. Grammatical Theory The phenomena involved in the analysis of the easy adjective class illustrate (obligatory and optional) subcategorization, control, long-distance dependence, optional modification, and specification (the last in its interaction with adjectival gradation with too and enough). As such, it represents an excellent demonstration vehicle for the lexical demands of grammatical analysis. Our analysis is formulated within head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), the grammatical theory developed by Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag during the mid and late 1980s. See Pollard (1984; 1985; 1988; 1989) and Pollard and Sag (1987; 1988; 1991). As the lengthy list of publications might suggest, this grammatical theory is well enough documented so that we may restrict our Ross (1967), Postal (1971), Bresnan (1971), Chomsky (1973), Lasnik and Fiengo (1974), Jackendoff (1975), Chomsky (1977), Fodor (1978), Brame (1979), Nanni (1980), Schachter (1981), Jacobson (1982, pp. 221-223), Sag (1982), Maling and Zaenen (1982, pp. 253--254), Kaplan and Bresnan (1982, pp. 255-263), Culicover and Wilkins (1984), Jacobson (1984), Gazdar et al. (1985, pp. 150-152), Jacobson (1990), Jones (1990), Bayer (1990), and Hukari and Levine (1991). None of these works has attempted a thorough descriptive analysis of the range of data we address here, though we are of course indebted to these studies for much of the data and many of the generalizations we seek to express. In particular, our account is consistent with the brief generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) analysis of these adjectives given in Gazdar et al. (1985, pp. 150-152) though we embrace a larger range of data and extend the analysis to related nouns, a topic rarely discussed since its introduction by Lasnik and Fiengo (1974). 271 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 remarks here to the distinctive characteristics of the assumptions used here. We assume familiarity with feature-based grammars and basic familiarity with HPSG as well.","In all linguistic theories there is a division of labor between grammatical rules and the lexicon, and this concerns the amount of information contained in each. At the rule-based extreme lie non-feature-based context-free grammars, where the lexicon merely links lexical items to nonterminals; in these grammars it is indeed customary to view the lexicon as a set of unary rules. The grammatical rules thus effectively encode all linguistic information. At the lexical extreme we find feature-based categorial grammars, which allow function argument application as the only grammatical rule. Here the lexicon bears the burden of encoding linguistic information, and the contribution of rules is marginal. We emphasize that HPSG is found very close to the lexical extreme, because this highlights the significance of the present work--HPSG is a framework whose lexical demands are very nearly maximal.","Subcategorization information is lexically based in HPSG, much as it is in Categorial Grammar (Bach 1988). Grammatical heads specify the syntactic and semantic restrictions they impose on their complements and adjuncts. For example, verbs and verb phrases bear a feature SUBCAT whose content is a (perhaps ordered) set of feature structures representing their unsatisfied subcategorization requirements. Thus the feature structures associated with transitive verbs include the information: [subcat: /[ NPe:acc ]' [NPcase: nom ]/ ] (where"]},{"title":"hip","paragraphs":["abbreviates a substantial feature structure.) Applied to adjectival VP complementation, this treatment of subcategorization leads naturally to the postulation of adjectives that subcategorize for VPs, etc. (details follow).","The significance of subcategorization information is that it represents a (perhaps ordered) set of grammatical categories with which a subcategorizer combines in form-ing larger phrases. When a subcategorizer combines with a subcategorized element, the resultant phrase no longer bears the subcategorization specification--it has been discharged. Compare Pollard and Sag (1987, p. 71) for a formulation of the HPSG subcategorization principle.","We shall in general present subcategorization specifications in a slightly different way from that above, i.e., not as a single feature whose value is a list, but rather as a collection of complement features with category values. Compare Borsley (1987) for a development of this approach, which we shall not attempt to justify here. We will therefore reorganize the information above in the following way:","subject: [ NP","case: nom","°bject: [ NP ]","case: acc We choose this representation here only because we find the keywording of grammatical functions,"]},{"title":"subject,","paragraphs":["etc., more perspicuous than an encoding in terms of list positions, but nothing in the analysis hinges on the one or the other representation.","We shall furthermore allow that subcategorized elements be either obligatorily subcategorized or optionally subcategorized. Optionally subcategorized elements need not be discharged from subcategorization specifications. (This necessitates an obvious change to the principle that subcategorization must be satisfied in independent 272 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation utterances.) In case an element is not discharged, something must be said about its semantics. Here we borrow an idea from Situation Theory, and specify that unsaturated predicate argument structures (or infons; see Devlin 1991) may hold when there is some way of filling out the unfilled argument positions so that the result holds. This has the effect of existentially quantifying over unfilled argument positions. Linguistically, there are many other ways in which arguments may be omitted (cf. Fillmore 1985), but this seems to suffice for the adjectives under examination here.","Control and modification, the latter being the relation between an adjunct and a head, are both lexically realized in the case of the easy adjectives. We regard there as being a control relation between for Smith and toget in complex adjectivals such as easy for Smith to get (cf. Gazdar et al. 1985: 83ff). Modification plays a role when complex adjectivals appear in construction with nominal heads, as in easy job for Smith to get. These are common assumptions in the analyses of control and modification.","Long-distance dependence is treated in HPSG in much the same way it was treated in GPSG (cf. Gazdar et al. 1985), and we assume basic familiarity with this type of analysis. We recall that the site of a missing element in a \"gappy\" constituent bears a feature SLASH whose value is a specification of the expected material. The SLASH specification is propagated by general principles (which we shall not elucidate) to the higher level constituents, until it is matched by a \"filler\" or a subcategorizing element. When the gappy constituent is adjoined to a filler or subcategorizing element, the result no longer bears the SLASH value.","Important for our purposes is the possibility of a lexical entry specifying that a dependent may contain a gap. (Cf. Gazdar et al. 1985, pp. 150-153 for the first mention of this suggestion.) We shall exploit this in the analysis of several word classes below, viz., the ones that subcategorize for a VP with an NP in SLASH. It is unusual to find a subcategorization specification for SLASH, but not unique: comparatives likewise subcategorize for gappy complements, as in seen in examples such as taller than it is A wide. We shall require lexical specifications that lead to feature structures of the following form: stem: easy sere: easy( ~], ̂~] ) syn.loc.subcat:","sub j: [ syn: NP-nom ] sem: ~-~ pp-for: [ sem:[-~ ] xcomp: syn: VP-inf sem: ~] slash: [ sem:[~] ] The tag [~ in the diagram above shows that the semantics of the SLASH value and the adjectival subject semantics have been identified. Thus, once a VP/NP has combined with this adjective, the semantic contribution of the SLASH element is assumed by the subject.

Adjectival VP Complementation We assume familiarity with the mechanisms of lexical inheritance and lexical rules in the analysis to follow, but we provide an overview of these mechanisms for lexical 3 It is also worth mentioning that HPSG has also been the subject of intensive implementation activity during the past several years; we know of implementations at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, The German AI Center (DFKI), Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, The Ohio State University, Simon Fraser University, University of Edinburgh, ICOT, University of Stuttgart, the IBM LILOG project in Stuttgart, and ATR. We may therefore safely refer the reader to documentations of those implementations, even if these are less generally available than the theoretical literature: Proudian and Pollard (1985), Nerbonne and Proudian (1987), Franz (1990), Emele and Zajac (1990), and Carpenter, Pollard, and Franz (1991). 274 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complernentation representation in Appendix A. The fundamental data we shall be concerned with are repeated in (2):","(2) a. b. C. d. Other adjectives amusing annoying","(3) boring comfortable confusing Bill is easy to talk to. It is easy to talk to Bill. Bill is easy for Mary to talk to. It is easy for Mary to talk to Bill. that show this same distribution include the following: depressing great nice difficult hard painful exhausting important tiresome fun impossible terrible good impressive tough","Given pairs like (2a,b) and (2c, d), two dusters of properties begin to suggest them-selves as part of the definitions of the relevant lexical entries. The first of these clusters we will associate with the class of words containing lexical entries for the easy of (2a,c) and its counterparts in (3), a class we term SLASH-EASY. The other cluster of properties we associate with a second class termed IT-EASY, containing the lexical entries for the variant of easy in (2b, d) and its counterparts in (3). We begin by simply identifying the relevant properties in each of these two classes, supported by examples as necessary; then we provide motivation for factoring these properties into several word classes linked by inheritance.","Adjectives in the IT-EASY class have two obligatory complements, an NP subject and a verbal complement; in addition they have one optional complement, a PP headed by the preposition for. As seen in (4), the verbal complement can be either infinitival or gerundive, and (5) shows that this complement can be a VP even with a PP-for present, or an infinitival S, again with or without the optional PP-for complement. The subject NP must be the expletive it.","(4) a. It was great working for Bill. b. It was great to work for Bill.","(5) a. It's easiest for the dogs to feed them at noon. b. For the dogs, it's easiest to feed them at noon. c. It's easiest for the dogs to be chained up all day. d. *For the dogs, it's easiest to be chained up all day. e. It's easiest for me for the dogs to be chained up all day. f. For me, it's easiest for the dogs to be chained up all day.","Examples (5e, f) demonstrate that not only VP complementation but also S complementation, is involved in easy subcategorization. Note that S complementation never requires a controller, and that the PP phrase in such structures is mobile (5f). In addition to the conclusion that a variety of complementation schemes are used with easy, the data above also demonstrate that the exact specification of the controller (the understood subject of the infinitival VP) is nontrivial. Example (5a) demonstrates that the PP-FOR complement need not control the VP, and (5b) suggests that noncontrolling PPs are more mobile than controllers (5d). 275 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3","We accommodate these facts semantically by aUowing that easy and similar adjectives denote two-place relations between individuals and states of affairs. The relation holds between the pair, roughly, when it is easy (or convenient) for the individual when the state of affairs obtains. Examples (5e,f) show that the individual involved in the easy relation need not be involved in the state of affairs, i.e., that there is no necessary semantic control involved in this relation. 4 The control facts are clear enough: when this easy is combined with an S, there is no semantic control; and when it is combined with a VP, there is no grammatically specified controller of the VP--although there may be pragmatic inference about the understood subject.","Adjectives in the SLASH-EASY class also have two obligatory complements, an NP subject and a verbal complement, as well as an optional PP-for complement. In contrast to the first class, this class specifies that the subject is a normal (nonexpletive) NP, and that the verbal complement must contain an NP gap. Moreover, this verbal complement must be infinitival, not gerundive, as seen in (6), and must be a VP, not an S, as shown in (7). 5","(6) a. Bill was great to work for. b. *Bill was great working for.","(7) a. For me, Bill was easy to talk to. b. *Bill was easy for me for Mary to talk to.","In the word class hierarchy we assume, sketched in Appendix A, there is a word class CONTROL, which introduces a verbal complement subcategorization, and which serves as the superclass from which both of the classes IT-EASY and SLASH-EASY inherit. However, neither of these classes is an immediate subclass of CONTROL; we draw on the data provided in (8) and (9) below to motivate two intermediate word classes that will stand between CONTROL and these two in the hierarchy.","The English lexicon contains two more groups of adjectives that have much in common with the two variants of easy introduced above, but must be kept distinct. Lasnik and Fiengo (1974:535) identified a set of adjectives including pretty and melodious, illustrated in (8).","(8) a. Disneyland is pretty to look at. b. Sonatas are melodious to listen to. c. *It is pretty to look at Disneyland. d. *It is melodious to listen to sonatas. e. ?Disneyland is pretty for children to look at. f. ?Sonatas are melodious for serious musicians to listen to. 4 There is an interesting pragmatic problem lurking in the control specifications involved here. If one specifies the control relationships exactly, then one needs to postulate systematic structural ambiguity in examples such as (5c), where the sequence of PP and VP may or may not be analyzed as an constituent. This seems plausible, but then we would like to have a pragmatic account of why there is normally no distinction, i.e., why the control relationship is inferred, or, equivalently for all intents and purposes, why the S reading is so strongly preferred. 5 Hukari and Levine (1991) note in passing that there is a group of closely related adjectives such as worth that do take a gerundive complement instead of the usual infinitival complement, as in That article is not worth looking at. The extension of our analysis to worth is straightforward, but not given here. 276 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complernentation","Members of this class of adjectives share much in common with the SLASH-EASY adjectives, but have two significant differences: first, as shown by (8c,d), they do not have a corresponding entry with an expletive"]},{"title":"it","paragraphs":["subject, and second, they assign a real thematic role to their subjects.

(Of course many other properties, including e.g., gradation properties and the applicability of lexical rules, have likewise been suppressed in the interest of clarity in presentation.) This lexical description translates fairly directly (with some further simplifications and abbreviations) into a feature structure of the sort used by HPSG grammars. 281 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 stem: easy syn.loc.head: Adj sem: easy( [~,̂[~) syn.loc.subcat: sub j: [ syn: NP-nom ]"]},{"title":"sem: ~]","paragraphs":["pp_for: [ sY n: PP-f°r ] sem: [] syn: VP-inf sere: ~] xcomp: subject.sem: [~ slash: [ 2eYnm:~ -acc ]","We would like to draw attention to two semantic coindexings in the structure, which are lexically specified and which simplify subsequent (grammatical) processing. The coindexing of the xcomp's subject with the pp-for is effected in the SLASH-EASY word class, and the semantic coindexing seen above is just a consequence of that. The coindexing of the xcomp's slash's semantics value with the subject's semantics, on the other hand, derives ultimately from SLASH-COMP.","In Figure 3 we examine the combination of a token from this class of easy adjectives and a VP/NP. The very sparse specification of the mother phrase's features is, in fact, solely for purposes of legibility--all of the information specified on the mother node may be derived from general HPSG principles, so that nothing is specified, e.g., on the rule that licenses head-complement combinations. The fact that the semantics attribute is identified with the subcategorizer's semantics follows from the HPSG Semantics Principle, which states that the semantics of a phrasal node is always to be identified with the semantics of a head in a head complement combination. The fact that the slash value of the mother structure is empty follows from the Binding Inheritance Principle, which states that slash values are collected going up a tree--unless a head subcategorizes for an element containing a slash value, in which case the slash satisfies the subcategorization requirement. The identification of the feature structure labeled V~, which is just the representation of the phrasal node dominating to get Mary to hire, with one of the adjective's subcategorization specifications, that labeled ~], is just a condition for the applicability of the head-complement rule, not an additional specification. Of course, the phrasal node is massively underspecified here, but the suppressed information is predictable, not merely hidden.","This is an intriguing aspect of HPSG, but we dwell on it here for self-serving purposes. If the properties of the phrasal combination of this fairly intricate syntactic structure require no further comment, that is largely because the lexicon has provided a wealth of richly structured representation. This would hardly be feasible in the absence of efficient and sophisticated lexical representation mechanisms. 282 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation Adj easy slash: 0 AdjP to get Mary to hire t • stem: easy sem: [~ easy( [-i-], ̂~] )"]},{"title":"s bj: [som[] ] pp or: [ sem:[ ] comps: subj: [ som:[ ] xcomp:[] sem:[]","paragraphs":["L slash.sem: []","sere: get(x,m, 1 [] \" hire(m, ~])) slash.sere: [] Figure 3 The combination of complex adjective and slashed VP complement.","To complete this illustration, we spell out the effects of unification on the structure above in Figure 4. Note in particular that because the slash semantics on the VP phrase is identified with the slash semantics on the subcategorized-for VP, which in turn is identified with the semantics of the subject for easy, the resultant phrase will bind its subject to the deeply embedded object argument position of the verb hire. This takes place even though the subject plays no role in the easy relation itself. This is exactly what is wanted semantically of a raising construction. 5. Extensions and Lexical Maintenance The structured lexicon aims ideally at a redundancy-free specification of all lexical properties, and indeed, it achieves this largely through the use of inheritance. While we do see scientific parsimony as an end in itself, we see two further advantages in the employment of the structured lexicon, one scientific and one practical. The scientific advantage of the structured lexicon is that it identifies significant classes in the language. In a feature system with approximately 30 atomic features (including semantics), each of which ranges over approximately 10 values, it is certainly striking that we never see the need to distinguish 1030 classes of items. In fact we distinguish approximately 300 lexical classes in HP-NL, a large system with very broad grammatical coverage (see Nerbonne and Proudian 1987). 283 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 stem: easy sem.logic: [] easy( z, ̂get (z, m,","\" hire(m, T,~] U ~]) ) comps:[ subj: [sem:[~]U[~] ] ] Aa5 to get Mary to hire t Figure 4 The result of combining complex adjective and slashed VP complement. Note that the subject of easy is still semantically coindexed with the missing VP object.","But the practical advantage of the structured lexicon may ultimately also be of scientific value, and that is because a structured lexicon is more easily maintained and extended than a nonstructured one. This advantage derives immediately from the characteristic that lexical properties are normally specified only once. Modifications tend then to be minimal and extensions less frightening. The ultimate scientific benefit this may bring derives from the fact that it is then easier in systems with structured lexicons to experiment with grammatical description.","The following section is an attempt to buttress the claim that structured lexicons are easily extended. We examine therefore extensions to the analysis above of adjectives that govern VP complements--to nouns with similar subcategorizations, to the adjectival specifiers too and enough, and to adjectives that govern S complements rather than VP complements. 5.1 Pleasure Nouns Adjectives like easy have been the most widely studied group of lexical types that populate the classes introduced in the analysis above, but they do not have exclusive claim to those classes. Lasnik and Fiengo (1974) observed that the English lexicon also contains a group of nouns with similar properties, as illustrated in (20-21),","(20) a. Nureyev is a pleasure to watch. b. This course is a breeze to pass. c. Venice is a delight to visit.","(21) a. It is a pleasure to watch Nureyev. b. It is a breeze to pass this course. c.

Even though the analysis of predicative NPs is an old topic semantically (cf. the definition of be in Montague 1973, p. 261), there has been essentially no successful attempt to treat predicative nouns as if they had no denotation. Any attempt to do so seems to run afoul of the standard (if limited) determination and adjectival modification found in phrases such as no great pleasure to watch; at least such examples point out the inevitable duplication a semantic analysis would incur if predicative nominals had no denotation.","We therefore interpret pleasure as a three-place relation"]},{"title":"pleasure","paragraphs":["(theme : e~ for : x~ soa : s) which obtains just in case e is the pleasure x has in case s.

Under this analysis, a pleasure to watch and no pleasure to watch denote quantifiers, i.e., in each case a set of properties of pleasures (e's from above). Of course, a quantifier does not by itself represent a proposition, something that could be true or false---for that it must be paired with a property. In these cases, the relevant property is always the universal (existence) property; i.e., utterances of sentences such as (20a) are true just in case there is a pleasure of the relevant kind (and mutatis mutandis for the negative existentials). We therefore postulate that the predicate be in these sentences denotes the universal property. 9","What is striking about this proposal is that it assigns the common noun pleasure exactly the semantics the general scheme predicts--a relation between a theme and the denotations of other complements. For this reason, the word classes for pleasure nouns make no special stipulations about semantics.","We therefore derive feature structures such as the following, which are used in the syntax and semantics processing of the word pleasure.

This follows from the general treatment of unsaturated relations in Situation Theory (cf. Section 2 under subcategorization).

On the assumption that a noun must serve semantically as the subject of adjectival adjuncts, those adjuncts must specify some thematic role for the noun to play. Thus any adjective that requires an expletive subject should give rise to a semantically ill-formed expression when it appears as an adjunct to a noun. What prevents the IT-EASY easy from serving as an adjunct to problem is the fact that this easy requires an expletive it subject.","Given this transferable complement mechanism, we may straightforwardly complete the analysis of the earlier too/enough examples: the lexical entries for these two adverbs simply specify that their gappy infinitival complement is transferable.

We would like to use this section to summarize how we view this work and to suggest directions in which we feel it should move. 6.1 Conclusions We have presented a treatment of complementation that uses nonmonotonic lexical inheritance. The lexical specifications are quite compact and therefore both readily extendible and easily modified. We pointed out cases where nonmonotonic, default specification seems most natural, and the entire treatment turns on the possibility of there being genuine multiple inheritance of a \"complements\" attribute.","We adopt a skeptical approach to inheritance conflict. If there are inheritance conflicts in the system presented here, nothing is inherited. Mechanisms that warn users about such conflicts are useful, but we are wary of attempts to decide conflicts \"in-telligently.\" They seem likely to us to lead to cases where minor changes may have remote consequences, which would detract from maintainability.","We do not feel that we have overstated the case for structured lexicons by choosing a particularly messy or poorly understood area. To insist on this point somewhat, let us note that we omitted significant aspects of the grammar of the \"raising nouns,\" e.g., their complements, specifiers, and adjuncts. 19 Grammar abounds in poorly understood areas, including comparatives, superlatives, adverbials, internal NP syntax, and the \"specialized grammars\" found in dates, places, and technical vocabulary. All of these areas can benefit from the application of a tool for complex lexical description.","18 This leaves much to be said about the lexical properties of too and enough, but more detailed analysis at this point would take us too far afield; it is clear enough that, whatever their other properties, these two adverbs share complementation properties with the adjectives and nouns studied here.","19 For example, for \"pleasure\" nouns, some adjectives are okay, but not all (a real/*competent pleasure to work with; relative clauses are impossible: Sally is a pleasure *[that is real] to work with; and some nominal complements are fine: Sally was a pleasure of the rarest kind to work with. 294 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Cornplernentation 6.2 Hypotheses or Tools? The conclusions above may be read as a plea for the employment of an important tool in computational linguistics, and, indeed, we see the primary significance of the use of structured lexicons not in new expressive power which they bring to natural language processing or description (there is perhaps none), but rather in the increased ease and reliability with which they allow old hypotheses to be formulated and put to use.","Brachman (1983, p. 35) summarizes the dominant view of inheritance in knowledge representation: Even though much has been made in the past of the significance of inheritance in semantic nets, no one has been able to show that it makes any difference in the expressive power of the system that advertises it... It is strictly implementational.","Given this authority on the technical side, it may be surprising to hear more application-oriented users of inheritance mechanisms hedging at all on whether there is any scientific significance to the proposal here. But there is at least a potential candidate: lexical rules may distinguish inherited from specified information.","In expressing the relationships between members of two sets of lexical entries, we make crucial use of the distinction between idiosyncratically specified information (which appears in a sparse Inonredundant] lexical entry) and inherited information. We have adopted here the restrictive hypothesis, proposed in Flickinger (1987), that lexical rules hold for minimally specified lexical entries, without having access to inherited, predictable information. Adopting this hypothesis imposes a constraint on the form and function of lexical rules that is strong, perhaps too strong, but one that allows a simpler formulation of rules by keeping to a minimum the amount of information to be managed. Only two kinds of information are relevant for a lexical rule: the word classes that each of the two related entries belong to, and any idiosyncratic properties specified by either lexical entry. We note that if lexical rules were insensitive to the distinction between idiosyncratic and predictable properties of lexical entries, the statement of even a simple rule like LR-PAST, given earlier, would be much more difficult. If the lexical rule for past tense verbs had to cope with fully specified entries that blurred this distinction, it would be difficult to express in the rule just which properties of the one entry had to match in the other, related entry.","For example, the verb"]},{"title":"like","paragraphs":["idiosyncratically requires a verbal complement that is either infinitival or gerundive, while the verb"]},{"title":"enjoy","paragraphs":["does not allow the infinitival form, allowing only the gerundive form for its complement.

The development of lenses revolutionized astronomy, even though glass grinding embodied no astronomical hypotheses. 6.3 Emergent Issues in Structured Lexicons Perhaps more interesting are the many directions in which this research may be developed. We suggest some of these in the questions below.","What are lexical classes and lexical entries? The careful reader noted in Section 5 above that our lexical specifications are translated into feature structures. Theoretically, we could dispense with the translation for nearly all of the information involved, and have the lexicon describe feature structures directly. But this does not correspond to our implementation, nor are we clear on how, e.g., information on lexical rules and their application ought to be rendered in features. Perhaps lexical entries must be structured so that one component of a lexical entry is a feature structure, while others are not. 2°","Can inheritance be exploited in the specification of inflectional variation? This appears to be a promising area of application, since in general, one can view inflected elements as further specifications of abstract lexemes (cf. Evans and Gazdar 1989 for an intriguing proposal).","Can derivational lexical rules be treated more satisfactorily? For example, it is clear that at least some lexical rules relate not merely a pair of word classes, but rather entire lexical substructures (involving several classes) to one another. Can the techniques of inheritance be applied here, so that exceptional elements may be easily accommodated?

CSLI, Stanford. 298 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation Appendix A: Lexical Fundamentals In the analysis of adjectives governing VP complements that we provide here, we adopt the approach to lexical representation developed in Flickinger (1987). We provide here a brief sketch of the framework, limiting our discussion to those aspects that are relevant to the analysis in the main body of the paper. Lexical Framework Much of the information in a fully specified entry within the lexicon is not unique to that particular entry. Viewing this information as a set of discrete properties making up the lexical entry, related lexical items will have in common some of the properties of that entry. Lexical items can be grouped into classes defined by those properties that are common to all members of the class. By giving a precise characterization of these word classes, one can eliminate a good deal of the redundancy found in a lexicon that consisted of fully specified entries. Put differently, one can make use of these word classes to capture generalizations about the elements of the lexicon and to make predictions about the behavior and distribution of a lexical item on the basis of the classes it belongs to.","To avoid redundancy entirely, each property relevant to representing the elements of a lexicon should only be mentioned once in some single class, with all elements of the lexicon that have this property being members of that class. If so, a given lexical item may have to belong to many classes in order to obtain all of its properties. These word classes form a hierarchy over which rules are defined that govern the inheritance of information from class to class, and ultimately to individual lexical entries. One of the nicest aspects of this idea is that it is readily visualized (cf. Figure 7).","In order to present the class definitions that formally express the properties of the adjectives governing VP complements as collections of attributes with assigned values, we shall make use of the hierarchy of word classes above, where classes inherit their properties from other more general classes, or indeed from several such classes. This hierarchy of classes is intended as the repository of both the syntactic and semantic properties that comprise the fully fleshed-out lexical entries of a language; we will of course only present a very few of the classes that would populate a complete hierarchy, sufficient we hope to prove the promise of such a representation. Part of this hierarchy is devoted to specifying the number and types of complements that predicates allow or require, and among this group of word classes is one defining the properties shared by lexical entries that take a subject and a complement that is semantically controlled (possibly by the subject); we label this class simply CONTROL. Above, we illustrate the barest outlines of the top of the word class hierarchy for English, to suggest where the CONTROL class fits in. We provide the content of CONTROL later.","It is important to note that word classes do not merely form a simple hierarchy, but rather that they form a set of interconnected hierarchies; as Chomsky (1965) argued in his discussion of lexical representation in"]},{"title":"Aspects","paragraphs":["(pp. 79-83), the need to cross-classify a given lexical item according to several distinct properties renders impossible the use of a simple branching hierarchy to represent the lexicon.","We take as adequate motivation for the existence of a word class the demonstration that some particular syntactic or morphological property (or cluster of properties) is shared by a number of lexical items. The forcing function in the identification of word classes is our assumption that the best representation for lexical information is one in which each new piece of information, each distinct property exhibited by one or more elements of the lexicon, is introduced exactly once in the lexicon.

CONTROL TRANSITIVE Figure 7 A sample of lexical classes near the top of the lexical hierarchy. shared by more than one lexical item should be introduced in a word class common to those items, or those lexical items should be related by lexical rule. In the simplest case where a word class or lexical entry belongs to just one superclass, the inheritance rule for how values of an attribute are assigned in the word class hierarchy is quite straightforward. The two alternatives to be considered depend on whether a given attribute permits only one value, or multiple values. Inheritance of Values The value assigned to a particular word class (or member) W for a given attribute is determined as follows:","a. For a single-valued attribute, the assigned value is either introduced directly in W, or is the one introduced in the most specific class to which W belongs. If there is no value introduced anywhere in the linked classes between W and the root WORD-CLASS, inclusively, no value is assigned to W for that attribute.","b. For a multiple-valued attribute, the assigned values are the members of the set consisting of all distinct values 300 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation introduced for that attribute in W and in any of the classes linking W with the root WORD-CLASS, inclusively. 2~","In cases where a class or member belongs to more than one superclass, the picture might be more complicated, since each of two immediate superclasses might specify a different value for the same single-valued attribute. One way to address the potential conflict would be to define another rule of inheritance to take account of multiple parents, a rule which for each attribute assigns priority to some one of the parent classes (see the paper on the ELU lexicon in this collection). We instead assume that the hierarchy is specified in such a way that each single-valued attribute of some given class or member was assigned a value by at most one of the immediate superclasses (or its parents), so conflicting values do not occur.","In adopting this discipline for inheritance of lexical information, we follow Flickinger (1987) rather than accepting the more rigorously defined but more restrictive rules of inheritance defined for DATR by Evans and Gazdar (1989a; 1989b). As will be seen in the discussion to follow, we believe that the ability to inherit a lexical property from more than one potential source can be important in capturing relevant linguistic generalizations. There would be no point to our use of multiple-valued attributes if we did not allow genuine multiple inheritance. We employ the multiple-valued attribute \"complements\" in order to collect subcategorization information about several subcategorized-for elements simultaneously. In its most natural form, the single property \"complements\" inherits from several ancestors simultaneously. 22","We also follow Flickinger, this time accompanied by Evans and Gazdar, in assuming that lexical attributes may be assigned default values as part of a word class definition, with those defaults possibly being overridden in the definition of a subclass or lexical entry inheriting from that word class. In this we part ways with Pollard and Sag (1987)'s strong assumption of monotonicity in the inheritance of lexical properties, again for reasons that we identify in the discussion to follow. 23","While word classes and the associated mechanism of nonmonotonic inheritance provide powerful tools for representing one kind of shared information, that which links a category to its subcategories, a distinct formal device is required to link two morphologically related classes of different categories. We employ the familiar notion of a lexical rule to represent this second kind of systematic (but not exceptionless) relationship. Given a word belonging to the first set, a lexical rule predicts the existence of a corresponding word belonging to the second set, with the differences and similarities between the two words captured both in the formulation of the rule, and in the definitions of the classes each word is a member of.","We illustrate our notation for lexical rules with an example of a relatively simple one, the inflectional rule relating the base forms of verbs with their past tense forms. We can express the relationship between, say, walk and walked as given in the LR-PAST rule below, leaving out specifics of phonology and only hinting at semantics.","21 We employ multiple-valued attributes only within the lexicon in order to gather subcategorization specifications. A translation step converts these to sets (or--with more information--lists) for use in the feature system.","22 The DATR position carefully disallows multiple inheritance of a single property from two or more classes, even while allowing inheritance from various classes into different properties (in a single word class). We find genuine multiple inheritance seems useful, even if it may be dispensible; cf. the treatment of the lexical attribute \"complements\" below.","23 But see Pollard and Sag 1987, p. 194 note. 301 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 Rule LR-PAST lexical rule LR-PAST LE2-Classes - PAST = LE1-Classes - BASE LE2-Spelling = (AFFIX-ED LE1-Spelling) LE2-Phonology .... LE2-Semantics = (PAST LE1-Semantics)","This lexical rule, like any other, expresses a relation holding between two sets of lexical entries, the first set represented by a canonical lexical entry LE1, and the second set by LE2. The rule's applicability is governed by the relevant classes that LE1 and LE2 each belong to, with these classes named in the statement within the rule that relates the one entry's list of parent classes with the other entry's class list. Having specified the range of applicability, each rule then states the particular dependencies holding between properties of LE1 and corresponding properties of LE2. 24","We might view inheritance within a hierarchy of word classes as a tool that eliminates redundancy along one dimension within the lexicon, while lexical rules provide the same service along another dimension. A given lexical item, by virtue of being a member of one or more word classes, shares inherited properties with other lexical items that belong to those same classes, but does not necessarily share a common morphological or semantic base (or indeed any idiosyncratic properties) with any of those other items. That same lexical item, by participating in one or more lexical rules, has properties in common with a second set of lexical items, where the shared properties crucially include some or all of the idiosyncratic information that distinguishes the lexical item from others in its class. The members of this second set, related by lexical rules, all do share a single common semantic and morphological base (except for suppletions).","Of course, if a lexical rule relates two entries that both belong to a given word class (as happens with the verbal inflection rules), those two entries will share some inherited properties as well as the idiosyncracies. However, the lexical rule only establishes joint membership in that given class and the relationship of the idiosyncratic information in the two entries; all other properties shared by the two are established by inheritance within the word class hierarchy.","Both of these formal devices, inheritance and lexical rules, serve to express that which is common among (often overlapping) sets of fully specified lexical entries, including properties that are morphological, syntactic, and semantic. In their capacity as redundancy mechanisms, the two devices permit a parsimonious representation of the existing lexicon. Lexical Content For convenience of exposition, we view the syntactic properties of lexical items as being of two kinds: one a set of features, separated into those with atomic values and those with category values, and the other a set of subcategorization specifications, divided into complements (obligatory and optional), and adjuncts. Even though HPSG represents both types of information (features and subcategorization specifications)","24 We include this rule primarily in order to introduce the notation we shall later employ. We would, however, be quite sympathetic to an alternative treatment of the relation between PAST tense forms and untensed lexemes that employed lexical inheritance rather than inflectional rules to account for the relationship. We deny that this sort of treatment can be extended straightforwardly from inflectional to derivational rules, however. 302 Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne Inheritance and Complementation uniformly as attribute-value pairs (as noted above), we shall represent them lexicaIIy as distinct. We have two motivations for this: first, in representing the information differently from its normal form in HPSG we demonstrate the independence of the lexical ideas presented here. We employ HPSG in the grammatical analysis presented here because it is a useful grammatical framework, and because it makes strenuous lexical demands; but the lexicon framework does not presuppose HPSG (for example, PATR-II systems can make use of structured lexicons, and nearly do, in the form of templates. Compare Shieber 1986, pp. 54-55.). Second, a uniform feature notation needed for subcategorization and nonsubcategorization information threatens to obscure points addressed below, so the two kinds of information are separated in the representations of lexical entries used here.","The atomic-valued features that we employ in specifying lexical entries (and in specifying categories) are drawn from a (small) finite set where each feature has a limited set of possible atomic values, 25 e.g., the binary feature INVERTED, indicating whether or not a verb can appear as the head of an inverted sentence. The feature VFORM, on the other hand, draws its values from a set containing among others BASE, PAST, and PAST-PARTICIPLE, to represent the morphological form of a verb. Category-valued features take as their value a feature structure, a specification for some syntactic category. Since any nonempty set of feature value pairs is (by definition) enough to specify a category, any such set constitutes a possible value for one of these category-valued features.","Each complement or adjunct entry, referred to here as a"]},{"title":"subcat,","paragraphs":["consists of a category specification and its semantic properties. Since reference to subcategorization properties of subcats is excluded in specifying complements or adjuncts within a lexical entry (cf. Pollard and Sag 1987:143-4 for a similar--but not identical--\"locality\" restriction), we make use of a feature COMPLETE, quite similar to the SUBJ feature proposed by Borsley (1983), and employed in Gazdar et al. (1985:61f) to distinguish incomplete from complete categories. Incomplete constituents lack one or more of their obligatory complements, including at least their final complement (usually the subject), and are marked [COMPLETE-], while complete categories are marked [COMPLETE+] to represent the property that no obligatory arguments are missing. (Complete categories correspond roughly to maximal projections in an X-bar framework.) To distinguish lexical categories from phrasal ones, we use the binary feature LEXICAL. With these two features COMPLETE and LEXICAL, we can follow Pollard (1984) in dispensing with the widely used (and abused) X-bar machinery, while maintaining the full range of necessary distinctions among lexical and phrasal categories.","The content of the word-class CONTROL, promised above, is presented here.

It will play the role State-of-Affairs (abbreviated 'soa') in relations denoted by words inheriting from CONTROL, and it will be semantically interpreted by the variable XComp-Semantics. The specification of the semantics will occasionally be omitted below, since the convention should be clear. It is this CONTROL class that will serve as the superclass from which both of the adjectival VP complement classes (cf. IT-EASY and SLASH-EASY below) inherit.","Before concluding the sketch of the lexicon, we turn to the lexical representation of semantics, which likewise plays a role in the final analysis.

Montague (1973) effectively exploited this by interpreting multiplace verbs and verb phrases as functions into the denotations of lesser-place verbs. We exploit the interdependence by allowing some semantic inheritance to follow syntactic subcategorization lines. To be more precise, we allow subcategorizers to specify not only the syntax of their complements, but also the semantic role the complement is assigned in the relation denoted by the subcategorizer.

There is furthermore a substantial body of work on the so-called \"linking\" of semantic roles to syntactic information, including especially Roberts (1991) who applies this theory to HPSG. (Even though we use role- or keyword-coded arguments in lexical specifications, we will occasionally revert to order-coded representations for the purposes of illustration. They are more concise.

Then easy adjectives of the SLASH-EASY class would more precisely subcategorize for an infinitival complement that has an NP gap of the marked SLASH' variety rather than the usual SLASH. To illustrate, consider example (46d): the SLASH' feature that would (by hypothesis) be introduced at the extraction site within the embedded S that Mary admired will be passed up from that site by a general principle, but will stop its ascent when it reaches that S. Assuming that the verb see does not select for this unusual kind of SLASH ~ complement, the sentence will not be admitted as grammatical. In contrast, the example in (46a) will still be admitted since the SLASH t introduced at the extraction site in to hire will be faithfully passed up by the same binding inheritance principle until it reaches the node dominating to get Mary to hire. Now this VP[SLASH / NP] is, according to our proposed refinement, precisely the kind of complement that easy requires, so the sentence is grammatical.","Of course, to properly defend this addition of SLASH I to the collection of binding features for English, we would like to find independent evidence of the claim that finite S's can serve as islands for SLASH. We leave the matter here as one meriting further study, and refer the interested reader to Jacobson (1987) for a similar suggestion to distinguish various slash attributes."]},{"title":"Pied Piping","paragraphs":["A third refinement of the analysis given above is motivated by examples like those in (47), where the easy adjective appears in a noun phrase with an infinitival complement containing a pied piping construction, not accounted for in what we have said thus far. 3°","(47) a.
