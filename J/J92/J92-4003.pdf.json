Della Pietra* Jenifer C. Lai* We address the problem of predicting a word from previous words in a sample of text. In particular, we discuss n-gram models based on classes of words. We also discuss several statistical algorithms for assigning words to classes based on the frequency of their co-occurrence with other words. We find that we are able to extract classes that have the flavor of either syntactically based groupings or semantically based groupings, depending on the nature of the underlying statistics. 1. Introduction In a number of natural language processing tasks, we face the problem of recovering a string of English words after it has been garbled by passage through a noisy channel. To tackle this problem successfully, we must be able to estimate the probability with which any particular string of English words will be presented as input to the noisy channel. In this paper, we discuss a method for making such estimates. We also discuss the related topic of assigning words to classes according to statistical behavior in a large body of text.","In the next section, we review the concept of a language model and give a definition of n-gram models. In Section 3, we look at the subset of n-gram models in which the words are divided into classes. We show that for n = 2 the maximum likelihood assignment of words to classes is equivalent to the assignment for which the average mutual information of adjacent classes is greatest. Finding an optimal assignment of words to classes is computationally hard, but we describe two algorithms for finding a suboptimal assignment. In Section 4, we apply mutual information to two other forms of word clustering. First, we use it to find pairs of words that function together as a single lexical entity. Then, by examining the probability that two words will appear within a reasonable distance of one another, we use it to find classes that have some loose semantic coherence.","In describing our work, we draw freely on terminology and notation from the mathematical theory of communication. The reader who is unfamiliar with this field or who has allowed his or her facility with some of its concepts to fall into disrepair may profit from a brief perusal of Feller (1950) and Gallagher (1968). In the first of these, the reader should focus on conditional probabilities and on Markov chains; in the second, on entropy and mutual information. * IBM T. J.

Language Models Figure I shows a model that has long been used in automatic speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and has recently been proposed for machine translation (Brown et al. 1990) and for automatic spelling correction (Mays, Demerau, and Mercer 1990). In automatic speech recognition, y is an acoustic signal; in machine translation, y is a sequence of words in another language; and in spelling correction, y is a sequence of characters produced by a possibly imperfect typist. In all three applications, given a signal y, we seek to determine the string of English words, w, which gave rise to it. In general, many different word strings can give rise to the same signal and so we cannot hope to recover w successfully in all cases. We can, however, minimize our probability of error by choosing as our estimate of w that string @ for which the a posteriori probability of @ given y is greatest. For a fixed choice of y, this probability is proportional to the joint probability of @ and y which, as shown in Figure 1, is the product of two terms: the a priori probability of @ and the probability that y will appear at the output of the channel when @ is placed at the input. The a priori probability of @, Pr (@), is the probability that the string @ will arise in English. We do not attempt a formal definition of English or of the concept of arising in English. Rather, we blithely assume that the production of English text can be characterized by a set of conditional probabilities, Pr(Wk I W~1-1), in terms of which the probability of a string of words, w~l, can be expressed as a product: Pr (wkl) = Pr(wl)Pr (w2"]},{"title":"Iwl)'\"Pr(Wk Iw~-l).","paragraphs":["(1) Here,"]},{"title":"W~ -1","paragraphs":["represents the string WlW2\"''Wk_ 1.

We refer to a computational mechanism for obtaining these conditional probabilities as a language model.","Often we must choose which of two different language models is the better one. The performance of a language model in a complete system depends on a delicate interplay between the language model and other components of the system. One language model may surpass another as part of a speech recognition system but perform less well in a translation system. However, because it is expensive to evaluate a language model in the context of a complete system, we are led to seek an intrinsic measure of the quality of a language model. We might, for example, use each lan-468 Peter E Brown and Vincent J.

The IBM Tangora speech recognition system has a vocabulary of about 20,000 words and employs a 3-gram language model with over eight trillion parameters (Averbuch et al. 1987). We can illustrate the problems attendant to parameter estimation for a 3-gram language model with the data in Table 1.

Indeed, given such a partition, we know of no practical method for demonstrating that it does, in fact, maximize the average mutual information. We have, however, obtained interesting results using a greedy algorithm. Initially, we assign each word to a distinct class and compute the average mutual information between adjacent classes. We then merge that pair of classes for which the loss in average mutual information is least. After V - C of these merges, C classes remain. Often, we find that for classes obtained in this way the average mutual information can be made larger by moving some words from one class to another. Therefore, after having derived a set of classes from successive merges, we cycle through the vocabulary moving each word to the class for which the resulting partition has the greatest average mutual information. Eventually no potential reassignment of a word leads to a partition with greater average mutual information. At this point, we stop. It may be possible to find a partition with higher average mutual information by simultaneously reassigning two or more words, but we regard such a search as too costly to be feasible.","To make even this suboptimal algorithm practical one must exercise a certain care in implementation.

We measured the perplexity of the Brown corpus with respect to this model and found it to be 271. We then interpolated the class-based estimators with the word-based estimators and found the perplexity of the test data to be 236, which is a small improvement over the perplexity of 244 we obtained with the word-based model. 476 Peter F. Brown and Vincent J. Della Pietra Class-Based n-gram Models of Natural Language 4. Sticky Pairs and Semantic Classes In the previous section, we discussed some methods for grouping words together according to the statistical similarity of their surroundings. Here, we discuss two additional types of relations between words that can be discovered by examining various co-occurrence statistics.","The mutual information of the pair wl and w2 as adjacent words is","Pr (wl w2) (18) log Pr (wl) Pr (w2).

Discussion","paragraphs":["We have described several methods here that we feel clearly demonstrate the value of simple statistical techniques as allies in the struggle to tease from words their linguistic secrets. However, we have not as yet demonstrated the full value of the secrets thus gleaned. At the expense of a slightly greater perplexity, the 3-gram model with word classes requires only about one-third as much storage as the 3-gram language model in which each word is treated as a unique individual (see Tables 1 and 4). Even when we combine the two models, we are not able to achieve much improvement in the perplexity. Nonetheless, we are confident that we will eventually be able to make significant improvements to 3-gram language models with the help of classes of the kind that we have described here. 478 Peter F.
