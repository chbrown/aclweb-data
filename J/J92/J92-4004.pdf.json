Vijay-Shanker*","paragraphs":["University of Delaware This paper describes a new interpretation of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) that allows the embedding of TAG in the unification framework in a manner consistent with the declarative approach taken in this framework. In the new interpretation we present in this paper, the objects manipulated by a TAG are considered to be descriptions of trees. This is in contrast to the traditional view that in a TAG the composition operations of adjoining and substitution combine trees. Borrowing ideas from Description Theory, we propose quasi-trees as a means to represent partial descriptions of trees. Using quasi-trees, we are able to justify the definition of feature structure-based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG) that was first given in Vijay-Shanker (1987) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1988). In the definition of the FTAG formalism given here, we argue that a grammar manipulates descriptions of trees (i.e., quasi-trees); whereas the structures derived by a grammar are trees that are obtained by taking the minimal readings of such descriptions. We then build on and refine the earlier version of FTAG, give examples that illustrate the usefulness of embedding TAG in the unification framework, and present a logical formulation (and its associated semantics) of FTA G that shows the separation between descriptions of well-formed structures and the actual structures that are derived, a theme that is central to this work. Finally, we discuss some questions that are raised by our new interpretation of the TAG formalism: questions dealing with the nature and definition of the adjoining operation (in contrast to substitution), its relation to multi-component adjoining, and the distinctions between auxiliary and initial structures. 1. Introduction A number of grammatical systems and linguistic theories, such as Functional Unification Grammars (FUGs), Lexical Functional Grammars (LFGs), Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (GPSGs), and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammars (HPSGs), are said to take the unification-based approach to grammars. A common aspect shared by these grammars or theories is that they are based on specifying constraints that define well-formed structures. This work discusses viewing Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) in such a manner and embedding it in a unification-based framework.","Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) were first introduced by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (1975). A preliminary study of this formalism, from the point of view of its formal properties and linguistic applicability, was carried out by Joshi (1985). A detailed study of the linguistic relevance of TAG was done by Kroch and Joshi (1985). Abeille et al. (1990) discuss a fairly substantial grammar for English using the lexicalized approach to TAG that was originally proposed by Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi (1988). • Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716.

Predicate-argument, wh-dependencies, and filler-gap dependencies are examples of dependencies that can be localized in a TAG.","Our aim is to view a TAG as defining constraints on well-formed structures (according to the linguistic intuitions being instantiated in the grammar). In this paper, we argue that if we chose to interpret the objects manipulated by a TAG as trees (as is done currently) then it is not possible to embed TAG in a unification framework in a straightforward manner.

We introduce quasi-trees as a means to structurally depict partial specifications of trees. Using this interpretation, we show that the resulting structure obtained after adjoining preserves the structural relationships described in the structures being composed. 1.1 Outline of the Paper For the sake of contrasting the two definitions, we start by giving the currently used definition of TAG. In Section 2, we show that this definition is not consistent with the assumptions made in the unification framework. We propose a novel way of interpreting the basic objects of a TAG, borrowing ideas from description theory (D-theory). By means of an example, we introduce the notion of quasi-trees. We then show how TAG can be embedded in a unification-based framework. This interpretation of the objects manipulated by a TAG grammar as quasi-trees not only leads to our current definition of FTAG, but also explains the earlier definition (Vijay-Shanker 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1988). In Section 3, we give examples to show why the introduction of feature structures and unification adds to the descriptive capabilities of TAG. In particular, we focus on the implementation of the so-called adjoining constraints (that determine locally which structures can be used for adjoining and whether adjunction is mandatory). We will show that not only can adjoining constraints be specified in a linguistically more appealing manner now, but also that in several cases redundant specifications of structural descriptions can be avoided.","In Section 5, we consider some possible implications of the new interpretation of the formalism proposed here. One particular question that arises is whether the operations of adjoining and even multi-component adjoining (as used in Multi-component Tree Adjoining Grammar) can be considered to be the same as the substitution operation where the characteristics of the adjoining and multi-component adjoining operations can be derived from the fundamental (linguistic) assumptions that concern the make-up of elementary objects of a grammar. Questions related to this issue, such as whether a distinction between initial and auxiliary structures (the two types of basic structures used in a TAG) needs to be made, are also raised. Further work along the lines suggested in this section depends on investigation of certain linguistic issues involved in the use of the TAG formalism that is beyond the scope of this work. A1-482 K.

The logical formulation is given, in part, to show the separation between the descriptions of well-formed structures (as specified in a FTAG grammar) and the models that satisfy these descriptions.","We would like to note that the work presented in this paper concerns a formalism and not linguistic issues. A deliberate attempt has been made to only discuss the TAG formalism in general terms rather than focusing on linguistic issues. By doing so, our intent is to pay closer attention to the formalism itself and uncover the aspects of the definition of TAG that are stipulations and those that fall out as a corollary of a formalism that tries to localize dependencies. The use of linguistic examples in this paper by no means indicates the suitability of any linguistic theories. The only assumption that we make is that a grammar will attempt to localize dependencies to the extent possible. 1.2 Introduction to Tree Adjoining Grammars A Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) as"]},{"title":"defined traditionally","paragraphs":["is said to be specified by a finite set of elementary trees.

There are two kinds of elementary trees: initial trees and auxiliary trees. Originally, initial trees (e.g., c~1 and OL 2 in Figure 1) were defined to correspond to minimal sentential structures. Therefore, the root of an initial tree was required to be labeled by the symbol S. With the advent of lexicalized TAG and the use of the substitution operation, this assumption is no longer made (see c~3).","Auxiliary trees (ill, t2 in Figure 2) are usually defined to correspond to minimal recursive constructions.

In the traditional approach to TAG, adjunction was the only operation used to compose trees. In the lexicalized approach to TAG as proposed by Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi (1988), the substitution operation is also used. In this approach, elementary trees are associated with lexical items. These lexical items (indicated by ~) are said to be the anchors of the trees. These trees define the arguments required by the anchor. Figure 1 shows two initial trees ~1 and c~2 whose anchors are transitive verbs.

So far, the only restriction we have placed on the set of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at a node is that the label of that node must be the same as the label of the root (and the foot) node of the auxiliary tree. However, often it becomes necessary to allow only a subset of such auxiliary trees to be adjoined at 484 K. Vijay-Shanker Using Descriptions of Trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar 71 : S NP~.

In a TAG, associated with each node is a list of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at that node. This specification of a set of auxiliary trees with each node is called the Selective Adjoining (SA) constraints of the nodes. A node is said to have a Null Adjoining (NA) constraint if no auxiliary tree is allowed to be adjoined at that node. An NA constraint is specified by associating an empty set with a node. In current TAG literature NA constraints are therefore said to be a special case of SA constraints. In addition, for some nodes it is necessary to insist that adjunction is mandatory at a node. In such a case, we say that the node has an Obligatory Adjoining (OA) constraint.","A more detailed description of TAG, the use of adjoining constraints, their propagation during derivation, and their usefulness in providing linguistic analyses may be found in Kroch and Joshi (1985).

On the other hand, we will see that: in the version of FTAG we define here, decisions such as the choice of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at a node or whether adjunction is mandatory at a node follows from the assertions (stated in terms of feature structures) about the linguistic features of individual nodes, rather than being specific to the adjoining operation.

For instance, one of the assertions we can make is that (since we consider al as a tree) following two immediate domination (ID) links from the S node leads us to the v node. Now consider the tree \"yl (Figure 3) obtained by adjoining at the VP node (of al) that lies along the path from the S node to the v node. In \"Yl, although the S and v node are still present, the v node is no longer the grandchild (two ID links) of the root node. This example illustrates that, in general, the adjoining operation on trees nullifies certain assertions that can be made about the component trees (that are composed). The reason that the traditional definition of TAG is not compatible with the unification approach is that it defines that the grammar manipulates (composes) fully specified structures (trees in this case) rather than partially specified structures. The composition operation of adjoining creates a new structure that does not maintain all of the properties that held in the original (fully specified) structures of which it is composed.","In the rest of the paper we will discuss an alternate definition of TAG and argue that our proposed definition is more compatible with the unification approach. Unlike the traditional definition of TAG, we do not consider the objects manipulated by a grammar to be trees. Rather, we will say that although the elementary objects do specify tree structures, they do so only in a partial fashion. 2.2"]},{"title":"A New Interpretation of TAG Objects","paragraphs":["We start by examining the nature of objects that are manipulated by a TAG. The only assumption we will make about these objects is that the elementary objects of the grammar give a sufficiently enlarged domain of locality that allows localization of statements of dependencies such as subcategorization, and filler-gap. 2.2.1 Quasi-Trees. Let us reconsider al (shown in Figure 1), which is assumed to be one of the tree structures associated with a transitive verb. Let us consider which information captured in this tree is important for asserting the cooccurrence dependencies involved. We must represent the obligatory arguments required by a transitive verb. If we look at the relationship between the obligatory arguments and the anchor captured by the tree al, we notice that the sentence structure is formed by combining the subject NP node with a VP node. This information is often captured by a rule 486 K. Vijay-Shanker Using Descriptions of Trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar (1): S --* NP VP. Also, notice that a VP that captures the combination of the lexical anchor with the other obligatory arguments must be formed. In the case of a transitive verb, such information can be captured by a rule (2): VP ---* vNP. Thus we can see that the essential information captured by c~l includes the simultaneous use of the two rules and can be described by stating the relationships between the six entities (three for each rule) involved in the rules.","These relationships can be stated by means of some assertions about the individual entities. At this point it is useful to use some names (identifiers) to refer to these entities) Let these names be Sl, npl, vpl (for the three symbols in rule (1)) and vp2, v2, np2 (for the three symbols in rule (2)). The assertions given below (that can be captured by the structural representation, ~4, given in Figure 4) can be stated to minimally describe a structure anchored by a transitive verb.","1. The label of the entity referred by Sl is S. It immediately dominates the entities referred to by npl and vpl. npl and vpl correspond to the occurrences of NP and VP in the right-hand side of rule (1) and hence the immediate domination.","2. npl refers to the subject of v2 and is labeled by the symbol NP. It is one of the obligatory arguments required by the anchor.","3. vpl is labeled by VP and is used to indicate the combination with the subject (i.e., npl) to yield a sentence.","4. vp2 (also labeled VP), corresponds to the occurrence of VP in the left-hand side of rule (2). It immediately dominates v2 and np2. vp2 is used to indicate the result of the combination of the transitive verb with the obligatory object argument (given by np2).","5. Since the combination of the anchor with the subcategorized arguments (given by npl and np2) will yield a sentence, the sl dominates v2 by a path of length at least two. Furthermore, the nodes named vpl and vp2 lie on the path from the v2 node to the Sl node. Since vpl must dominate v2, we can conclude that the node named vpl must dominate the node named vp2 (indicated by a dashed link in c~6) and thus, in turn the v2 node. Immediate domination, on the other hand, is represented in the usual fashion.","Here we define the domination relation to be reflexive (i.e., a node dominates itself) in addition to being transitive and antisymmetric. Therefore, we are not stating that the nodes named as vpl and vp2 are necessarily different. Notice that the above assertions have been made independent of TAG or the commitment to use trees for the elementary objects. In TAG, given the decision to use trees, a (minimal) tree that satisfies these assertions will be used. It is due to this minimality requirement that the nodes named as vpl and vp2 are assumed to be the same.","On the other hand, the only decision we have committed to is to use structures large enough to localize subcategorization. In this case, we have given some assertions that describe the structure for simple declarative sentences anchored by a transitive verb. Although compatible (though different) assertions have been made about the 1 We adopt this practice of naming nodes following D-theory.

In fact, this is the reason that structures such as \")/1 (which represents the case where the two are different) in Figure 3 as well as O~1 (where vpl and vp2 both refer to the same node), given in Figure 1, can both be derived. The structure given by c~4 (with the dashed link indicating possible separation) partially describes the phrase structure tree for both cases. Since vpl and vp2 can both refer to the same node, to avoid confusion, henceforth we will call them quasi-nodes. Thus a node such as the VP node in ~1 (Figure 1) is represented by a pair of quasi-nodes in ~4. We will refer to these quasi-nodes as the top (for example, vpl) quasi-node and the bottom (vp2) quasi-node. Structures such as ~4 will be called quasi-trees to indicate that they are not trees but (partial) descriptions of trees.","A second example that also motivates the proposed interpretation of TAG where the elementary objects are taken to be descriptions of trees (quasi-trees with domination and immediate domination links) rather than trees involves the tree structure in the case of topicalization. The topicalization of the object of a transitive verb can be described by the quasi-tree ~5 (in Figure 4), which is the counterpart of ~2 (Figure 1) used traditionally in TAG. If the elementary structures in a TAG are supposed to depict the localization of dependencies such as those arising due to subcategorization and movement, then we claim structures like ~5 are indeed the appropriate structures to consider. For instance, no treatment of topicalization can justify the identification of the nodes referred to by s2 and s3. Thus, a pair of quasi-nodes is appropriate for their representation. As in the case of vpl and vp2 quasi-nodes in ~4, one can only claim that s2 quasi-node dominates s3 quasi-node (again, by domination, we also allow for the possibility that s2 and s3 can refer to the same node). It may be interesting to contrast this lack of information in ~5 (whether or not they refer to the same node) with the use of functional uncertainty in LFG (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988) to account for long-distance dependency.","In order to consistently maintain the distinction between descriptions of trees with trees, while discussing the proposed interpretation of TAG we will use the terms 488 K.

In the version of FTAG formalism we define here, the feature structure that we associate with quasi-nodes simply reflects the assertions that we make about them. For instance, suppose a constraint VP.head.subj.agr = NP.head.agr was used in conjunction with the rule S --* NP VP; and the constraint VP.head = v.head was used with the rule VP --* v NP. These two rules (and associated constraint equations) when used together produce ~6, shown in Figure 5. Notice that the feature structure associated with a top quasi-node can be considered as constraints on it (and hence a constraint on the nature of tree that is rooted at this quasi-node) that are made on the basis of its ancestors and siblings. Similarly, the feature structure associated with a bottom quasi-node reflects the nature of tree that is rooted at this quasi-node (that is its descendants).","Instead of explicitly using a pair of quasi-nodes and drawing the domination (dashed) link between them, we can also depict it in a more traditional manner found in TAG literature (see ol 7 in Figure 5). In such a case a node, such as the VP node in c~7, will have two feature structures (the ones associated with the two quasi-nodes) associated with it. This matches the previous definition of feature structure-based Tree Adjoining Grammars where these two feature structures were called the top and bottom feature structures associated with a node. In fact, this correspondence was independently observed by Henderson (1990) and was used in the translation of an FTAG to a Structure Unification Grammar. When convenient, we will use \"a node with two associated feature structures\" instead of \"a pair of quasi-nodes (with one feature structure associated with each quasi-node).\"","If the objects manipulated by a TAG are considered as quasi-trees, a natural question arises when one considers what would be a node in a tree as a pair of quasi-nodes.

Thus the above-mentioned stipulation is a statement that recursion is factored out of elementary trees. In fact, as we will see, if instead of nonterminal symbols we consider category structures (as specified in GPSG) as labeling nodes then almost all pairs of quasi-nodes in the trees we will consider here will be labeled differently (by compatible or incompatible categories). In fact, it is the relationship between the two labels that will determine the subset of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at a node. Further discussion on this matter can be found in Section 3.","In the definition here, since we do not start by assuming that trees are composed, there is no need to make such an assumption that a pair of quasi-nodes separated by the domination (dashed) link must be labeled the same, unless if it follows from some linguistic principle/intuition being expressed using the TAG formalism.

Thus, given a quasi-tree, its minimal reading leads to the derived tree that is obtained by explicitly equating the related top and bottom quasi-nodes for each pair of quasi-nodes (since by the domination relation specified here any quasi-node dominates itself).

Now if adjunction takes place at a node in some tree that has been derived, then the \"unification\" that has been performed has to be undone to recover the top (relating it with its ancestors and siblings) and bottom (based on the structure it dominates) feature structures. This undoing can be quite complex, especially if the pair of quasi-nodes in question is a part of a derived object rather than an elementary structure specified by the grammar. The above description essentially captures the definition of the formalism presented by Harbusch (1990).","Another point can be made about the scheme presented above. Consider a node whose top and bottom feature structures are incompatible and hence nonunifiable. If we were to insist that only one feature structure were to be associated with every node then we can only unify the compatible parts of the top and bottom feature structures and somehow (perhaps with the use of a device like ANY) retain (effectively) the OA constraint machinery. 3. Feature Structures and Adjoining Constraints In the traditional definition of a TAG, the adjoining possibilities at a node is determined by the association of adjoining constraints with each node. In this section we consider how such constraints may be captured by the use of feature structures and then contrast the two methods of determining the adjoining possibilities. Since we attempt to contrast the adjoining possibilities, in this section we will make correspondences between nodes in trees (used in the traditional definition of TAG) with pairs of quasi-nodes that are linked by the domination (dashed) link. That is, we talk of such pairs of quasi-nodes as the target of adjunction. Also, if we have a pair of quasi-nodes given by ~/1 and r/2 where ?]1 quasi-node dominates ~/2, we will say that the 72 is the bottom quasi-node paired with ~/1 or that ~/1 quasi-node is the top quasi-node paired with 7/2. 3.10A Constraint In the definition of TAG, given in Section 1.2, it was stated that if a node has an OA constraint, then adjoining is mandatory at that node. In terms of quasi-nodes this means that the corresponding pair of quasi-nodes must be separated. Therefore, the use of an OA constraint at a node may be interpreted as stating that the related pair 494 K.

As an example, consider c~8 given in Figure 10. The feature structure of the quasi-root of c~8 has a value of + for the tense attribute to specify that any tree rooted at this quasi-node must satisfy the constraint that it describes a tensed sentence. On the other hand, the feature structure of the paired bottom quasi-node has a value of - for the tense attribute since it only reflects the descendants.

The definition of adjunction used here is stated in terms of a pair of substitutions (and thus adjunction involves two unifications). In terms of quasi-trees, we allow the \"SA\" constraints to be determined as a consequence of the unifications required by identifications of quasi-nodes. If an auxiliary quasi-tree cannot be adjoined at a pair of quasi-nodes, then it must be the case that there is an incompatibility among the relevant pairs of feature structures that we unify when we attempt adjunction.

A Logical Formulation A central theme in our definition of FTAG has been the view that the objects manipulated by a grammar are descriptions of trees (rather than trees). This separation of descriptions of trees from the trees (models) derived has been crucial in embedding TAG in the unification framework. The question of which language to use to describe trees (together with its semantics) arises. We have used quasi-trees (as the descriptions themselves) in order to focus on TAG, and have not introduced some general formal framework for describing trees. The discussion below does not constitute a suggestion about how such general descriptions may be given, but is one way to specify an FTAG that will be convenient for our purposes here.","In this section, we describe a logical formulation of the unification-based approach to TAGs. The purpose of providing a logical formulation of FTAG is so that we can find the denotation of an FTAG grammar (the set of structures generated) as well as contrast it with context-free grammar-based unification grammars. To define the denotation of an FTAG grammar, we will first describe how an FTAG grammar can be represented. This representation uses the logical formulation of feature structures as given by Kasper and Rounds (1986) and Johnson (1988) and is similar in approach to the logical formulation of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987).","In the framework of Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987), an FUG (or any context-free grammar with associated unification equations as in, say PATR-II) can be represented by means of a set of equations, using the formulae of Kasper-Rounds to represent feature structures. For example, a context-free grammar rule S --* NP VP can be represented as s ::= CAT : S A 1 : np A 2 : vp. Here s, np, and vp are type variables. The attributes 1 and 2 are used to indicate the first and second children respectively. Using standard techniques to derive fixed points from a set of recursive rules, the denotation of type variables are obtained. The denotation of the type variables gives the set of structures derived from the corresponding nonterminals.","Now suppose we wish to express reentrancy in feature structures by using variables; it is clear that we have to use individual variables and not type variables. As in Johnson (1988), we use individual variables and equalities to express reentrancy. The syntax we adopt to describe attribute-value structures is as follows. Firstly, the set of terms is defined as","t::= a x l(tl) where a is an atomic value where x is an individual variable where 1 is a label (or attribute) and tl is a term. 501 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 The set of formulae is defined as"]},{"title":"0::=","paragraphs":["tl ~ t2 01 A 02"]},{"title":"0~","paragraphs":["v"]},{"title":"02","paragraphs":["where tl,t2 are terms where 01,02 are formulae where 01~ 02 are formulae.","For example, (l(x) = y) A (h(x) = z) A (g(y) = z) A (z = a) describes (among others) the following feature structure. 1 : g : [-i-~ ] h : [~a","Note that individual variables (that stand for individual feature structures) are being used to capture reentrancy, whereas typed variables play a role analogous to the role of nonterminals in grammars (such as CFGs) and stand for a set of feature structures. For the purpose of describing an FTAG, we need individual variables to specify reentrancy (as well as to refer to quasi-nodes) and \"typed\" variables to denote the set of structures derived from elementary quasi-trees. To distinguish between these two kinds of variables, in our framework, we will use monadic predicate instead of typed variables. 4.1 Expressing an FTAG Firstly, we note that quasi-initial trees are analogous to nonterminals in CFGs. Thus, as indicated above, quasi-initial trees will be represented by monadic predicates. If a is a quasi-initial tree, then we will use a predicate symbol ~ to represent this quasi-tree. If a structure ,,4 is derivable in the grammar starting from a then we would like to have .4 to belong to the set denoted by ~. For example, any structure described by Ot14 can be assumed to satisfy the requirements on the variable x in cat(x) ~ S A Dom(x,y) A cat(y) ~ S A l(y) ~ z A count(y) ~ zero A cat(z) ~, c. This description is intended to not only describe the features of nodes, but also the structure of the subtrees rooted at each node (with attributes 1,2,... used to specify the first, second, ... child of a node). In the formula given above, x represents the quasi-root node. Therefore, we will define ~14 by ~14(X) K===~ cat(x) ~ S A Dom(x,y) A cat(y) ~ S A l(y) ~ z A count(y) ,~ zero A cat(z) ~ c. In this case, Dom(x, y) is used to indicate that the quasi-root (x) dominates the associated bottom quasi-node (given by y).","Now if we view the definition of 0t14 independent of the rest of the grammar, then Dom(x,y) represents domination in any arbitrary manner. However, the rest of the grammar specifies the constraints on the domination relation by defining the actual possibilities for the domination. This is because a pair of quasi-nodes (say as given by x and y in c~14) is intended to mean that either they are the same objects or are different nodes that are related by proper domination. In our definition, the separation can take place only by adjunction. So given a grammar, we can specify that the domination relationship is actually defined by Dom(x,y) 4==~ x ~ y V fll(x~y) V ...

Since the actual definition of the domination between a pair of quasi-nodes is determined by the quasi-trees of the grammar, it is appropriate to consider fixed-point semantics to define the denotation of a grammar.","Before we discuss the fixed point we will complete our discussion about how we can specify a grammar. Let us define another monadic predicate Inittree by Inittree(x) 4=~ ~l(x) V ... V ~m(X) where {al,... ,OLm} is the set of initial trees. If we further wish to stipulate that a structure is derived in a FTAG if it is derived from some quasi-initial tree and is rooted in S we can define Grammar(x) 4=~ Inittree(x) A cat(x) = S. Note that for a quasi-node (referred to as x) where substitution can take place, we can specify Inittree(x) to specify the substitution.","We will now illustrate the representation of an FTAG grammar, shown pictorially in Figure 15. This grammar contains c~14 and fl16.

This logical formulation of FUG essentially captures CFG-based unification grammars where substitution (and associated unifications) is the operation used for composition. This can be seen from their semantic treatment where type variables are repeatedly substituted for. Rather than using type variables for \"nonterminals,\" in our formulation predicate symbols represent the nonterminals. Although \"substitution\" at frontier nodes can be effectively captured by Rounds-Manaster-Ramer calculus, we found it less cumbersome to express adjunction operation and FTAG in the above DCG-like style. The domination relation and adjunction operation are easily captured by using binary predicates and their substitutions. Despite these syntactic differences, the presentation of the semantics is essentially the same traditional fixed-point semantics. Not only do we capture the substitution operation, as was done in the Rounds-Manaster-Ramer calculus, but we are also able to contrast FUG (and CFG-based unification grammars) with FTAG by capturing adjoining as a pair of substitutions. 5. Some Consequences of the New Interpretation So far we have concerned ourselves with an interpretation of TAG that is compatible with the constraint-based approach to grammars. We will now briefly discuss some possible implications that this new interpretation may have on design or development of TAG grammars. The point of this section is simply to raise certain possibilities and questions. Providing definitive answers and solutions involves exploring linguistic issues that are beyond the scope of this work. 5.1 Adjoining, Multi-Component Adjoining, and Substitution We defined the adjoining operation as an operation that fits a structure in the gap between a pair of associated quasi-nodes. Although the nature of the adjoining operation itself has not been examined in much detail in this paper (apart from defining it in terms of quasi-nodes in a manner such that it is similar to the traditional definition), questions that arise from this work are: how different is the adjoining operation from the more commonly used substitution operation; and whether the definition of adjoining itself (as stated here) follows from some more fundamental linguistic assumptions. To motivate our arguments, we start by considering an example using the so-called multi-component adjoining. 506 K. Vijay-Shanker Using Descriptions of Trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar Consider the derivation of: (1) Which picture did you buy a copy of? (2) Which picture did you buy a photograph of a copy of? This form of long-distance dependency cannot be localized in a TAG if we wish to localize the predicate-argument dependencies as well (for details, see Kroch [1987]). On the other hand, an analysis has been given using a version of multi-component adjoining. Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar (MCTAG) differs from (the traditional definition of) TAG in that the elementary objects of the grammar are sets of trees rather than trees, and multi-component adjoining involves the composition of these elementary sets of trees 4 (rather than elementary trees). See Joshi (1987) for more details on Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammars (MCTAG).","The multi-component sets, given in Figure 16, may be used to give an account for sentences (1) and (2). Obtained by adjoining the two components of fl. 17 in C~lS, % can be used for sentence (1) (Figure 17).","The need for introducing multi-component sets and multi-component adjoining (in this case, at least) arises because of the decision in traditional TAGs to compose trees (rather than descriptions of trees, i.e., quasi-trees). In particular, the domination relations allow us to give partial descriptions of trees such as oL16 (in Figure 18) that captures the same information as in the multi-component set fl17 (in Figure 16). Note that OL16 can be described by using the same principles that relate (X13 and O~12 (see Figure 14). If, for a moment, we consider c~15 to be an auxiliary quasi-tree (rather than an initial quasi-tree) and use it for \"adjoining\" (treating the n2 quasi-node as the quasi-foot) then we obtain the same structure as \"Y8 (Figure 17).","Two issues can be raised with respect to this example. Firstly we can question whether such uses of multi-component adjoining (and where the foot node of one component dominates the root of the other components in the eventual structure 5) can be considered to be adjoining in the quasi-tree framework; and secondly whether these operations can be thought of as essentially the substitution operation when viewed in this framework (that uses quasi-trees rather than trees). However, c~15 would normally be called an initial quasi-tree, and we would have considered substitution at the 1\"/2 quasi-node rather than treating C~lS as an auxiliary quasi-tree and the n2 quasi-node as the quasi-foot. Nevertheless, this \"adjunction\" of oL15 seems to be really playing the role of substitution (with a sub-quasi tree though).","Addressing the first issue, in the case of the multi-component adjoining example used here, we believe the need for multi-component adjoining arises from the fact that objects being composed were defined to be trees. Even in the previous version of FTAG, it was assumed that the objects being composed were trees despite the fact that two feature structures were associated with each node. These top and bottom feature structures associated with a node were supposed to account for a view of that node from two different perspectives (from the top and from below). However, 4 There are three different definitions of multi-component adjoining that have been proposed. The version considered here is the simplest kind: one where a set of trees are simultaneously adjoined into a single tree. This version leads to a system weakly equivalent to TAG. The other definitions include the case where sets of trees are adjoined simultaneously into nodes in trees that belong to another set and finally where a set of auxiliary trees are adjoined simultaneously without any restriction on the adjoining sites, 5 Although not a part of the definition of multi-component adjoining, in all analyses we are aware of, it is the case that the foot node of one component dominates the root of the other component in the eventual structure. 507 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4"]},{"title":"/ 18 :","paragraphs":["~17 : S ~ NPI $ which painting NP DET N' a N PP"]},{"title":"A copy","paragraphs":["p NP(, of NP Cgl5 : S DET N' a N PP did N'P VP"]},{"title":"I A IA photograph","paragraphs":["p NP i you v NIP"]},{"title":"I II of buy","paragraphs":["• Figure 16 A multi-component tree adjoining grammar. because one was dealing with a"]},{"title":"single node,","paragraphs":["it was taken for granted that the two feature structures associated with the"]},{"title":"single","paragraphs":["node would assign the node the same label (S,"]},{"title":"NP,...),","paragraphs":["no matter which perspective (viewing a node from above or from below) one took.

This is the assumption we made when we \"adjoined\" the quasi-tree c~lS to capture the effect of multi-component adjoining.","Assuming that c~15 is an auxiliary structure points out the similarities between multi-component adjoining and adjoining.

It is hard to justify that s2 quasi-node of fl19 is the quasi-foot on the basis of factoring of recursion (the original reason for introducing auxiliary structures).

Among the quasi-nodes that appear in the frontier of flw, the s2 quasi-node is called the quasi-foot because extraction cannot occur from a tree that can appear below the subject NP quasi-node, whereas it can in the case of s2 quasi-node.

If we insist that the resulting structure must describe a tree, then we must have either sl dominate s3 or s3 dominate s~. Now suppose there are some fundamental linguistic principles (perhaps those principles that govern the makeup of elementary structures and hence also the characteristics of the domination link between paired quasi-nodes) that determine that it is the case that s 3 must dominate sl and not vice versa. In this case we obtain 79 (as shown in Figure 21), a structure obtained by \"adjoining\" fl19. In fact, that s3 must dominate Sl must be derivable from any reasonable linguistic theory that is used to produce the elementary structures concerned (for otherwise a wrong sequence of words would be predicted)• One possible explanation of why s3 dominates Sl could be given by importing a device like the functional uncertainty machinery (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988) used in LFG• The treatment used in LFG, when imported here, would suggest that zero or more structures of the form given by fl19 would fit in the gap specified by the domination link between s3 and s4. Thus when the identification of s2 and s4 takes place, s3 must dominate sl and again zero or more structures of the form of fl19 could fit between s3 and sl now (see Joshi and Vijay-Shanker [1989]) for a discussion of the treatment of long-distance dependency in TAG and LFG). Another way to explain the domination of s3 over sl could be done by using the notions of maximal government domains discussed by Kroch (1989) and using it now to define the characteristics of the domination links such as that between s3 and s4. Note that once the nature of the adjoining operation has been derived, one can pre-compile out the linguistic principles and machinery used to express it. Thus even if one uses, say, the functional uncertainty machinery or maximal government domains, these additional devices (used during the developmental stages) of the grammar need not be used again during the derivation process once we have derived the adjoining operation• This is analogous to the situation with elementary structures. Some linguistic theory will be involved in defining the elementary structures of a TAG. However, once the grammar has been developed, these principles are no longer directly involved during the derivation phase• This is because the principles have been pre-compiled into the elementary structures built•","Figure 22 describes the general situation that may be used to contrast substitution, adjoining and multi-component adjoining• As usual, the identification of the bl and b2 quasi-nodes defines the substitution of the O~21 at the bl quasi-node of c~20.

If the cl quasi-node dominates al (as in \"710), we have a structure that appears like the one obtained by adjoining. Suppose there is some principle that predicts this situation to occur when substitution takes place; then we can conclude that adjoining is not a fundamental operation in itself but rather a derived operation. Trying to capture the above-mentioned principle would involve specifying the characteristics of the domination link between pairs of quasi-nodes such as that specified by Cl and b3 and the makeup of elementary structures of a grammar.","Let us now consider the other case.

This appears to correspond to the version of multi-component adjoining where different components of a set ({{~0, ~}) are adjoined simultaneously into another multi-component set, ({0£~2, ~})\" Other possibilities include 0£20 and O~2 splintered into some number of pieces (depending on the domination links found in them) and interleaved in a more complex fashion.","To summarize, when we substitute at bl by identifying it with a quasi-root of another structure, we have the standard substitution. On the other hand, when we substitute at bl by identifying bl and b3, if cl dominates al then the resulting structure appears to be the one formed after adjunction. When al dominates Cl the situation seems to be comparable with that of multi-component adjoining, where (~20 and 0£22 are multi-component sets made up of 0£20,' c~20\" and 0~22 ,' 0£22 ,'' respectively. Such multi-component adjoining has been used previously in providing linguistic analyses. Since both cases occur (al dominates cl or vice versa), we believe it only further justifies our claim that in situations where we consider substitutions as above, whether we have cl dominating al (adjoining) or not (multi-component adjoining) depends on the linguistic principles being instantiated during the development of elementary structures (and 513 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4","\")'12 \" $"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["NP VP \"/13 \" J Figure 24 Representation of an elementary structure.

Thus, this raises the question that although adjoining is used in defining the TAG formalism, could it too (like the elementary structures) be precompiled from some more fundamental principles? 5.2 Describing the Elementary Objects of a Grammar In this section we show that the new interpretation of the TAG formalism allows the possibility of representing a grammar in a more compact fashion. This is illustrated by means of an example.","The structure named \"/12 (Figure 24) pictorially represents the normal (or default) tree structure that can be associated with any verb, whereas 3'13 will be used specifically in the case of a simple transitive verb. The default structure associated with a simple transitive verb can be obtained by considering the description illustrated pictorially by 3'13 and inheriting the description (3'12) that is common for all verbs. Now since the Vl and v2 nodes have to be identified, we have the following.","• The domination link between vpl and Vl quasi-nodes indicates a path length greater than or equal to 0. However, in this case since the labels of these quasi-nodes are different, they cannot refer to the same node. Thus, in this case we have a path length that is greater than 0.","• vp2 quasi-node immediately dominates the v2 quasi-node (i.e., path length=l).","• Since Vl and v2 quasi-nodes are identified and since we insist on a tree structure, we have vpl and vp2 quasi-nodes in the domination relation. In fact vpl quasi-node must dominate vp2 quasi-node in the resulting structure by a path of length 0 or more (from the two observations above). Thus we get the structure given by c~2a as desired. Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (1992) describe a proof system that can be used to perform the type of reasoning involved in constructing the structure o~23 as described above.","In the manner described above we can build the default structure for every subcategorization frame. Such structures will be specified in any lexicalized TAG; the difference (in the envisaged specification method) is that we no longer precompile out 514 K. Vijay-Shanker Using Descriptions of Trees in a Tree Adjoining Grammar all possibilities (thus repeating the structure ~'12 in all structures associated with every type of verb). To complete the description of the rest of the elementary quasi-trees one would have to use transformations, meta-rules, or lexical rules to specify the structures for passivization, wh-movement, topicalization, etc. Work along this direction is being carried out (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992). 6. Conclusions In this paper, we have embedded TAG in the unification framework in a manner consistent with the constraint-based approach used in this framework. Starting from first principles and taking the localization of dependencies within the elementary structures of a TAG grammar as the only basic principle, we have argued that the objects manipulated by such a grammar are not trees but descriptions of well-formed syntactic structures. From D-Theory, we have adopted the use of domination relation and use of identifiers to refer to nodes while describing such structures. Quasi-trees were introduced to depict pictorially partial descriptions of trees. The pairing of quasi-nodes (with domination link between them) was then used to explain the association of two feature structures with individual nodes in previous definition of Feature structure-based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG). In fact, we also show that the formalism defined in Harbusch (1990) (where only one feature structure is associated with every node) turns out to be similar to the use of FTAG with an additional decision to merge every pair of quasi-nodes by default. We argue that such defaults lead to nonmonotonic behavior.","One can now view FTAG as a generalization of TAG in that arbitrary categories (as used in GPSG) can label nodes, instead of just atomic symbols (nonterminals) as in TAG. In fact, by not insisting that a pair of quasi-nodes be labeled by the same category in FTAG, as was done in TAG, we argue that the \"adjoining constraints\" follow from the definition of adjunction and the labeling of quasi-nodes, thus making unnecessary the stipulations of SA and OA constraints. In addition, contrary to the assumptions made in current literature on TAG, we show that there are two possible interpretations of NA constraints, only one of which is a special case of SA constraint. We note that as the information associated with quasi-nodes grows during derivation, \"adjoining constraints\" get instantiated dynamically in an FTAG. We make use of this property in order to give examples to show how FTAG can give more succinct descriptions than TAG.","We have given a logical formulation of FTAG. This builds on a similar treatment of FUG given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer. We view this logical formulation as a description of those trees and associated feature structures that are built by CFG-based unification grammars. Unlike a CFG-based formalism that allows only for substitution operation, for an FTAG one has to depict adjunction in addition to substitution. Our treatment captures both these cases. We end by giving a presentation of the semantics that can be used to give the denotation of a grammar, i.e., in our case, the structures derived by a grammar.","We have emphasized throughout the paper that we are only interested in the definition of the FlAG formalism. In particular, we have not been concerned with linguistic analyses. However, we have raised a few questions about the formalism that we believe can only be answered on linguistic grounds. In the context of the new interpretation, some of these include whether the linguistic uses of multi-component adjoining can be simulated as the adjoining operation; whether there is an essential need to divide the elementary structures of the grammar as initial and auxiliary structures; and whether the adjoining operation itself can be defined as a substitution 515 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 operation, the apparent differences between these operations being derived on the basis of some more fundamental linguistic principles used in the design of the elementary structures of the grammar. Even if the answer is in the affirmative, we believe there is considerable advantage to be gained by deriving this operation in order that we can manipulate directly the elementary structures that localize various forms of the dependencies. As observed earlier, with the derivation of this operation (like the derivation of the elementary structures of the grammar), we can disregard (i.e., not reason with) the principles used (to derive them) during the derivation of more complex structures. Finally we have also shown that the new interpretation of the TAG formalism proposed here allows for the possibility of a more compact representation of a TAG grammar.
