The resulting context-sensitive rules are used by a stack-based, shift~reduce parser to compute unambiguous syntactic structures of sentences. The acquisition system and parser have been applied to the phrase structure and case analyses of 345 sentences, mainly from newswire stories, with 99% accuracy. Extrapolation from our current grammar predicts that about 25 thousand CDG rule examples will be sufficient to train the system in phrase structure analysis of most news stories. Overall, this research concludes that CDG is a computationally and conceptually tractable approach for the construction of sentence grammar for large subsets of natural language text. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["An enduring goal for natural language processing (NLP) researchers has been to construct computer programs that can read narrative, descriptive texts such as newspaper stories and translate them into knowledge structures that can answer questions, classify the content, and provide summaries or other useful abstractions of the text. An essential aspect of any such NLP system is parsing--to translate the indefinitely long, recursively embedded strings of words into definite ordered structures of constituent elements. Despite decades of research, parsing remains a difficult computation that often results in incomplete, ambiguous structures; and computational grammars for natural languages remain notably incomplete. In this paper we suggest that a solution to these problems may be found in the use of context-sensitive rules applied by a deterministic shift/reduce parser.","A system is described for rapid acquisition of a context-sensitive grammar based on ordinary news text. The resulting grammar is accessed by deterministic, bottom-up parsers to compute phrase structure or case analyses of texts that the grammars coven The acquisition system allows a linguist to teach a CDG grammar by showing examples of parsing successive constituents of sentences. At this writing, 16,275 example constituents have been shown to the system and used to parse 345 sentences ranging from 10 to 60 words in length achieving 99% accuracy. These examples compress to a grammar of 3,843 rules that are equally effective in parsing. Extrapolation from our data suggests that acquiring an almost complete phrase structure grammar for AP Wire text will require about 25,000 example rules. The procedure is further demonstrated to apply directly to computing superficial case analyses from English sentences. • Department of Computer Sciences, AI Lab, University of Texas, Austin TX 78712. E-mail @cs.texas.edu t Boeing Helicopter Computer Svces, Philadelphia, PA (~) 1992 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4","One of the first lessons in natural or formal language analysis is the Chomsky (1957) hierarchy of formal grammars, which classifies grammar forms from unrestricted rewrite rules, through context-sensitive, context-free, and the most restricted, regular grammars. It is usually conceded that pure, context-free grammars are not powerful enough to account for the syntactic analysis of natural languages (NL) such as English, Japanese, or Dutch, and most NL research in computational linguistics has used either augmented context-flee or ad hoc grammars. The conventional wisdom is that context-sensitive grammars probably would be too large and conceptually and computationally untractable. There is also an unspoken supposition that the use of a context-sensitive grammar implies using the kind of complex parser required for parsing a fully context~sensitive language.","However, NL research based on simulated neural networks took a context-based approach. One of the first hints came from the striking finding from Sejnowski and Rosenberg's NETtalk (1988), that seven-character contexts were largely sufficient to map each character of a printed word into its corresponding phoneme---where each character actually maps in various contexts into several different phonemes. For accomplishing linguistic case analyses McClelland and Kawamoto (1986) and Miikkulainen and Dyer (1989) used the entire context of phrases and sentences to map string contexts into case structures. Robert Allen (1987) mapped nine-word sentences of English into Spanish translations, and Yu and Simmons (1990) accomplished comparable context-sensitive translations between English and German simple sentences. It was apparent that the contexts in which a word occurred provided information to a neural network that was sufficient to select correct word sense and syntactic structure for otherwise ambiguous usages of language.","In order to solve a problem of accepting indefinitely long, complex sentences in a fixed-size neural network, Simmons and Yu (1990) showed a method for training a network to act as a context-sensitive grammar. A sequential program accessed that grammar with a deterministic, single-path parser and accurately parsed descriptive texts. Continuing that research, 2,000 rules were accumulated and a network was trained using a back-propagation method. The training of this network required ten days of continuous computation on a Symbolics Lisp Machine. We observed that the training cost increased by more than the square of the number of training examples and calculated that 10,000-20,000 rules might well tax a supercomputer. So we decided that storing the grammar in a hash table would form a far less expensive option, provided we could define a selection algorithm comparable to that provided by the trained neural network.","In this paper we describe such a selection formula to select rules for context-sensitive parsing, a system for acquiring context-sensitive rules, and experiments in analysis and application of the grammar to ordinary newspaper text. We show that the application of context-sensitive rules by a deterministic shift/reduce parser is a conceptually and computationally tractable approach to NLP that may allow us to accumulate practical grammars for large subsets of English texts."]},{"title":"2. Context-Dependent Parsing","paragraphs":["In NL research most interest has centered on context-free grammars (CFG), augmented with feature tests and transformations, used to describe the phrase structure of sentences. There is a broad literature on Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al. 1985), Unification Grammars of various types (Shieber 1986), and Augmented 392 Robert E Simmons and Yeong-Ho Yu Context-Dependent Grammars for English Transition Networks (J. Allen 1987). Gazdar (1988) calls attention to a subcategory of context-sensitive grammars called indexed languages and illustrates some applicability to natural languages, and Joshi illustrates an application of \"mild context-sensitivity\" (Joshi 1987), but in general, NL computation with context-sensitive grammars is a largely unexplored area.","While a few advanced NLP laboratories have developed grammars and parsing capabilities for significantly large subsets of natural language, 1 it cannot be denied that massive effort was required and that the results are plagued by ambiguous interpretations. These grammars are typically a context-free form, augmented by complex feature tests, transformations, and occasionally, arbitrary programs. The combination of even an efficient parser with such intricate grammars may greatly increase computational complexity of the parsing system (Tomita 1985). It is extremely difficult to write and maintain such grammars, and they must frequently be revised and retested to ensure internal consistency as new rules are added. We argue here that an acquisition system for accumulating context-sensitive rules and their application by a deterministic shift/reduce parser will greatly simplify the process of constructing and maintaining natural language parsing systems.","Although we use context-sensitive rules of the form uXv ~ uYv they are interpreted by a shift/reduce parser with the result that they can be applied successfully to the LR(k) subset of context-free languages. Unless the parser is augmented to include shifts in both directions, the system cannot parse context-sensitive languages. It is an open question as to whether English is or is not context-sensitive, but it definitely includes discontinuous constituents that may be separated by indefinitely many symbols. For this reason, future developments of the system may require operations beyond shift and reduce in the parser. To avoid the easy misinterpretation that our present system applies to context-sensitive languages, we call it Context-Dependent Grammar (CDG).","We begin with the simple notion of a shift/reduce parser. Given a stack and an input string of symbols, the shift/reduce parser may only shift a symbol to the stack (Figure la) or reduce n symbols on the stack by rewriting them as a single symbol (Figure lb). We further constrain the parser to reduce no more than two symbols on the stack to a single symbol. The parsing terminates when the stack contains only a single root element and the input string is empty. Usually this class of parser applies a CFG to a sentence, but it is equally applicable to CDG. 2.1 CDG Rule Forms The theoretical viewpoint is that the parse of a sentence is a sequence of states, each composed of a condition of the stack and the input string. The sequence ends successfully when the stack contains only the root element (e.g. SNT), and the input string is 1 Notable examples include the large augmented CFGs at IBM Yorktown Hts, the Univ. of Pennsylvania, and the Linguistic Research Ctr. at the Univ. of Texas. 393 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 INPUT SENTENCE t._i Ci+l t__i+2 .... t. tn Nrk STACK bottom INPUT SENTENCE t.i+l t 1+2 f_i+$ .... t_ln NT._~, t l STACK bottom t i,t m,.~,t I are terminals.

To avoid this difficulty, the stack and input parts of a rule are limited to five symbols each. In the following example the stack and input parts are separated by the symbol \"*/' as the idea is applied to the sentence \"The old man from Spain ate fish.\" The symbol _ stands for blank, art for article, adj for adjective, p for preposition, n for noun, and v for verb. The syntactic classes are assigned by dictionary lookup in a context-sensitive dictionary. 2 394 Robert F.

Note that the first four operations can be described as shifts followed by the two reductions, adj n ~ np, and art np ~ np. Subsequently the p and n were shifted onto the stack and then reduced to a pp; then the np and pp on the stack were reduced to an np, followed by the shifting of v and n, their reduction to vp, and a final reduction of np vp ---* snt. Illustrations similar to this are often used to introduce the concept of parsing in AI texts on natural language (e.g.J. Allen 1987).","We could perfectly well record the grammar in pairs of successive states as follows: ___ np p* n v n __--* __ np p n* v n ___ __ np p n* v n ___7 ___ np pp* v n ___ but some economy can be achieved by recording the operation and possible label as the right half of a rule. So for the example immediately above, we record: _ _ _ np p * n v n _ _ --+ (S) __nppn*vn___--*(Rpp) where S shifts and (R pp) replaces the top two elements of the stack with pp to form the next state of the parse.","Thus a windowed context of ten symbols is created as the left half of a rule and an operation as the right half. Note that if the stack were limited to the top two elements, and the input to a single element, the rule system would reduce to a binary rule CFG.","The example in Figure 2 shows how a sentence \"Treatment is a complete rest and a special diet\" is parsed by a context sensitive shift/reduce parser.

The next operation is solely decided by the windowed context. It can be observed that the last state in the analysis is the single symbol SNT--the designated root symbol, on the stack along with an empty input string, successfully completing the parse.","And this is the CDG form of rule used in the phrase structure analysis. 2.2 Algorithm for the Shift/Reduce Parser The parser accepts a string of syntactic word classes as its input and forms a ten-symbol vector, five symbols each from the stack and the input string. It looks up this vector as the left half of a production in the grammar and interprets the right half of the production as an instruction to modify the stack and input sequences to construct the next state of the parse. To accomplish these tasks, it maintains two stacks, one for the input string and one for the syntactic constituents. These stacks may be arbitrarily large.","An algorithm for the parser is described in Figure 3. The most important part of this algorithm is to find an applicable CDG rule from the grammar. Finding such a rule is based on the current windowed context. If there is a rule whose left side exactly matches the current windowed context, that rule will be applied. However, realistically, it is often the case that there is no exact match with any rule. Therefore, it is necessary to find a rule that best matches the current context. 396 Robert E Simmons and Yeong-Ho Yu Context-Dependent Grammars for English CD-SR-Parser(Input,Cdg) Input is a string of syntactic classes for the given sentence. Cdg is the given CDG grammar rules.","Stack := empty","do until(Input = empty and Stack = (SNT)) Windowed-context := Append(Top-five(stack),First-ilve(input)) Operation := Consult_CDG(Window-context,Cdg) if First(Operation) = SHIFT then Stack := Push(First(Input),Stack)","Input := Rest(Input) else Stack := Push(Second(Operation),Pop(Pop(Sta~k))) end do The functions, Top_five and First-five, return the lists of top (or first) five elements of the Stack and the Input respectively. If there are not enough elements, these procedures pad with blanks. The function Append concatenates two lists into one. Consult_CDG consults the given CDG rules to find the next operation to take. The details of this function are the subject of the next section. Push and Pop add or delete one element to/from a stack while First and Second return the first or second elements of a list, respectively. Rest returns the given list minus the first element. Figure 3 Context-sensitive shift reduce parser. 2.3 Consulting the CDG Rules There are two related issues in consulting the CDG rules. One is the computational representation of CDG rules, and the other is the method for selecting an applicable rule.","In the traditional CFG paradigms, a CFG rule is applicable if the left-hand side of the rule exactly matches the top elements of the stack. However, in our CDG paradigm, a perfect match between the left side of a CDG rule and the current state cannot be assured, and in most cases, a partial match must suffice for the rule to be applied. Since many rules may partially match the current context, the best matching rule should be selected.","One way to do this is to use a neural network. Through the back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986), a feed-forward network can be trained to memorize the CDG rules. After successful training, the network can be used to retrieve the best matching rule. However, this approach based on ~ neural network usually takes considerable training time. For instance, in our previous experiment (Simmons and Yu 1990), training a network for about 2,000 CDG rules took several days of computation. Therefore, this approach has an intrinsic problem for scaling up, at least on the present generation of neural net simulation software.","Another method is based on a hash table in which every CDG rule is stored according to its top two elements of the stack--the fourth and fifth elements of the left half of the rule. Given the current windowed context, the top two elements of the stack are used to retrieve all the relevant rules from the hash table. 397 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4","We use no more than 64 word and phrase class symbols, so there can be no more than 4,096 possible pairs. The effect is to divide the large number of rules into no more than 4,096 subgroups, each of which will have a manageable subset. In fact, with 16,275 rules we discovered that we have only 823 pairs and the average number of rules per subgroup is 19.8; however, for frequently occurring pairs the number of rules in the subgroups can be much larger. The problem is to determine what scoring formula should be used to find the rule that best matches a parsing context.","Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1988) analyzed the weight matrix that resulted from training NETtalk and discovered a triangular function with the apex centered at the character in the window and the weights falling off in proportion to distance from that character. We decided that the best matching rule in our system would follow a similar pattern with maximum weights for the top two elements on the stack with weights decreasing in both directions with distance from those positions. The scoring function we use is developed as follows: Let T4 be the set of vectors {RI~R2,... ,Rn} where Ri is the vector [rl, r2,..., rl0] Let C be the vector [Cl, Ca,..., c10] Let #(ci, ri) be a matching function whose value is 1 if ci = ri, and 0 otherwise. TZ is the entire set of rules, Ri is (the left half of) a particular rule, and C is the","parse context. Then/-4' is the subset of T4 where if Ri E T~ I then #(ri4,c4) • #(ris~cs) = 1. Access of the hash table with the top two elements of the stack, c4, c5 produces","the set T4'. We can now define the scoring function for each Ri C T~ I. 3 i0","Score = ~_, t~(ci, ri) . i+ ~_, #(ci, ri)(11 -i) i=1 i=6","The first summation scores the matches between the stack elements of the rule and the current context, and the second summation scores the matches between the elements in the input string. If two items of the rule and context match, the total score is increased by the weight assigned to that position. The maximum score for a perfect match is 21 according to the above formula.","From several experiments, varying the length of vector and the weights, particularly those assigned to blanks, it has been determined that this formula gave the best performance among those tested. More importantly, it has worked well in the current phrase structure and case analysis experiments.","It was an unexpected surprise to us 3 that using context-sensitive productions, an elementary, deterministic, parsing algorithm proved adequate to provide 99% correct, unambiguous anAalyses for the entire text studied. 3. Grammar Acquisition for CDG Constructing an augmented phrase structure grammar of whatever type unification, GPSG, or ATN--is a painful process usually involving a well-trained linguistic team of several people. These types of grammar require that a CFG recognition rule such 3 But perhaps not to Marcus (1980) and Berwick (1985), who promote the study of deterministic parsing. 398 Robert F.

The additional features make the rules exceedingly complex and difficult to prepare and debug. College students can be taught easily to make a phrase structure tree to represent a sentence, but it requires considerable linguistic training to deal successfully with a feature grammar.","We have seen in the preceding section that a CFG is derived from recording the successive states of the parses of sentences. Thus it was natural for us to develop an interactive acquisition system that would assist a linguist (or a student) in constructing such parses to produce easily large sets of example CFG rules. 4 The system continued to evolve as a consequence of our use until we had included capabilities to: • read in text and data files • compile dictionary and grammar tables from completed text files • select a sentence to continue processing or revise","• look up words in a dictionary to suggest the syntactic class for the word in context when assigning syntactic classes to the words in a sentence","• compare each state of the parse with rules in the current grammar to predict the shift/reduce operation. A carriage return signals that the user accepts the prompt, or the typing in of the desired operation overrides it.","• compute and display the parse tree from the local grammar after completion of each sentence, or from the global total grammar at any time • provide backing up and editing capability to correct errors • print help messages and guide the user","• compile dictionary and grammar entries at the completion of each sentence, insuring no duplicate entries • save completed or partially completed grammar files.","The resulting tool, GRAMAQ, enables a linguist to construct a context-sensitive grammar for a text corpus at the rate of several sentences per hour. Thousands of rules are accumulated with only weeks of effort in contrast to the years required for a comparable system of augmented CFG rules. About ten weeks of effort were required to produce the 16,275 rules on which this study is based. Since GRAMAQ's prompts become more accurate as the dictionary and grammar grow in size, there is a positive acceleration in the speed of grammar accumulation and the linguist's task gradually converges to one of alert supervision of the system's prompts.","A slightly different version of GRAMAQ is Caseaq, which uses operations that create case constituents to accumulate a context-sensitive grammar that transforms 4 Starting with an Emacs editor, it was fairly easy to read in a file of sentences and to assign each word its syntactic class according to its context. Then the asterisk was inserted at the beginning of the syntactic string, the string was copied to the next line, the asterisk moved if a shift operation was indicated, or the top two symbols on the stack were rewritten if a reduce was required--just as we constructed the example in the preceding section. Naturally enough, we soon made Emacs macros to help us, and then escalated to a Lisp program that would print the"]},{"title":"stack-*-string","paragraphs":["and interpret our shift/reduce commands to produce a new state of the parse. 399 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 Text States Sentences Wds/Snt Mn-Wds/Snt Hepatitis 236 12 4-19 10.3 Measles 316 10 4-25 16.3 News Story 470 10 9-51 23.5 APWire-Robots 1005 21 11-53 26.0 APWire-Rocket 1437 25 8-47 29.2 APWire-Shuttle 598 14 12-32 21.9 Total 4062 92 4-53 22.8 Table 1 Characteristics of a sample of the text corpus. sentences directly to case structures with no intermediate stage of phrase structure trees.

Figure 9 in Section 7.3 illustrates the acquisition of case grammar. 4. Experiments with CDG There are a number of critical questions that need be answered if the claim that CDG grammars are useful is to be supported. • Can they be used to obtain accurate parses for real texts? • Do they reduce ambiguity in the parsing process? • How well do the rules generalize to new texts?","• How large must a CFG be to encompass the syntactic structures for most newspaper text? 4.1 Parsing and Ambiguity with CDG Over the course of this study we accumulated 345 sentences mainly from newswire texts. The first two articles were brief disease descriptions from a youth encyclopedia; the remaining fifteen were newspaper articles from February 1989 using the terms \"star wars,\" \"SDI,\" or \"Strategic Defense Initiative.\" Table 1 characterizes typical articles by the number of CDG rules or states, number of sentences, the range of sentence lengths, and the average number of words per sentence.","We developed our approach to acquiring and parsing context-sensitive grammars on the first two simple texts, and then used GRAMAQ to redo those texts and to construct productions for the news stories. The total text numbered 345 sentences, which accumulated 16,275 context-sensitive rules--an average of 47 per sentence.","The parser embodying the algorithm illustrated earlier in Figure I was augmented to compare the constituents it constructed with those prescribed during grammar acquisition by the linguist. In parsing the 345 sentences, 335 parses exactly matched the linguist's original judgement. In nine cases in which differences occurred, the parses were judged correct, but slightly different sequences of parse states occurred. The tenth case clearly made an attachment error--of an introductory adverbial phrase in the sentence \"Hours later, Baghdad announced .... \" This was mistakenly attached to \"Baghdad.\" This evaluation shows that the grammar was in precise agreement with 400 Robert F.

Since our primary interest was in evaluating the effectiveness of the CDG, all these evaluations were based on using correct syntactic classes for the words in the sentences. The context-sensitive dictionary lookup procedure described in Section 7.3 is 99.5% accurate, but it assigns 40 word classes incorrectly. As a consequence, using this procedure would result in a reduction of about 10% accuracy in parsing.","An output of a sentence from the parser is displayed as a tree in Figure 4. Since the whole mechanism is coded in Lisp, the actual output of the system is a nested list that is then printed as a tree.","Notice in this figure that the PP at the bottom modifies the NP composed of \"the first firing of a trident two intercontinental range missile\" not just the word \"firing.\" Since the parsing is bottom-up, left-to-right, the constituents are formed in the natural order of words encountered in the sentence and the terminals of the tree can be read top-to-bottom to give their ordering in the sentence.","Although 345 sentences totaling 8594 words is a small selection from the infinite set of possible English sentences, it is large enough to assure us that the CDG is a reasonable form of grammar. Since the deterministic parsing algorithm selects a single interpretation, which we have seen almost perfectly agrees with the linguist's parsings, it is apparent that, at least for this size text sample, there is little difficulty with ambiguous interpretations. 401 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 5. Generalization of CDG The purpose of accumulating sample rules from texts is to achieve a grammar general enough to analyze new texts it has never seen. To be useful, the grammar must generalize. There are at least three aspects of generalization to be considered. How well does the grammar generalize at the sentence level? That is, how well does the grammar parse new sentences that it has not previously experienced? How well does the grammar generalize at the operation level? That is, how well does the grammar predict the correct Shift/Reduce operation during acquisition of new sentences? How much does the rule retention strategy affect generalization? For instance, when the grammar predicts the same output as a new rule does, and the new rule is not saved, how well does the resulting grammar parse? 5.1 Generalization at the Sentence Level The complete parse of a sentence is a sequence of states recognized by the grammar (whether it be CDG or any other). If all the constituents of the new sentence can be recognized, the new sentence can be parsed correctly. It will be seen in a later paragraph that with 16,275 rules, the grammar predicts the output of new rules correctly about 85% of the time. For the average sentence with 47 states, only 85% or about 40 states can be expected to be predicted correctly; consequently the deterministic parse will frequently fail. In fact, 5 of 14 new sentences parsed correctly in a brief experiment that used a grammar based on 320 sentences to attempt to parse the new, 20-sentence text. Considering that only a single path was followed by the deterministic parser, we predicted that a multiple-path parser would perform somewhat better for this aspect of generalization. In fact, our initial experiments with a beam search parser resulted in successful parses of 15 of the 20 new sentences using the same grammar based on the 320 sentences. 5.2 Generalization at the Operation Level This level of generalization is of central significance to the grammar acquisition system. When GRAMAQ looks up a state in the grammar it finds the best matching state with the same top two elements on the stack, and offers the right half of this rule as its suggestion to the linguist. How often is this prediction correct?","To answer this question we compiled the grammar of 16,275 rules in cumulative increments of 1,017 rules using a procedure,"]},{"title":"union-grammar,","paragraphs":["that would only add a rule to the grammar if the grammar did not already predict its operation. We call the result a \"minimal-grammar,\" and it contains 3,843 rules. The black line of Figure 5 shows that with the first 1,000 rules 40% were new; with an accumulation of 5,000, 18% were new rules. By the time 16,000 rules have been accumulated, the curve has flattened to an average of 16% new rules added. This means that the acquisition system will make correct prompts about 84% of the time and the linguist will only need to correct the system's suggestions about 3 or 4 times in 20 context presentations. 402 Robert E Simmons and Yeong-Ho Yu Context-Dependent Grammars for English 50 40 r~"]},{"title":"-] 30 20","paragraphs":["10","...... ~\" ...... t ....... t ....... t ....... t ....... t .............. ! ....... ! ....... +.'\"'\"t ...... t ....... ! ....... t ....... ! ....... ! ....... !","i..~.

That is, 13,081 possible CDG rules were not retained because already existing rules would match and predict the operation. However, using those rules to parse the same text gave very poor results: zero correct parses at the sentence level. Therefore, the process of compiling a minimal grammar was repeated starting with those 3,194 rules. This time only 619 new rules were added. The purpose of this 5 These definite conditions are due to an analysis by Mark Ring. 403 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 Pass UntWined Retained Total Rules 1 13081 3194 16275 2 15656 619 16275 3 16245 18 16275 4 16275 0 16275 Table 2 Four passes with minimal grammar. repetition is to get rid of the effect that the rules added later change the predictions made earlier. Finally, in a fourth repetition of the process no rules were new.","The resulting grammar of 3,843 rules succeeds in parsing the text with only occasional minor errors in attaching constituents. It is to be emphasized that the unretained rules are similar but not identical to those in the minimal grammar.","We can observe that this technique of minimal retention by \"unioning\" new rules to the grammar results in a compression of the order 16,275/3,843 or 4.2 to 1, without increase in error. If this ratio holds for larger grammars, then if the linguist accumulates 40,000 training-example rules to account for the syntax of a given subset of language, that grammar can be compressed automatically to about 10,000 rules that will accomplish the same task. 6. Predicting the Size of CDGs When any kind of acquisition system is used to accumulate knowledge, one very interesting question is, when will the knowledge be complete enough for the intended application? In our case, how many CDG rules will be sufficient to cover almost all newswire stories? To answer this question, an extrapolation can be used to find a point when the solid line of Figure 5 intersects with the y-axis. However, the CDG curve is descending too slowly to make a reliable extrapolation.","Therefore, another question was investigated instead: when will the CDG rules include a complete set of CFG rules? Note that a CDG rule is equivalent to a CFG rule if the context is limited to the top two elements of the stack. What the other elements in the context accomplish is to make one rule preferable to another that has the same top two elements of the stack, but a different context.","We allow 64 symbols in our phrase structure analysis. That means, there are 642 possible combinations for the top two elements of the stack. For each combination, there are 65 possible operations: 6 a shift or a reduction to another symbol. Among 16,275 CDG rules, we studied how many different CFG rules can be derived by eliminating the context. We found 844 different CFG rules that used 600 different left-side pairs of symbols. This shows that a given context free pair of symbols averages 1.4 different operations. 7","Then, as we did with CDG rules, we measured how many new CFG rules were added in an accumulative fashion. The shaded line of Figure 5 shows the result. 6 Actually, there are fewer than 65 possible operations since the stack elements can be reduced only to nonterminal symbols. 7 We actually use only 48 different symbols, so only 482 or 2,304 combinations could have occurred. The fraction 600/2,304 yields .26, the proportion of the combinatoric space that is actually used, so far. 404 Robert E Simmons and Yeong-Ho Yu Context-Dependent Grammars for English","100 ........................................... ~. .......................................................................................... : ! ! ! !"]},{"title":"I _m° •","paragraphs":["....... or, Z 10 .......................................................................................................... l 1 100 1,000 10,000 25,000 100,000 Nbr of Accumulated Rules Extrapolation thegray line, predicts that 99% of the context free pairs will be achieved with the accumulation of 25,000 context sensitive rues. Figure 6 Log-log plot of new CFG rules. Notice that the line has descended to about 1.5% errors at 16,000 rules. To make an extrapolation easier, a log-log graph shows the same data in Figure 6. From this graph, it can be predicted that, after about 25,000 CDG rules are accumulated, the grammar will encompass a CFG component that is 99% complete. Beyond this point, additional CDG rules will add almost no new CFG rules, but only fine-tune the grammar so that it can resolve ambiguities more effectively.","Also, it is our belief that, after the CDG reaches that point, a multi-path, beam-search parser will be able to parse most newswire stories very reliably. This belief is based on our initial experiment that used a beam search parser to test generalization of the grammar to find parses for fifteen out of twenty new sentences. 7. Acquiring Case Grammar Explicating the phrase structure constituents of sentences is an essential aspect in computer recognition of meaning. Case analysis organizes the constituents into a hierarchical structure of labeled propositions. The propositions can be used directly to answer questions and are the basis of schemas, scripts, and frames that are used to add meaning to otherwise inexplicit texts. As a result of the experiments with acquiring CDG and exploring its properties for parsing phrase structures, we became fairly confident that we could generalize the system to acquisition and parsing based on a grammar that would compute syntactic case structures"]},{"title":"directly","paragraphs":["from syntactic strings. Direct translation from string to structure is supported by neural network experiments such as those by McClelland and Kawamoto (1986), Miikkulainen and Dyer (1989), Yu and Simmons (1990), and Leow and Simmons (1990). We reasoned that if we could acquire case grammar with something approaching the simplicity of acquiring phrase structure rules, the result could be of great value for NL applications. 405 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 7.1 Case Structure Cook (1989) reviewed twenty years of linguistic research on case analysis of natural language sentences. He synthesized the various theories into a system that depends on the subclassification of verbs into twelve categories, and it is apparent from his review that with a fine subcategorization of verbs and nominals, case analysis can be accomplished as a purely syntactic operation--subject to the limitations of attachment ambiguities that are not resolvable by syntax. This conclusion is somewhat at variance with those AI approaches that require a syntactic analysis to be followed by a semantic operation that filters and transforms syntactic constituents to compute case-labeled propositions (e.g. Rim 1990), but it is consistent with the neural network experience of directly mapping from sentence to case structure, and with the AI research that seeks to integrate syntactic and semantic processing while translating sentences to propositional structures.","Linguistic theories of case structure have been concerned only with single propositions headed by verb predications; they have been largely silent with regard to the structure of noun phrases and the relations among embedded and sequential propositions. Additional conventions for managing these complications have been developed in Simmons (1984) and Alterman (1985) and are used here.","The central notion of a case analysis is to translate sentence strings into a nested structure of case relations (or predicates) where each relation has a head term and an indefinite number of labeled arguments. An argument may itself be a case relation.

The symbols vao and vabo are subclasses of verbs that take, respectively, agent and object; and agent, beneficiary, and object. The symbol v.. refers to any verb. Forms of the verb be are referred to as vbe, and passivization is marked by relabeling a verb by adding the suffix -pasv. Parsing case structures From the discussion above we may observe that the flow of control in accomplishing a case parse is identical to that of a phrase structure parse. The difference lies in the fact that when a constituent is recognized (see Figure 7): in phrase structure, a new name is substituted for its stack elements, and a constituent is formed by listing the name and its elements in case analysis, a case transformation is applied to designated elements on the stack to construct a constituent, and the head (i.e. the first element of the transformation) is substituted for its elements--unless a new name is provided for that substitution. Consequently the algorithm used in phrase structure analysis is easily adapted to case analysis. The difference lies in interpreting and applying the operation to make a new constituent and a new stack.","In the algorithm shown above, we revise the stack by attaching either the head of the new constituent, or its new name, to the stack resulting from the removal of all elements in the new constituent. The function select chooses either a new name if present, or the first element, the head of the operation. Makeconstituent applies the transformation rule to form a new constituent from the output stack and pushes the constituent onto the output stack, which is first reduced by removing the elements used in the constituent. Again, the algorithm is a deterministic, first (best) path parser 409 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 with behavior essentially the same as the phrase structure parser. But this version accomplishes transformations to construct a case structure analysis."]},{"title":"7.3 Acquisition System for Case Grammar","paragraphs":["The acquisition system, like the parser, required only minor revisions to accept case grammar. It must apply a shift or any transformation to construct the new stack-string for the linguist user, and it must record the shift or transformation as the right half of a context-sensitive rule--still composed of a ten-symbol left half and an operation as the right half. Consequently, the system will be illustrated in Figure 9 rather than described in detail.","Earlier we mentioned the context-sensitive dictionary. This is compiled by associating with each word the linguist's in-context assignments of each syntactic word class in which it is experienced. When the dictionary is built, the occurrence frequencies of each word class are accumulated for each word. A primitive grammar of four-tuples terminating with each word class is also formed and hashed in a table of syntactic paths. The procedure to determine a word class in context, ,, first obtains the candidates from the dictionary.",",, For each candidate wc, it forms a four-tuple, vec, by adding it to the cdr of each immediately preceding vec, stored in IPC. • Each such vec is tested against the table of syntactic paths; if it has been seen previously, it is added to the list of IPCs, otherwise it is eliminated. If the union of first elements of the IPC list is a single word class, that is the choice. If not, the word's most frequent word class among the union of surviving classes for the word is chosen. The effect of this procedure is to examine a context of plus and minus three words to determine the word class in question. Although a larger context based on five-tuple paths is slightly more effective, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and storage requirements.","The word class selection procedure was tested on the 8,310 words of the 345-sentence sample of text. A score of 99.52% correct was achieved, with 8,270 words correctly assigned. As a comparison, the most frequent category for a word resulted in 8,137 correct assignments for a score of 97.52%. Although there are only 3,298 word types with an average of 3.7 tokens per type, the occurrence of single word class usages for words in this sample is very high, thus accounting for the effectiveness of the simpler heuristic of assignment of the most frequent category. However, since the effect of misassignment of word class can often ruin the parse, the use of the more complex procedure is amply justified. Analysis of the 40 errors in word class assignment showed 7 confusions of nouns and verbs that will certainly cause errors in parsing; other confusions of adjective/noun, and adverb/preposition are less devastating, but still serious enough to require further improvements in the procedure.","The word class selection procedure is adequate to form the prompts in the lexical acquisition phase, but the statistics on parsing effectiveness given earlier depend on perfect word class assignments.","Shown in Figure 8 is the system's presentation of a sentence and its requests for each word's syntactic class.

What we notice in this second protocol is that the stack shows syntactic labels but the input string presented to the linguist is in English. As the system constructs a CS rule, however, the vector containing five elements of stack and five of input string is composed entirely of syntactic classes. The English input string better enables the linguist to maintain the meaningful context he or she uses to analyze the sentence. About five to ten minutes were required to make the judgments for this sentence. Appendix A shows the rules acquired in the session.","When rules for the sentence were completed, the system added the new syntactic classes and rules to the grammar, then offered to parse the sentence. The resulting parse is shown in Figure 10.","The case acquisition system was used on the texts described earlier in Table 1 to accumulate 3,700 example CDG case rules.

Thirdly, the shift/reduce parsing is unable to give correct analyses for such embedded discontinuous constituents as \"I saw the man yesterday who .... \" Finally, the actual parsing structures that we have presented here are skeletal.

During this process of discourse analysis, some degapping, completion of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution is accomplished. 8.1 Conclusions From the studies presented in this paper we conclude:",".

The CDG acquisition system described earlier simplifies linguistic judgments and greatly improves a linguist's ability to construct relatively large grammars rapidly.","4. Although a deterministic, bottom-up parser has been sufficient to provide highly accurate parses for the 345-sentence sample of news text studied here, we believe that a multi-path parser proves superior in its ability to analyze sentences beyond the sample on which the grammar was developed.","5. With 3,843 compressed CDG rules, the acquisition system is about 85% accurate in suggesting the correct parsing for constituents from texts it has not experienced.","6. For phrase structure analysis, the context-free core of the CS rules will be 99% complete when we have accumulated about 25,000 CS rules. At that point it should be possible for a multi-path parser to find a satisfactory analysis for almost all news story sentences.","We have shown that the acquisition and parsing techniques apply also to CDG grammars for computing structures of case propositions to represent sentences. In this application, however, much more research is needed to better define linguistic systems for case analysis, and for their application to higher levels of natural language understanding.
