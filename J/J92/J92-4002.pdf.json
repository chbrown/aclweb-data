These representations allow decisions about the precise meaning of a sentence to be postponed until the required information becomes available. Three computational constraints for this logical form are proposed: compactness, modularity, and formal consistency. Initially, NPs are represented using a composite representation for all allowable meanings, conforming with the compactness constraint. This representation is provided using only syntactic and sentence level information, consistent with the modularity constraint. When an ambiguity can be resolved, the precise behavior is specified in a way compatible with the initial representation, conforming with the formal consistency constraint. The scope of this approach is demonstrated by using a wide variety of examples, and a computer implementation is described. Related approaches are also discussed. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["A goal of natural language research is to provide a computer model capable of generating an internal representation for the meaning of each sentence processed. The building of this representation can be approached in two ways.","The first approach requires the generation of an unambiguous internal representation for each sentence before attempting to represent subsequent sentences. There are, however, several problems with this approach. First, the enumeration and testing of each possible reading of an ambiguous sentence to determine which is correct can require significant computational resources. Second, an application may not require the precise meaning for a sentence; hence, determining a single meaning would be a waste of resources. Third, many times an ambiguous sentence cannot be disambiguated until information contained in subsequent sentences has been processed.","Another approach, the one adopted in this paper, is to use an intermediate representation called logical form (LF) (Schubert and Pelletier 1984; Allen 1987; Harper 1988) to avoid immediately committing to a single meaning of an ambiguous sentence. LF partially specifies the meaning of a sentence based on syntactic and sentence-level information, without considering the effects of pragmatics and context. This partial specification of meaning allows us to process additional sentences before further limiting the meaning of an ambiguous sentence. Later, as relevant information becomes available (from a context processing module), the intermediate representation of the ambiguous sentence can be incrementally updated. This process can continue until all of the ambiguities are resolved and an unambiguous internal representation of the sentence is generated (although this is not a requirement of the approach). The process of mapping a sentence to an unambiguous internal representation is shown in Figure 1.","Because LF is a component of a computer model for language comprehension, it must be designed with two goals in mind.

Second, it should be computationally tractable. In fact, we have defined three constraints for using LF in a computational framework (Harper 1988, 1990).","1. Compactness Constraint: The compactness constraint, which captures the spirit of LF as presented by Allen (1987), is important in a computer model of language comprehension because of the need to postpone decisions about ambiguity without large storage requirements. LF should compactly represent the underdetermined meaning of a sentence--underdetermined in that ambiguities and anaphora are not resolved. Ideally, LF should only require polynomial (in the number of words in a sentence) space.","2, Modularity Constraint: The modularity constraint requires LF to be initially computable from syntax and local (sentence-level) semantics only. In particular, it should not be initially dependent on contextual information, which requires significantly more computational resources to extract.","3. Formal Consistency Constraint: The formal consistency constraint requires that any update to the meaning of LF should be a refinement of the original meaning. Initially, LF provides a composite representation for a sentence. However, as more information becomes available, the meaning of the sentence is incrementally updated (without contradicting the composite meaning) until all ambiguity is resolved. To obey the formal consistency constraint, it is important to explicitly detail the syntax and semantics of the LF (see Appendix A for the syntax and semantics of the LF we are about to describe) and to indicate how formal consistency would be violated. 420 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form","In the next section, we describe how LF has been used to represent quantifier scope ambiguity and how this representation conforms to our computational constraints. Then, we introduce our LF representations for pronouns, singular definite NPs, and singular indefinite NPs, considering how to update each representation when new information becomes available (though not how to determine that information). We also discuss an implementation that uses our representations and compare our approach with related work."]},{"title":"2. Quantifier Scope Ambiguity in Logical Form","paragraphs":["Quantifier scope ambiguity has been handled by some researchers by using an intermediate scope-neutral LF (e.g., Hobbs 1983; Schubert and Pelletier 1984; Allen 1987) for the initial representation of sentences.

Possible Meanings: 1. ~x VY (love x y)","2. Vy 3x (love x y) Scope-neutral Form: (love [3x x] [Vy y]) Initially, in scope-neutral LF, the quantifiers are stored in the predicate argument-structure with no scoping preference indicated, hence the representation does not commit to a specific meaning for the sentence; it is simply a compact way of expressing the set of all possible readings. Another type of scope-neutral form initially gives universal quantifiers scope over all existentials. This solution provides a general reading that in many cases subsumes readings where the existential is outside of the scope of the universal. However, if we are to handle NPs containing pronouns and sentences with verb phrase ellipsis, this solution is inadequate.","An LF that avoids committing to a single meaning must be capable of being updated once information is available to limit the scoping possibilities. There are a variety of mechanisms for expressing scoping decisions. For example, Schubert and Pelletier (1984) indicate quantifier scoping by extracting and linearly ordering the quantifiers to the left of the predicate-argument structure. Allen (1987) indicates for each pair of quantifiers which one has scope over the other; a method that is not limited to a linear sequence of operators. Finally, Creaney and McTear (1990) use constraints to limit scope possibilities. Hintikka (1979) has noted that the linear ordering of quantifiers is not sufficient to capture all possible meanings of a sentence when four or more quantifiers occur in the sentence. Consider a sentence with four quantifiers, two universals and two existentials:"]},{"title":"Every boyi wanted every girlj to introduce a friend of hisi to a friend of hersj.","paragraphs":["It should be possible for"]},{"title":"every boy","paragraphs":["to have scope over"]},{"title":"a friend of his,","paragraphs":["without having scope over"]},{"title":"a friend of hers.","paragraphs":["Similarly,"]},{"title":"every girl","paragraphs":["could have scope over a"]},{"title":"friend of hers,","paragraphs":["but not"]},{"title":"a friend of his.","paragraphs":["There is no way to express this with a linear quantifier scoping string, but Allen and Creaney and McTear have no trouble indicating nonlinear scoping using their approaches.","A scope-neutral LF compactly represents a sentence. Since the size of the scope-neutral representation is directly proportional to the length of the sentence, it is consistent with the compactness constraint. This representation also avoids committing to 421 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 a single meaning by separating the process of making a scoping decision from the process of constructing the initial representation for a sentence and its constituents (this separation is consistent with the modularity constraint). Later, when enough information becomes available to make a scoping decision, there are several different methods for indicating which quantifier has scope over the other. These modifications commit to one of the meanings encoded in the scope-neutral form and so are compatible with the formal consistency constraint.","There are other types of semantic ambiguities in addition to quantifier scope ambiguity that can be handled by using LE For example, the meanings of pronouns, singular definite NPs, and singular indefinite NPs often cannot be determined without additional contextual information. Postponing decisions about the precise meanings of sentences containing these types of constituents could be extremely useful, as the following example illustrates: Every man showed a boy a picture of his mother. The precise meaning of the sentence cannot be specified until information is available to select the pronoun's antecedent and to determine the quantifier scoping. The pronoun his can have many different antecedents, including: every man, a boy, some entity introduced in other sentences, or some individual in the environment of the speaker or hearer. The meaning of his mother is ambiguous because it depends on the pronoun's antecedent. Also, a picture of his mother is ambiguous; its meaning cannot be determined until we determine the meaning of his mother and decide whether the universally quantified NP has scope over the indefinite. Notice that quantifier scoping decisions are affected by the choice of antecedent for his. If every man is the antecedent then it must have scope over a picture of his. 3. Pronouns in Logical Form Pronouns are a source of underspecification in a sentence: the antecedent of a pronoun cannot be determined using syntactic information alone, but requires a combination of syntactic, semantic, and contextual information. We divide the process of determining the meaning of a pronoun into two phases. First, we provide the pronoun's LF, using only syntactic and sentence-level information. This LF constrains the possible antecedents to be those NPs that are consistent with this local information. The LF is also a flag indicating that the sentence is underspecified because more than one antecedent for the pronoun is possible. Later, when the antecedent is determined, a task that often requires contextual information found in surrounding sentences, we provide a way to update our LF to include this information.","In the rest of this section, we discuss the linguistic behaviors of pronouns we want to model, introduce their LF representation, discuss how that representation is updated once contextual information isolates antecedents for the pronouns, and describe how the approach models verb phrase ellipsis (VPE). 3.1 Pronouns: Linguistic Behavior Pronouns either have linguistic antecedents or refer to salient objects in the environment of the speaker or hearer (deictic use). Pronouns with linguistic antecedents can be categorized in two ways: either their antecedents occur in the same sentence (intrasentential reference 1) or in other sentences (intersentential reference). 1 By reference, we do not mean that the pronoun denotes its linguistic antecedent; rather, that it adopts the behavior of its antecedent. 422 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form","When a pronoun's intrasentential antecedent is a universal NP, that pronoun takes on the behavior of the universal's variable. Consider the sentence Fred showed every girl her picture. Given that the antecedent for her is every girl, the pronoun adopts the behavior of a variable bound by the universal quantifier of its antecedent, as shown in Example 2."]},{"title":"Example 2","paragraphs":["Fred/showed every girly herj picture. Vx (if (girl x) (show Fred (x's picture) x))","In contrast, if a pronoun has an intersentential antecedent, then that pronoun cannot act like a bound variable, since quantifiers do not have scope across sentences in English. Consider the following two sentences: Fred likes everyone. But, he doesn't return the sentiment. The pronoun in the second sentence cannot be bound by the quantifier corresponding to everyone in the first sentence. However, a quantified NP in one sentence can be the antecedent for a pronoun in another sentence, as in Fred likes everyone. But, they don't return the sentiment. In this case, they adopts the discourse entity for the group of individuals that everyone quantifies over. Webber (1978) discusses how to construct discourse entities for nonanaphoric NPs in a sentence (both for quantified NPs and definite NPs that are quantified over) once that sentence has been disambiguated. A discourse entity is a designator for the entity or set of entities the NP evokes in the discourse model of the speaker or hearer. If an NP in one sentence is the antecedent for a pronoun in another, the pronoun is replaced with the antecedent's discourse entity.","Pronouns have also been classified as bound variable pronouns or referential pronouns. The antecedent for a bound variable pronoun occurs in the same sentence as the pronoun and the meaning of the pronoun is represented as a variable bound by the operator associated with its antecedent. In contrast, the meaning of a referential pronoun is the discourse entity evoked by its antecedent. The bound versus referential dichotomy divides the world of pronouns differently than does the intrasentential-intersentential dichotomy. Pronouns with intersentential antecedents are typically referential. 2 However, pronouns with intrasentential antecedents can be bound or referential (Webber 1978; Reinhart 1983).","The bound-referential dichotomy doesn't cover the entire range of behaviors possible for pronouns. There is another category of pronoun that Evans (1980) dubs E-type pronouns and that appears to be a bound variable, but on closer inspection is not. Donkey sentences (originally noticed by Geach [1962]) can be used to demonstrate this difficulty, for example: Every miner who owns a donkey beats it. Given that every miner has scope over a donkey, the indefinite cannot be referential and the existential operator is blocked from binding the pronoun because of the scope island; quantified NPs embedded in a relative clause attached to an NP cannot bind pronouns outside of the relative clause environment. 3 However, a donkey can be the antecedent for the pronoun. 2 The only exception are pronouns like those in paycheck sentences (first noticed by Kartunnen [1969]). Consider the sentence Fred gave his paycheck to his wife. George gave it to his mistress. The pronoun it is not referential. For that matter, it is not bound. The pronoun seems to take his paycheck as its antecedent where the pronoun is instantiated to a different individual than in the original sentence. 3 This is related to the Complex NP Constraint introduced by Ross (1967), which prevents wh-movement out of a relative clause attached to an NP. 423 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 Donkey sentences provide evidence that all of the following cannot be simultaneously true (adapted from Heim [1982, p. 102]). 1. Indefinites should be represented using existential quantifiers. 2. Indefinites obey the same scope-island restriction as universals. 3. Pronouns are either bound variables or referential. Many researchers have attacked one or more of these assumptions, but we prefer to modify the third by adding an additional type of pronoun: pronouns that adopt the functional behavior of their antecedents. The first two assumptions, together with our modification of the third, allows us to build a simpler LF for a sentence and also handle donkey sentences (as described in Section 5.2).","Pronouns are a source of ambiguity in verb phrase ellipsis (VPE). To signal a VPE, a full verb phrase (VP) is replaced with an auxiliary, as in the second sentence of Example 3. A sentence with VPE is called an elided sentence. The index on Fred and his indicates that they are co-referential. Example 3 Trigger Sentence: Elided Sentence: Possible Meanings: Fred/loves his/wife. Georgej does too. 1. George loves Fred's wife. (strict meaning) 2. George loves George's wife. (sloppy meaning) The elided sentence has little meaning independent of the first sentence, called a trigger sentence. Hence, before determining the meaning of the elided sentence, the meaning of the trigger sentence must be completely determined. Even though the antecedent of the pronoun in the trigger sentence is Fred, the meaning of that pronoun is still ambiguous because pronouns in a trigger VP can refer to a subject NP either directly or indirectly. This example indicates that care is needed to design a pronoun representation capable of handling VPE since the representation must be compatible with the two behaviors of a pronoun whose antecedent is the syntactic subject of a trigger sentence. It also demonstrates how the meaning assigned to the trigger VP limits the possible meanings of the elided sentence. Though the meaning of the elided sentence is ambiguous, it cannot mean George loves some other person's wife (other than Fred's or George's). 3.2 Pronouns: The Initial Representation Before introducing our LF for pronouns, we briefly describe the LF for the rest of a sentence. A sentence is represented as a predicate-argument structure, with subjects lambda abstracted to handle VPE (following Sag [1976]; Williams [1977]; Webber [1978]; and Partee and Bach [1981]). By lambda abstracting syntactic subjects in LF, a pronoun whose antecedent is a syntactic subject can refer to that subject in two different ways, either directly by using a value depending on the type of the subject NP or indirectly by using the subject's lambda variable. The logical roles of all NPs in a sentence are indicated by position in LF (logical subject first, logical object second, logical indirect object third, etc.). Following Webber [1978], we represent universal NPs as universally quantified and restricted variables (as in 4a) and existentially quantified NPs as existentially quantified and restricted variables (as in 4b). The colon between the quantifier and its restriction expands differently depending on the type of the quantifier. 424 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form"]},{"title":"Example 4","paragraphs":["a. Sentence: Every man is happy. Representation: Vx: (man x) (happy x) Meaning: Vx (if (man x) (happy x))","b. Sentence: A man is happy. Representation: 3x: (man x) (happy x) Meaning: 3x (and (man x) (happy x)) Quantifier scoping is handled in the same way as in Section 2. Initially, quantifiers are placed in the predicate-argument structure for the sentence, except for subjects, which are necessarily abstracted. Abstraction of a quantified subject does not imply that it must have scope over quantifiers placed in the lambda function corresponding to the VP. Later, when information becomes available for making scoping decisions, quantifier scoping is indicated using a method similar to Allen's (1987) (described in Section 5.2). Possessive NPs are represented as functions of the possessive nouns (following Webber [1978]) and proper nouns as skolem constants (i.e., skolem functions without arguments). These representations will be replaced with a general representation for definite NPs in Section 4.","The LF representation for a pronoun must be compatible with our computational constraints. To be consistent with the modularity constraint, a pronoun's representation must be generated without utilizing the contextual information needed to select its antecedent. To obey the compactness and formal consistency constraints, a pronoun must be represented using a single representation that is consistent with the ways the pronoun can act given its position in a sentence. To conform with these constraints, we represent a pronoun as a pronoun function in LE This representation of pronouns is similar in spirit to the representation of pronouns as unique skolem constants in Charniak and McDermott (1985). Their representation allows the construction of basic logical structure of the sentence to precede pronoun resolution, a division consistent with our compactness and modularity constraints. However, because a constant is incompatible with a variable, their pronoun representation is incompatible with a bound variable meaning.","A pronoun function is a composite representation reminiscent of a skolem function. Its role is to limit the range of possible antecedents for the pronoun without committing to one in particular. Each pronoun function is assigned a unique name (supplied by adding a unique number to the pronoun to distinguish it from other pronouns), and its argument list is specified using only syntax and sentence-level semantics to avoid violating the modularity constraint.","A pronoun should be represented as a function of all the variables corresponding to quantified NPs that can affect its meaning (because they are representations for possible antecedents or can affect the meanings of other nonquantified antecedents such as definite NPs). By concentrating on variables of possible antecedents, we automatically include those variables that affect potential nonquantified antecedents. The argument list should also contain the variables of lambda operators that have scope over the position that the pronoun function fills in LF (in order to allow sloppy readings of elided sentences).","To provide an algorithm for automatically generating the LF for a pronoun, we must develop a mechanism for specifying its argument list. This mechanism should not automatically assign all of the variables associated with quantified NPs in the sentence to the argument list of a pronoun function because, in English, some quantified NPs are syntactically incompatible antecedents for the pronoun. Consider, for example, He loves every man, in which the antecedent for he cannot be every man.

Node A c(constituent)-commands node B iff the branching node ~1 most immediately dominating A either dominates B or is immediately dominated by a node a2 which dominates B, and a2 is of the same category type as al. (Reinhart 1983, p. 23) To illustrate the concept of c-command, consider the parse tree for the sentence in Example 5, shown in Figure 2. Example 5 Every man who saw every boy kicked his dog. In Figure 2, NP1 c-commands his, but NP2 and NP3 do not. Reinhart claims that a pronoun can be bound by an NP if and only if the NP c-commands the pronoun. Hence, every man who saw every boy can bind his, but every boy cannot.","C-command is very useful for ruling out incorrect antecedents for pronouns, as illustrated by Example 5. Unfortunately, it also makes some incorrect predictions. For example, it does not allow every man's to bind him in Every man's mother loves him or each candidate to bind him in A friend of each candidate supported him, even though the universal variables provide reasonable meanings for the pronouns. The difference between Example 5 and the previous two sentences is that in 5 the quantified NP in question is contained in a relative clause attached to an NP, whereas in the other two sentences they are not. A quantified NP is prevented from binding any pronoun outside of the clause even though the NP containing it c-commands the pronoun. Hence, we adapt Reinhart's binding rule 4 to allow quantified NPs to bind a pronoun if they c-command the pronoun or are embedded in another c-commanding NP but not contained in a relative clause. 4 We could have also adapted the binding constraints found in Bach and Partee (1980). 426 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form","Armed with this syntactic rule for determining which quantified NPs can have an impact on the meaning of a pronoun, we can now specify a pronoun's representation. A pronoun is represented as a uniquely named function of all the variables corresponding to operators that can have scope over it. These operators include: • any lambda operator that has scope over the pronoun function in LF,","• any nonsubject quantified variable corresponding to an NP that can bind the pronoun given our modification of Reinhart's binding rule. Because a quantified subject's variable is abstracted by the sentence's lambda operator, the lambda variable subsumes the quantified variable as the only subject-related variable required in the argument list. The lambda variable makes available both the direct quantified variable meaning as well as the indirect lambda variable meaning since we can choose to apply the quantified variable or not, depending on our need.","Now that the initial representation for pronouns has been specified, consider a series of examples, beginning with Example 6: Example 6 Fred loves himself.

To augment LF with antecedent information without creating an ill-formed LF (i.e., a LF with unbound variables), we assert equality statements in the lambda environment containing the pronoun function and limit the types of updates allowed. A pronoun function constrains its possible antecedents, and depending on the type and location of its antecedent, the pronoun function is equated with four different values. Pronoun Update Cases:","1. If a universal or indefinite NP is the intrasentential antecedent for the pronoun, and its variable is an argument of the pronoun function (or is abstracted by a lambda operator whose variable is an argument of the function), then equate the pronoun function with that quantified variable.","2. If an NP represented as a function (i.e., a pronoun or definite) is the intrasentential antecedent for a pronoun, and its argument list is compatible with that of the pronoun function (either immediately or after more is known about its meaning), then equate the pronoun function with that function.","3. If a syntactic subject of a sentence is the intrasentential antecedent for the pronoun, and the lambda variable is an argument of the pronoun function, then equate the pronoun function with either the subject's lambda variable or some other value depending on the subject's type.","4. If an NP in a different sentence or some nonlinguistic entity is the antecedent for the pronoun (and it is compatible in number and gender with the pronoun), then equate the pronoun function with the discourse entity created for the antecedent. 5 In this paper, we are not concerned with how the correct antecedent for a pronoun is determined. However, our LF provides useful hooks for an implementation to request information of either a user or a pronoun resolution module in order to resolve ambiguity. 428 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form Some updates to logical form must be postponed until more is known about the meaning of a possible antecedent (as we will show in Section 4.3.2).","Consider some examples of how LF is refined following pronoun resolution. Suppose, for example, that we decide that the antecedent for his, in Example 7, is a boy, then the LF for the sentence is modified as follows:"]},{"title":"Example 10","paragraphs":["Every mani showed a boyj hisj picture.

Notice that the equality statement is placed in the environment of the A(y) operator. If we had placed it outside of this environment, the variable y would have been unbound. The variable z is compatible with the pronoun's initial representation because we are limiting the function of y and z to be the identity function on z. Once the equality statement is asserted, we can simplify the LF as shown above. Notice that the meaning of the sentence is still underspecified since quantifier scoping has not been determined.","Next, consider how the representation in Example 6 is augmented, given that the antecedent for himself is the subject Fred."]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["11","Fred/loves himself/.","Fred22, A(x)(and (love x (himselh x))","(ora (= (himself1 x) x) (= (himself1 x) Fred22))) The pronoun can refer to the subject either directly or indirectly, so its function is equated with Fred22 (by pronoun update case 2) or x (by case 3), respectively. Notice that we use Ora as a meta-or to annotate our logical form with multiple possible meanings for the pronoun (outside of the logical system for mapping to truth value, see Appendix A). No simplification of the LF is possible until one of the alternatives is chosen, but by using this device we can at least compactly represent the ambiguous ways that pronouns refer to syntactic subjects. In fact, if there are n pronouns whose antecedents are subjects, we can specify this ambiguity with O(n) updates, compared with providing 2 n different representations for the sentence. This allows us to more easily put off decisions about the pronoun's intended meaning until we process the required information, in contrast to an approach that uses an exponential amount of memory.","Finally, consider how the LF in Example 9 is updated given that Fred is the antecedent of his and his mother is the antecedent for her."]},{"title":"Example 12","paragraphs":["Fred/showed (his/mother)j herj picture.","Fred22, A(x)(and (show x (picture-of (her1 x)) (mother-of (his2 x)))","(ora (= (his2 x) x) (= (his2 x) Fred22))","(= (her1 x) (mother-of (his2 x)))) 429 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 Possible Meanings: 1.

Later, when an elided sentence is detected, its trigger sentence must be located and disambiguated. Contextual information is needed to select trigger sentences, to choose antecedents for pronouns, and to select a single meaning for a pronoun function whose antecedent is a syntactic subject.","We have described our LF representation of pronouns, which allows us to model pronoun behaviors both in normal use and in VPE and is compatible with our computational constraints. Next, we discuss the LF for singular definite NPs, which is slightly more complex than the logical form for pronouns. 4. Singular Definite NPs in LF In this section, we develop an LF representation for singular definite NPs. As with pronouns, we wish to obey our computational constraints while providing a model of definite behavior. First, we discuss the behaviors we wish to model. 4.1 Definites: Linguistic Behavior Like pronouns, definite NPs can be anaphoric. Anaphoric definites either depend on linguistic antecedents or denote salient individuals in the environment of the speaker/hearer. An anaphoric definite's antecedent can be found in previous sentences as in Fredi saw (hisi cat)j. The catj was chasing a mouse, or within the same sentence as in Every boyi who loves (hisi cat)j takes care of the animalj. In the first example, the antecedent for the cat is his cat, found in the previous sentence, hence, the cat adopts the discourse entity assigned to his cat. In the second, the animal cannot take a discourse entity as its meaning because its antecedent is his cat, which does not denote a particular cat.","Definites, unlike pronouns, can have a complex syntactic structure. A definite NP's meaning can be affected by embedded NPs. While simple nonanaphoric definites (i.e., they contain no embedded NPs) act like constants when included in sentences with universal NPs, as in Every boy loves the woman; definite NPs containing pronouns often cannot be described as constants, as in Every boy loves his mother. The meaning of his mother depends on how the pronoun is resolved. If the antecedent for his is found in another sentence, then his mother could be represented as a constant, but if every 431 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4"]},{"title":"boy","paragraphs":["is the antecedent for"]},{"title":"his,","paragraphs":["then the universal quantifier corresponding to"]},{"title":"every boy","paragraphs":["distributes over"]},{"title":"his mother.","paragraphs":["When a quantifier distributes over a definite, the definite denotes different entities depending on the values assigned to the quantified variable.

The meaning of a definite NP is ambiguous whenever it contains a pronoun whose antecedent is the subject of the sentence, 6 as in the following example. Example 18 The postman/saw hisi dog. The policemanj did too. Possible Meanings: 1. The policeman saw the postman's dog.","2. The policeman saw his own dog. (strict reading) (sloppy reading) We must also provide a good representation for a definite subject, one that will account for the differences between universal and definite subjects in VPE (compare Example 19 with 18). Example 19 Every postman/saw hisi dog. Every policemanj did too. Possible Meanings: Every policeman saw his own dog. (sloppy reading only) Universal quantifiers cannot bind across sentences, so the only possible meaning for the elided sentence in 19 is the sloppy one. However, definite subjects support both sloppy and strict meanings (as shown in 18). If we choose a quantified variable to represent a definite subject, we would have to allow its quantifier to bind across sentences.","The meaning of a definite NP is affected by its structure and the meanings of embedded NPs, as well as its potential anaphoric use. In the remainder of this section, we introduce our LF representation for definites, describe ways to update this 6 Or whenever it contains an embedded indefinite. We consider sloppy indefinites in Section 5.3. 432 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form representation once ambiguity is resolved, and discuss how the representation is used in VPE. 4.2 Definite NPs: An Initial Representation We represent definite NPs as functions of all of the variables that can affect their meanings. This representation satisfies our constraints by combining the advantages of definite descriptions (Russell 1971) (discussed in Section 7.2.1) with the functional no-tation we introduced to represent pronouns. A definite function is assigned a unique name (i.e., def with a unique integer subscript) to distinguish two occurrences of the same definite NP, has a restriction consisting of a single predicate or a conjunction of predicates derived from information contained in the NP, and has a (possibly empty) list of arguments containing: • any variables associated with lambda operators that have scope over it,","• any variables associated with nonsubject quantified NPs that could bind a pronoun in that position,","• any quantified variables associated with embedded quantified NPs that are not also embedded in a relative clause. 7","To illustrate our representation for definite NPs, consider the initial representation of the following sentence. Example 20 Every man showed a boy his picture. Vx: (man x) x, My)(show y ((defl y z) I (and (picture (defl y z))","(possess (his2 y z) (defl y z)))) [3z: (boy z) z]) This representation is very similar to Example 7 except for the definite NP, his picture, which is represented as the function (defl y z). The definite function's argument list consists of the variables y and z, just like the pronoun his. As in the representation of pronouns, we omit the variable x from the argument list because the lambda operator for y abstracts x, so y is the more general argument. Anything that affects the meaning of the pronoun also affects the meaning of the definite. The function's restriction is the conjunction of statements following the vertical bar. The vertical bar in the function serves two purposes: it is used to distinguish the function's definition (on the left) from references to it (on the right), and it indicates that the function's restriction should be expanded just like the restriction on an existential operator.","This representation for definite NPs accounts for quantified NPs embedded in a definite. There are three cases to consider. The first is exemplified by Every man's mother loves him. The NP every man's mother does not denote a single mother; every man distributes over the definite noun phrase. A possessive quantified NP embedded in a definite NP always distributes over the definite. Hence, its variable must be included in the argument list of the definite function plus any other functions that the quantifier can affect (e.g., the pronoun function for him). Additionally, its quantifier must be moved to indicate that it has scope over the function, as shown below. 7 We should also add that a sententially attached PP with a quantified object can quantify over a definite as well (e.g., In every car, the driver turned the steering wheel, in which the universal distributes over both definites). 433 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4"]},{"title":"Example 21","paragraphs":["Every man's mother loves him.

Later, after we decide whether or not the quantifier distributes over the definite, the initial representation will be updated, as discussed in the next section.","The decision about whether a quantified object of a PP attached to a definite distributes over it cannot be made at the level of LF, though it has an impact on the quantifier's ability to bind pronouns (or anaphoric definites) in the sentence. Quantified objects of prepositions attached to a definite NP can bind pronouns in the sentence only when they distribute over the definite (Roberts 19879; May 1985). For example, in The secretary of every spy keeps an eye on him, the NP every spy can bind the pronoun him only when it has scope over the definite NP, giving it a distributive reading. However, we cannot make our representation of the pronoun him contingent on quantifier scoping decisions. Hence, we must include the variable in the argument list of the pronoun, and add a constraint to the pronoun resolution module preventing a pronoun function from being bound by a quantifier unless it distributes over the NP containing it.","Because a definite function is initially a composite representation for all possible meanings of a definite NP, as appropriate information becomes available, we repeat-8 We do not provide an explicit representation for who; instead we represent it by borrowing the relative head's representation. In 22, who is represented as a definite function. If the relative head was quantified, we would have represented the relative pronoun using the quantified variable. 9 Roberts modifies the definition of c-command to allow a PP-attached quantified NP to optionally c-command the same NPs as the containing NP. 434 Mary P.

Given this information, we can refine the meaning of a definite function using the behavior of definite descriptions (Russell 1971) as our model. Any definite description that does not contain variables bound by outside quantifiers acts like a constant because of the uniqueness assumption (see Section 7.2.1 for a discussion of definite descriptions). On the other hand, if a quantifier has scope over the definite description (either because an embedded quantified NP distributes over it or the antecedent for an embedded pronoun is quantified), it denotes different individuals depending on the instantiation of that variable.","Once we determine the meanings of the NPs contained in a definite function's restriction and decide whether any extractable embedded quantifiers should distribute over it, we examine the function's restriction to determine whether it contains any"]},{"title":"necessary arguments,","paragraphs":["i.e., variables bound by operators outside of the restriction.

Hence, our general LF representation of definite NPs allows us to derive both the sloppy and strict readings of the elided sentence.","We have introduced a composite representation for definite NPs along with a way to update its meaning as more information becomes available. Our approach has several strengths: It is consistent with the three computational constraints discussed in Section 1; it handles a variety of definite behaviors with one mechanism; and it provides useful constraints on intrasentential antecedents for definites (in addition to traditional constraints like number and gender agreement) and a more flexible mechanism than c-command for determining whether a definite noun phrase is a possible antecedent for an anaphoric expression. 5. Indefinites in Logical Form In this section, we develop an initial LF representation for singular indefinite NPs and provide a mechanism for updating it once additional information is processed. 5.1 Indefinites: Linguistic Behavior and Initial Representation Singular indefinite NPs share many behaviors with singular definites, including the fact that the final meanings of both are affected by the meanings of embedded NPs. However, unlike definites, the meanings of indefinites are affected by negation, and so they cannot be initially represented as functions in LE For example: Example 43 Fred did not see a woman. Possible Meanings: a. ~x: (woman x) Not(see Fred x) b. Not 3x: (woman x) (see Fred x) = Vx: (woman x) Not(see Fred x) Whenever there is negation in a sentence containing an indefinite, two meanings of the sentence are possible. If the negation does not have scope over the indefinite, 440 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form then the indefinite is represented as an existential outside the scope of the negation as shown in 43a (and could be represented as a function). In contrast, if the negation has scope over the indefinite, then it has scope over the existential operator making it equivalent to a universal (as shown in 43b). If we represent the indefinite in 43 as a function before deciding whether the negation has scope over it, then the second reading could not be expressed. Thus, we represent indefinites initially as existentially quantified and restricted variables, as in Example 44. Example 44 Fred saw a dog. ((defl) I (name (defl) Fred)), ;~(x)(saw x [3y: (dog y) y]) To provide a scope-neutral form, we place the quantified term [3y : (dog y) y] directly into the predicate-argument structure (see Appendix A). This initial representation of the indefinite is provided using only syntactic information and knowledge about how to map arguments into the predicate-argument structure, obeying the modularity constraint. Once quantifier scoping information is available, we update the sentence's LF, using a mechanism that also allows us to account for several interesting indefinite behaviors. 5.2 Indefinites: Updating the Initial Representation An approach that models indefinites solely as existentially quantified variables cannot account for the variety of behaviors of indefinite NPs, since quantifiers cannot have scope over variables in other sentences. This accounts for the fact that the quantified NP cannot be the antecedent for the pronoun she in: The boy kissed everygirl. She slapped him. However, in The boy kissed a girl. She slapped him, the antecedent for she can be a girl.","A similar problem arises in VPE. If the trigger VP contains a pronoun whose antecedent is an indefinite subject, two possible meanings for the elided sentence are possible, as in Example 45. Example 45 A postman/saw hisi dog. A policemanj did too. Possible Meanings: a. A policeman saw the postman's dog.","b. A policeman saw his own dog. (strict reading) (sloppy reading) When the antecedent for his is a postman, the elided sentence has two possible meanings, but a quantified representation for the indefinite can only account for one of them. 1° Given that the antecedent for his is a dog, there are two possible representations for the trigger VP. The pronoun function is either replaced with the lambda or the existential variable corresponding to the subject. If we use the first representation of the pronoun, we are able to derive the sloppy reading. But, if we use the second, then the meaning for the elided sentence would contain an unbound variable because existential quantifiers do not have scope across sentences.","Donkey sentences (originally noticed by Geach [1962]) suffer a similar difficulty.

However, the existential operator is only necessary until we can determine that the indefinite is not in the scope of a negation and can decide what has scope over the indefinite. After this information is available, it is desirable to transform the initial representation into a form more compatible with the behaviors of indefinites, especially if that transformation refines the meaning of the indefinite (conforming with the formal consistency constraint). Our solution is to eliminate the existential operator and replace the existential's variables with skolem functions.","Once scoping is specified, each existentially quantified variable is replaced by a function whose argument list consists of all of the universally quantified variables that have scope over the existential operator.

First, it provides a way to indicate quantifier scoping in a representation containing only universal and existential quantifiers. Second, the method of indicating scope is similar to Allen's (1987) method since we are not limited to expressing scope as a linear string of operators. Third, universal variables cannot be replaced with functions. Hence, skolemization may be useful for modeling the differences between universals and indefinites in English. Fourth, once quantifier scoping information is available, the replacement of existential variables with functions is a meaning preserving operation as required by the formal consistency constraint. Finally, a functional representation for an indefinite allows us to account for several behaviors that are poorly modeled using an existential variable representation of indefinites alone.","The functional representation for an indefinite provides a mechanism for determining whether a singular indefinite can be the antecedent for a singular pronoun in a subsequent sentence.

For example, 12 It could also be used to create a singular discourse entity compatible with the singular pronoun. 13 Our solution has much in common with Webber's (1978) parameterized individuals.

When an indefinite NP occurs in the trigger VP, the elided sentence is ambiguous. This is in contrast to Example 32 discussed in Section 4.4: Fred saw the dog.

We label the subject's lambda variable as the logical subject for a sentence with active voice or as the logical object for a sentence with passive voice. We do not specify case roles like agent in our LF because their determination may require contextual information. Also, the case role of a subject need not be the same in the trigger and elided sentences, e.g., Fred hit the window. The hammer did too. The subject in the first sentence is probably filling the role of agent, whereas the subject of the second fills the role of instrument.","Because our program is designed to provide meanings of sentences with VPE, it examines each LF provided by the parser to see if it contains an elided VP. If it does not contain one, then additional processing of the potential trigger sentence is put off until the final meaning of the sentence is needed. Ideally, processing should be done as information becomes available; however, for the purpose of this implementation, it is conceptually simpler to refine the trigger LF only when its meaning must be determined to disambiguate an elided VP. Hence, the LF in 66 is saved on a stack of recently processed sentences.","To determine the meaning of an elided sentence (a process depicted in Figure 4), the program must first locate the trigger sentence.

Related Work Other researchers have developed an intermediate representation for a sentence from syntactic information (Pollack and Pereira 1988; Alshawi and van Eijck 1989). These approaches agree that in order to determine the meaning of a sentence, it is useful to build a partial meaning that is augmented once contextual information becomes available. These approaches, however, use a different scheme for indicating the final meaning of a sentence and do not handle VPE.","In the rest of this section, we review past representations of pronouns, definite NPs, and indefinite NPs. We emphasize VPE research because it considers not only the representation of sentences in general, but also the representation of trigger sentences. Each approach is examined in the light of its modeling capability and our computational constraints. 7.1 Verb Phrase Ellipsis and Models of Pronouns Pronouns are often classified as either bound variable or referential pronouns (Sag 1976; Webber 1978; Reinhart 1983; Partee and Bach 1981), but the adequacy of this dichotomy is questionable (as discussed in Section 3.1). Models of VPE must consider not only pronouns in normal sentences but also pronouns in trigger sentences, and must account for the ambiguity that arises when a pronoun's antecedent is the syntactic subject of a trigger sentence. Sag (1976) and Webber (1978) handle this ambiguity by introducing a rule to replace a pronoun whose antecedent is known to be the syntactic","15 This program only deals with intersentential VPE. Hence, all variables in the trigger VP must be bound in the VP, otherwise the elided sentence cannot receive a meaning. If we augment our approach to handle antecedent-contained ellipsis, we would have to allow variables bound by an operator outside of the VP but inside the meaning of the sentence. 451 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 subject of a trigger sentence with the larnbda variable corresponding to that subject.

Reinhart does not represent pronouns or definites as quantified terms, yet she claims that when a pronoun's antecedent is a definite NP or a pronoun that c-commands the pronoun, then the pronoun is bound by a lambda operator abstracting the antecedent. At first glance, the idea of binding a pronoun with the lambda operator of its antecedent (given that the NP c-commands the pronoun) seems promising; it can be used to handle Example 70.

Reinhart's approach can only provide the first meaning of the elided sentence in 71. This example suggests that pronouns can refer to definite subjects in two nonreferential ways; lambda abstraction accounts for only one of them.","Partee and Bach (1981) attempt to dispense with LF in translating from syntax to final interpretation, building on Montague's (1970) general theory (with a few modifications to get around the strict compositionality of that approach). All of the possible representations for ambiguous sentences are simultaneously generated, avoiding the 452 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form need for an intermediate level of representation. They directly provide model-theoretic interpretations for sentences containing pronouns and elided VPs. In their approach, null or elided VPs and pronouns are initially represented as variables. Pronouns are represented as variables that are either bound by some operator or remain free within the representation of the sentence. If a pronoun variable is unbound, it is assigned some value by a context assignment function, that is, a function that maps the variable to the individual that the pronoun denotes. In other words, pronouns are either bound variables in this model or they are referential. An elided VP is represented as a free property variable, typed to receive a value corresponding to a VP already in discourse. It receives its interpretation in much the same way as an unbound pronoun variable, with the exception that its antecedent must be available in linguistic context. Once the value of the null VP is specified, the meaning of the elided sentence is determined.","Bach and Partee point out a variety of examples for which their approach fails. Because there is no mechanism for ensuring that a pronoun bound in the trigger sentence is bound by the same operator in the elided sentence, their approach provides a host of impossible interpretations for elided sentences. For example, their approach provides an impossible interpretation for the elided sentence in No man believes that Mary loves him. But she does, given that no man is the antecedent for him and the meaning of the null VP is loves him. Since the variable for him is unbound in the elided interpretation, it must be assigned a value (e.g., Fred) by the context assignment function. Partee and Bach also discuss examples in which an elided sentence receives an impossible interpretation when a free pronoun variable in the trigger VP becomes accidentally bound by a quantifier in the elided sentence. In addition to the problems pointed out by Partee and Bach, others arise if we assume that definite NPs are quantified.","The above approaches also do not adhere to all of our computational constraints, which are essential in any computer model. For example, Sag's (1976), Webber's (1978), and Reinhart's (1983) approaches do not conform with the formal consistency constraint (because they replace pronoun strings with a variable to account for bound variable meanings of a pronoun) and Partee and Bach's approach (1981) does not conform with the compactness constraint. 7.2 Past Representations of Definites and Indefinites In this section, we examine previous representations of definite NPs. In particular, we review definite descriptions and definite quantifiers. We also examine some recent work that departs from traditional representations of definite NPs (e.g., Heim [1982]; Roberts [1987]; Kamp [1981]; Klein [1987]). 7.2.1 Definite Descriptions and Definite Quantifiers. Many researchers have attempted to represent definite NPs using definite descriptions or definite quantifiers. Russell (1971) introduced definite descriptions to capture the meaning of definite NPs like the dog in Example 72. Example 72 The dog barked.: (barked (~x)(dog x)) which means: 3x (and (Dog x) ; The dog exists.","Vy ((dog y) *-~ x=y) ; It is the one-and-only dog.","(barked x)) ; It barked. 453 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 The definite description,"]},{"title":"(~x)(dog x),","paragraphs":["which stands for"]},{"title":"the object x such that the property (dog x) is true","paragraphs":["names a unique object, and hence, is translated into the formula,"]},{"title":"3x (and (dog x) Vy ((dog y) *-4 (= x y))).","paragraphs":["Notice three important features of the meaning of the sentence in Example 72: the dog described by the definite NP is assumed to exist, is assumed to be unique, and fills some role in the sentence.","Definite descriptions suffer from several problems.

For example,"]},{"title":"the dog","paragraphs":["in 72 is described as the-one-and-only"]},{"title":"the dog,","paragraphs":["regardless of context.

While an in-place definite description simply fills an argument slot in a predicate-argument structure representing the sentence, a quantifier scopes an open sentence. For example, the sentence,"]},{"title":"The dog barked,","paragraphs":["could be represented as shown in 73 (along with a shorthand notation, where the quantifier 3! reads"]},{"title":"there exists a unique). Example 73","paragraphs":["The dog barked. 3x: (and (dog x) (Vy ((dog y) *-* x=y))) (barked x) Short hand notation: 3!x: (dog x) (barked x)","A quantificational representation for definites suffers from several problems. First, as one might guess, it suffers from the same uniqueness problem that in-place definite descriptions have. 16 Second, definite noun phrases do not exhibit the same type of quantifier scope ambiguity that other quantified NPs have. Compare the two sentences below.","Example 74","a. Every man loves a woman. 1. Vx: (man x) 3y: (woman y) (loves x y) 2. 3y: (woman y) Vx: (man x) (loves x y)","b. Every man loves the woman. 1. Vx: (man x) 3!y: (woman y) (loves x y) 2. 3!y: (woman y) Vx: (man x) (loves x y)","16 Dowty, Wall, and Peters (1981) suggest a nice way to fix the uniqueness problem. They eliminate the one-and-only aspect of a definite quantifier by relativizing uniqueness to a context of utterance (much as the domain of a universal NP must be relativized to a context of utterance). Though their solution improves definite quantifiers, it does not eliminate the problem with definite anaphora. 454 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form While the sentence in 74a has two different meanings and two representations, the sentence in 74b expresses one meaning, but has two representations. Definite descriptions, on the other hand, provide only a single representation for Every man loves the woman while providing multiple representations for sentences with definite scope ambiguity, as in The mechanic adjusted the steering wheel in each car. Third, as we have already discussed in Section 4.1, the strict reading of the elided sentence in Example 18 is difficult for a quantified definite representation to account for. Finally, pronoun references to definites are not constrained in the way that pronoun references to other quantified NPs are. For example, when a quantifier is embedded in a relative clause attached to a noun phrase, it cannot bind a pronoun outside of that clause, as in Fred gave the psychiatrist who cares for every woman her diary. In contrast, the pronoun her in Every man gave the psychiatrist who cares for his mother her diary can have his mother as its antecedent. One might, like Hornstein (1984), assume that definites are quantified but have different properties than universal quantifiers. However, this assumption does not correct some of the problems of definite quantifiers, such as uniqueness or their inability to model anaphoric definites.","Rather than modifying definite quantifiers, it seems appropriate to represent definites as functions and gain four immediate benefits. First, the representation of a definite NP as a uniquely named function provides a mechanism for handling anaphoric definite NPs. Second, because of this naming convention, definite functions are distinct unless an equality is asserted between them. Third, since we represent each definite as a function with a restriction and the restriction provides us with a mechanism for determining the final meaning of the definite, we are able to capture the properties of a definite description without neglecting anaphoric definites. Fourth, while definite quantifiers can violate the compactness and formal consistency constraints, 17 our approach does not. 7.2.2 Heim (1982)"]},{"title":"and Discourse Representation Theory.","paragraphs":["Another approach to modeling definites was developed by Heim (1982) and Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) researchers Kamp (1981), Roberts (1987), Klein (1987). A hallmark of these approaches is their ability to handle anaphoric definites in a reasonable way and the commitment to modeling the meaning of a series of sentences in discourse, not just individual sentences.","Heim (1982) treats definites and indefinites very similarly in her theory since both can be referred to across sentence boundaries, unlike universal NPs. To provide an interpretation for a sentence, Heim first determines the logical form for a sentence. Her logical form is essentially a parse tree with quantifier scoping information indicated, though it is not a logical representation for the meaning of the sentence. Once the logical form for a sentence is constructed, she provides a file change semantics for the sentence using felicity conditions to distinguish definites from indefinites. For example, the novelty-familiarity felicity condition states that indefinites should always cause a new discourse referent (or file card) to be created in the discourse model but definite NPs should not introduce a new discourse referent (or file card). Clearly, Heim's approach emphasizes the anaphoric aspect of the definite NP, which both definite descriptions and definite quantifiers fail to handle well.","Heim's model handles anaphoric definites, but she must introduce accommodation to cover nonanaphoric definites. Consider the sentence Every mani loves hisi mother.","17 Formal consistency is violated when a wide scope definite is replaced with something that cannot be described as a constant and compactness is violated when a different representation is introduced to handle anaphoric definites. 455 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 a° x2 person(x2)"]},{"title":"I irsoo xx xx' I b.","paragraphs":["person(xl) person(x2) I [ (love x2 xl) Figure 5 Discourse representations for Someone loves everyone. Accommodation, a concept introduced by Lewis (1979), allows the introduction of a new file card for a definite NP if and only if that NP is related to a previous file card. In the example, his mother is nonanaphoric; however, given that the antecedent for his is every man, accommodation allows the introduction of a new discourse referent. However, to provide a file card for his mother, the model must know that his refers to every man; accommodation requires more than syntax and sentence-level information to provide the representation for some definite NPs. Additionally, Heim's model would have trouble handling any definite NPs without an accommodation link to a previous NP in the discourse model.","Heim's approach requires a considerable amount of information before a definite or indefinite NP is represented in file change semantics (including quantifier scoping information and pronoun antecedents). Hence, the process of representing sentences in file change semantics does not seem to comply with our modularity constraint.","Kamp (1981) introduces a discourse theory similar to Heim's, called Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), providing a model-theoretic interpretation for discourse models. Both theories are motivated by the fact that pronouns in one sentence can have definite and indefinite antecedents in another sentence, while universals cannot bind pronouns in other sentences. Kamp's approach has been extended by several researchers (e.g., Klein [1987]; Roberts [1987]). Since Kamp does not discuss quantifier scope ambiguities, we introduce DRT as discussed by Roberts.","In DRT, a set of construction rules converts natural language into discourse structures. To do so, however, quantifier scoping information must be specified. Consider the two DRT representations for Someone loves everyone. The first, shown in Figure 5a, corresponds to the reading in which someone has scope over everyone. The discourse referents for everyone and someone are xl and x2, respectively. The universal NP causes the creation of the antecedent-consequent box. Because x2 is defined outside of xl's antecedent-consequent box, it acts like a constant. The second, shown in Figure 5b, corresponds to the reading in which everyone has scope over someone. Because the discourse referent for someone is created in the consequent box of the universal, its denotation depends on xl, the discourse referent for everyone. Each quantifier scoping requires a different discourse representation for the meaning of the sentence.","Mapping into a discourse representation is a top-down process that reduces the original sentence to a structure with a discourse referent for each noun phrase, with predicates indicating restrictions on the discourse referents as well as relations between discourse referents. As we already pointed out, a universal is represented by placing its discourse referent and restriction into an antecedent box, with additional sentence information placed in the consequent box (resulting in a meaning like a universal in 456 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form l xl x2 ] ~[ miner(xl) donkey(x2) [ [ x3 (beat xl x3) (=x3 x2) Figure 6 Discourse representation for Every miner who owns a donkey beats it. predicate calculus). Indefinites and definites are represented by placing their discourse referents and restriction information in the box corresponding to the current level in the model. An accessibility relation determines when a pronoun can have a particular discourse referent as its antecedent. A pronoun's antecedent can be any discourse referent defined in the box where the pronoun is instantiated or in any box containing that box. Additionally, a pronoun in a consequent box can also refer to anything in the antecedent box (unless the antecedent is embedded in another box contained in the antecedent box).","Roberts (1987) combines DRT with c-command to distinguish two types of binding, c-command binding and discourse binding. C-command binding occurs when the best way to represent the anaphoric NP is by replacing it with the variable associated with the operator of the NP that c-commands it. On the other hand, discourse binding is needed to handle anaphoric dependencies on things that don't c-command a pronoun or anaphoric definite. For example, consider the sentence Every miner who owns a donkey beats it. In Robert's approach, if a donkey had c-commanded it, then no discourse referent would be created for it; instead, the pronoun would be represented using the discourse referent of its antecedent. However, because a donkey does not c-command it, the sentence is handled as shown in Figure 6. Notice that the pronoun is represented as a discourse referent x3, which is equated with the discourse referent for a donkey (i.e., x2). Pronouns that haven't already been replaced by a discourse referent must be equated with some accessible discourse referent.","Klein (1987) has augmented DRT to handle VPE by introducing a concept that is very similar to lambda abstraction. He is able to represent VPs and abstract the syntactic subject of the sentence. Consider how Example 3 is handled. Example 3 Trigger Sentence: Elided Sentence: Possible Meanings: Fred/loves his/wife. Georgej does too. 1. George loves Fred's wife. (strict meaning) 2. George loves George's wife. (sloppy meaning) The discourse representation for the two readings of the elided sentence are shown in Figure 7. Klein represents the trigger VP as a boxed structure named P. Within this box is a distinguished variable x2 (distinguished variables are marked with brackets), which corresponds to the abstracted subject. The trigger sentence is represented as P(xO), which is very similar to applying the discourse referent for the subject to a lambda function named P. The discourse referent for his is x4, which can either be equated with the distinguished discourse referent (i.e., x2) or with something outside of the VP box. To get the sloppy reading, it is equated with the distinguished discourse 457 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 a. x0 xl P q Fred(x0)","P: Ix2] x3 x4 wife(x3) possess(x4 x3) love(x2 x3) x4 = x2 P(x0) George(xl) Q(xl) Q=P b. x0 xl P Q Fred(x0)","P:[[x2] x3 x4 Iwife(x3) Ipossess(x4 x3) [love(x2 x3) ] x4 = xO P(x0) George(x1) Q(xl) Q=P Figure 7 Discourse representations for the readings of Example 3. referent, as shown in Figure 7a. The elided sentence is represented initially as Q(xl), where xl is the discourse referent for the subject of the elided sentence. The sloppy reading for the sentence is provided when Q is equated with P.","On the other hand, to derive the strict reading of the elided sentence, the discourse referent for the pronoun in the VP is equated with the discourse referent for the subject, namely xO (as shown in Figure 7b). Again the meaning of the elided sentence is derived by equating Q with P, but in this case the pronoun's discourse referent is equated with the discourse referent for the subject. Hence, Klein derives the two expected readings for the elided sentence in 3.","This approach to VPE is similar to ours, except we introduce explicit differences between definite and indefinite NPs. To see why this is an issue, compare Examples 75 and 57. Example 75 Fred/saw his/friend. Georgej did too. Possible Meanings: 1. George saw Fred's friend.","2. George saw George's friend. Example 57 Fred/saw a friend of his/. Georgej did too. Possible Meanings: 1. George saw the same friend of Fred's.","2. George saw a different friend of Fred's.","3. George saw a friend of George's. Because definites and indefinites are represented in the same way in DRT, the sloppy readings for both of these examples are represented in precisely the same way (shown in Figure 8a), as are the strict readings (shown in Figure 8b). However, the meaning of his friend is quite different from the meaning of a friend of his in VPE. The elided sentence in 75 cannot mean George saw a different friend of Fred's, in contrast to the elided 458 Mary P. Harper Ambiguous Noun Phrases in Logical Form a. x0 xl P Q Fred(x0)","P: [x2] x3 x4 [ friend(x3) I possess(x4 x3) ["]},{"title":"see(x2 x3) [ x4 = x2 I","paragraphs":["P(x0) George(xl) Q(xl) Q=P b. x0 xl P Q Fred(x0)","P:[ Ix2] x3 x4 [ friend(x3) IPossess(x4 x3) [ see(x2 x3) I x4 = x0 P(.O) George(xl) Q(xl) Q=P Figure 8 Discourse representations for the readings of Examples 57 and 75. sentence in 57. One more interpretation is available for the elided sentence in 57 than for the elided sentence in 75, but in each case, only two representations are provided. In our approach, definites and indefinites are treated quite differently, not simply in how they are initially represented, but also in how they are processed to determine final meanings. It is therefore easier for us to explain the differences between examples 57 and 75. In Section 5.3, we demonstrated how our approach is able to provide the three readings for the elided sentence in 57. In contrast, our approach provides only two readings for the elided sentence in 75, as shown with a similar example (i.e., Example 3) in Section 4.4.","In Klein's (1987) approach to VPE, the discourse referents for definites and indefinites are provided only after quantifier scoping information is available. Hence, Klein's discourse representation for these NPs is similar to our refined representations for definites and indefinites (i.e., definite functions following argument simplification and indefinite functions), where a discourse referent that is created in a box introduced by a universal corresponds to a function of a universal variable. However, Klein's approach does not determine whether lambda operators (i.e., distinguished variables) have scope over discourse referents in a VP box. To handle Examples 57 and 75 in the framework of DRT, Klein must determine whether a discourse referent should be defined inside or outside of the VP box, stipulating that a discourse referent is created inside a box if and only if the operator responsible for introducing that box has scope over the NP. In contrast to our approach, the information required to make this decision must be known before building the discourse model. 8. Conclusion We began with the idea that LF, a compact intermediate level of representation derived only from syntactic and sentence-level information, is a valuable component in any computer model generating meaning for sentences. It can be used to postpone the determination of an unambiguous meaning for a sentence until the information required to select the intended meaning becomes available. Even though the meaning of the logical form for a sentence is ambiguous, it can be used by a contextual 459 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 4 processing module to guide the refinement of its own meaning (as well as the meaning of other sentences' LFs).","We have developed logical form representations for pronouns, definites, and indefinites and have demonstrated through a variety of detailed examples that these representations accurately model the linguistic behavior of the language (for a discussion of a wider variety of examples see Harper [1989, 1990]). We have proposed three computational constraints for using LF in a computational framework and have demonstrated that our LF conforms to these constraints. And finally, we used our representation in an implementation that was capable of processing nontrivial examples.","There are two topics that we have only touched on in this paper: the extraction of information from context and the handling of syntactic ambiguity. Though LF constrains the information sought by a contextual module, it does not completely specify a strategy for locating and processing contextual information. A single parse tree can be automatically mapped into LE However, in syntactically ambiguous sentences (e.g., Fred saw the bird with his binoculars) more than one parse is possible. A solution is to allow multiple LFs for a sentence (though this would violate the compactness constraint). Another solution, which we are currently pursuing, is to associate LFs with a parse forest for the sentence (resulting in a compact representation for the parse trees and logical forms).
