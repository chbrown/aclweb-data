{"sections":[{"title":"Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing of Montague Grammar 1 David Scott Warren Department of Computer Science SUNY at Stony Brook Long Island, NY 11794 Joyce Friedman University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI In natural language processing, the question of the appropriate interaction of syntax and semantics during sentence analysis has long been of interest. Montague grammar with its fully formalized syntax and semantics provides a complete, well-defined context in which these questions can be considered. This paper describes how semantics can be used during parsing to reduce the combinatorial explosion of syntactic ambiguity in Montague grammar. A parsing algorithm, called semantic equivalence parsing, is presented and examples of its operation are given. The algorithm is applicable to general non-context-free grammars that include a formal semantic component. The second portion of the paper places semantic equivalence parsing in the context of the very general definition of an interpreted language as a homomorphism between syntactic and semantic algebras (Montague 1970).

Semantic equivalence, based on logical equivalence of formulas obtained as translations, is used. We discuss the consequences of incorporating semantic processing into the parser and give examples of both syntactic and semantic parsing. In Part II the semantic parsing algorithm is related to earlier tabular context-free recognition methods. Relating our algorithm to its predecessors gives a new way of viewing the technique. The algorithmic description is then replaced by a description in terms of refined grammars. Finally we suggest how this notion might be generalized to the full class of Montague grammars.","The particular version of Montague grammar used here is that of PTQ, with which the reader is assumed to be conversant.

Syntactically each antecedent is regarded as substituted into a place marked by a variable. This is not unlike the way fillers are inserted into gaps in Gazdar's 1979 treatment. However, Montague's use of variables allows complicated interactions between different variable-antecedent pairs. Each substitution rule substitutes a term phrase (NP) for one or more occurrences of a free variable in a phrase (which may be a sentence, common noun phrase, or intransitive verb phrase). The first occurrence of the variable is replaced by the phrase; later occurrences are replaced by appropriate pronouns. The translation of the resulting phrase expresses the coreferentiality of the noun phrase and the pronouns. With substitution, but without pronouns, the only function of substitution is to determine quantifier scope. Directed Process Approach","One computational approach to processing a sentence is the directed process approach, which is a sequential analysis that follows the three-part presenta-tion in PTQ. The three steps are as follows. A purely syntactic analysis of a sentence yields a set of parse trees, each an expression in the disambiguated language. Each parse tree is then translated by Montague's rules into a formula of intentional logic to which logical reductions are immediately applied. The reduced formulas can then be interpreted in a model. The directed process approach is the one taken in the system described by Friedman, Moran, and Warren 1978a,b.","Semantic equivalence parsing is motivated by the observation that the directed process approach, in which all of the syntactic processing is completed before any semantic processing begins, does not take maximal advantage of the coupling of syntax and semantics in Montague grammars. Compositionality and the fact that for each syntactic rule there is a translation rule suggest that it would be possible to do a combined syntactic-semantic parse. In this approach, as soon as a subphrase is parsed, its logical formula is obtained and reduced to an extensionalized normal form. Two parses for the same phrase can then be regarded equivalent if they have the same formula.","The approach to parsing suggested by Cooper's 1975 treatment of quantified noun phrases is like our semantic equivalence parsing in storing translations as one element of the tuple corresponding to a noun phrase. Cooper's approach differs from the approach followed here because he has an intermediate stage that might be called an \"autonomous syntax tree\". The frontier of the tree is the sentence; the scope of the quantifier of a noun phrase is not yet indicated. Cooper's approach has been followed by the GPSG system (Gawron et al. 1982) and by Rosenschein and Shieber 1982. Neither of those systems treats pronouns. In Montague's approach, which we follow here, the trees produced by the parser are expressions in the disambiguated language, so scope is determined, pronoun antecedents are indicated, and each tree has a unique (unreduced) translation. The descriptions of the systems that use Cooper's approach seem to imply that they use a second pass over the syntax tree to determine the actual quantifier scopes in the final logical forms. Were these systems to use a single pass to produce the final logical forms, the results described in this paper would be directly applicable. 1. Equivalence Parsing Ambiguity","Ambiguity in Montague grammar is measured by the number of different meanings. In this view syntactic structure is of no interest in its own right, but only as a vehicle for mapping semantics. Syntactic ambiguity does not directly correspond to semantic ambiguity, and there may be many parses with the same semantic interpretation. Further, sentences with scope ambiguity, such as A man loves every woman, require more than one parse, because the syntactic derivation determines quantifier scope.","In PTQ there is infinite syntactic ambiguity arising from three sources: alphabetic variants of variables, variable for variable substitutions, and vacuous variable substitution. However, these semantically unnecessary constructs can be eliminated, so that the set of syntactic sources for any sentence is finite, and a parser that finds the full set is possible. (This corresponds to the \"variable principle\" enunciated by Janssen 1980 and used by Landsbergen 1980.) This approach was the basis of our earlier PTQ parser (Friedman and Warren 1978).","However, even with these reductions the number of remaining parses for a sentence of reasonable complexity is still large compared to the number of non-equivalent translations. In the directed process approach this is treated by first finding all the parses, next finding for each parse a reduced translation, and then finally obtaining the set of reduced translations. Each reduced translation may, but does not necessarily, represent a different sentence meaning. No meanings are lost. Further reductions of the set of translations would be possible, but the undecidability of logical equivalence precludes algorithmic reduction to a minimal set. The ATN Program","In the underlying parser the grammar is expressed as an augmented transition network (ATN) (Woods 1973). Both the syntactic and the semantic parsers use this same ATN. The main difficulty in construct-124 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing ing the ATN was, as usual, the non-context-free aspects of the grammar, in particular the incorporation of a treatment of substitution rules and variables. The grammar given in PTQ generates infinitely many derivations for each sentence. All but finitely many of these are unnecessary variations on variables and were eliminated in the construction of the ATN. The ATN represents only the reduced set of structures, and must therefore be more complex. Equivalence Testing","In order to say what we mean by semantic equivalence parsing, we use Harel's 1979 notion of execution method for nondeterministic programs. An execution method is a deterministic procedure for finding the possible execution paths through a nondeterministic program given an input. For an ATN, these execution paths correspond to different parses. Viewing parsing in this way, the only difference between the usual syntactic parsing and semantic equivalence parsing is a difference in the execution method. As will be seen, semantic equivalence parsing uses semantic tests as part of the execution method.","We call the execution method we use to process a general ATN equivalence parsing (Warren 1979). Equivalence parsing is based on a recall table. The recall table is a set of buckets used to organize and hold partial syntactic structures while larger ones are constructed. Equivalence parsing can be viewed as processing an input sentence and the ATN to define and fill in the buckets of the recall table. The use of the recall table reduces the amount of redundant processing in parsing a sentence. Syntactic structures found along one execution path through the ATN need not be reconstructed but can be directly retrieved from the recall table and used on other paths. The recall table is a generalization of the familiar well-formed substring table (WFST) to arbitrary programs that contain procedure calls. Use of the WFST in ATN parsing is noted in Woods 1973 and Bates 1978. Bates observes that the WFST is complicated by the HOLDs and SENDRs in the ATN. These are the ATN actions that correspond to parameter passing in procedures and are required in the ATN for PTQ to correctly treat the substitution rules.","In the Woods system the WFST is viewed as a possible optimization, to be turned on when it improves parsing efficiency. In our system the recall table is an intrinsic part of the parsing algorithm. Because any ATN that naturally represents PTQ must contain left recursion, the usual depth-first (or breadth-first or best-first) ATN parsing algorithm would go into an infinite loop when trying to find all the parses of any sentence. The use of the recall table in equivalence parsing handles left-recursive ATNs without special consideration (Warren 1981). As a result there is no need to rewrite the grammar to eliminate left-recursive rules as is usually necessary.","In a general nondeterministic program, a bucket in the recall table corresponds to a particular subroutine and a set of values for the calling parameters and return parameters. For an ATN a bucket is indexed by a triple: (1) a grammatical category, that is, a subnet to which a PUSH is made, (2) the contents of the SENDR registers at the PUSH and the current string, and (3) the contents of the LIFTR registers at the POP and the then-current string. A bucket contains the members of an equivalence class of syntactic structures; precisely what they are depends on what type of equivalence is being used.","What makes equivalence parsing applicable to non-context-free grammars is that its buckets are more general than the cells in the standard tabular context-free algorithms. In the C-K-Y algorithm (Kasami 1965), for example, a cell is indexed only by the start-ing position and the length of the parsed segment, i.e., the current string at PUSH and POP. The cell contents are nonterminals. In our case all three are part of the bucket index, which also includes SENDR and LIFTR register values. The bucket contents are equivalence classes of structures. Sentence Recognition","For sentence recognition all parses are equivalent. So it is enough to determine, for each bucket of the recall table, whether or not it is empty. A sentence is in the language if the bucket corresponding to the sentence category (with empty SENDR registers and full string, and empty LIFTR registers and null string) is nonempty. The particular forms of the syntactic structures in the bucket are irrelevant; the contents of the buckets are only a superfluous record of the specific syntactic structures. The syntactic structure is never tested and so does not affect the flow of control. Thus which buckets are nonempty depends only on what other buckets are nonempty and not on what those other buckets contain. For sentence recognition, when the execution method constructs a new member of a bucket that is already nonempty, it may or may not add the new substructure, but it does not need to use it to construct any larger syntactic structures. This is because the earlier member has already verified this bucket as nonempty. Therefore this fact is already known and is already being used to determine the nonemptiness of other buckets. To find all parses, however, equivalence parsing does use all members of each bucket to construct larger structures.","It would be possible first to do recognition and determine all the nonempty buckets in the recall table, and then to go back and take all variants of one single parse that can be obtained by replacing any substructure.by another substructure from the same bucket. American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 125 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing This is essentially how the context-free parsing algorithms constructed from the tabular recognition methods work. This is not how the equivalence parsing algorithm works. When it obtains a substructure, it immediately tries to use it to construct larger structures.","The difference described above between sentence recognition and sentence parsing is a difference only in the execution methods used to execute the ATN and not in the ATN itself. This difference is in the test for equivalence of bucket contents. In sentence recognition any two syntactic structures in a bucket are equivalent since we only care whether or not the substring can be parsed to the given category. At the other extreme, in finding all parses, two entries are equivalent only if they are the identical structure. For most reasonable ATNs, including our ATN for PTQ, this would not happen; distinct paths lead to distinct structures.","Semantic parsing is obtained by againmodifying only the equivalence test used in the execution method to test bucket contents. For semantic parsing two entries are equivalent if their logical translations, after logical reduction and extensionalization, are identical to within change of bound variable. Small Grammar","For our examples, we introduce in Figure 1 a small subnet of the ATN for PTQ. Arcs with fully capitalized labels are PUSH arcs; those with lower case labels are CAT arcs. Structure-building operations are indicated in parentheses. This net implements just three rules of PTQ. Rule $4 forms a sentence by concatenating a term phrase and an intransitive verb phrase; Sll conjoins two sentences, and S14,i substitutes a term phrase for the syntactic variable he i in a sentence. $4 and Sll are context-free rules; S14,i is one of the substitution rules that make the grammar non-context-free and is basic to the handling of quantifiers, pronouns, and antecedents. The ATN handles the substitution by using a LIFTR to carry the variable-binding information. The LIFTR is not used for the context-free rules."]},{"title":"ITE","paragraphs":["TS TS IV ($4 TERM IVP) POP SENT l","(S11 SENTI (S14,i TERM SENT) SENT2) TE bte"]},{"title":"i l l","paragraphs":["POP hei IV biv POP IVP Figure 1.

This sentence has the obvious parse using only the context-free rule $4. It also has the parse using the substitution rule. We will carry through the details of its parse to show how this substitution rule is treated in the parsing process.","In the trace PUSHes and POPs in the syntactic analysis of this sentence are shown. The entries are in chronological order. The PUSHes are numbered sequentially for identification. The PUSH number uniquely determines a) the category to which the PUSH is made, b) the remainder of the sentence being parsed at the time of the PUSH, and c) the contents of the SENDR registers at the time of the PUSH, called the PUSH environment. At each POP a bucket and an element in that bucket are returned. The bucket name at a POP is made up of the corresponding PUSH number, the remaining input string, and the contents of the LIFTR registers, which are called the POP environment. The element in the bucket is the tree that is returned. For brevity we use in the trace only the first letters of the words in the sentence; for example, Bill walks becomes Bw.

Execution continues but there are no more parses of the sentence.] Discussion","In this trace bucket t-e-null is the only bucket with more than one entry. The execution method was syntactic parsing, so each of the two entries was returned and printed out. For recognition, these two entries in the bucket would be considered the same and the second would not have been POPped. Instead of continuing the computation up in the subnet from which the PUSH was made, this path would be made to fail and the execution method would back up. For semantic equivalence parsing, the bucket contents throughout would not be the syntax trees, but would instead be their reduced extensionalized logical formulas. (Each such logical formula represents the equivalence class of the syntactic structures that correspond to the formula.) For example, bucket 2-w-null would contain ~,Pp{Ab} and bucket 3-c-null would contain walk'. The first entry to bucket 1-E-null would be the formula for ($4 Bill walk), that is, walk.'(b). The entry to bucket 1-e-null on the last line of the trace American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 127 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing would be the formula for (S14,0 Bill ($4 he0 walk)), which is also walk.'(b). Therefore, this second entry would not be POPped.","Buckets also serve to reduce the amount of repeat-ed computation. Suppose we have a second PUSH to the same category with the same string and environment as an earlier PUSH. The buckets resulting from this new PUSH would come out to be the same as the buckets from the earlier PUSH. Therefore the buckets need not be recomputed; the results of the earlier buckets can be used directly. This is called a \"FAKEPUSH\" because we don't actually do the PUSH to continue through the invoked subnet but simply do a \"FAKEPOP\" using the contents of the previously computed buckets.","Consider, as an example of FAKEPOP, the partial trace of the syntactic parse of the sentence Bill walks and Mary runs (or Bw&Mr for short).

This corresponds to the failure due to duplicate bucket contents in bucket 6-E-null following PUSH 9 in the trace above. Similarly parse g) is aborted before the entire tree is built. This corresponds to the failure in the final line of the trace due to a duplicate translation in bucket 10-E-null. Semantic parses that would correspond to syntactic parses h), i), and j) of Figure 2 are not considered at all. This is because bucket 1-&Mr-null contains two syntactic structures, but only one translation. Thus in semantic equivalence parsing we only do one FAKEPOP for this bucket for PUSH 5. In syntactic parsing the other parses are generated by the FAKEPOP of the other structure in this bucket. Reducing the Environment","The potential advantage of semantic equivalence parsing derives from treating partial results as an equivalence class in proceeding. A partial result consists of a structure, its extensionalized reduced translation, and a set of parameters of the parse to that point. These parameters are the environment for parsing the phrase. Consider the sentence John loves Mary and its parses: (1) ($4 John ($5 love Mary)) (2) ($4 John (S16,0 Mary ($5 love he0))) (3) (S14,0 John ($4 (he0 ($5 love Mary))) (4) (S14,0 John ($4 he0 (S16,1 Mary","($5 love hel)))) (plus 3 more) On reaching the phrase love Mary in parse (3) the parameters are not the same as they were at that point in parse (1), because the pair (he0 John) is in the environment. Thus the parser is not able to consult the recall table and immediately return the already parsed substructure. Instead it must reparse love Mary in the new context.","This environment problem arises because the ATN is designed to follow PTQ in treating pronouns by the non-context-free substitution rules. We have also considered, but have not to this point implemented, alternative ways of treating variables to make partial results equal. One way would be not to pass variable bindings down into lower nets at all. Thus the PUSH environment would always be null. Since these bindings are used to find the antecedent for a pronoun, the way antecedents are determined would have to be changed. An implementation might be as follows: On encountering a pronoun during parsing, replace it by a new he-variable. Then pass back up the tree informa-tion concerning both the variable number used and the pronoun's gender. At a higher point in the tree, where the substitution rule is to be applied, a determination can be made as to which of the substituted terms could be the antecedent for the pronoun. The variable number of the pronoun can then be changed to agree with the variable number of its antecedent term by a variable-for-variable substitution. Finally the substitution rule can be used to substitute the term into the phrase for all occurrences of the variable. Note that this alternative process would construct trees that do have substitution rules to substitute variables for varia-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 133 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing bles, contrary to the variable principle mentioned above. We also note that with this modification a pronoun is not associated with its antecedent when it is first encountered. Instead the pronoun is saved and at some later point in the parse the association is made. This revised treatment is related computationally to that proposed in Cooper 1975. Evaluation of Semantic Equivalence Parsing","The question of the interaction of syntax and semantics in parsing was introduced early in computational linguistics. Winograd 1971 argued for the incorporation of semantics as early as possible in the recognition process, in order to reduce the amount of syntactic processing that would be needed. Partial parses that had no interpretation did not need to be continued. The alternative position represented by Woods's early work (Woods and Kaplan 1971) was basically the inverse: less semantic processing would be needed if only completed parses were interpreted. This argument is based on the idea of eliminating uninterpretable parses as soon as possible.","This advantage, if it is one, of integrated syntactic and semantic procedures does not occur here because the semantic aspect does not eliminate any logical analyses. The translation of a structure to a formula is always successful, so no partial parse is ever eliminated for lack of a translation. What happens instead is that several partial parses are found to be equivalent because they have the same translation. In this case only a representative of the set of partial parses needs to be carried forward.","A further expansion of equivalence parsing would be interpretation equivalence parsing. Sentence processing would take place in the context of a specified model. Two structures would be regarded as equivalent if they had the same denotation in the model. More partial structures would be found equivalent under the equivalence relation than under the reduce-extensionalize relation, and fewer structures would need to be constructed. Further, with the interpretation equivalence relation, we might be able to use an inconsistent denotation to eliminate an incorrect partial parse. For example, consider a sentence such as Sandy and Pat are running and she is talking to him. In this case, since the gender of Sandy and Pat cannot be determined syntactically, these words would have to be marked in the lexicon with both genders. This would result in multiple logical formulas for this sentence, one for each gender assumption. However, during interpretation equivalence parsing, the referents for Sandy and Pat would be found in the model and the meaning with the incorrect coreference could be rejected.","Logical normal forms other than the reduced, extensionalized form used above lead to other reasonable versions of equivalence parsing. For example, we could further process the reduced, extensionalized form to obtain a prenex normal form with the matrix in clausal form. We would use some standard conventions for naming variables, ordering sequences of the same quantifier in the prefix, and ordering the literals in the clauses of the matrix. This would allow the algorithm to eliminate, for example, multiple parses arising from various equivalent scopes and orderings of existential quantifiers.","The semantic equivalence processor has been implemented in Franz Lisp. We have applied it to the PTQ grammar and tested it on various examples. For purposes of comparison the directed process version includes syntactic parse, translation to logical formula and reduction, and finally the reduction of the list of formulas to a set of formulas. The mixed strategy yields exactly this set of formulas, with one parse tree for each. Experiments with the combined parser and the directed parser show that they take approximately the same time for reasonably simple sentences. For more complicated sentences the mixed strategy usually results in less processing time and, in the best cases, results in about a 40 percent speed-up. The distinguishing characteristic of a string for which the method yields the greatest speed-up is that the environment resulting from parsing an initial segment is the same for several distinct parses.","The two parsing method we have described, the sequential process and the mixed process, were obviously not developed with psychological modeling in mind. The directed process version of the system can be immediately rejected as a possible psychological model, since it involves obtaining and storing all the structures for a sentence before beginning to interpret any one of them. However, a reorganization of the programwould make it possible to interpret each structure immediately after it is obtained. This would have the same cost in time as the first version, but would not require storing all the parses.","Although semantic equivalence parsing was developed in the specific context of the grammar of PTQ, it is more general in its applicability. The strict compositionality of syntax and semantics in PTQ is the main feature on which it depends. The general idea of equivalence parsing can be applied whenever syntactic structure is used as an intermediate form and there is a syntax-directed translation to an output form on which an equivalence relation is defined. 2. Input-Refined Grammars","We now switch our point of view and examine equivalence parsing not in algorithmic terms but in formal grammatical terms. This will then lead into showing how equivalence parsing relates to Universal 134 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing"]},{"title":"Grammar","paragraphs":["(UG) (Montague 1970).

Furthermore, there is a direct one-to-one relationship between the derivations of s in G and the derivations of s in G s. Thus the problem of recognizing s in G is reduced to the problem of determining emptiness for the grammar G s. Also, the problem of parsing s with respect to the grammar G reduces to the problem of exhaustive generation of the derivations of G s (there is at most one string). Each of the tabular context-free recognition algorithms can be viewed as implicitly defining this grammar G s and testing it for emptiness. Emptiness testing is essentially done by reducing the grammar, that is by eliminating useless symbols and productions. The table-constructing portion of a tabular recognition algorithm, in effect, constructs and reduces the grammar Gs, thus determining whether or not it is empty. The tabular methods differ in the construction and reduction algorithm used.","In each case, to turn a tabular recognition method into a parsing algorithm, the table must first be constructed and then reprocessed to generate all the parses. This corresponds to reprocessing the grammar Gs t, the result of reducing the grammar Gs, and using it to exhaustively generate all derivations in G s.","Rather than formally defining G s from a context-free grammar G and a string s in the general case, we illustrate the definition by example.

For the RHS nonterminals without subscripts, add the appropriate subscript. Also, to handle the terminals, for each t i add the production Ti~t where t is the i th symbol in s.","It is straightforward to show inductively that if a nonterminal symbol generates any string at all it generates exactly the substring of s that its subscript determines. Symbols with superscripts generate the empty string. Also a parse tree of G s can be converted to a parse tree of G by first deleting all terminals (each is dominated by the same symbol with a subscript) and then erasing all superscripts and subscripts on all symbols in the tree. Conversely, any parse tree for s in G can be converted to a parse tree of s in G s by adding appropriate subscripts and superscripts to all the symbols of the tree and then adding the terminal symbols at the leaves. American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 135 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing","It is clear that G s is not in general a reduced grammar. G s can be reduced to Gs ~ by eliminating unproductive and unreachable symbols and the rules involv-ing them. Reducing the grammar will determine whether or not L(Gs) is empty. By the above discussion, this will determine whether s is in L(G), and thus an algorithm for constructing and reducing the refined grammar G s from G and s yields a recognition algorithm. Also, given the reduced grammar Gs I, it is straightforward, in light of the above discussion, to generate all parses of s in G: simply exhaustively generate the parse trees of Gs ~ and delete subscripts and superscripts.","The tabular context-free recognition methods of Cocke-Kasami-Younger, Earley, and Sheil can all be understood as variations of this general approach. The C-K-Y recognition algorithm uses the standard bottom-up method to determine emptiness of G s. It starts with the terminals and determines which G s nonterminals are productive, eventually finding whether or not the start symbol is productive. The matrix it constructs is essentially the set of productive nonterminals of G s.","Sheil's well-formed substring table algorithm is the most obviously and directly related. His simplest algorithm constructs the refined grammar and reduces it top-down. It uses a top-down control mechanism to determine the productivity only of nonterminals that are reachable from the start symbol. The well-formed substring table again consists essentially of the reachable, productive nonterminals of G s.","Earley's recognition algorithm is more complicated because it simultaneously constructs and reduces the refined grammar. It can be viewed as manipulating sets of subscripted nonterminals and sets of productions of G s. The items on the item lists, however, correspond quite directly to reachable, productive nonterminals of G s.","The concept of input-refined grammar provides a unified view of the tabular context-free recognition methods. Equivalence parsing as described in Part I above is also a tabular method, although it is not context-free. It applies to context-free grammars and also to some grammars such as PTQ that are not context-free. We next relate it to the very general class of grammars defined by Montague in UG. Universal Grammar and Equivalence Parsing","In the following discussion of the problem of parsing in the general context of Montague's definitions of a language (which might more naturally be called a grammar) and an interpretation, we assume the reader is familiar with the definitions in UG (Montague 1970). We begin with a formal definition of a refinement of a general disambiguated language. A particular type of refinement, input-refinement, leads to an equivalence parsing algorithm. This generalizes the procedure for input-refining a grammar shown above for the special case of a context-free grammar. We then discuss the implications for equivalence parsing of using the formal interpretation of the language.

The problem can now be restated: find an algorithm that, given a string ~, constructs a disambiguated language ~2~ that is an input-refinement of fL That is, f~ is a refinement in which the sentence category Cts, is exactly the set of parses of ~ in L. Finding this algorithm is equivalent to solving the parsing problem. For given such an algorithm, the parsing problem reduces to the problem of generating all members of C'80,.","In the case of a general language <~, R>, it may be the case that for ~ a string, the input-refined language f~ has finitely many categories. In this case the reduced grammar can be computed and a recursive parsing algorithm exists. If the reduced grammar has infinitely many categories, then the string has infinitely many parses and we are not, in general, interested in trying to parse such languages. It may happen, how-ever, that ~2~ has infinitely many categories, even though its reduction has only finitely many. In this case, we are not guaranteed a recursive parsing algorithm. However, if this reduced language can be effectively constructed, a recursive parsing algorithm still exists.","The ATN for PTQ represents the disambiguated language for PTQ in the UG sense. The categories of this disambiguated language correspond to the set of possible triples: PTQ category name, contents of SENDR registers at a PUSH to that subnet, contents of the LIFTR registers at the corresponding POP. The input-refined categories include the remainder of the input string at the PUSH and POP. Thus the buckets in the recall table are exactly the input-refined categories. The syntactic execution method is thus an exhaustive generation of all expressions in the sentence category of the input-refined disambiguated language. Semantic Equivalence Parsing in OG","In UG, Montague inclues a theory of meaning by providing a definition of interpretation for a language. Let L = <<A,F,r,Xs,S,t~0>.rEF,SEA,R> be a language. An interpretation ,t' for L is a system <B,G~,,f>3,EF such that <B,Gv>v~ r is an algebra similar to <A,F./>3,eF; i.e., for each ~, E F, Fy and G./ have the same number of arguments, and f is a function from O,EAX 8 into B. Note that the algebra <B,G~,>.rE F need not be a free algebra (even though <A,Fy>v¢ r must be). B is the set of meanings of the interpretation ,I,; Gv is the semantic rule corresponding to syntactic rule Fv; f assigns meanings to the basic expressions Xv. The meaning assignment for L determined by if' is the unique homomorphism g from <A,F.r>~,EF into <B,Gy>,/E F that is an extension of f.","There are two ways to proceed in order to find all the meanings of a sentence ~ in a language L = <f~, R> with interpretation ~. The first method is to generate all members of the sentence category Cts0 , of the input-refined language ~2~. As discussed above, this is done in the algebra <A,F./>~,cF of ~, using the syntactic functions Fv to inductively construct members of A from the basic categories of f~ and members of A constructed earlier and then applying g. The second method is to use the fact that g is a homomorphism from <A,F.~>~,EF into <B,G./>~ F. Because g is a homomorphism, we can carry out the construction of the image of the sentence category entirely in the algebra <B,G~,>~,eF of the interpretation q'. We may use the G functions to construct inductively members of B from the basic semantic categories, that is, the images under g (and f) of the basic syntactic categories, and members of B already constructed. The advantage of carrying out the construction in the algebra of ,t, is that this algebra may not be free, i.e., some element of B may have multiple construction sequences. By carrying out the construction there, such instances can be noticed and used to advantage, thus eliminating some redundant search. There are additional costs, however, associated with parsing in the interpretation algebra q'. Usually, the cost of evaluat-ing a G function in the semantic algebra is greater than the cost of the corresponding F function in the syntactic algebra. Also in semantic parsing, each member of B as it is constructed is compared to the other members of the same refined category that were previously constructed.","In the PTQ parsing system discussed above, the interpretation algebra is the set of reduced translations. The semantic functions are those obtained from the functions given in the T-rules in PTQ, and reducing and extensionalizing their results. The directed process version of the parser finds the meanings in this algebra by the first method, generating all parses in the syntactic algebra and then taking their images under the interpretation homomorphism. Semantic equivalence parsing for PTQ uses the second method, carrying out the construction of the meaning entirely within the semantic algebra. The savings in the example sentence Bill walks and Mary runs comes about American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 137 David Scott Warren and Joyce Friedman Using Semantics in Non-Context-Free Parsing because the algebra of reduced translations is not a free algebra, and the redundant search thus eliminated more than made up for the increase in the cost of translating and comparing formulas. Summary","We have described a parsing algorithm for the language of PTQ viewed as consisting of two parts, a nondeterministic program and an execution method. We showed how, with only a change to an equivalence relation used in the execution method, the parser becomes a recognizer. We then discussed the addition of the semantic component of PTQ to the parser. With again only a change to the equivalence relation of the execution method, the semantic parser is obtained. The semantic equivalence relation is equality (to within change of bound variable) of reduced extensionalized translations. Examples were given to compare the two parsing methods.","In the finalportion of the paper we described how the parsing method initially presented in procedural terms can be viewed in formal grammatical terms. The notion of input-refinement for context-free grammars was introduced by example, and the tabular context-free recognition algorithms were described in these terms. We then indicated how this notion of refinement can be extended to the UG theory of language and suggested how our semantic parser is essentially parsing in the algebra of an interpretation for the PTQ language.","References","Bates, Madeleine 1978 The theory and practise of augmented transition network grammars.
