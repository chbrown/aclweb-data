I am very pleased that the opening of the Wrtshington Office of AFIPS coincides so closely Mith the start of my own term as President of AFIPS. The establishment of this Office has been a particular interest of mine for some time; during my term as President I expect to devote a considerable amount of time to it. In order for the Washington Office to be a success, a number of pieces will have to fit together. Two of them most appropriate for mention here are: This Washington Report must develop into a useful, not to say indispensable publication to its recipients; this will happen most surely if we receive feedback from you on what you like and don't like, on what should be in the Report which is not and on what shouldn't be in the Report which is. The Washington Report is being distributed to senior officials of the AFIPS constituent societies. From you we solicit ideas on what the Washington Office should be involved in. Your suggestions on how the infonation processing comnunity can be best served by the AFIPS Washington Office are most important to us. Anthony Ral ston WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS DR. WILLIS H.

FORD ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCES BILL FOR WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVICE Senator Moss, in behalf of the Ford Administration, introduced on June 20 a bill to establish a science advisory mechanism in the White House. While there are currently several bills pending before the Congress on this subject, the administration bill (S.1987) and a bill introduced in the House by Mr. Teague (H.R.4461) are considered to be the most likely contenders for enactment. S.1987 would establish in the Executive Office of the President an Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Director of the office would be the President's chief policy advisor with respect to scientific and technological matters.

In 1957 President Eisenhower, in response to international developments. in mi ssile technology, appointed a Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, and a President's Science Advisory Comi ttee (PSAC) which consisted of non-government scientists and engineers; in 1959, he also established the Federal Council for Science and Technology, which was composed of representatives of the major science-oriented agencies. President Kennedy, in 1962, institutionalized White House involvement in science policy by creating the Office of Science and Technology (OST) in the Executive Qffice of the President. As of 1970 OST included a staff member for computers, Dr. A. Michael Noll. However, President Nixon abolished PSAC and OST in 1973, transferring OST's functions (except those relating to national security) to the Office of the Director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. H. Guyford Stever. While Stever was simultaneously appointed Science Advisor to the President, the post was organizationally removed to agency level, and Stever was effectively barred from White House policy level discussions during the Nixon Administration. The Ford Administratian, in contrast, has recenxly shown several signs of willingness to reinstate a science advisor in the White House. ,H.R. 9058 differs from earlier bills in two important respects. First, in contrast to the Administration bill and to Stever's present role, H.R. 9058 would specifically direct the new science advisor to render advice in the area of national security. Second, in lieu of the maior organizational reform proposed in the original Teague Bill (H.R. 4461) to provide a centralization of scientific research and development, the new bill would simply initiate a major study to assess the total Federal science and techology effort, devoting particular attention to organizational reform. Since the earlier Teague Bill would have consolidated major Federal scientific and technical information organizations, the study approach is expected to create considerably less political resistance. Nevertheless, the bill 's prospects for enactment remain unclear. Although AFIPS and other scientific societies were told by an official of the Domestic Council in a White House briefing on July 30 that the bill was perceived to be a good one, it has not yet received the public support of the Ford Administration. PRIV4CY COMMISSION ELECTS CHAIRMAN, APPOINTS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR The Privacy Protection Study Commission elected David F. Linowes as its chairman on July 11. Linowes subsequently announced on August 14 the appointment of Carole W. Parsons as executive director of the Commission. Mr. Linolves is an international management consultant and a certified public accountant. Ms. Parsons has formerly been associated with the White House DonieStic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy and the HEW Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems. In carrying out its statutory charter (Washington Re ort, 8 75), the Comlnission will emphasize the assessinent of privacy safeguarhe (usiness and industry sector. It will examine policy issues associated ~ith the interstate transfer of information, the use of personal identifiers, and information activities in areas such as employ~nent, insurance, credit, banking, health, and social service. It will publish a final report by June, 1977. Chairman Linowes has indicated \"the strong desire of tlie Conaiission to receive suggestions from the public on which facets of the private sector should be given major attention;'' further, Ms. Parsons has stated that she will be looking for new ideas and lines of research to propose to the Conirnission. Tlie AFIPS Washington Office will endeavor to play an active role in providing assistance and input to the Commission; comments from tlie AFIPS societies are therefore of substantial importance, and are strongly solicited. U. 5. SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW NEW CASE ON PATENT OF SOFTWARE, There is now pending before the U. S. Supreme Court a review of the software patent granted to Thomas R. Johnston. The Court ruled in the 1972 Benson-Tabbot case that the software patent then in question was not valid, but the Justices did not resolve the issue of software patentability in general. Instead, the Court deferred to the Congress for a definition of the legal protections to be afforded to software; the Congress, however, has not responded. In the brief for the United States filed in the pending case; Solicitor General Robert Bork has asked the Court to resolve whether a coniputer program is patentable as a machine (rather than as a process), arguing that it is unreasonable to characterize a programmed general purpose coniputer as a \"new s~achine\".

RECENT EFTS DEVELOPMENTS The bill introduced in the llouse by Rep. St. Germain (Washington Report, 8/75), which would limit installation of remote teller terminals to a financial institution's ho~ne state and within 25 miles of its headquarters or 10 miles of a branch, has apparently died in conmiittee. While the measure to limit installation of such ternlinals has been, therefore, essentially rejected by the Senate, a Federal district court in Washington ruled i~ July that remote teller terminals constitute branch banks and are subject to laws governing branch banking. The decision, if it withstands the appeal being requested in the U. S. Comptroller of the Currency, will effectively prohibit future ban< installation of such terminals, and will cause operation of existing installations to be discontinued. NEW BILL INTRODUCED TO CONTROL FEDERAL CRIMJ_NAL JUSTICE INJORMATION SYSTEMS - Sen. Tunney and Rep. Edwards have introduced identical bills (H.R. 8227 and S. 2008) to control Federal criminal justice information systelns. The bill is a compromise incorporating features of legislation introduced earlier this year. It would allow only conviction records to be distributed without restriction to law enforcement agencies; arrest and acquittal records could be disclosed only for specific purposes (e.g., the investigation of a specific crime] and only to authorized personnel. Further, the bill would create a Commission on Criminal Justice Information, composed of rnen~bers of state and local law enforcement agencies, which would implement and oversee enforcement of the act. I,lhile tile FBI has been attempting for some time to establish a law enforcement communicationr system interconnecting local police departments throughout the country, the Cormis-sion would have the authority to modify or terminate the FBI plan.

The errors were made largely or entirely through the conlputer system which supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Changes in a Complex statutory scheme have caused a haphazard development of SSI software; but the agency also admits to a lack of internal control, as well as a lack of coordination between systems or between programers working on the same system. The Comnissioner testified that many of the erroneous transactions are \"literally beyond anybody's direct control.\" The errors have also led to concern that the system is vulnerable to fraudulent abuse by agency employees.

In response to a suggestion by chairman David Linowes, the Comnission resolved to create a conittee on Freedom of Information and Privacy, chaired by Minnesota State Sen. Robert Tennessen. Executive director Carole Parsons enumerated a list of areas possibly appropriate for the Comission's attention, which included: mailing lists; private sector usage of universal identifiers; valuntary private sector compliance with Federal regulations; data collection criteria; credit card and reservation systems; Freedom of Information Act litigation; health and medical records; multi-jurisdictional data systems; consumer reporting services; credit issuance and insurance; statistics and research; social services; employment and personnel matters; oversight, enforcement and remedies regarding privacy policies; international implications (including mu1 ti-national corporations) ; cost factors in imp1 ementing privacy safeguards; and the Federal-state relationship in privacy regulation.

TUNNEY HEARINGS ON WHITE HOUSE COMPUTERS The Senate Subcornnittee on Constitutional Rights, chaired by Sen. John Tunney, held fact-finding hearings on September 9 to investigate computer usage (pertaining to personal data files) by the White House and'the Federal Preparedness Agency (FPA). Tunney indicated that the investigation could lead to legislation controlling the use of surveillance technology. Witnesses for the White House Office of Management and Budget, and FPA, testified that their computers were not capable of direct communications with other agency computers, and that there had been no improper use of their systems. Tunney nonetheless expressed concern regarding accountability and control in the use of such systems. In particular, he pointed to the lack of knowledge on the part of White House witnesses concerning the data base content in the FPA computers at Mt.

Our next activity will be to structure a group of individuals from the AFIPS societies who are willing to make a comnitment to providing this assistance, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION BRIEFINGS The Washington Office has instituted a series of briefings to the Federal Cmicatlons Cmission, beginning with ivformal presentatioils by AFIPS experts visiting Washington. A near-term objective in this area is to provide a more comprehensive briefing to the Coninission, describing broadly how technological developments in, computing 'will affect communications and ultimately affect the regulatory responsibilities of that agency. FEDERAL COMPUTER NETWORKS AND PERSONAL DATA FILES The use or potential use of Federal computer networks to exchange personal data files has recently been the subject of attention by both Sen, Tunney's Subcommittee on~Constitu$ional Rights, and NBC Tews. Earlier this year, Ford Rowan of NBC produced a series of national news stories based on his investigation of Federal networks, particularly those in the defense and intelligence comnunities. With the objective of providing appropriate input from the computing profession, the AFIPS Washington Off~ce arranged for Mr. Rowan to interview Prof. Bernard Galler and Dr. Willis Ware; these interviews are expected to dppear on the NBC Nightly News. GENERAL INFORMATIONAL ACTIVITIES In addit-ion to producing the AFIPS Washington Report, recent activities have included: the development of a mechanism to disseminate NSF program solicitations froni both the Computer Science Section and the Office of Science and Information Service; providing infomation in response to individual requests from AFIPS constituents; and providing direct briefings to the AEDS and IEEE Computer Society boards which have recently met in Washington. In providing information to the Federal government, the Washington Office has recently responded to requests from the Federal Comnunications Comnission, the Library of Congress, and the Domestic Council Privacy Comnittee. PXPLORATORY ACTIVITIES An Important concept in the Washington Office charter is that the Office will function as an early warning mechanism with regard to developments in the Federal government. The objective is to permit AFIPS societies the opportunity to participate in such developments, rather than responding to them as faits accom lis. Accordingly, the Washington Office devotes substantial resources to ads hearings and meetings, and scanning on a daily basis such publications as the Federal Register, the Congressional Record and various comnercial reporting cervices."]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["Recent exploratory meetings have been held with several groups which have indicated a definite interest in access to technical information through AFIPS, e.g., the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, the Air Force Systems Comnand, and the Office of Automated Data Processing Management in the General Services Administration.

NcLI.9. The Comission, established by statute in 1970, is chartered to advise the President and the Congress on national policy related to library and information services; its major program objectives are (1) to develop resources supportive of high quality library and information services, and (2) to form a national network of library and information facilities. Specific objectives are to \" k]ncourage the private sector"]},{"title":". . .","paragraphs":["to become an active partner in the development of the National Program,\" as well as to ensure adequate library and infomation services, provide adequate special services, strengthen state resources, ensure education of related personnel, coordinate Federal programs, and establish a locus of Federal responsibility for the National Program. Nationwide netwrk. The Commission envisions a nationwide network of libraries and infomation centers encompassing state networks, multistate networks, and specialized netwrks in the public and private sectors; the definition of \"network\" in this cmntext includes computers and computer communications, although it extend3 to cmventional telephone and teletype devices as well. While the Federal government would neither directly control nor operate the network, it would have responsibility for aiding the development of compatible networks, furthering comn practices, and increasing coordination between the private and public sectors; it would also \"collaborate with appropriate professional societies in promulgating interstate technical standards, support the introduction of additional coyuter and telecommunications facilities as needed for interstate purposes, and help establish protocols governing the way transactions are handled by the network.\" Other Federal (as opposed to private) responsibilities identified by the Comission include developing centralized services for networking, exploring computer use, applying new forns of telecommunications, and supporting research and devel opment. Copies of the present National Program Document (U) may be obtained through the MIPS Washington Office; comments are, as noted above, encouraged by NCLIB. 69 FEDERAL PRIVACY ACT IMPLEMENTATION Ihe Privacy Act of 1974 took effect on September 27, amidst certain unresolved questions as to its operation. lhe Department of Health, Education and Welfare has characterized itself as a single agency for purposes of the Act, allowing (barring further Congressional response) the 11 separate agencies within HEW to exchange personal data files without the disclosure records required for transfers between other Federal agencies. In a separate development, members of Congress expressed concern over the fact that sone agencies were interpreting the Act to preclude Congressional access to agency files of personal data. Members of Congress frequently request such access to aid their constituents in dealing with Federal agencies. The situation was resolved, temporarily at least, by an OMB memo recommending that each agency establish Congressional access as a \"routine use\" of a system of records under the Act; the effect on the OMB procedure will be to obviate the need for niembcrs of Congress to obtain written consent in order to access a constituent's data file. Finally, Sen. Kennedy has taken :I strong issue with a Justice Department opinion which operated to exempt records which an agency had exempted from public access under the Privacy Act, from access under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as well. In response to Kennedy's objection, the Justice Department has proposed a new regulation which would allow the FOIA to apply to records exempted from the Privacy Act, but only at an agency's discretion. POLITICS AND PRIVACY A number of prominent politicians have been addressing the privacy issue recently, most notably President Ford. In an address ((1 at Stanford Law School, Ford spoke of the need to balance the individual right of privacy with the government's legitimate need for information related to its program. While Ford made clear his in-tolerance of illegal invasions of privacy, his coments were primarily directed toward threats to privacy which result from otherwise beneficial programs; in such areas, he said, 'ke must protect every individual from excessive and unnecessary intrusions by a Big Brother bureaucracy.\" In a separate statement Ford later said that"]},{"title":"\"N","paragraphs":["eeping only an essential minimum of these records is the most effective protection we have\" against incursions on privacy. Sen. Tunney, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, recently reaffirmad his concern with privacy in a speech (#) on the Senate floor. He noted that his Subcommittee was presently moving bills which: would prohibit military spying on civilians; would provide for control of criminal records (Washington Report, 9/75); and would secure greater privacy protection for government employees. Turtney pointed out the need to anticipate technological threats to privacy, an endeavor in which AFIPS has already offered assistance to the Senator. Speaking in a recent interview in EDP Weekly, Rep. Goldwater stated that he hoped for an attitude of support and voluntary compliance with privacy protection principles in the colmPercia1 sector. While he feels that the business sector has an incentive to be concerned with privacy as a \"good business practice,\" he feels that a similar incentive does not exist in the area of government; he pointed out, however, that he expects the states to enact their own privacy legislation, and that the Privacy Commission Cof which he is a member) would be looking primarily at the Federal-state relationship. In a speech at the recent IEEE Computer Society CWCON, Goldwater also urged the information processing community to provide technical input as a basis for reasonable legislation. CONTROVERSY ON,DEFENSE IR$D PROGRAM ?he Department of Defense Independent Research and Development IIRl,ll) progr~mr has been the subject of controversy in hearings before the Senate Irmed Services Subcommittee. The program permits defense contractors to charge part of their general R 6 D programs as overhead-on defense contracts; its cost in 1975 ros over $800 million dollars. Proponents of the program argued that it allows contractors to keep abreast of current technological developments, and that it allows the military to buy .tdvnnCed electronic system at a lesser cost than if developed under n. Jircctly funded R 6 D program. Critics of the program, however, testified that ~t allow:. firms to charge part of the cost of developing commercial projects to their military contracts; Admiral Hyman Rickover, heatl of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program, recornended that the program be eliminated. COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS RULING ENJOINED FROM IFIPLEMENTATION The Comptroller of the Currency has suspended his December, 1974 ruling (#) that Customer-Bank Comunication Terminals (CBCT's) are not branch banks within the meanipg of the laws governing national banks. A decision last July in the Federal District Court in Washington (Washington Report, 9/75) had enjoined fuxther implementation of the ruling, but it remained in effect while the Comptroller requested a stay of the District Court decision, pending appeal; on Octaber 10 the stay was denied and the ruling immediately suspended. PRESIDENT APPQIWS EFTS CCMdISSION President Ford has appointed the non-statutory members of the EFTS Commission, over one year after the enactment of the statute (t) creating the Commission. As a result of the delay the Commission will have less than a year to complete its work, unless the Congress passes an amendment (presently pending) which would extend its period of activity. William B. Widnall, former Congressman and ranking Republican on both the House Banking and Currency Committee and the Joint Economic Committee, has baen nominated as chairman; the Senate Banking Committee held brief confirmation hearings on October 23, and confirmation was expected (at press time) by Novembek 1. Members representing the financial sector are Richard D. Hill (First National Bank of Boston), Verne S. Atwater (Central Savings Bank of New York), and R~~ G, G~~~~ (Fidelity Federal S & L). State banking officials appointed were James E. Faris (Indiana) and William B. Lewis (New Jersey), and Herb Wegner was appointed as a trade association executive. Other nominees were Freyda P. Koplow, (former Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks), Fairfax Leary, Jr. (Temple University law professor); Almarin Phillips (U. of Pennsylvania) ; Gordon R. Worley (Montgomery Ward) ; George W. Waters (American Express); John J. Reynolds (Interbank Card Association); and Ralph F. Lewis (Harvard Business Review). 7 1 NSP ACTIVITIES mt Events. The National Science Foundation held an October 28 conference at Case Western Reserve University on Production Research and Industrial Automation; part of Vhe NSF Research Applied to National Needs Program, the conference focused on technological improvement of productivity. NSF also has awarded a grant to John W. Hamblen, chairman of the University of Missouri Computer Science Department, to conduct an Inventory of Computer Acrivities and Related Ilegree Programs in U.S. Higher Education. Nnding Opprtunities. NSF is seeking proposals from U.S. institutions, for five day mgional conferences, on subjects of current research interest in the mathematical sciences. The Foundation has also reopened its annual competition for faculty fellbwships in Science Applied to Societal Problems; awards will be offered in all scientific fields, including computer science and mathematics, and applications (#) are due by February 6, 1976. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF CWRCE ON COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING Speaking at the recent Second International Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) Standards workshop in Washington, Dr. Betsy Ancker-Johnson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, described the potential of computer-aided manufacturing for increasing national productivity. In a speech reported by EDP Weekly, she stressed the opportunities related to the standardization of CAM Systems, pointing out that efficient applications will depend on standards in data base formats, computer languages and interfaces between system components. DATA COhMRJICATIONS ISSUES AT THE FCC Telenet and Tymshare. Telenet has filed a request with the FCC, seeking a ruling that meshare be required to operate as a regulated common carrier, alleging that meshare's policies do not conform with FCC rules on computer-based communication services. While both companies provide packet-switched network services, only Telenet has filed with the Commission as a common carrier. Regulation of such value-added networks is also an issue in the current FCC \"Resale. and Sharing Docket;\" this inquiry (X) is investigating whether non-regulated carriers which purchase cmication services at bulk discqunts (and subsequently resell or share them) should be treated as common carriers. Aetna joins cML satellite. IBM, Comsat General, and Aetna Life E Casualty have proposed ta the FCC a partnership arrangement in which each would become an equal owner in ML Satellite, a corporation being organized to provide satellite data comunications; the proposal corresponds to the \"balanced option\" for CML, approved by the FCC in an earlier ruling. The earlier FCC decision allowing an IBM-Comsat General joint venture remains the subject of litigation by three existing satellite carriers, Western Union, RCA Global Counnunications, and American Satellite.

AFIPS IN WASHINGTON MIPS BRIEFS DOMESTIC COUNCIL PRIVACY COMMITTEE DIRECTOR On October 3rd, representatives of AFIPS societies provided a briefing to Qulncy Rodgers, executive director of the White House Domestic Council Privacy Committee. The briefing to Rodgers was primarily in anticipation of a vice-presidential roundtable on Privacy and Information Policy. AFIPS participants were: Daniel McCracken (ACM), Charles Meadow (ASIS), Bill Moser (DPMA), and Bruce Peters (IEEE Computer Society). The objective of the briefing was to provide Rodgers an assessment, from the prospective of professionals in the information processing field, of issues related to Federal government information policy. Vice President Rockefeller, chairman of the Domestic Council Privacy Committee, 1s concerned with the development of a comprehensive policy which would view these Issues in a broad perspective, in contrast to the ad hoc fashion in which they are presently handled by the Federal government. COORDINATING AFIPS COWITTEES AND WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES Since several existing MIPS committees address areas of continuing interest in Washington, an effort is undexway to closely coordinate such committees with the activities of the AFIPS Washington Office and to make the facilities of the office available in connection with relevant committee work. AFIPS committees initially identified for close liaison include those on Privacy, EFTS and Statistics. AFIPS NASHINGTON ACTIVITIES CWIITEE MEETS IN WASHINGTON An MIPS Washington Activities Committee meeting was held In Washington on October 8, attended by MIPS Presiden Tony Ralston and Executive Director Robert Rector. In additian to conducting its regular review and assessment of Washington Office activities, the Connnittee resolved to pursue specific projects with the Federal Communications Commission [FCC) and the Institute for Computer Sciences and Tcch-nology (ICST) at the National Bureau of Standards; both of these projects are presently in an exploratory phase. The objective of the FCC project is a major briefing to the Commission, assessing the impact of developments ~n computer coi!ninmications on FCC regulation and the ICST project is oriented toward an assessment of the scope, character and impact of computer scienc~ as a discipline. N6W WASHINGTON- RGPORT POLICIES At its recent meeting, the Washington Activities Committee established three major policies for the AFIPS Washington Report: Subscriptions to the Washington Report shall be, for the present, available upon request. While the publication is viewed primarily as a member service to MIPS societies, it is available to non-AFIPS groups and individuals as well. Ib is anticipated that subscription charges will be imposed at a future date, with approprlate differentials for AFIPS societies and society members. Key documents discussed or cited in the Washlnyton Report will be, made available through the Washington Office upon request, whcre feasible; availability will be indicated by a \"(#)'I","symbol in the text of the Washington Report. In appropriate instances, the Washington Report will solicit comments and provide a form for discussion of particular events or programs in the Federal government. In addition to the foregoing services, AFIPS societies can, of course, contact the Washington Office for assistance in connecti~n with any matters discussed in the Washington Report; it is indeed hoped that arhicles will precipitate both .inquiries and comment. ZSPUWS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING A joint effort by AFIPS Executive Director Robert Rector and the AFLPS Washington Office has resulted in tentative plans for a February 5, 1976 White House briefing to senior officials of the AFIPS societies. AFIPS will be brieted by various executive agency spokesmen in areas of particular interest to the ~nfonation processing field; prospective topics include research and development, technglogy transfer, EFTS, computer communications, privacy, Federal usage of computers: and standards. In addition. AFIPS may undertake to brief ?he Administration on issues as viewed by professionals in infonnation processing. Comments on proposed topics are solicited from the AFIPS socleties, AFIPS societies have permission ta use material in the AFIPS Wasl~ington Report fo~ their own publications, except chat where an article title appears with an \" * 'I clearance must first be obtained from the AFIPS Washington Office.

DC 20037 202-296 0580 Vol. I, No. 5, December, 1975 WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS FCC APPROVES DIRECT INTERCONNECTION OF TERMINAL EQUIPMENT The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that users may directly connect terminal equipment to the telephone network without the use of carrier-supplied connecting arrangements, provided they comply with FCC requirements. The ruling (#) is to become effective April 1, 1976. Impact of the decision. The ruling will permit users to connect computer terminal equipment to the network without the necessity of either a modem supplied by the common carrier (generally ATFjT) or a telephone company data access arrangement (DAA); the DM had previously been required if a Bell modem were not used. While circuitry similar to the DAA will still have to be incorporated in customer-supplied equipment, it is expected to be considerably less expensive to users than present AT&T lease charges. Xistory. The FCC ruling requiring the use of telephone company connecting arrangements for user-supplied terminals has been the subject of controversey ever since its implement?tioh after the Carterfone decision (which allowed the connection of custo,mer-provided equipment) in 1968. The common carriers have argued that such arrhghents are necessary to protect the network against potential hams, such as those identified by a 1970 National Academy of Sciences study: hazardous valtages, excessive signal power levels, excessive longitudinal imbalance, and imp,roper network control signaling. Opponents maintain, however, that the telephone cmpanies have insisted on carrier-supplied access arrangements to protect their own revenues. Registration program. The FCC will allow interconnection only if it is done through either protective circuitry registered with the FCC, or directly through equipment which is itself registered. The Commission has also required that carrier-supplied terminal equipnient be registered (a requirement not generally imposed on comon carriers) in order to enhance network protection, insure competitive equality (between carriers and non-carriers) in the manufacture of such equipment, and to prov'i'de a \"benchmark\" against which to judge non-carrier applications. Possible appeal. ATBT is expected to appeal the FCC ruling, which may delay its effective date. Further, the ruling applies only to the technical aspects of intercomection; a separate proceeding (Docket 20003) is underway to examine the potential economic harm from competition in this area. A reversal of the technical ruling would appear unlikely on economic grounds, since data communications devices account for only the small portion of ATET revenues. 7 5 OTP REPORT ON SOCIAL ISSUES IN EPTS The White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTY) has relensed a study on the non-economic implications of EFTS, entitled \"Value Choices in Electronic Funds Trnnsfer Policy.\" In transmitting the study to the Vice President, OTP Acting Director John Eger said \"both because of our particular mandate to evolve policy relating to the intorconncction of contputers with teleconununications, an intcrconncction which is tlie necessary foundation of any EFT system, and because of our concern for i,.formed and cffcctive formnulution of policy in the executive brdnch, DTP has begun to scrutinize closely the increasing range of Fedcral governmcnt activity in this area."]},{"title":". . .","paragraphs":["While mnny of the aost significant economic questions have becn rarscd, critical non-ecunomic issues have not bccn addressed-such as the desirability of unrcttered govcfnltrent acccss to pcrsonnl records either as a user or an operator of alty EFT system.\" A prim:~ry signific:lnce of the rcport is thc indication that OTP is squarely concc~ncd irith the social in~p:ict of EFTS.

Both Ralston and Smet urged Handler to consider organizational changes which would recognize computer science as .I separate discipline within the National Research Council [NRC -- the NAS and the National Academy of Erlgineering), arguing that this recognition has already occurred within major universities and throughout most of the academic commun~ty. History. There have been a number of activities within the NRC in the last ten years which relate to computer science and engineering, most recently the Computer Science and Engineering Board (CSEB). The CSEB was in existence from 1968 to 1972, chartered to assess the implications of information performing technology with regard to the public and private sectors of the United States. The National RE-search Council generally operates by performing studies under contract to various Federal groups, and occasionally undertakes similar studies on its own initiative; there have been no studies primarily related to information processingsince the termination of the CSEB. While the Academies have approximately n dozen computer scientists and engineers as members, the computer science discipline has not been organizationally recognized outside of existing groups in mathematics and engineering. Meeting agenda. At its recent first meeting, the Computer Science Planning Group undertook a general discussion of areas which would be candidates for NRC attention, including (1) the impact of computers on soclety, (2) computer engineering, (3) computer science, and (4) the commercial impact of computer technology. Re-ports will be produced in these areas by early 1976. Outlook for a permanent group While there is apparently no consensus in the Group on how to proceed, it appears highly likely that a recommendation will be forthcoming to set up a permanent computer science group within the NRC; the principal unresolved questions relate to the structure of such a group. There are presently three other groups proceeding in parallel with the AMPS group, each of which will ultimately produce a report recommending NRC activities in this field, these are the Assembly of Engineering, the Assembly of Behavorial and Social Sciences, and the Connnission on Sociutczhniciil Systems.

The scrvico is cl;~imcd to provide high quality and reliability, primarily by simultnneous transmission of data by undersca cable and satellite. Thc FCC approval is for one year of operation, within whicli IDDS must submit an analysis af its service.

Thc proposed scrvice, to be known as Corn-Pak, is a packet-switched system which woul'd be cap.lble of servicing incompatible computers and computer terminals. The network would initially serve 13 cities by 1977, eventually expnnding to 24 cities. Like other value-added carriers (e.g., Telenet) Com-Pak would rely on circuits leased frum common carriers. While computer-related transmissions on the network will generally be immeditite, a delayed-transmission service (at a lawer price) will also be available to customers for'applications such as word processing.

ITT World Comunications has bpposed the FCC authori:ation of IDDS, arguing that the FCC should conduct a techaicill inquiry on optimum methods for international digitnl data services, before g~xnting the IDDS application. On a separate topic, Western Union and other carriers have petitioned the United States Court of Appeals in Washington to reverse FCC approval of the proposed CML data communications satellite venture (Washington Report, 11/75), asserting that it would have monopolistic effect (such as dividing the market for satellite data communications between ATET and CMI,). The petitioning firms feel the monopoly condi-tions which might exist subsequent to CML entry into the market could not be reversed by antitrust regulation or litigation.

There is little disphte regarding the actual functions of the device; the argument is focused primarily on whether such functions should be characterized as data communications or data processing The fundamental issues, however, are (1) whether the data services embodied in the Dataspeed 40 should be subject to government regulation, and (2) whether a government-regulated monopoly (ATBT) should be allowed td manufacture such terminals and thus compete with the private enterprise computer industry. The Dataspeed 40 is a 1920 character CRT terminal and standard teletypewriter keyboard, with optional features for functions such as printing and editing.

The brienng was presented by Executive Branch spokesmen from the White House as well as from the various Federal agencies cognizant of the subject areas addressed, and was arranged through the White House OfEce of Public Liaison. The specific topics briefed,were selected on the basis of an advance poll taken of the AFIPS attendees. The material presented at the briefing, because of its general interest to AFIPS beyond the audience which could be accomodated in the Yihite House Family Theater, is described at length below. OFFICE OF TELECOWNICATIONS POLICY. John Eger, Acting Director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), began the briefing by describing the mandate of his office to formulate policy on the relationship between the Government and private sectors in telecommunications. Characterizing the Federal government as a primary telecommunications user (a $50 miIlion capital investment, with annual expenditures of $10 - $15 billion), Eger raised two fundamental question:. First, when should the Federal government provide its own computer communications, and when should it rely on the private sector? While the Federal government must be careful not to overburden existing common carriers, he said, it should leave as much as possible to the private sector and not become a competitor with it. Second, what is the proper role of the Federal government in regulation of computer conununications? OTP has generally been an advocate of minimal government regulation (Washington Report, 8/75), ahd is presently developing this policy in three areas: data communications, EFTS, and privqcy. Eger described OTP's systematic review of regulatory legislation, and their efforts to eliminate govement regulation where possible. Roland Homet, Chief of the Studies and Analysis Section af OTP, reviewed the OTP analysis of computer communications regulatory questions now before the Federal Communications Colmission (FCC). Homet noted the earlier FCC \"Computer Inquiry\" which distinquished between data communications and data processing, ruling that the FCC would regulate the former but not the latter; he further noted that the same fundamental distinction is now at issue in both the controversey between Telenet and p-mshare (Washington Report, 11/75), and the &aspeed 40 tariff now pending before the FCC (Washington Report, 2/76). He went on, however, to artirulate the critical issue underlying these controversies: should the provision of these services and goods, however they are characterized, be,subject to government regulation at all? While it is, true that the data communications and data processing technologies are becoming increasingly integrated, the most crucial question is whether the markets they address display the \"natural monopoly\" conditiqns which have traditionally been the justification for Federal economic regulation. aTP has formally taken the position that both the sbrvices of value-added carriers (e.g., Telenet), and the manufacture of tenninal equipment (e.g., the Dataspeed 40) should be deregulated. Charles Joyce (now OTP Special Assistant for National Security Activities and formerly Assistant Director for Government Conununications) discussed issucs relating to the Federal government as a user of computer communications. raising two primary is? ~cs. First, as the Government continues to develop networks fcr what have tradition 11ly been viewed as government services (e.g., networks for biomedical communic;~Lions, or scientific and technical information services), when docs the Government cease providing a legitimate Federal service and begin to infringe on services .ihich should be provided by the private sector? Second, how Is the Pcdera1 government to treat privacy and security in its computer comm~~chtions systems? Joyce described the primary policy factors to be balanced as the need for privacy and security in computer networks, and the competing pressure for the cfficicnces to be achieved in nctworki~ig and resource sharing. Ife cite3 security tcch-nology as a pdssible solution, but onewhich requires a substantial technical basis. Joyce called for assistance on this question from societies such as AFIPS, to suppacmont the expcrtisc OTP prcscntly draws from its own staff as voll as that of the Wllitc llouse Office of hlan;~gmment and Budget, the Nationol Bureau of St;u~Jnrds and the Cencra'l Serviccs Administration. Tom Keller, OTP General Counsel, addressed OTP activities related to the area of privacy. In addition to describing the general Federal interest in this area (e.g., the Privacy and EFTS Commissions) he pointed out the VIP studies on current legal protections related to individual policy (by Prof. Grecnaxalt of Columbia University Law School) and on the social implications of EFTS (by Prof. Rule of SUNY). kellcr indicated that OTP is undertaking a follow-up study on the threats to privacy which may bc posed by a comprehensive EFT system. O'rP is particularly concerned about information collected by the Federal government, in that such information can (in distinction to the private sector) be compelled by legal process Kcller emphasized the OTP position that private sector costs for enforcement of privacy legislation such as H.R. 1984, and private sector alternatives to Federal government privacy protections, should be fully examined before any related Federal action is taken; ho specifically called for any empirical data which may be provided by AFIPS on the compliance costs of Federal privacy legislation. In closing, Mr. Bger extcidcd an invitation for AI:IPS to continue an opcn dialogue with OT9, on questions of comnputer communications. 'me future of computer co~a~unications, he said, will dcpund I~cnvily on actions tokc11 by the Pedcml govcriimcnt, ;inJ thcso actions will in turn depend on the q~rillity and impact of this dialo~ue. TBCWOGY TRRNSFER IN INFORITION PROCESSING. Arthur Downey, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East-West Trade, began his remarks with a dcscriptioii of the co~nplcx F~deral regulatory structure, relating to the export of computer technology. This structure is basically tripartite, with the State Department playing a role under the blutual Security Act of 1954, the Commerce Department playing the largest role (in terms of implementation]. under the Export Administration Act of 1969, and the Defense Department playing a major policy role as required by the same 1969 statute [the Pentagon has virtually a veto power over exports relnted to national security]. In addition, the Trade Act of 1975 has created an oversight board for monitoring the flow of technology to socialist countries, to be known as the East-Nest Foreign Trade Board. Downey described \"national security\" controls as having the heaviest impact on the export &advanced technology to socialist countries, while adding that \"foreign policy\" controls may also play a role in the export of technology to specific countries (e.g., Angola). While there are several working levels of control, the highest is at the cabinet level in the Export Administration Review bard, which is comprised of the Secretaries of State and Defense, who will soon be joined by the Secretary of the Treasury as well. aile most products are exported under a \"general license\" (which must be obtained only once'.lior a category of products), high technology products such as computers move under \"special licenses,\" which must be obtained for each specific ship-ment. While not defining the terms specifically, Downey said that \"scientific and educational technologyt1 is allowed to transfer ,freely to all countries. \"Industrial data\" is generally allowed to move to the non-co~mnunist \"free world\" on the theory that the U.S. is advantaged by this flow of technology to our allies; the same technology however, when exported to communist countries, is very tightly controlled. In granting special licenses, several factors ara considered: (1) thc strategic or military impact of the product, (2) the end user, (3) the end use (and whether the computer system at issue is appropriately scaled to this use), and (4) the risk of diversion of the export to other users. The U.S. cooperates in this program of export control with its 13 NATO allies and Japan in a group called the Coordinating Committee (COCOM), which maintains an International Commodity List of items which are banned from export to social t countries. In particularly difficult or disputed applications for computer export licenses, the Commerce Department will establish a task force with other qgencies to examine critical factors; they often draw upon the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology at the National Bureau of Standards, which Dswney described as a \"highly respected, talented group.\" In addition, the Department has organized several technical advisory cmittees in areas such as computers and computer peripherals, to assist it in arriving at the U.S. position on export controls in the national and international contexts. Downey noted as particularly difficult problems (1) assessing the risks in allowing export of training and software associated with computer sales, and (2) assessing the appropriateness of systems for particular applications. While describing the present system as a workable one, Downey acknowledged the competing pressures from industry to relax export controls to a more \"realistic\" level, and from Congress, which is generally not sympathetic to decontrol of high technology exports. RESEARCH AND DEVEWPMENT IN INFORMATION PROCESSING. The research and development (RED) area was addressed in preseqtations from the two largest funding organizations of computer R&D in the Federal government, the National Science Foundation (NSF) which has a proposed budget of $15.8 million in fiscal year 1977 (FY 77) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which has a proposed FY 77 budget 6f $37.7 million.

While the Commission agreed that its primary concern would be \"the broad public policy issues of EFTS\" (in contrast to technical issues) the majority of the meeting was devoted to organizational matters. The most substantive aspect of the meeting was a discussion of the proposed amendments to Federal Reserve Regulation J, which would define the duties and liabilities of participants in the Federal Reserve's wire transfer and automated payment services, and the proposed rules for access to the Federal Reserve's electronic clearing, settlement and delivery services (automrlted clearinghouses). Both the Regulation J amendments and the interim guidelines for access [XI are subject to public comment until March 19. The Comission debated whether it should devote its resources to such interim comments on immediate issues, or whether it should work primarily toward a comprehensive report; agreement could not be reached and the matter was postponed for further discussion at the next Commission meeting (scheduled for March 12).
