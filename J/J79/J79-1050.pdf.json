The objcctivc of the scheme is to facilitate recognition and employment of synonyms and stock phrases by programs which process natural la,nguage. Besides presenting the proposed organization, the paper characterizes thc lexical \"senses\" which result. 1. Introduction. - This paper describes an internal lexical organization which is particularly designed to capture the facts about synonymy. Besides recording the inclusion of each word in one or more synonym sets (identified with its various \"senses\"), the scheme attempts to distribute attributes per~picuously between \"senses\", \"wordings\", and the intersections of the two. In addition, there is provision to record multi-word idioms, stock phrases, and the like. and to include these as elements in synonym sets when appropriate. Briefly, \"senses\" are represented in their own right, along with \"words\" and \"phrases\", by distinct data items. Each word or phrase is associated with a list of the \"senses\" which it can express; conversely, each \"sense\" is associated with a list of \"alternative wo iings\" Additionally. each word is associated with a list of phrases in which it occurs. Grammatical category, features, selection restrictions, and the like are applicable at three different levels: to words or phrases as such, to \"senscs\" as such, or to particular usages of words or phrases (equivalently, to particular wordings of \"senses\").

The balance of this paper conies in two sections: Section 2 presents the proposed lexical data structures, and suggests haw they arc to be used.

From the standpoint of the word or phrase, it; represents a particular scnse; from the standpoint of the sense, it represents a particular wordink Starting from a KDI or PDI, one gets to the SDI for a particular sense by advancing along the \"alternative senses\" ring to the relevant SLE, then &touring along the ring which connects th~ latter to the SDI (as one of the SDI's \"alternative wordings\").

Since each \"alternative senses\" ring contains exactly one KDI or PDI, while each \"alternative wording#' ring contains exactly one SDI, each SLE is tied to exactly one sense of one word or phrase.

The attributes which may be recorded in each, however, come from different bags. To begin with, the attributes found in an SDI characterize a11 the wordings of a given sense whenever the wording-, are used in that sense.

An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses senses of \"alter\"","Fig. 2 \"Alternative Senses\" and \"Alternative Wordings\" Rings (The first sense has two wordings: \"alter\" and \"change\". The second sense has wordings \"change\" and \"small coin\". Two senses are recorded for \"change\", and one sense each for \"alter'.' and \"small coin\".) A different sort of attribute may be recorded in a KDI, as a global feature of the word itself. For example, we may note of the word \"change\" that it is \"regularly conjugated\". That is, when used An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 8 as a verb, it forms the third person singular by adding \"s\", and both past ~nd past participle by adding \"ed\" To be sure, this \"global\" attribute applies only to the \"verb\" senses of \"change\"; but a moment's reflection will confirm that \"change\" has more than one \"verb\" sense, and the regularity of its conjugation is common to all of them. Thus, it is useful to note this regularity as an attribute of the word itself. (Contrast this with the behavior of the word \"can\", which is regular whn it means \"to pack in cans\", but irregular when it means \"is able to\".) Various other attributes suggest themselves as global characterizers of the words thcn~selvcs, to bc recarded in the KDI's. For example, one might wish to note of \"change\" that it drops its final \"e\" whon adding \"ing\" (this is the normal rule) but of \"singe\" that it doesn't. Still other attributes are appropriate when characterizing multi-word units (in PDl's). A string of words whose meaning is not evident from the nlere juxtaposition of its constittlents (such as \"givc up\") may be classified as an \"idiom\", A string of words whose meaning could be figured out from the meanings of its constituents, but which occurs with enough frequency to warrant inclusion in the dictionary, might be classed as a \"stock phrase\". (Example: \"drop dead\".) A string like \"perform in a subordinate role\", which one would not normally expect to encounter in its own right, might be classed as a \"definition\" (for a certain sense of the word \"accompany\", difficult to reword except with a definition). Perhaps the most unexpected site for recording attributes is in the connective elements (SLE's). These are the logical place, though, to note features that apply to a specific sense of a word, without being global to either the sense or the word. Consider the following four senrenccs: On the way to the office, he stopped daydreaming. On the way to the office, he ceased daydreaming. On the way to the office, he ceased to daydream. versus: On thebway to the office, he stopped to daydream. Suppose we choose to view this as a restriction upon the (surface) object of the verb: \"stop\", when applied to an action, must take a gerund as its object; \"cease\" can take either a gerund or an infinitive. (It wouldn't affect the point being made if we said that \"stop\" inhibits a certain grammatical transformation en route to surface structure, while \"cease\" pennits it.) An Organization tur a Dictionary of Word Senses 9 Now, we wouldn't want to mark \"gerund object only\" as a global. attribute of the sense, for we have just shown that \"cease\" and \"stop\", two wordings of the sense, differ with respect to this restriction. On the other hand, it doesn't belong among the global attributes of the word \"stop\" as such, for \"stop\" has other verb senses, even transitive ones, tu which the restriction is completely inapplicable. (Consider \"stop a hole in the dike\", \"stop a catastrophe\", etc.) That leaves the alternative we are suggesting: treat the restriction as an attribute of one particular usage of thc word (equivalently, one particular wording of the sense).","Fig. 3 \"Phrase Involvement\" Rings (1) \"play\" (Where numbers are shown on connecting links, they indicate the position of the word in the phrase which is linked to.) 1 KDl i"]},{"title":"1,","paragraphs":["\"play down\" 1 PDI"]},{"title":"1.

Fig. 3 shows the plan of attack. I'n the KDI for each word, there is a link connecting it to the PDI for the first phrase in which the word is known to occur, together with a number designating the position of the word (Ist, Znd, 3rd. etc.) in that phrase. In the PDI itself, there is a coiltinuation link for each word of the phrase, together with its niiri~ber in the next phrase. In the final PDI involving a given word, the link for that word points back to the KDI. Thus, independent of its \"altcrnative senses\" ring, each KDI tnay hmc r~ \"phrase invol\\~cit~ents\" ring. This structure makes it possible to retrieve all the idioms, stock phrases, definitions, etc., in which a given word has made its appearance, anywhere in the dictionary. As the same structure is used to encode every multi-word unit, no occurrence of a word is ever lost sight of, and r~ phrase can be looked up via any of its constituent words. Of the fields to which Fig. 1 calls attention, we have discussed all but one. In the SDI for each \"sense\", tbpre is a \"sense chain\" link field. This links the SDI to its successor in a global chain of \"senses\". Using this chain, it is possible to make an exhaustive, non-duplicative list of all the \"senses\" recorded in the dictionary. The listing program has only to proceed down the chain, retrieve frdm each SDI its attributes, decode them, then chase around the \"alternative wordings' ring of the SDI and list the wordings alongside the attributes. One more feature of the internal representation deserves mention: the data items for words occur as \"leaves\" in a lexical tree (Fig. 4). That is, the KDI for a word can be looked up letter-by-letter, following a chain of pointers that correspond to successive letters. The chain ends at a KDI after following a substring sufficient to distinguish the word fro111 the nearest thing like it in thc dictionary. The lexical tree has the advantage that words can be looked up either at random or in sequence. Recapitulating, these are the essential features of the representation: *1) \"Senses\" are represented separately from \"wordings\", and the mutual connections between them are made explicit in both directions. *2) \"Wordings\" may be either single words or multi-word pnrases. I hese are representea by distinct types of data item, and may be subject to distinct schemes of classification. but they are on the same footing with regard to \"sense\" connections.

Alternative implementations of individtlal points (though not of the scheme as a whole) have in fact been described by other writers.

F. Simnlons ([Ill, [12]) and by Larry R. Harris (31. This way of looking at matters led Harris to remark some of the same points that we have been stressing: that senses have alternative wordings just as words have alternative senses; that multi-word phrases might occur on the same footing as individual words in the expression of a sense; and (interestingly enough) that part-of-speech information really adheres to the \"sense\", not to the \"word\" Similarly, Simmons associates his \"deep case\" information with lexical nodes representing \"wordsenscs\",, while words the~nselves are treated as \"print image\" attributes of the wordsenses. Harris's dictionary was only a minor component in a small-scale model of concept acquisition. No great number of either words or concepts was required to illustrate the principles at stake, so Harris programmed the dictionary as an array, with words represented by rows and \"concepts\" by columns. Elements of the array were merely frequencies, indicating the strength of association between each word and each concept. Needless to say, for a full-scale vocabulary of words and concepts, such an array is mostly empty; nobody would dream of expanding it in that form. From a programming standpoint, the only thinkable choice is some form of list structure. Having decided in principle to use \"some form of list structure\", though, one might well ask: Why chains? Why rings? Why not just include in each Key Data Item a full list of pointers to the corresponding Sense Data Items. and vice-versa? The answer is simply one of convenience. It's easier to handle insertions and deletions when they don't require the movement of expanded items to new quarters, or the provision of \"overflow\" pointers. It's easier to reclaim freed storage when deleted items come in a handful of standard An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 13 sizes. As for \"rings\", they eliminate the need for two-way pointers, since one can break into a ring at any point and follow it to its source. It should be noted that to make rings an attractive representation, the details of the material being represented must cooperate, In particular, the rings must not become too long, or the processing requlred to follow them becomes excessive. It happens that \"alternative senses\" rings and \"alternative wordings\" rings are typically short rarely more than a dozen links per ring. \"Phrase involvement\" rings, on the other hand, can become spectacularly long, especially for words like \"a*' and \"to\". In practice, it's necessary to provide these rings with short-cut links.

In doubtful cases, when words are grouped somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add markings some clay that will prevent misuse of the equivalence. When words are separated somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add a mechanism some day that will recognize their relatedness. In the end, too, one assigns internal structure to the equivalence sets. That's the effect of assigning local attributes to the alternative wordings (\"animate subject\", \"object a vehicle\", etc.): constraints are imposed upon the interchangeability of the wordings. More radical structuring can be accomplished if, for example, one notes \"government\" as an alternative wording of the sense \"govern, rule, control\", with the attribute \"nominalization\". A trenchant discussion of such difficulties may be found in Kelly and Stone [4]. There the emphasis is upon disambiguation: given a word in a passage of text, they seek to identify (by selection from a fixed list of possibilities) the sense in which it is used. Building a computerized An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses dictionary for the purpose, they soon became concerned with the arbitariness and the proliferation of target \"senses\", as taken from standard desk dictionaries. They argue, with persuasive examples, that what lexicographers conventionally distinguish as separate senses of a word are often just applications of the word's underlying concept to different contexts. To cover the various contexts, the underlying concept has to be stretched a little, by a process of metaphoric extension. This metaphoric process is beyond our present power to computerize, but for 'the long run looks indispensable for successful language processing. Meanwhile, the authors advocate a dictionary which records for each word as few discrete senses as practicable, combining into one scnsc all the usages which can reasonably be united by a common underlying thougl~t. It is interesting to re-examine Kelly and Stone's argument with a diffcrent task in n~inii: not tile disambiguation of one word, but the recognition of synonymy between two words. A n~etaphorical capability would be as useful for the one task as for the other, but in the case of synonynl rccognition, some of the considerations which have guided traditional lexicography remain pertinent. In particular, it is necessary to ask not merely whether the concepts overlap, but whether the one word may in fact be used in place of the other. As noted before, usage is restricted by conventional domaitls of application; for example, an \"alteration\" is conceptually both a \"change\" and a \"modification\", but one wouldn't call it a change or a modification when painting a sign for a tailor's shap. The arbitrariness of the equivalence sets is not all that disqualilies then1 as \"conceptual primitives\". There is a much deeper difficulty in the fact that practically all \"senses\" can be paraphrased in terms of other \"senses\". Take, for example, the intransitive sense of \"change\" (as in \"My, but you've changed!\"). Surely, one would suppose, the concept of \"change\" must be primitive? Change of state is what well-nigh a third of all verbs are about. But if \"change\" is a \"primitive\", it's a peculiar sort of \"primitive\", for it can be paraphrased in a variety of ways: (change, become different, cease to be the same, assume new characteristics, make a transition into a new state) Note that the multi-word paraphrasals are not idioms; the individual words contribute their usual meaqings to concatenated meanings which express the concept \"change\". An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 18 But perhaps we were merely unlucky? Perhaps we chanced upon a concept which looked elemental but actually turned out to be complex. Maybe the real primitives are \"become\", \"be\", \"cease\", \"different\", \"same\", etc. Let's dig into that possibility. What does it mean to \"become X\", where X is an adjective? The meaning can bc \\~ario\\isly expressed: (become X, come to bq X, get to be X, get X, turn X, grow X, assume thc charrtctcris-tic X) That's a discouraging number of ways for a \"primitive\" to be re-expressible"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["though if we choose to regard \"come to be\" and \"get to be\" as idiomatic concatcnr\\tions of words, only onc of the alternatives makes use of other concepts to explain the one at hand. As for \"different\", it implies a whole underlying anecdote about sortlebody making a contparisoi~, after first making a judgment about relevant things to compare. In the combination of the two concepts -- \"become different\" --, we furthermore drop mention of the objects being compared. It's simply understood that they are certain attributes of the subject at two points in time. It is tempting to invent ad-hoc \"transformational\" explanations for these phenomena. One might conjecture, for example, tliat \"The man changed.\" is a surface realization of four underlying sentences: (Man be X at time m. Man be Y at time n. X not equal Y, Time n greater-than time n~.) Thetrouble with explanations of this sort -- apart from the fact that they introduce growing complexity into the understanding of straightforward utterances -- is that they assign arbitrary primacy to some concepts at the expense of others. Why should \"time n greater-than time m\" be an assumed primitive? May we not equally well conjecture that \"time n greater-than time m\" is a surface realization of these?: (Time be m. Time change. Then time be n.) For that matter, why not view An Organization for a Dictibnary of Word Senses \"Time elapsed. \" as a surface form of this?: \"At least one thing in the universe changed.\" After all, what is \"time\" but a nominalized way of talking about the presence and partitioning of change? The difficulty, it would seem, lies in the very notion of context-independent \"conceptual primitives\". The metaphor itself is at fault: it calls to mind a fixed set of dements, like thosc of which matter is composed, out of which all ideus must be compounded. But where concepts arc concerned, primitivity is a matter of focus, Shift the perspective a little, and new elenlcnts swim into view as fundamentals, while former simples become con~plex. A more promising metaphor is the analogy to a 'vector space. A set of basis vectors is, in a way, a set of \"primitives\" out of which all the entities in the space can be composed. These primitives have the appealing property that they are only primitive relative to one frame of reference. Rotatc your point of view, and what used to come natural as basis vectors are now at an angle; they become easier to express as sums of vectors that lie along new axes. That bears a resemblance to what we have seen,in tlhe case of lexical \"primitives\". Thus far and no further may the analogy be pushed, however. The elements which span \"conceptual space\" can be no such uniform set of objects as those in a vettor space, while the rules of composition are coextensive with grammar"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["at a minimum. Composition of concepts itself contributes to the meaning. (For that matter, it is arguable whether concepts are sufficiently separable to model them as discrete objects at all"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["whether simple or composite.) Moreover as \"conceptual space\" must encompass all things thinkable, the rules of composition must themselves be part of the space. That is, the operators as much as the things operated upon lie within the space to be spanned. A seming counterexample to these remarks may be found in the \"primitive ACT's\" of conceptual dependency theory, as propounded by Schank, Goldman, Rieger, and Riesbeck (121, [7], [8], [9]). On a close reading, however, the \"primitive ACT's\" turn out to be verb paradigms"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["powerful, semantically motivated generalizations about large classes of verbs.

The An manbation f~r a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 0 effect is to provide strong guidelines for the inference of unstated information, for the comparison of related utterances, for paraphrasal, etc. TO represent a particular verb in terms of these ACT's, however, it is necessary to augment each ACT with various substructures which detail the manner, the means, the type of actor or object, etc. No reduced set of representatives is as yet offered for the adverbs, nouns, adjectives, etc. in terms of which the \"primitive ACT's\" are qualified. If such additional condcnsntion werc attempted, the elaboration of a given utterance in terms of the full set of \"primitives\" might well ramify without practical end. In other words, reduction of the set of names L'or nodes (and labels for arcs) must be purchased at the expense of extending the number of them required to represent each utterance, In conceptual dependency representation, just as in the sernantic networks\" of Quillinn [6], Simmons ([I I], [12]), Slocum, and others, reality ultimately appears as a shimmering web, every part of which trembles when any part of it is touched upon.

In terms of that theory, they come closest to the so-called \"CONCEXICON entries\" used by Goldman in realizing surface expressions 'of a concept from its conceptual representation [2]. Given a primitive ACT, Goldman narrows it down to a particular \"CONCEXICON\" entry by applying the tests in a discrin~ination tree to the rest of the structure in which the ACT appears. Our lexical \"senses\", therefore, are lcft with a humbled role. If they span anything, it might best be thought of as \"communication space\", not \"conceptual space\". Even in this light, they arc a hugely redundant basis, and a not at all unique one. They form no inventory of the experiences being communicated about; \"meaning\" is still a step removed, still evoked rather than embodied by the elements of this basis. If we persist in calling these things \"senses\", it is because that is the traditional term for what is brought to mind as the synonym sets of a given word are enumerated. The tie-in with meaning is tenuous, but the human user is able to supply it. There is at least this much justification for the term: synonym sets, more forcefully than words, direct attention to the points at which a tie-in must be made between the tokens of communication and the underlying representation of \"world knowledge\" An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 1 In a full-fledged system for processing natural language, then, we must envision the \"dictionary of senses\" as a component stretching vertically across the \"upper\" layers. Its \"sense data items\" must link, ifi some way, to the deeper-lying data structures which encode \"knowledge of the world\" (the \"pragmatic component\"). The \"key data items\" and \"phrase data items\" register tokens to be expected or employed in \"surfzrce\" utterances. Global and local attributes recorded in the various data items guide parsing and interpretation. Where one takes it froin there depends upon thc linguistic approach to be used.

Ncroth University of California, Berkeley Computers & Grapltics I:227-231, 1975 The experimental problem solving environrnen t is one of formulating specifying, debugging and executing (algebraic) procedures interactively on a small processor. The speech recognition system is a real time, syntax directed, limited vocabulary, highly cost effective scheme specifically tailored to this environment. The data transformation operations of the language are verbally specified and the control flow is specified graphically as a two-dimensional directed graph. The semantics of the latter structure is independent of the time sequence of its input. An input restricted (conditional input) pseudo-finite state machine model is used for the continuous syntax checking of the input on an atomic token basis and for directing the speech recognizer.

Fourier transform methods have been used to establish a correspondence between the quality of the reconstructed compressed speech waveforms and the subjective recognition of compressed speech. The result of two psychoacot~stic experiments indicate that 1) the interruption frequency should be equal to the pitch frequency of the voice waveform for optimum recognition of the compressed speech, and 2) smoothing of the discontinuities with electronic techniques significantly improves the recognition of the compressed speech. The optimum smoothing parameters, window width and characteristic function, are also obtained from this study.

Since growing environments can produce ponderously large subsets of network, environments are lin~ited by techniques involving transmittance to each node, the number of paths traversed which lead to each node, path length, and a frequency cut-off.

Thea middleground rules for the major mode involve two formalized lan_eus~es, S1, which has 11 inference rules (corresponding to Schenker's prolongation techniques), and S2. with 5 inference rules. S1 governs dilyneor compositions (a lyne being one musical voice) and has three primitive axioms, while S2 governs irilvnear conipositions and contains an axiom structure which relstes the systems S1 and S2. The decision procedure provides one proof for any given theorem (i.e composition) rather than all possible proofs.

The system described applies computers and computer graphics to teach the Chinese ideogram in a systematic, simple and effective manner. A set of LOGO procedures are defined which draw simple strokes and then these procedures are used as primitive commands to construct ideograms on a CRT. one stroke at a time. Five demonstration courseware lessons are discussed to illustrate the teaching methodology.
