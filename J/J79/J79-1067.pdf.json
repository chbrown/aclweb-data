The direct comprehension of these sentences fails to derive the main communicative~effcct. For example, declarative scntenccs can be used to seek information (\"1 nced to know your Social Security number.\"): questions can be u-scd to convey information (\"Did you know that John and Harriet got married?\") or to request an action (\"Could you pass the salt?''). These kinds of utterances, which have bccn extensively analyzed by philosophers of language (Austin, 1962: Searle, 196 9, 1975: Grice, 1975), are not handled satisfactorily by any of the current theories of the dircct comprchcnsion of language.

Clark & Lucy (1 975) formalized and tested this model, and found that people's rasponse times tend to support a three-stage model (deriving the literal mcaning, check its plausibility and, if implausible, dcriving the \"intended\" meaning\" from convcrsational rules).
