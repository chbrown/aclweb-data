Many problems in computational linguistics require the use of a stored dictionary easily accessible to a coqutw program.

In this context, relationship6 are established among three variables : the size of the covered set, the sire of the covering set, and the maximum defbition length. both, the size of the covering set and the maximum definition length should be small for economic considerations. But decreasing one will increase the other. It is therefore important to establish these relatibnships empirically. The knowledge, so gained will constitute a basis for opthizing the structure of a dictionary for specified size of the covered set and a specified machine.
