Rosenberg Department of Computer Science UniversFty of BritLsh Columbka Vancouver, B. C., Canada V6T 1WS Copyr-i ght 1975 by the Association for Computational Linguistics This paper describes a system for analysing natural language basea on the concept of case.

These routines search for parts of the syntactic structure which best satisfy the requirements of the verb case frames and under back-up are able to weaken gradually the conditions far success. The resultinq structure is similar to the conceptual dependency networks of Schank, and is an attempt to represent as fully as possible the meaning of the input sentence.
