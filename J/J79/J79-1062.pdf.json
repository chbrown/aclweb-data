I I . 48 1 General Discussion","paragraphs":["1.1 Consultative Production Systems A consultation proqram plays the mle of an expert consultant in some domain, ~ivin~ advice or answers to non-experts with ~roblems in the domain. Users will often want to know how the svstea arrived at its results durinq a particular consultation. This Daper explalns how the implementation of such a proqram as a ~rod~ction system can fac~lltate program-generated ex~lanations. A production system [2] consists of three basic components. a set of production rules, a data base which is both used and updated bv these rules, and a rule interpreter. A production rule often is in the form of a situation-action rule. it describes a situation and a set of actions to be taken if tbis situation is found to exist. The rule intermeter deternines the order In which rules will be tried, checks to see if the situations exist, and undertakes the required actions. It also determines how manv of the potentially useful rules wjll be used. only the flrst (where orderinq may be predetermined or comouted dynamically), all possible rules, or enough rules to satisfy some criterion that the interpreter uses. In some production systems, rules are always trled in a predetermined order. In others, the order in which rules are tried varies with different consultations, since a rule will be tried as soon as the rule interpreter determines that it may be useful. In such svsteas, the common alternatives are data-directed rule invocation, in which a rule is considered \"usefulff if its situation part matches the data base, and qoal-directed rule invocation, in which a rule is if its action part will help the system reach its current goal. Many systems use a combination of soal- and data-directed rule invocation. A consultative production system need not be a psycholoqical model, imitating a human s reasoning process. The imporbant point is that the System and a human expert use the same (or similar) knowledqe about the domain to arrive at the same answer to a given problem. The svstem's rules and data base can be viewed as a knowledge base containinq the domain-speclfic knowledge of an expert as well as facts about a particular broblem. When a rule is used, its actlons make changes to the data base which are the sy5tem's decisions or deductions. Thus, a rule can be thouqht of as a plece of judgmental knowledqe, using the judqment and knowledge of au expert to make deductions. The process of trying rules and taking actlons can be thouqht of as llreasonsngw, and explanations consist of showing how rules used information provided by the user to make various intermediate de~uctions and finally to arrive at the answer. If the information contained in these rules is sufficient to show why an action was taken (without aettinq into programming details), an explanation can conslst of printing each rule that was used (or an Engllsh equivalent of what the rule means,) EXPLANATION ' CAPABILITY PRODUCTION RULES","Judqmental Knowled~e","about domain","General Factual Knowledge of","domain Figure 1.

This discussion is not meant to define the vcorrectw way of representing or organizing knowledge, but rather to mention certain factors which should be taken into account when declding what representation or orqanization will be best for a given product Ion system. 1.4.1 Question Types The first step ~s to decide what basic types of questions the system should be able to answer. This will have a direct Influence on how the EC is im~lemented. It is important, however to make the rnitial desl~n flexible enough to accomodate possible future additions to the set of basics. If the basic forms are diverse enough, some level of natural-languaqe understanding may be necessary. The degree of sophlstlcation of the natural-languacze processor will depend won what kind of ~erformance is. expected of the EC 1.4.2 Organization of Knowledge The format and organigation of various components of the production system's knowledge base will affect the deslgn of an EC. Individual ~ieces of static and dynamic knowledge presumably will be organized m some fashion which makes them accessible during the consultation. A GOA facility could make use of such organization to help In finding the information needed bo answer a question. The less organized the knowledge base the more difficult wxlf, be the task of the EC, as more complicated routines must be used in order to find the desired ~nformation. During the cQurse of the consultation, the system should keep a record of its actlons for use by both Co~nponents of the explanation capability. Where the ordering of events is important (e.~;. when the action of one rule establishes the situation necessary for a subsequent rule to yuuceed), the record should be structured in a madner which reflects the ordering of events as well as the reasons whv each event occurred. 1.4.3 Knowledge of What Rules Mean The explanation capability will need to understand some of the semantics of indlvldual production rules. Thls requirement could be met by having the svstem's knowledge base include a description of what each Pule means, encoded in some form which would be of use to the EC. If the format of the system's rules is highly stylized and well-defined, however, it might be possible instead to implement a mechanism for 'Iread~ng\" the rules. the language in which the rules themselves are written could be defined. A high-level description of the individual components of this language, telling what each component means, could be used to enable the EC to read and understand rules. If the rule set consists of a large nuaber of rules, and these rules are composed entirely of a relatively small number of primitive elements, this second approach has the advantage that less information needs ts be stored"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["a description of each of the orimit~ve components, as opposed to a description of each rule. When new rules are added to the system, the first approach requires that descriptions of these rules must be added. With the second approach, provided that the new rules are made up of the standard rule components, no additional descriptite information would be needed by the explanation capabilitv. 1.4.4 Knowledge of the Rule Interpreter Enabling an EC to understand how t,he rule interpreter works is analoqous to enabling lt to understand rules It must be able to \"read\" the interpreter or else it must have access to some stored description of how the interpreter works. ?here is a thirkl approach for understandlnq the rule interpreter, one whlch would not be feasible for understand in,̂a larse number of rules.

Each of the specialists needs only a small amount of ~nfomation about the rule interpreter whlch could be built Into ~ts ltexplalnln~n procrea. 1.4.5 Other Domain-Independent Knowledge The final type of knowledge that some general quest~on-answering facilities wlll need is lnformatlon allowinq deductions to be vade froa facts In the knowledge base.

The tree indicates that this is CULTURE-2, Rather than being a sequential cycle throuqh the rule set, wher-e each rule is tried in some predetepmined order, the flow of control is qoal-directed. This means that only rules which conclllde about the current goal (to find out the value of a given parameter) are examined. The PREMISE of one of these rules may need to use some ~arameter whose value is unknown, This sets up a subgoal, namely to deterqine the value of this parameter so that the rule can be used.

The user will be asked about onLy those parameters Qhich way be relevant to the particular patient's case. 2.2 OrganizatYon of Knowledge in MYCXN In order to give explanations of a consultation system's decisions, an explanation capability must have access to the system's knowledge base. More informative emlanations can be given if the EC also has knowledae of how the syfitem works, a record of the consultation, and possibly some domain-independent knowledae. This section discusses how MYCIN meets these requirements. The system's knowledee base consf sts of static medical knowledge plus dynamic knowled3e about a specific consultation. Static knowledqe is further classified as factual and judgmental. Factual knowled~e consists of facts which are medically valid inde~endent of the ~ayticular case. Judgemental knowledge consists of product ion rules representing deduct ions which might be made, conditional an what is already known about the case.

A total of 60 such primitives make up the language in which rules &re written, This design facilitated the implementation of a mechanisp for translating rules into Enqliah (described in detail in 171). Each primitivs functions has a translation template with blanks to be filled in with translations of the function's arquments.

The answer to WHY at this pant is simply a display of the goals and the rules linkin8 them. We have given considerable attention to rnakin~ this as lucid a display as possible. First, since mwhvrf has several other interpretations, and no more extensive natural languase processinq is used in this component of MYCIN'S EC, the question is expanded to indicate the sense in which it will be answered. The higher goal is then presented, followed bv the rule. The clauses in the PREMISE of the rule are divided into those already esf.ablished and those yet to be determined. Finally, since rules may have multiple conelusions about different clinical parameters, the relevant conclusion is presented first and all others fbllow. As Fiaure 5 illustrates, further sections of the reasoning chain can be examined by repeating the WHY command.

The explanation sfatem was included in the system's original desiqn in order to make the consultation program's decisions acceptable, justifiable, and instructive. Since the question-answerina facility was not the primary focus of the research, it is not designed to be a sophisticated natural-lanquage understander. Rather, it uses crude techniqyes, relying strongly on the very specific vocabulary of the domain, to ll~nderstand~~ whst information is being requested. The analysis of a question is broken into three phases: the first creates a list of terminal or root words; the second determines what type of question is beinq asked (see the classification of questions"]},{"title":"in Section","paragraphs":["2.3); and the last determines what particular parameters, lists, etc. are relevant to the question. In the first and last steps, the system dictionary is important, The dictionary Contains approximately 1400 words that are commonly used in the domain of infectious disease. It ificludes all words that are acceptable values for a parameter, common synonyms of these words, and words used elsewhere by the system in describing the parameter (e.q., when translating a"]},{"title":"rule","paragraphs":["into English or requesting the value of the parameter). 2.4.1 Reducing the Question to Terminal Words Each word in the dictionary has a synonym pointer to its terminal"]},{"title":"word (terminal words","paragraphs":["point to themselbes). For the purpose of analyzing the question, a non-terminal word is considered to be equivalent to its ( terminal) aynonym. Terminal words may have properties indicating:","1) that this word is an acceptable value for some clinical parameter(s)","2) that this word always implicates a certain clinical parameter, system list, or table (e.g. the word \"identitvll always implicates the parameter IDENTITY, which means the identity of an organism)","3) that this word might Xmplicate a certain parameter, system list, or table (e.3. the word tlpositiven might implicate the parameter NUMPOS, which means the number of positive cultures in a series)","4) that this word is part of a phrase which can be thought of as a sinqle word (examples of such phrases are \"transtracheal aspirationw, Ithow longw, and llnot sterilev1.

Properties of' Terminal Words The first three properties are actually inverse pointers which are generated automatically from properties of -the clinical parameters, Specifically"]},{"title":",","paragraphs":["a word receives the \"acceptable valuew pointer to a paramster (property (1) above) ilp it appears in the parameter's list of acceptable values"]},{"title":"--","paragraphs":["a list which is used during the consultation to check the user's response to 3 request for the parameter's value.

These words are divided according to hoM sure we can be that a doctor is referring to this parameter list, or table when the articular word is used in a question. It is from this list that terminal words nimplicationn pointers (~Papertiea 2 and 3 in Table 1 ) are generated. During the first phase of parsing, each word in the original text is replaced by its terminal word. For words not found in the dictionary, the system uses Winograd's root-extraction aleorithm"]},{"title":"181","paragraphs":["to see if the word's lexical root is in the dictionary (ems., the root of tfdecisionw is \"deciden). If so, the word is replaced by the terminal word for its root. Words st111 unrewgnized aFter root extraction are left unchanqed. The resulting list of terminal and unrecognized words is then passed to a function which recognizes phrases. Usinq propertv 4 (see Table 1) of the terminal words in this list, the function identifies a phrase and replaces it with a single synonymous terminal word (whose dictionary properties may be important in determining the meaning of the question). 2.4.2 Classifying the Question The next step is to classify the question so that the proqram can tell which specialist should answer it. Since all auestions about the consultation must be about some specific context, the system requires that the"]},{"title":"name","paragraphs":["of the context (e.g., ORGANISM-1) be stated explicitly.

The system uses an empirical scoring mechanism for picking out only the most likely parameters.","Associated with certain parameters are words or patterns which must appear in the question in order for the parameter to be implicated. This scheme allows the system to distinguish related parameters which may be implicated by the same key words in the first pass. For example, the word nPMNvf implicates parameters CSFPOLY (the percent of PMNs in the CSF) and PMN (the percent of PMNs in the complete blood count).

The original case was brought against the FHLBB and a Cincinnati Home Loan Bank by the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO) and United Data Processing, Inc, In October, 1973. The remaining four Home Loan Banks joined the suit as intervenors in November, 1973.

A modified stay of the injunction has been obtained by the FHLBB pending the present appeal.

NEW CBCT REGULATIONS MAY SANCTION OPERATION OF ,NON-FEDERALLY REGUtATED EFTS TERMINALS Acting Comptroller of the Currency Robert Bloom last month announced new customer-bank comntunicat ions t erkninal (CBCT) regulations for national banks. The new regulations allow national banks to apply for permission to establish CBCTs as branches in states where state-chartered banRs are permitted to establish branches. Bloom's action follows the Supreme Court's refusal to consider consolidated petitions from two Chicago banks and the Comptroller of the Currency seeking review of Federal Appeals Court decisions which equate CBCTs with bank branches and forbid CBCTs in non-branching states (Washington R6pPt, 11/76]. The Comptroller has unsuccessfully argued in the courts that CBCTs are not branches, and are not forbidden in states which limit or disallow branching. The trade press suggests that the new regulations may sanction the operation of non-federally regulated EFTS terminals by retailers, shopping mall operatorsf owners of apartment complexes, or operators of transportation terminals. Thus, the effect of these regulations may be to extend the present list of EFTS ilprovidersff beyond financial institutions, i.e., to include what were formerly on13 EFTS users. The Comptroller's new regulations state that capitalization required for a CBCT branch may now be shared among the participants, thus lowering the cost of operating a CBCT, and presumably making CBCTs available to smaller banks with less capital (see Washington Report, 11/76). Also, in contrast to the $500 application fee for a traditional branch, the application fee for a CBCT branch is $200.

CCPA APPROVES PATENT FOR SOFTWARE PROGRAM SECOND TIME Some software programs are eligible for patents, according to the U.S. Court of? Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), which last November reversed %he U.S. Patent Office for the second time on the issue of software patentability.

In two previous cases, the Supreme Court (prior to the latest Chatf5eZd decision)has reversed the CCPA, deciding in favor of the Patent Office on limited grounds and not addressing the question of software patentability.

Moore, section head, Exxon Corp., Florham Park, New Jersey; and William E. Perry, director of EDP and Research, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Orlando, Florida. Credit Bureau President White wrote: \"Since one of CBI's primary obligations is to maintain the confidentiality of the informatibn in its data base, we would be opposed to any general prohibitions against the use of the Social Security Number in the private sector. While CBI does not use this number as a universal identifier or as a sole factor in the identification or authentication process, it is an aid in maintaining confidentiality in a small number of cases. Therefore, eliminating the use of the Social Security Number would have an adverse impact on our ability to serve the consumer and the credit granting community. Bxxon Section Head Moore wrote: he presence of the SSN in the record constitutes unique identification and restricting its use as a formal record identifier would serve no useful purpose,\" Ohio University Data Processing Director Dalzell said: \"I would question whether the individual's knowledge and consent should be s complete qualifier.
