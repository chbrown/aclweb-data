In contrast most artificial language processors operate in one direction only or requtre separate grammars for parsing and generation. This paper describes a model for human language processing which uses a single language description for parsing and generation. 1. Choice of Parsing Strategy A number of constraints limit the processors suitable as models of human language processing. Because short term memory is limited. the listener must absorb incoming words into larger chunks as the sentence is heard.

The case system distinguishes the immediate performer of an act from a remote cause or agent of the act.

In order tb understand the model of compounding whfch is being presented here, it is essential","paragraphs":["to consider the function of wmpounding in language. In my view, compounding is a process which allows a speaker to systematic8lly deLete information from an utterance just when the speaker has reason to expect that the hearer can reconstruct that information. In effect, I consider compounding (and a great many other linguistic procesbes) ro be examples of linguistic encoding which are used to speed up communication, and the grammar shared by the speaker and hearer must include the encodihg and decoding functions.","Consider the nominal compound steam distillation, which refers to the distillation of same substance with steam; the hearer of the compound steam distillation knows that distillation is the derived nominal form of distill. The hearep also knows what the common or characteristic cases of the verb distill are: the agent is invariably a person or machine (this would be the occupant of the Cause case slot in my system), the instrument (or Means) may be an apparatus or a heated medium such as steam and the Goal is a liquid which is missing some of the constituents that it entered the distillation process with. It happens that in English, whenever a, derived nominal of an act is the right element in a compound, then the left element is almbst always an occupant of one of the case slots of the verb. In order to recreate the underlying relative clause structure, it is only necessary for the hearer to properly choose the case for the nominal steam. A great deal of lexical information can be brought to bear on this question; for example, steam is not a liquid, is water vapor and thus cannot substance or the end product of a distillation process. Steam might be the Cause of the act of distillation except that there do not seem to be any compounds in English which have distillation as the right element and a Cause as the left element. Thus the hearer can assign steam to the Means case with some assurance."]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["In another example, shrimp boat, the hearer can ascertain by lexical relations involving the word boat, that boats are characteristically used to catch marine life.

There is a strong characteristic relation between the animal being caught and the means used to catch it, for example mink is trapped, calves are roped, birds are netted, and fish are caught with a boat.

In the case of the boat compounds, a boat will only be a shrimp boat if it is characteristically, usually, habitually or invarfably used to catch shrimp. So the operation of a compounding rule is enabled only if a characteristic aspect is associated with the verb; in English, this is usually indicated by an adverb or an adverbial phrase. If the speaker is willing to assert that a boat is characteristically used to catch turtles, then the nominal compound turtle boat may be used. The hearer sill use the general rule to place turtle and boat in the proper case slots, and because a compound was used by the speaker, the hearer will infer Qhat the boat is one which is characteristically used to catch turtles, There are other problems which arise with the generalization of rules; for example, compounding never produces a compound in which the lert element"]},{"title":"is a proper noun, unless the","paragraphs":["proper noun ie the name of a process (e.g. Harkov process) or is a Source, Performer, or Goal of an act of giving.

The Computer Model The computer model of compounding accepts relative clause structures as input and produces nominal compound structures as output when the input is appropriate. It is written in a language with many parentheses the language was chosen for its program development facilities, i.e. built-in editor, rather than for its interpretive capabilities. The program which produces nominal compounds is a pattern matching interpreter; it applies a rule of compound formation by matching one side of the rule with the input structure, and if certain criteria are satisfied by the match, items from the input structure are bound into the rule, transferred to the other side of the rule, and a copy is then maae af the other side of the rule. The result is a nominal compound structure. The model has two components: a rule interpreter and a lexicon of rules for compounding. There is nothing tricky about rule application.

In addition, the nominal flowers must be carried across to the other side of the rule and substituted there for goods before the other side of the rule is copied. Thus market and goods must be bound across the rule so that whatever lexical item matches either of these nominals becomes the value associated with these nominals on the other side of the rule.

The technique of using lexical rules to establish bindings works in virtually every instance, but it has the defect of requiring that the information that a thief is a person who steals things be represented in the lexicon twice at least. A new model is under construction which attempts to reduce this redundancy by allowing the rules to have multiple left and right parts. The problem of selecting appr~priate rules is rather easier to solve. In most compounds in English, there is a characteristic association between the right element of the nominal compound and the main verb of the associated relative clause paraphrase. These two elements which occur on opposite sides of the compounding rule supply a great deal of information about the possibilities for application of the rule. So, in the model, each rule in the lexicon is indexed by the main verb of the relative clause and by the right element of the nominal compaund.

The form of the surface string is controlled by a recursive augmented transition network grammar, which is capable of examining the form and content of the semantic network connected to the semantic node being described. A single node of the grammar network may result in different forms of surface strings depending on the semantic node it is given, and a single semantic node may be described by different surface strings depending on the grammar node it is given to. Since generation from a semantPc network rather than from disconnected phrase markers,, the surface string may be generated directly, left to right. Introduction In this paper, we discuss the approach being taken in the Engllsh generation subsystem of a natural language understanding system presently under development at Indiana University. The core of the understander is a semantic network processing system, SNePS (Shapiro, 1975), which is a descendant of the MENTAL semantio subsystem (Shapiro, 1971a, 1971b) of the MIND system (Kay, 1973). The role of the generator 13 to describe, in English, any oP the nodes in the sernantjc network, all of which represent concepts of the understanding aystem. 46 and other computations are ~equired in the process of pasting these trees tog ther in appropriate places until a 'single phrase marker Is attained which will lead to the surface string. Since we are generating from a semantic network, aL1 the pasting together is already done. Grabbing the network by the node of interest and letting the network dangl-e from it gives a structure mich may be searched apppogriately in order to generate the surface strfng directly in left to right fashion. Our system bears a superficial resemblance to that described fn Simmons and Slocum, 1972 and in Simmons, 1973. That system, however, stores surface information such as tense and voice in its semantic rietwork and its ATN takes as input a linear list containing the semantic node and a generation pattern consisting of a \"series of constraints on the moclalltyfl (Simmons et al., 1973, p. 92 The generator d.escribed in Schank et al., 1973, translates from a \"conceptual structuref1 into a network of the form of Simmons"]},{"title":"' network","paragraphs":["which is then given to a version of Simmons generation program. The two stages use different mechanisms. Our system amounts to a unificatio of these two stages. The generator, as described in this pager, as well as SNePS, a parser and an inference mechanism have been written in LISP 1.6 and are running Interactively on a DEC system-10 on the Indiana University Computing Network. Representation in the Semantic_Network Conceptual information derived from parsed sentences or deduced from other information (or input directly via the SNePS user's language) is stored in a semantic network. The nodes in the network represent concepts which may be discussed and reasoned abaat. The edges represent semantic but non-conceptual binarx relations between nodes. There are also auxiliary nodes which SNePS can use or which the user can use as SNePS variables. (For a more complete diecussion of SNePS and the network nee Zhapiro, 1975.) The semantic network representation being used does not in- 47 olude information considered .t.6 be features of' the surface string such as tense, voice or main vs. relative clause. Ihstead of tense, temporal information is stored PeIative to a growing time line in a manner similar to that of Bruce, 1972. From this information a tense can be generated for an output sentence, but it may be a different tense than that of the original input sentence if time has progressed iri %he 5nterim. The voice of a generated sentence is usually determined by the top level call to the generator function. However, sometimes it is determined by the generator grammar. For example, when generating a relative clause, voice is determined by whether the nodn being modified-is the agent or object of the action described by the relative clause. The Main clawe of a generated sentence depends on which semantic node is given to the generator in the top level call. Other nodes connected to it may result in relative clauses being generated. These roles may be reversed in other top level calls to the generator. The generator is driven by two sets of data: the semantic network and a grammar in the form of a recursive augmented transition network (ATN) similar to that of Woods, 1973. The edges on our ATN are somewhat different from those of Woods since our view is that the generator is a tranducer from a network into a linear string, whereas a parser Is a transducer from a linear string into a tree or network. The changes this entails are discussed below. During any point in generation, the generator is working on some particular semantic node. Functions on the edges of the ATN can examine the network connecteb to this node and fail or succeed accordingly. In this way, nodes of the ATN can \"decide\" what surface form is most appropriate for describing a semantic node, while different ATN nodes may generate different surface foI?ms to describe the same semantic node. A common assumption among linguists is that generation begin3 with a set of disconnected deep phrase markers.

For example, tense is mapped into and from temporal relations between a node representing that some action has, is, or will occur and a growing time line. Restrictive relative clauses are used by the parser to Identify a node being discussed, while non-restrictive relative clauses may result in new information being added to the network.

Generation as Parsing Normal pa~sing involves taking input from a linear string and producing a tree or network structure as output. Viewing this in terns of an ATN grammar as described in Woods, 1973, there is a well-defined next input function which simply places successive word6 into the** register. The output function, however, is more complicated, uslng BUILDQ to build pieces of trees, or, as in our parser, a BUILD function to build pieces of network. If we now consider generating in these terms, we see that there is no simple next input function. The generator will focus on some semantic node for a while, recursively shifting its attention to adjacent nodes and back. Since there are several adjacent nodes, connected by variously labelled edges, the grammar author must specify which edge to follow when the generator is to move to another semantic node. For these reasons, the same focal semantic node is used when traversing edges of the grammar network and a new semantic node is- specified by gl,ving a path from the current semantic node when pushing to a new grammar node. The register SNODE is usedto hold the current semantic node. The output function of generation is straightforward, simply being concatenation onto a growing string.

Adjectives are added before the mame or before tkre class name and a relative clause is added after.

Figure 13 shows the adjective string generator and Figure 14 shows the relative clause generator. Notice the use of the TRANSR edges for iterating. At this time, we have no theory for determining the number or which adjectives and relative clauses to generate, so arbitrarily we generate all adjectives not already on DONE but only one relative clause. We have not yet implemented any ordering of adjectives. It is merely fortuitous that \"sweet young Lucyt is eenerated rather than \"young sweet Lucyft. The network is written so that a relative clause for which the noun is the deep agent is preferred over one in which the noun is the deep object. Notice that this choice determines the voice of the embedded clause. The fomn (STRIP(FIND MEMBER (1. SNODE) CLASS (FIND LEX PERSON))) is a call to a SNePS function that determines if the object is known to be a person, in ~hich case \"WHO\" is used rather than \"'WHICHft. This determination is made by referring to the semantic network rather than by including a HUMAN feature on the lexical entries for LUCY and CHARLIE. nDJs7JUMP(SETR ADJS(GETF WEICH*)) Figure 13,: The network for generating a string of adjectives. Notice that any information about the object being described by a noun phrase may be used to construct a relatfve clause even if that Lnfomnation derived from some main clause. Also, while the generator is examining a semantic node all the information about that node is reachable from it and may be used directly. There is no need to examine disjoint deep phrase markers to discover where they can be attached to each other so that a complex sentence can be derived. Future Work Additional work needs ts be done in developing the style of generation described in this paper. Experience with larger and richer networks will lead to the following issues: describing a node by a pronoun when that node has been described earlier in the string; regulating verbosity and complexity, possibly by the use of resource bound8 simulating the limitations of short term memory* keeping sub-"]},{"title":", ordinate clauses and descriptions to","paragraphs":["the point of the conversation posslbly by the use of a TO-DO register holding thenodes that are to be included in the string.

Since the main goal has been achieved, and the goal produced as a consequence of that goal has also been achieved, the story ends. What distinguishes stories from simple sequences of events? Coherency is important: there has to be a logical flow from one event to the next. This is represented in CD as a chain of acts which re,sult in states which enable further acts and so on. Interest is important: something interesting or unusual has to happen or else the reader will begin to wonder what the point of the story is. TALE-SPIN creates impediments to goals, on the assumption that the overcoming of obstacles can make an interesting skory. \"One day Joe Bear was hungry. There was a jar of honey right next to him.

This process prevents the plans from being too complicated. As the story is generated, various plot decisions have to be made. Some decisions are made at random, others are made by the reader. When Joe Bear threatens Irving Bird because Irving Bird won't tell him where the honey is, the reader gets to decide whether Irving Bird is going to ignore the threat. We use planning structures because any program which reads or writes a story, whether of the folktale variety or the New York Times variety, must have a model of the logic of human activity. It might be easier to simulate the generation of a highly stylized form of story, as Klein (1974) has done using ~ropp's analysis of a class of Russian fairy tales, but there is little generality there. One could use any of the wel.1-known problem-solving systems like MICRO-PLANNER, but the story is the proof procedure, and the procedure used there does not correspond to my conception of how people solve problems. hat's not a criticism of MICRO-PLANNER as a problem-solver, but only as a model human problem-solving"]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["user interaction was included for two reasons.
