Nevertheless, their combined effect is to produce the tree or trees which exist at that stage of the \"farward\" generation where the last postcyclic transformation has applied. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to view them initially as constituting a kind of \"bootstrap\" whose function is to set the stage for '-'true1' transformational parsing.

Nevertheless, there appeared to be no reasonable grounds (such as obscurity, doubtful grammaticality, and the like) for excluding them from the subset. A third factor affe.cting the performance of the \"bootstrap\" was the conscious decision to try to get along initially with a shrfac.e parser which would be maximally simple with respect to both its computat-ional mechanism and its surface phrase structure grammar.

While revealing no critical problems with the bootstrap, these first trial runs indicated that incorrect surface structures were indeed produced along with the correct ones and tended to give rise to analysis paths which continued for some time before being aborted by well-fornledness tests.

T.he first analysis initiated a lengthy inverse derivation that was terminated as ill-formed only after the entire postsycle and the first inverse cycle had been traversed, meaning that nearly as much time was spent in pursuing this incorrect path as was required to follow the correct one. In this and a number of similar cases, however, it was observed that ill-formedness of the surface structure could have readily been detected at 02 near the outset of the transformational parsing process by performing testg employing the pattern-matchin power of transformational rules. This observation led to the introduction of so-called blocking rules in the transformational grammar, rules which proved to be quite effective in detecting and filtering out ill-formed structures such as the incompatible auxiliarylfinite verb combination in the example just considered, I11 the spring of 1972, the surface grammar was greatly expanded in an attempt ta cover the full range of structures that could be produced by thk set of transformational rules then in use. At that point, the mmbined effect of the various design decisions affecting surface structures and surface parsing became immediately and painfully evident in the form of a combinatorial explosion: The brief and apparently innocuous question (8) (8) \"Is the headquarters of"]},{"title":"XY%","paragraphs":["in Buffalo? I' produced no less than 19 surface parses, a figure which soared to 147 when a third prepositional phrase was introduced by replacing \"Buffalo\" with the classifier construction \"the city of Buffalo\" Although a blocking rule for detecting spurious stranded prepositions rather quickly killed off 16 of the 19 analyses in the former case, thereby reduoing the analysis problem to tractable size, the system was unable to cope with the latter situation at all, due to problenls of storage overflow. Thoughts of what would inevitably happen if we added yet another prep ositional phrase (as in \"Was the headquarters of XYZ in the city of Buffalo in 1971? \") made it clear that killing off unwanted surface parses after the fact by means of blocking rules was not enough, measures would have to be adopted which would prevent formation of most such ai~alyses in the first place. Two corrective steps were taken almost immediatey: (a) coverage of classifier constructions was temporarily dropped, and (b) it was decided to explore whaf could be clone towards eli'n~ination of spurious surface parses through selective refinement of category distinctions in the surface grammar. In the latter area, it was discovered (not surprisingly) that differences in the surface structure distribution of prepositional phrases, genitive noun phrases, anu other types of noun phrases could be effectively exploited to suppress incorrect parses, as could distributional contrasts between proper nouns ahd common nouns, finite verbs and participles, et~. (In the case of (8) above, 13 of the original 19 parses were ruled out on the ground that proper ,nouns cannot take modifiers, while 3 more analyses (plus 4 of the 13 already eliminated) were excluded oq the basis of distribu tional distinctions between prepositioxlal phrases and other noun phrases. ) In~plen~entation of the refinements in the surface grammar required nmerons part-of-spcech code changes in the lexicon and a substantial increase in the number of rules in the surface grammar.

The fact that the underlying variety and complcxity of these constructions mds to be masked by superficial similarities makes a selective, piecemeal approach to their coverage a generally-dubious move in a system swch as RJjXXJEtST, whose eventual users can hardly be expected to make distinctions that may not be immediately obvious even to a trained linguist. Despi-te strong reservatiops on- this point, it was decided to employ the string transformation mechanism to deal with an extremely limited range of coniunction constructions on an experimental basis.
