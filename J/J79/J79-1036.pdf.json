Georgette Silva kindly chaired both subaetsions. Only five .of the a ix talks given are represented in this Proceedings. The paper detailing Salton's talk on automatic igdexing was far too extensive to be included on this fiche and hence will be published separately. The paper by Klappholz and Lbckman discusses the problems involved in the feesolution of cross-sentential reference and sketches an algorithm for their solution. (Notq the closely related paper by Deutsch in Session 4.) Rosenschein addresses the problem of restrict-ing the generation of inferential propositions given a set of beliefs and proposes a structural constraint upon inferencing. Becklea et al. present a man-machine approach to the description of idiolect variations in an environment extraordinarily complex linguistically and sociologically. Brill and Oshika describe a set of programs which permit both batch and interactLve processing of orthographic and phonological strings to provfde information on f r , contextual variation, and associational relations. Anderson, Bross, and Sager present a theory, of: linguistic compression in written texts and describe the results of an implementation of that theory. Timothy 6.

Before presenting a sketch of a proposed solution to the nominal reference resolution problem, it would be well to detail more precisely the overall language processing enviornment within which it is meint to operate and of which it is a most necessary part. First, we adsume that a relatively small set, S, of semantic primitives and $ logical-calculus -like language, L, for expressing ltmeaningsll are available. The set S and language L must satisfy the following two conditions. (i) The predicate, function, and constant eymbols of L are members of S. (ii) There is a one-to-o* mapping from meanings of (natural language) sentences to formulas of L. While a set of prkiitives and a meaning representation language even demonstably close to satisfying the above conditions have yet to be produced, we will, in examples to follow, make use of meaning represen tations; the only claim we will make for them is that the functibns served by their constituent constructs must be served by the elements of any adequate system.

Before giving example8 of just how such a judgment mechanism might work, we should make it clear that our sense of I1inferencing1l is very different from Riegerls (1974).

The tape-recorded speech of a sample of children is being analysed to determine the structure of their language, its correlation with socio-linguistic facters and their progress in the use of English. X.2 coqvter system is designed to deal with manually codified data in the form of parse trees with associated grammatical and semantic information. The communication complex does not have readily identifiab le norms. The analytical method and compwr sys tern effect recognition of stable sub-systems (regardless of the external criteria which determine these sub-system), comparison of these sub-systems with English as well as state the evolution of the children's language.

CONCLUSION In respect of performance of groups with different socio-linguistic descriptions, for purposes of this study, it is assumed that the frequency of occurrence of particular basic parse trees is a meaningful indicator of differences in speech patterns. A major difficulty is that no two trees in the study are identical but at the same time if we strip too much information from each node there are too few trees to make an analysis worthwhile, and in part, the study aims at determining the degree to which strippilrp of information at interior nodes is necessary if the Gomputer is to be a qseful aid.

All of the programs in this package are written in SAIL, an ALGOL-based language offering extended string and set manipulation operations and an associative data base. The programs run on a DEC PDP-10 at Carnegie-Mellon University via the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) computer network (ARPANET). The ARPANET is accessed by the ELI? operating system developed by SCRL, which runs on a local PDP-11 [I]. While the processing package is applicable to various types of natural language data, it has been used most extensively at SCRL in the analysis of discourse transcriptions. The discourses consist of conversational speech gathered in interviews with adult speakers of various dialects of American English. More than twenty-five discourses, transcribed orthographically and phonologically, have been prmssed, yielding detailed information on over 28,000 utterances representing about 3,500 distinct lexical- items. All examples in this section are taken from a typical discburse. B. \"Batchw Facility Discourse processing usually begins with the generation of a transcription reference file in which orthographic and phonological representations are listed in discourse order, as illustrated in Figure 1.","paragraphs":["WELL LET"]},{"title":"' S TRY CLASSIFYING THEM ACCORDING= TO THE EXCUSES 086 TRAY 887 KLAES$CFAYIHNS 888 DHAXM 88s //AXK$ORDIHN/TUW// Figure 1 In this example, the phonological realization of TRY is /tray/ (coded TRAY). The phonological code shown is a basic ARPA phonemic alphabet augmented by special symbols indicatim some phonetic detail, such as vowel height. The realization of THE, for example, is coded DH$I, indicating that the vowel fell between /i/ and /I/. Reference number's assigned to each utterance serve as an index to the discourse context in which utterances occur, and are used to interpret the output of other programs in the package. Separate reference number sequences are provided for the orthographic and phonological forms in the reference files, since there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between these forms, as in the case of phonological merging whl-eh obscures word boundaries, In Figure 1, for example, the two orthographic items WELL and LET'S are realized as a single phonological item /wl E ts/ (coded WELEHTS) The core of the \"batch! processing facility is a set of three programs: PROCON, ENVIRN and CLUSTR. PROCON provides frequency and context information on the lexical level, while the other two provide similaf information on the phonological level, PROCON output contains an alphabetically sorted list of the utterance types occurring in the input discourse transcription file as illustrated in Figure 2. Frequency of occurrence of each type is given, along with the various phonological realizations.

For example, Q appeared eight times in the context EH--EN (E-n, and a check of the reference list shows that all these occurrences were in the word sentence (s) . ENVIRN output also provides a frequency ordered liSt of phonemes, with frequency totals brokerr down according to occurrence in word initial, medial and final position. CLUSTR, the third of the \"batch\" programs,is used in the analysis of phoneme cluster distribution in the discourse data. All clusters are indexed by each of their component phonemes, so that the cluster NDZ (fndz)') which is listed under D in Figure 4 also appears under N ad 2 in the full output.

For each phoneme belonging to a selected class, CLUSTR provides a count of the number of times that the phoneme appears in clusters, an alphabetically sorted list of those clusters, and a frequency count and reference numbers for each cluster. Figure 4, a sample of CLUSTR output for within-word consonant clusters, shows that D appeared in clusters a total of 70 times, with 32 of these being ND clusters. Reference numbers may be used to establish the discourse context of any cluster. For example, the cluster D Q EN T S (/di?nts/) appears in utterance 486 which is the word students. Like ENVIRN, CLUSTR provides a frequency ordered list of cluster types in addition ts the alphabetic list. C- Interactive Retrieval Facility The set of \"batch\" programs is complemented by a language data retrieval system which allows the user to interactively retrieve data items conforming to various orthographic, phonological and syntactic patterns. Linguistic data is inte~nally stored in the system as a network of associations between items of various types. These associations are implemented in SAIL as LEAP triples [2J and the element types entering into these associations vary according to the - particular application. For example, in analysis of the discourse data described above, triples contain orthographic, phonological and syntactic elements. For study of phonetic-to-phonemic mapping, triples might be orthographic, phonemic and phonetic elements. In comparative linguistic research, triples might consist of an orthographic element and two phonological elements corresponding to two languages or dialects Data can be accessed on the basis of patterns directed to any one (or any combination) of these elements. For example, if the data base contains associations between orthographic, phonological and syntactic elements, then the query P/ 0: THE retrieves the phonological items associated with the .spelling THE, and might return DHAX(/Ba/) and DHIY i). The query O/ P: TUW would","paragraphs":["retprn the orthographic items pronounced Tm (/tu/), e.g two, too, tor"]},{"title":"--- Patterns such as THE and TUW completely specify the element to which they are directed, but various special forms allow partial. specifications to be expressed also.

Each phonological element is defined in terms of a set of features such as UV (unvoiced) and ST (stop), and these features may be used to specify segments in phonological pawerns. To search for phonological realizations containing /i/ between unvoiced stops, one could use the query P/ P: =(UV + ST)IY(UV + ST)= to find /kip/ (keep) , /pik~","paragraphs":["?/"]},{"title":"(peeking) , and /r pit d/ (repeated) Boolean operators are also available for specifying pattern segments. For example, the query 0 6: (C OR K)=, P: (NOT K)= returns arthographic ikems which begin with C or K and are not pronounced with initial k, e.g. cite, change, know. Several capabilities lacking in the current interactive system will be available in the near future. The user will be able to (1) specify optional segments and sequences of segments in phonological patterns; (2) create and name sets containing items of interest, e.g. monosyllabic function words, and use set operations such as union and intersection; (3) interactively modify feature definitions of phonological symbols: (4) retrieve several elements, e.g. orthographic and phonological forms, simultaneously; (5) display the discourse context of any given item, and (6) write retrieval queries and responses to a file for subsequent analysis. 11. APPLICATIONS The processing package can be used in the analysis of various kihds of natural language data, as illustrated in the following examples. A. Phonological variation The programs can be used to efficiently index and sort natural language data so that systematic phonological variation can be easily examined. For example, inspection of a PROCON output for a ten minute interview consisting of over 2,000 utterance tokeno yields general observations such as -- final /t/ alternates with final glottal stop","paragraphs":["/?/ under certain conditions;"]},{"title":"-- alveolar flapping occurs under several stress conditions whidh appear to be related to noun affixes. These preliminary observations can be systematically investigated using the interactive query system. The data base can be queried for all phonological realizations ending in T (/t/) or Q","paragraphs":["(/?/), and the corresponding orthographic entries, using the queries P/ P: =(T OR Q) and O/ P: =(T OR 9) The resulting list might include art /a*/ but /bat/ can' t /k=nt/","/k en?/ fished /f 1Jt/ limit raft that want That is, final /t/ appears to vary with final /?/ following vowels arid following nasals, but not elgewhere. This hypothesis, represented as a context-sensitive phonological rule, could then be tested against additional data using any of several computer rule testers [3-51.

Such a list might include ability lab il xfi/ city /s"]},{"title":"ifid/ facility /f as il IF/̂ letter /l ;fa/ petty","paragraphs":["/p ;pi/ responsibility /r~spans~bil~~i/ writing /rd~f I g/ Flapping occprs in"]},{"title":"a descending stress pattern, e.g. city letter, petty, wrdting in which a stressed vowel precedes the flap and an unstressed vowel follows. In addition, trhe flap appears to occur between unstressed vowels when the sequence rppresents the noun asfix -ity, as in ability. To check this, the query P/ 0: =ITY, S: N could be used to retrieve a81 nouns ending in -ity, and the subset involving affixed forms (i.e. excluding city, pity) could be examined for occurrences of flapping. B. Word Error Recognition testing The interactive facility can be used to examine the kinds of word recognition errors which might occur in a speech under-standing system due to indeterminacies in segment labelling. If a string is completely specified as /likrg/(coded LIYKIHNX), then it matches a single word, leaking. However, if labelling is less precise, then alternative (and incorrect)word matches might occur. Using the inte~ctive retrieval system, alternative labels and resulting word matches can be examined for any given lexicon. In the example above, the labelled string might be L (VOC HIGH ANT) K IH NX with the stressed vowel represented as a set of features: vocalic, high, anterior. Resulting word matches might include leaking and licking. If the initial consonant is also specified as a set of features (consonant, sonorant, continuant), as in the string* (CON SON CONT) {VOC HIGH","paragraphs":["ANT) K IH NX"]},{"title":"then the resulting word matches might be leaking, lickinq, reeking.

C. Comparative Linguistic Relationships If the data base is represented as an orthographic list with two associated phonological lists representing two languages or dialects, the interactive system can be used to discover systematic sound correspondences, and to aid in the study of dialect relationships and historical reconstruction. A sample'data base might be: Gloss a fish to have no, not brother bamboo Lanquaqe A Lanquage B plaa Pa mi i mia plaaw Paw phii fia phaay fay The query would retrieve those items in language B which correspond to items in language A with initial /pl-/ clusters, e.g. and paw, indicating that consonant cluster simplification may have occurred in language B. The query B/ A: =IYIY would retrieve those items in language B which correspond to items in language A with final /-ii/, e.g. the drphthongized mia and f ia. - - A large data base could be accessed in this way to discover systematic correspondences between languages A and B, such as the correspondences /pl-/:/p-/, m:m, /ph-/:/f/, ii:ia aa:a, etc. The flexibility of the interactive system, combined with the linguistic intuition of the user, can be used.to specify and retrieve any set of correspondences, without the need to format the data according to initial consonants or clusters, vowel nuclei, finals, etc. Information such as tonal cnntours and stress can also be represented and accessed.

Mechanisms of compressidn in medical records for a collaborative study of breast cancer are described. The syntactic devices were mainly deletion of words having a special status in the grammar of the whole language and deletion in particular positions of word+ having a special sta&us in the sublanguage. The deIeted forms are described and sublanguage Qord classes defined. A subcorpus of the medical records was parsed by an existing computer parsing system; a component covering the deletion-forms was added to the granunar. Modifications to t,he computer grammar are discussed and the parsing results are summarized. Introduction All 1anguages\"have mechanisms of compression. Sentences may be embedded within other sentenaes by means of nominalization and complementation. Various grammatical transformations involve deletion of certain parts of the sentence. In medical records, we find entries such as no evidence of metastases, which may be said to be derived Trea something like There is no evidence of metastases. Such incomplete sentences are not common in the spoken language of the medical records (i.e. dictated reports). However when physiciakrs themselves are requirbd to write- material for records, compression mechanisms are qmmonly use&.","Although this paper will deal with a mific corpus, similar devices would I often be used for compression in other s-ations where there is pressure to write as little as possible, Legal, educational, and scientific recordg where informal notes are kept woum be other examples of this class of sitqations. The original motivation for this study was to develop effective methods for storing &e information in a medical record and to be able to retrieve this information for purposes of research, medical care, or administration. Fsoan previous research, the feasibility of verbatim input of dictated narrative has been established, Computerized extraction of the information has been shown to be feaeible i~ a test system ACORN (Automated Coding of Report ~arrative). his system has been described in detail in a series of previous papers. 1dt3 1 I .Dm J.

It would presumably be usea in any extension of TICES which would handle medical nates. In eis'analysis the computer was used to reorganize the material in a fbrmmore convenient for manual analysis by the linguist. Anderson analyzed the linguistic structure of the entries in a sample of the medical records involving radiation findings, A discussion of this analysis will take up the next part of the paper. Sager and associates used some of the findings from this study to develop methods for processing these same medical records by computef, adapting% program and grananar which had been developed fok parsing science articles. This project will be discussed in the final part of the paper. Linguistic Characteristics of Medical Notes Many of the entries on the medical records are in the form of notes which are neither complete sentences nor single word entries, but linguistic strings of an intermediate type, which we will hereafter call fragments, Fragments are a compressed typ of linguistic material resulting from various transformations which have the effect of making linguistic strings shorter by reducing or deleting materihl. The writer of these stretches of material must make his entries brief, in order to save time and effort, but also make them informative and unambiguous. For this reason the deleted material has to be easily recover-able, or in other words it must not contain much information. An analysis of the fragments shows that deletion is maiinly of a small class of sentence parts: (1) tense and the verb"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["be (t"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["be); (2) subject, tense and the verb"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["be; (3) the subject; and (4) subject, tense, and verb (V) other than"]},{"title":"-","paragraphs":["be. A second characteristic of fragments which makes deleted material recover-able is that both the meted material and the remainders consist of words in easily defined subclasses, based on both distributional and semantic criteria. These subclasses are easily defined because of the nature of the sublanguage; in general the vocabulary is limited and each word has a limited semantic range. The question on a form khich is being answered can also be used as a basis for retoring deleted material.

The word subclasses ate based on both semantic and distributional criteria. To a large extent nouns can conveniently be subclassed on a semantic basis and verbs can be subclassed on a distributional basis, according ta the subclasses of nouns which they take as subject and object. Due to the nature of the sublanguage there is relatively little overlap (e.g., a given verb is likely to take only one noun subclass as shject) compared to what we would find in the language as a whole. Two impoftant subclasses of h-n nouns used in the medical records are N-physician and N-patieht. Each has only a few members, but is important because many verbs chqacteristically take it as subject or object, and also because both, but particularly N-physician, are usually deleted. It is on the basis of the verbs which characteristically take them as subject or object that they can usually be recovered without ambiguity. Other noun subclasses concern more directly the subject matter of the reports, the concrete objects with which the physician is dealing. Unlike N-physician and N-patient, these classes usually have many mmbers and they are seldom deleted. As with N-physician and N-patient, certain uerb subclasses char~cteristically take them as subject or object. Table 2 gives some of the word subclasses with examples of each. 6~ross et al. \"Information in Natural Languages: A New Approach,\" 1969. TABLE 2.

The LSP grqmmar of English is based on the same linguistic principles as the ACORN grammar. Hence it could also serve to test the feasibility of adding a note-handling capability to the ACORN-TICES system. The LSY sylr which was designed for text-processinQ, was adapted to the parsing of medical records by deleting portions of the grammar which are not required for this type of material and adding a section covering sentence fragments. These change$ are described below, followed by the parsing resultb. The corpus which was parsed consisted of 12 sections of the Radiation Findings extracted in their order of appearance from the medical records. These sections contained 245 sentences or sentence fragments (word sequences ending in a period). Of these, 37 were complete English sentences and 205 were fragments; 3 were combinations of both types. 21 entries were identical to others in the corpus, accounting in all for 139 of the sentences ox sentence fragments. Of the complete sentences, same were quite long, e.g., Reexamination shows some scarring and thickening over the right apex which is perhaps slightly more evident than it was before, but nothing is seen that is typical of tumor involvement. Typical sxorter sentences are Chest films on 10-25-68 and 12-14-68 do not show any essential changes since- last reports, Liver scan 1-29-69 was normal. Fragments were, as predicted, of the types listed in Table 1, above, though not all tyMs were represent-ed in the parsed corpus. Table 3 shows the new definitions or redefinitioqd which were added to the LSP grammar to cover fragments. These definitions are written in ~ahs-Naur Form (BNF), as ilze all the ca. 180 definitions which comprise the context-free-part of the LSP English grammar. The BNF definitions are used by the parser to construct a tree representing the structure of the input sentence. In addition to BNF definitions, the grammar contains restrictions, which test the sentence trees for grammatical and selectional well-formedness.

The data structures must not change the meaning. This is why syntactic methods are knpo%ant. Parsing with an English grammar provides the gross structure of input sentences. (The use of English transformations makes the grammatical analysis more refined,) In each specialized technical area, more specific structure is p~s~ibie, making use of the restricted word usage characteristic of the disqourse in the given subject area. K) A second stage of processing of this type is now being applied to the parsed corpus of medical records and will be reported in a subsequent paper. A convenkent test of the adeqyacy of the parsing outputs is therefore whether they can serve as input to this second stage of processing (called forhatting). It can be seen in Table 4 that a number of \"wrong\" parses were still adequate as input to the formatting; the segmentation of the sentence into parts was correct even if the parts were assigned an incorrect syntactic status, e.g., object instead of adjunct. Only when the first parse was not adequate for formatting was the sentence rerun to obtain alternative analyses. The parsing times are a rough indication of the efficiency of the parsing but two points should be kept in mind. (1) The present LSP system is not a production model, but a research tool, with all that implies. (2) A bignificant fraction of the input sentences were \"no data\" types, e,g., None this visit. These word sequences were so limited linguistically that a literal formula could serve to reaogniae them. The experimental use of such a formula cut down parsing times on the no-data entries from about 1.817 to0.030.
