One final remark &wut the style of this survey. I have not indulged the n~rmal critical luxury of careful and extensive quotation from authoys followed by detailed and meticulous criticism. That would be wholly in-appropriate in the present state of things. A great deal of work is being done at the moment, and many of the principal researchers change their views on very fundamental questions between one paper and the next without drawiw any attention to the fact. Cheap self-contradictions and changes of mind are all too easy to find, so criticism and smparisons are best drawn with a very broad brush and a light stroke. 2. Winograd's Understanding System Winograd's systea runs as a dialogue, in real time, between a human operator who types in meSqes, and the system proper, called SHRDLU, which displays on a screen pictures of a closed world of coloured blocks and pyraida, a box in- which they can be put, and an arm or crane khat can move che objects about. SHRDLU displays its replies to the operator by writing on the samq screen. The following is a discontinuous sample of the dialogue Winograd giws in his book. SHIIDLU1s replies are in the upper case r eick up the big red block, OK find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box. BY IIT', I ASSUME: YOU MEAN TKE BLOCK WHICH IS TALfwER THRN Tm ONE I AM HOLDING what does the box contain THE BLUE PYMID RND THE BLUE BLOCK had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the Lkttle cube YES, TEE GREEN ONE when did you pick it up WEIILE.1 WAS STACKING tlP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A EARGE WEN CUBE. why TO GET RID OF IT.

The syn-tactic analySis program was written in PR%RAMMAR, a procedural language related to PLANNER (see Hewitt '69). This means that a familia phase structure rule such as s+NP+w (to be interpreted: a sentence consists of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase) would be expressed as: (PDEFIME SENTENCE ((( PARSE NP) NIL FAIL) (( PAFSE VP) FAIL FAIL RETURN))) The details of the notation need not detairius at this point; what Ls important is that Winograd's gramuax 4s"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["tile cmnventirrnaL list of culas, but small sub-programs Like tha lines above, that actually xaysooant x-o~iiures for iulposing the desirad grstmalieA1 structure, The first leva1 of linguistic pm&ur~s in the system applies a systemic grammar'"]},{"title":", dur to M.A. K.

Second Generation Svstems To und'ewstand what was meant when Winograd contrasted his own with what he called second generation systems, we have to remember, as always in this suject, that the generations are of fashion, not chronology or inheritance uf i3eas. He dedcribed the work of Simmons, Schank and myself among others in his s-ey of new approaches, even though the foundations and terminology of those approaches were set out in print in 1966, 1968 and 1967 respectiyely, What those approaches, and others have in mmon is the belie. thak understanding systems must be able to manipulate very complex linguistic ohjects, or semantic structures,"]},{"title":"and","paragraphs":["that no simplistic approaches to understanding language with computers will wrk.

Charniakts analysis begins by pirating out that a great deal cf what is required to understand that story is implicit: Iun~ilrledge aLwut the giving of p~esents, knoililedge that if one possesses one of a certain sort of thing then one may well not want another, and *so on, Charniak's system does not actually run as a preyram, but is a theosetical structure of rules called 'demcnsl khat correspond roughly to what Minsky later called frames.

The demons are, as with Winoyraa's work, expressed in a procedural language which, on running, will seek for a succession of inter-related 'goals'. Here, for example, is a demon concerned with another story, about a child's piggy bank (PB) and a child shaking it, looking fcr money but hearing no sound.

It can be seen that the information encoded in the system is of a highly specific sort - in the present case it is not about containers as such, and how to get their contents out, but about Piggy Banks in particular, and everything relies on that partfcular knowledge having been put in. Not all the knowledge is of this general sort: in a recent paper (Charniak '74) whws tha 'kite' stary is reconsidered there are rules ~f considerable ganrrrsuty snd interest.
