There are in addition TIME, Location and LNSTrumental llnks, and these, as are all conceptual cases, are obligatory, even if they must be irifsreiitially filled in by the conceptual memory (CM). Figure 1 illustrates the CD representation of the sentence MARY YISSED JOHN BECAUSE HE (JOHN) HIT BILL. That conceptual graph is read as follows: John propelled some unspecified object X from himself toward Bill, causing X to come into physical contact with Bill, and this entire event cause Mary to do something which resulted in her lips being in physical contact with John! Furthermore, the entire event occurred sometime in the past. Chapter 2 of (Rl) contains a fairly complete overview of the CD representation. Assuming the conceptual analyzer (see (R2) ) has constructed, in consultation with the CM, a conceptual graph of the sort typified by Tigure 1, the first step for the CM is to begin \"integrating\" it into some internal memory structure which is more amenable to the kinds of active infezence manipulations the CM wants to perform. ?his initial integration occurs in three stages. First is an initial attempt to replace the symbols (JOHN, MARY, BILL, X, etc.) by pointers to actual memory cance'pts and tokens of concepts. Each concept and token in the CM is represented by a unique L-ISP atom (such as C0347) which itself bears no intrinsic meaning. Instead, the essence of the concept or token is captured in a set of features associated with the symbol. Thus, for instance, an internal memory token with no features is simply \"something\" if it must be expressed by language, whereas the token illustrated in Figure 2 would represent part of our knowledge about Bill's friend Mary Smith,, a female human who owns a red Edsel, lives at 222 Avenue St., is 26 years old, and so forth. This set ofl features is called C0948's occurrence set, and is in'the implementation merely a set of pointers to all other memory structures in which C0948 occurs. The process of referent identification will attempt to isolate one token, or second best, a set of candidate tokens for each concept symbol in the incoming graph by meansof a feafure-intersecting algarithm described in (Rl).

Hearing the input \"8111 saw John kiss Jenny.\", MEMORY-is unable to decide upon the referent of \"Jenny\": it could be Jenny Jones or Jenny Smith. MEMORY therefore creates a temporary token hav~rlg as features all the common features of Jenny Jones and Jenny Srnlth. By inference, MEMORY is able to decide upon Jenny Jones. At that point, the temporary token is merged inlo the concept !nr Jenny Jones, and a second pass 01 inferencinr is initiated. However, on the second pass a new inference arises: because Bill loves Jenny Jones, and he saw John kiss her, he (probably) becams angry at John. This inference was not triggered on the first inference pass.because beiing loved by Bill was not a common feature of both Jennys, and hence not accessible then (ie. it had not been copied to the temporary token's occurrence set).
