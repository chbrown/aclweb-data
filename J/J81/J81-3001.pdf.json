Martin 1 Laboratory for Computer Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 A scheme is proposed for representing the logical form of English sentences, wherein the meaning of a network node depends on how it is related through \"role-in\" links to nodes representing more aggregate entities. It is argued that roles are a natural device for capturing many linguistic and philosophic distinctions, and that they are convenient for computational processing. In particular, it is shown how role-in links may be advantageously used in lieu of quantifier scope to represent quantificational dependencies. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In representing the semantics of English sentences, it is traditional to distinguish \"logical form\" from semantic content. Chomsky [2], for instance, introduces LF (his version of logical form) as a linguistic level of representation between syntax (phrase structure) and semantics.","Representations of logical form, which are typically based on predicate calculus or lambda calculus, must be carefully chosen for empirical adequacy as well as computational convenience. There are at least three general ways in which predicate or lambda calculus might be carried over into representations of logical form: (la) directly (as by a theorem prover);","(lb) by replacing quantification with dynamically scoped iteration procedures (as in Woods [30]); or","1 This paper was substantially revised after Professor Martin's death by a group of his colleagues to satisfy length constraints and to take advantage of the reviewers' extensive and thoughtful comments. We wish to thank the editor and reviewers for their cooperation under these unfortunate circumstances.

The second and third are more process-oriented; that is, they more closely relate elements of the representation and states in the interpretation process. In my view, a process orientation is needed if issues of efficiency are to be discussed at all. 2 One key to efficiency is the delaying of decisions as long as possible. This is easier to achieve when differences between alternative interpretations are minimized.","The two process-oriented approaches noted above differ in their treatment of scope dependencies. For example, we can model \"each bottle\" in","(2) Each cork is fastened to each bottle by a","small wire basket. with a quantifier like (¥x: bottle), and then translate that into an explicit FOR loop clause. Alternatively, we can employ Skolem functions, with \"wire\" and \"basket\" modeled as functions of a variable ranging over \"bottle\". These functions and variables can then be represented in a semantic network, along the lines discussed in \"What's in a Link?\" [29].","I choose to adopt a particular semantic network approach wherein it is more appropriate to view meanings of nodes decompositionally (i.e., as dependent upon what they are constituents of) rather than compositionally (i.e., as fully determined by the meanings","2 It is unclear how to pose efficiency questions in a non-process-oriented framework, where even effectiveness may be rejected as a desideratum.

More specifically, the meaning of a network node depends (decompositionally) on how it is related though \"role-in links ''3 to nodes representing more aggregate entities. The decompositional view is preferable for explaining a number of linguistic phenomena. I will show, in this paper, that many important linguistic and philosophical distinc-tions can be analyzed as differences in role-in linkages. Among these are the intensional/extensional, referential/attributive, and distributive/collective distinctions.","My approach turns out to be more complex than some, but I will argue that it captures subtle cases in a more natural way and that it is superior for computational purposes. Indeed it has been my experience (as in the development of MACSYMA [13]) that a representational formalism with more constructs often permits more efficient processing than a formalism based on a smaller set of more primitive operators. I suspect that this experience will strike home with many readers familiar with the difficulties encountered by predicate-calculus-based theorem provers. t~1 generic node • individual node may-be-described -as role-in inherits-from Figure la.

I consider the intension/extension distinction extremely important, because intensional representations appear to be more natural for certain sentenees. 5","My representation does not deal with contextual problems by assuming a set of objects called contexts (or partitions) and then somehow stipulating a context link for each node. Instead, I argue that roles allow a more natural modeling of the context phenomena. For example, Figure 2 shows how Hendrix [10] represents the fact that legal persons can own physical objects. Rectangles (and squares) represent partitions (contexts). An individual or set is in a partition if its representing circle is in the rectangle representing that partition. In this figure, the individual I is an implication that any individual owning X has an individual agent Y, which is a legal person; an individual object Z, which is a physical object; an individual start-time t 1, which is a time; and an individual end-time t 2, which is also a time.","This same information is shown in Figure 3, using the notation presented here. Figure 3 eliminates the individuals I and X, the implication node, the context surrounding I, and the context surrounding Y, Z, t 1, and t 2. Some of these are replaced in Figure 3 with a richer variety of node types; I believe these types have better linguistic and philosophical motivations than Hendrix's abstract individuals, contexts, and implications. 3. Reference and Definite Descriptions","Russell's [22] analysis of a singular definite description required the existence of a unique object satisfy-ing the description in order for the expression to denote anything, and hence it fails to account for the successful reference of a noun phrase like \"the clock\" in (5) Did you wind the clock?

Attributive use asserts something about","\"whoever or whatever is the so-and-so\"; referential","use is intended to allow the hearer to identify at once,","in his own terms, who or what is being talked about.","(10) I will call the two uses of definite descriptions I have in mind the attributive use and the referential use. A speaker who uses a definite description attributively in an asser-tion states something about whoever or whatever is the so-and-so. A speaker who uses a definite description referentially in an assertion, on the other hand, uses the description to enable his audience to pick out whom or what he is talking about and states something about that person or thing. In the first case the definite description might be said to occur essentially, for the speaker wishes to assert something about whatever or whoever fits that description; but in the referential use the definite description is merely one tool for doing a certain job-- calling attention to a person or thing-- and in general any other device for doing the same job, an-other description or a name, would do as well. In the attributive use, the attribute of being the so-and-so is all important, while it is not in the referential use.","To illustrate this distinction, in the case of a single sentence, consider the sentence, \"Smith's murderer is insane\". Suppose first that we come upon poor Smith foully murdered. From the brutal manner of the killing and the fact that Smith was the most lovable person in the world, we might exclaim, \"Smith's murderer is insane\". I will assume, to make it a simpler case, that in a quite or-dinary sense we do not know who murdered Smith (though this is not in the end essential to the case). This I shall say, is an attributive use of the definite description.","The contrast with such a use of the sentence is one of those situations in which we expect and intend our audience to realize whom we have in mind when we speak of Smith's murderer and, most importantly, to know that it is this person about whom we are going to say something.","For example, suppose that Jones has been charged with Smith's murder and has been placed on trial. Imagine that there is a discussion of Jones's odd behavior at his trial. We might sum up our impression of his behavior by saying, \"Smith's murderer is in-sane\". If someone asks to whom we are referring, by using this description, the answer here is \"Jones\". This, I shall say, is a referential use of the definite description.","The distinction is brought out nicely by the following pair of sentences from Moore [17] and their corresponding semantic net representations (Figures 4 and 5).

In the past the President has been killed and it has taken a while to swear in the new President. During this time there is no President, yet (llb) is still true. In (lla), by contrast, the referent of \"the President\", president-1, is not a role in \"the President is married\", as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, we are not at liberty to have the referent change with time.6 The referential/attributive distinction might have been ascribed to differences of scope in quantified expressions.

In these examples, the subject plays the same role in both conjuncts.

However, (15a) cannot mean that the chickens are ready to be eaten and the children are ready to do the eating. Sentence (15b) illustrates the same point.

(Not surprisingly, given my account, this is a difficult reading for people to construct.) Finally, (22c) gives the by-now-familiar referential case where every boy is constrained to wanting the same lion. 7 Let us now turn to a discussion of the discourse iteration construct used in (22b).","(23a) (FOR EVERY X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X)) Every X in CLASS that satisfies P also satisfies Q.","(23b) (FOR SOME X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X)) Some X in CLASS that satisfies P also satisfies Q.","(23c) (FOR GEN X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X)) A generic X in CLASS that satisfies P also satisfies Q.","(23d) (FOR THE X / CLASS : (P X) ; (Q X)) The single X in CLASS that satisfies P also satisfies Q.

The key words EVERY, SOME, GEN, THE, and so on, specify a particular enumeration function.","I prefer to represent quantified phrases in terms of role-in links (interpretable as Skolem dependencies) rather than iteration procedures, and to use predicates on intensions and sets in addition to predicates on individuals. By converting Woods' FOR construct to my notation, the difference between the two referential readings of \"every boy wants a lion\" can be spelled out in more detail as shown in (24a) and (24b) below. (Note that (24a) is a slight elaboration of (22b), and that (24b) is identical to (22c)). (24a) captures both the EVERY and GENeric options. In both cases, lions are individuated by the boys who want them. The individuating is represented by the role-in link (Skolem modification) from lion-1 to want-boy-lion- 1. (24a) Every boy wants his own lion. 4.1 Procedural Representation of Knowledge","By procedural representation of knowledge, I mean knowledge in the form of procedures. For example, the knowledge that every boy wants a lion could be cast in the form \"if one were to check every boy in question and count those who want lions, then the count of those who want lions would be equal to the count of the boys checked\". Woods [30] introduced a FOR iteration construct for representing knowledge of quantified propositions procedurally. 8 Examples of the use of this construct are:","7 Partee [19] points out that this type of sentence and those of the previous section pose a problem for the analysis of the indefinite article in terms of the features +specific [7]. Something more is needed to produce all the readings. Features can be used as follows: if a hearer has decided a node is definitely attributive it can be marked +attributive, if it is referential the co-descriptor is shown.

I use it here because it is simple, is well explained by Woods, and will facilitate comparison of my sugges-tions with Woods' earlier work. 144 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 William A.

In this case, all the boys want the same lion. Since lions are not individuated with respect to boys, there is no motivation to introduce an iteration (or Skolem dePendency). On this reading, \"every boy wants a lion\" can be conceptualized just like \"a boy wants a lion\". 4.2 Collectives, Distributives, and Pluralities","In applying predicates to pluralities, we must be careful not to confuse a predicate on a plurality with a predicate on a collective. If a process, like wanting, is done by a plurality, then a plurality of wantings occurs. This contrasts with a collective, which acts as a single unit. Fauconnier [5] demonstrates this distinction with (25). (25a) The men {gathered, united, quarreled}, collective (25b) The men took off their hats. distributive (25c) The men carried the couch, plurality As a further example, observe that in","(26) Everybody gave $1000 to many of the men. we must decide whether the men receiving money receive $1000 apiece or just participate in a group receiving $1000. We must also decide whether \"everybody\" acted individually or collectively. Note that one cannot personally receive $1000 if $1000 is given to a group he is in, but one can be personally told the news if the news is told to a group he is in. From this we see that the distributive reading may or may not require a separate instance of some state or process for each individual.","A plural noun group may be understood in any of","the three ways. Vendler [27] gives examples intended","to show that the choice between \"each\" and \"every\"","influences our preferences.","(27) Suppose I show you a basket of apples and I tell you, \"Take all of them\". If you started to pick them one by one I should be surprised. My offer was sweeping: you should take the apples, if possible, \"en bloc\". Had I said, \"Take every one of them,\" I should not care how you took them, provided you do not leave any behind. If I say, \"Take each of","them,\" one feels that the sentence is unfin-","ished. Something like, \"Take each of them","and examine them in turn,\" is expected.","Thus I expect you to take them one after the","other not missing any.","\"All\" favors collective interpretation, but permits dis-","tributive interpretation. \"Every\" favors distributive","interpretation. \"Each\" strongly favors distributive","interpretation and favors distinct actions for each indi-","vidual. 4.3 Multiple Iterations","The previous sections suggested that an iteration need be constrUcted only when two descriptions in the sentence are related in a special way, e.g., where one is individuated by the other. Otherwise, predicates on collectives or pluralities provide an adequate description. In this way, I avoid iteration, which \"is relatively expensive from a computational perspective. There are other ways to eliminate iterations. For example, the apparent double iteration in sentence (28a) can be reduced to a single iteration. Formula (28b) represents the natural reading where each cork is associated with one bottle. It might appear that it requires two nested FOR loops as in (28c), but in fact, it can be implemented with a single loop (28d). (28a) Each cork is fastened to each bottle by a","small wire basket. (28b) (¥x) (Vy) if x is a cork & y is a bottle","& x is the cork in bottle y","then x is fastened to y by a small","wire basket. (28c) Forall x in corks do two nested loops","Forall y in bottles","if x is the cork in bottle y then","x is fastened to y by a small wire basket. (28d) Forall y in bottles do single loop","let x = the cork in bottle y","x is fastened to y by a small wire basket. Most people understand this sentence by iterating over bottles and individuating the corks by the bottles. The single loop implementation can be derived straightforwardly from my representation. In some other representation, it may require a very clever compiler optimization, such as \"loop jamming\".","Sentences (29a) and (29b) are similar to (28a) in this respect. (29a) All the boys kissed all the girls. (29b) Each man and each woman will be joined","in marriage here tonight. These sentences provide evidence that a quantifier like \"each\" doesn't necessarily set up an iteration. It usually does, and therefore these sentences are a bit odd. But these sentences are understood when each distributed quantified expression has a discourse co-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 145 William A.

Setting up an iteration in (29a) and (29b) expresses the specific dependence of boys on girls, and of each man and woman on each other. (34) sail-boat motor-boat 4.4 Human Processing of Quantified Expressions","In the previous example we could have had each man married to each woman! Indeed, it is not always obvious how an iteration should be constructed. When someone hears the statement","(30) A requirement for the course is the carv-ing of a block of wood into each of the 12 designs. his reasoning might be as follows: \"Well, let's see. We take the wood and carve the first design. (He pursues the distributive referential reading with one block.) Oh! Oh! Now how do we carve a second design, the block is used up. Well, maybe we could fit the twelve designs on one block, or we could cut the block into twelve pieces. Or maybe I should abandon the referential reading and use twelve blocks.\" There can be no doubt that world knowledge (pragmatics) is required to choose between such readings. Consider now the following pair of sentences. (31a) Everybody at MIT knows a dialect of LISP. (31b) Everybody at IJCAI knows a dialect of LISP. Everyone at a university might conceivably know the same specific dialect, while everyone at an international conference might not.","Van Lehn [26] reports that when people are given a sentence like","(32) A quick test confirmed that every drug was psychoactive. they claim they understand it, but are then unable to state whether there was one test per drug or only one test for all. This ambiguity can be expressed in predicate calculus using quantifiers. (33a) (] test) (V drug) C(test, drug) (33b) (¥ drug) (3 test) C(test, drug) But in my representation, the ambiguity is represented by the presence or absence of a role-in link, which makes it easy to delay disambiguation. There is no shuffling of quantifiers to shift between the two interpretations; instead, disambiguation is achieved by simply inserting a role-in link, when and if appropriate. 4.5 Ambiguity and Generality","The problem with (32) arises in part because of the difficulty of distinguishing between a"]},{"title":"general","paragraphs":["expression and an"]},{"title":"ambiguous","paragraphs":["one.

This contrasts with","(35) = =","pronoun-mine mineral-mine where there is no generalization of the"]},{"title":"pronoun-mine","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"mineral-mine","paragraphs":["senses of \"mine\". Finally, (36) A quick test confirmed ? th~t every drug /////%',,,,,,~,~ p sy c h o act i ve forall drugs forsome test forsome test forall drugs points out that it is uncertain whether \"a quick test confirmed that every drug was psychoactive\" has a general sense. The general sense of \"boat\" is resolved semantically -- by choosing between more specific concepts such as \"sailboat\" or \"motorboat\". If (35) does have a general sense it might be resolved semantically, but it might also be resolved pragmatically -- by binding the concept into the discourse structure in different ways. Philosophers have largely ignored this issue since they have been interested in formal languages whose terms are logically unambiguous. Van Lehn's results would tend to indicate that people do have a general sense of this expression.","The advantage of the representational scheme proposed here is that it allows the resolution of ambiguity by incrementally adding to what is already present. We have discussed many reasons why scoping decisions should be delayed, ranging from computational efficiency to Van Lehn's empirical observations. Role-in links provide a simple way to accomplish this. 5. Conclusion: The Asymmetry of Roles","Roles introduce a very interesting asymmetry. In my representation, the meaning of a node depends on its"]},{"title":"roles","paragraphs":["in more aggregate entities, not just on its"]},{"title":"constituents.","paragraphs":["For example, I use role-in links as Skolem modifiers where others have employed quantifier scope. In this way, I can represent quantificational dependencies a8 role-in links to nodes representing more aggregate entities. I have argued that roles are a natural device for explaining many linguistic and philosophical distinctions, and they are convenient for computational processing.","Section 3 showed how roles can help represent referring expressions. The referential/attributive dis-146 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 William A. Martin Roles, Co-Descriptors, and the Formal Representation of Quantified English Expressions tinction was formulated in terms of roles so that the attributive use asserts something as a role in such-and-such whereas the referential use asserts something as being the such-and-such without a role dependency. I choose to use roles where others (e.g. Moore) have employed scope dependencies, because the ambiguity persists even when the scoping context is unavailable, as in \"The president has owned a terrier since February\". In this way, I can delay the binding decision because I can represent the dependencies (or lack thereof) without hypothesizing an outer context.","Furthermore, I have argued that verb phrase dele-tion provides additional support for the claim that role dependencies are associated with references, not with contexts. That is, in a sentence like \"The prosecutor believed that he would win the case, and so did the defense attorney\", there are two ways to interpret \"he\": as a co-descriptor of the subject or as a co-descriptor of the prosecutor. Note that whichever way it is taken in the first conjunct, it will be taken the same way in the second. There is a natural explana-tion for this if the co-description dependency is associated with the reference \"he\", whereas in a system where this dependency was associated with the context, an ad hoc stipulation would be required.","Section 4 argued that quantifier dependencies should be associated with references as opposed to contexts. My approach leads to a natural representation for collectives, distributives, and pluralities. By minimizing the differences in the representation of these three cases, an interpreter is in a better position to delay binding decisions. This is consistent with Van Lehn's empirical observations. Furthermore collectives and pluralities can be interpreted without iteration, saving considerable processing effort.","References and Related Work","1. Brachman, R.J.

Martin, Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and in the Sloan School of Management at MIT and a long-time member of the Association for Computational linguistics, died Tuesday, June 2, 1981, after an extended illness. He was 43.","Bill Martin managed to crowd into an all-too-short life three distinct research careers. After receiving his doctorate from MIT, he, in association with Joel Moses, led the MACSYMA development project. MACSYMA, a computer system for applied mathematicians, has become one of the few large applied-AI systems that have evergrowing user communities. He then switched into the field of automatic programming, where he was responsible for developing the PROTOSYSTEM automatic programming system. This effort culminated in the development of HIBOL, a high-level businessoriented language. Changing fields once again, Bill became an expert in computational linguistics, concentrating on problems in parsing and knowledge representation.","Bill's involvement with computational linguistics was triggered by the need he perceived for a natural language interface to PROTOSYSTEM. His early efforts in this area began with an investigation of the structure of dialogues. This led to the development of first MAPL and later OWL as formal languages for representing knowledge of English, of the application domain, and of PROTOSYSTEM's procedures. Subsequently, the problems of English language processing came to be the focal point of his work, motivating his full concentration on computational linguistics during the last few years.","Bill's foremost talents were his ability to acquire an immense knowledge of both the most significant and the most intricate problems of any domain that he chose to focus on and his ability to forge and maintain a large coherent research project. His attention has alternated between these two somewhat dissimilar motifs, as individual researcher and as project head. He was a first-rate engineer throughout, one who believed and put into practice the notion that good engineering principles could be used to resolve all scientific and application problems. Believing in the notion of a \"small infinity,\" Bill demonstrated, on many occasions, that seemingly unbounded problems will succumb to the careful analysis of their hundreds of cases, when the \"infinity\" of their complexity is indeed only on the order of hundreds.","Bill was a native of Oklahoma City, graduating from Northwest Classen High School, where he made his mark as a wrestler as well as a student. He was an Oklahoma state wrestling champion, and continued his active interest in athletics as an undergraduate at MIT, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He received the bachelor's, master's, and PhD degrees from MIT in 1960, 1962, and 1967, respectively, all in electrical engineering, and was appointed to the MIT faculty in 1968.","He survived by his wife, Susan Y. Forbes Martin; three children, Jamie, Tad, and Jon; his parents Earl and Barbara Martin of Oklahoma City; and a sister Jane Anne Slane, also of Oklahoma City. A memorial fund has been established in Professor Martin's name by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. It will award an annual prize for the best MIT undergraduate thesis in computer science. 148 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981"]}]}
