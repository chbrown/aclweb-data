Arrangements were proceeding smoothly, with the banquet and Presidential Address yet to come. [The final figures for at-tendance are: 187 total, including 40 students; 44 new members were added to ACL; 140 people attended the banquet.] Secretary-Treasurer's Report","He reviewed the financial status of the Association for 1980 and the period of 1981 through 5-31. The income figures for the two periods were $24,796.89 and $25,973.41, respectively; the corresponding expenses, $19,601.38 and $17,127.14; the balances, $5,195.51 and $8,846.27; and the assets, $31,645.64 and $40,491.91.

For those four periods, the numbers of individual members were 500, 444, 658, and approximately 800; for institutional members, they were 201, 218, 249, and 218; with total membership figures of 701, 662, 907, and approximately 1000. Although in mid-passage, the effort to recruit members certainly has produced results. [Revised provisional figures for the full calendar year are included in the attachment at the end of these minutes instead of the material presented at the meeting. The corresponding figures for all of 1982 are 1190 individual, 257 institutional, and 1447 total. A grand tribute to the membership drive.]","Jim Moore described the membership drive, which involved the creation of a poster and the assembling of lists of relevant organizations and of members from a large number of such organizations to mobilize a large mailing. In addition, booths were set up at the National Computer and Office Automation Conferences [and subsequently at IJCAI in Vancouver] to distribute information. [Although the cost has been high, over $7,000, the additional 450-500 members added in this manner has provided good justification.] A suggestion was made that solicitations to increase institutional membership be made by asking members to ask their libraries to subscribe.

He expressed his appreciation to the Associate Editor, the Editorial Board, the referees, the President, and the Secretary-Treasurer. Heidorn asked for more papers, more technical reports for inclusion in the abstracts, announcements of all kinds, and expressions of interest in book reviews. 260 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 4, October-December 1981 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Minutes of the 1981 ACL Meeting Executive Committee Meeting","Sondheimer began a review of topics discussed at the Executive Committee Meeting.","Walker announced that a fund had been established at MIT in honor of Bill Martin, a long time ACL member who had died early in June. Bill was Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and in the Sloan School of Management at MIT. Walker suggested that the ACL contribute $100 to this fund, a recommendation that was unanimously approved.","Walker noted that 1982 would be the twentieth anniversary of the ACL; a commemorative session at the 1982 meeting is being planned.","Martha Evens reported that 75,000 people attended the June National Computer Conference in Chicago.

Kay pointed out that COLING-82 was scheduled for 6-10 July 1982 in Prague; he urged people to submit papers and attend.","Paul Chapin described the plans to publish an ACL Monograph Series, issuing two to three volumes a year. A number of publishers have expressed interest. A variety of kinds of publications are being considered in addition to regular manuscripts: papers from special meetings, theses, collections of published papers. He solicited reactions from the membership. A motion was made by Bill Mann empowering the Executive Committee to organize an editorial board and enter into negotiations for publication of a monograph series; it passed unanimously.","Sondheimer announced that the ACL was gathering information on graduate programs in computational linguistics; Martha Evens and Lauri Karttunen are responsible. Anyone with information on course of-ferings is urged to get in touch with one of them. The need for a careers brochure also is recognized; he solicited volunteers [and succeeded in getting Carole Hafner to accept responsibility].","With regard to relations with other societies, it was noted that SIGART now has Barbara Grosz and Ron Brachman in charge and that both Grosz and Walker are involved with the AAAI.","Sondheimer remarked on his concerns for funding cuts by the federal government; he indicated that the ACL was expressing these concerns in Washington and trying to mobilize other professional societies to do likewise.

They will occupy some 325,00 net square feet of exhibit space, up 95,000 net square feet from NCC '81. In addition, a technical program will focus on \"Advancing Professionalism.\" Its aim is to emphasize the fact that even as systems become in-creasingly ubiquitous through office automation and home computing, there are methods for building them to be usable, reliable, and efficient.","The two ACL-sponsored sessions are scheduled for Wednesday, June 9, and will address the topics of machine-readable dictionaries and natural language help systems.
