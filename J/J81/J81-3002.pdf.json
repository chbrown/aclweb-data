{"sections":[{"title":"Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic Veronica Dahl Department of Mathematics University of Buenos Aires Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA We discuss the use of logic for natural language (NL) processing, both as an internal query language and as a programming tool. Some extensions of standard predicate calculus are motivated by the first of these roles. A logical system including these extensions is informally described. It incorporates semantic as well as syntactic NL features, and its semantics in a given interpretation (or data base) determines the answer-extraction process. We also present a logic-programmed analyser that translates Spanish into this system. It equates semantic agreement with syntactic weil-formedness, and can detect certain presuppositions, resolve certain ambiguities and reflect relations among sets. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The idea of using logic as a conceptual framework in question-answering systems is not new. The fact that it can formally deal with the notion of logical consequence makes it particularly attractive for representing meaning. Standard predicate calculus, however, does not seem adequate for representing all the semantic features of natural language (NL), e.g. presuppositions and the subtleties of meaning involved in NL quantifiers. Nevertheless, some recent develop-ments indicate that logic can play an important role in NL processing.","In the first place, recent linguistic research [15,18] has arrived at interesting results concerning the extension of standard predicate calculus in order to provide a better formal model of language.","Secondly, programming in logic [19,29] has become possible since the development of the PROLOG programming language at Marseille [3,5,27]. Logic can now be used both as the underlying formalism and as the programming tool. As has been shown in [30], no loss in efficiency need be involved with respect to languages such as LISP, even though higher level features are supported in PROLOG (e.g. non-determinism).","Thirdly, most PROLOG implementations include a version of metamorphosis grammars (MGs), a logic-based formalism useful in particular for describing NL processors in terms of very powerful rewriting rules"]},{"title":"[5].","paragraphs":["Finally, the evolution in data base technology has been tending more and more towards the use of logic, both for data description and for queries [14].","Drawing on these developments, we have implemented (starting in 1976) successive experimental data base query systems, each written entirely in PROLOG.","The first system [6] represented the hardware and software catalogues for the Solar 16 series of computers. The user could ask it to build up a computer con-figuration satisfying his particular needs. We then developed a simpler but more general system which accepts different data bases to be consulted in Spanish or in French [7]. This system was later adapted to Portuguese consultation by H. Coelho and L. Pereira (personal communication, 1978), and to English consultation by D. Warren and F. Pereira (personal communication, 1980). In both cases, notably few modifications were needed.","The data base querying features that evolved from the development of these successive systems were coupled with NL representation features into a single logical formalism. Its linguistic motivation and general outline has been described by A. Colmerauer in [4], and its motivation from the data base querying view-point has been studied in [10]. The formal definition corresponding precisely to our multilingual system can be found in [11].","In this paper we present a thorough description of the main principles underlying'these NL processors.

Then we present an informal definition of the logical system possessing these features which serves as our internal query language. Finally, we show a step-by-step development of a PROLOG analyser for Spanish, after an informal description of our programming tools.","A complete listing of our PROLOG Spanish grammar is given in the Appendix in the Microfiche Supplement to this issue of the Journal.","The discussion of our analyzer is not intended to be normative: alternative solutions for the problems we encountered are certainly conceivable. Moreover, many of our choices were constrained by the hardware and software tools available to us. We merely show one way of using logic throughout a NL query system, which has proved feasible within modest computational environments. (Our system was first implemented on a 32K, T-1600 minicomputer, using a 1975 version of PROLOG.)","The research reported here has motivated further work on logic-programmed NL processors for data bases (e.g. [2,22,32], and on the need of extending the original MG formalism [24]. On the other hand, the data base component of this system, together with that of the SOLAR 16 system [6], has also influenced other researchers (cf. [2,31]).","A comprehensive description of the data base component of our system can be found in [13]. The SOLAR 16 system has only been reported in [6]. 2. Mapping Natural Language into Logic","This section discusses several NL processing problems and suggests ways of solving them, through careful choices for the internal language's features. We arrive at a typed, three-valued, set-oriented logical system, which we shall call L3. Its role is a double one. On the one hand, its syntax serves as a more rigorous and informative alternative to NL, making semantic features of NL sentences explicit. On the other hand, its semantics provides a clear definition of the answer-extraction process: the evaluation of an L3 formula yields either a truth value (corresponding to a yes-no question) or the representation of a set (corresponding to a wh-question). Spanish is used as the concrete point of reference. Related work for French is [4]. 2.1 Meaningfulness, Ambiguity and Semantic Types","A NL processing system must have a means for checking semantic as well as syntactic well-formedness, in order to reject semantically anomalous sentences.","A widespread solution to this problem consists in first generating a \"deep structure\" of the sentence, taking only syntax into account, and then performing all the necessary semantic operations and checks on it.","As has already been observed [26], this often implies a tradeoff between syntactic and semantic complexity. But it should be emphasized that it is overall simplicity and efficiency that are important. It seems likely, at least for limited computational resources and a given coverage of NL, that a several-pass analyser will take more space and time than a one-pass analyser.","Mtrreover~ linguists themselves are not unanimous as to whether the semantic component should be separate or intermingled with the syntactic component [21].","While taking no sides in this discussion, we shall describe a framework in which syntactic and semantic analysis take place during a one-pass, non-deterministic process, and which, as we have said, has proved sufficient even on small machines.","Where logic is concerned, there is a simple and elegant way of dealing with meaningfulness: by using types. Types, by the way, are also a useful means for associating the universe of predicate calculus to the relations in a particular data base.","They are also useful for improving efficiency: a) by narrowing the search space, as only those values in a variable's associated domain (or type) need be considered, and b) by avoiding futile access to the data base, as absurd queries can be rejected by the analyser on the grounds of domain incompatibility.","Another interest in using types is that they provide an efficient means for discarding readings that are syntactically acceptable but semantically incorrect. Take for instance the query: Cu~l es el salario del empleado que vive en Lomas? What is the salary of the employee who lives in Lomas?","From syntax alone, there is no way to decide whether the antecedent of the relative clause is \"the salary of the employee\" or \"the employee\". But in a type-checking system in which the first argument of the relation \"live\" is associated with the human domain, and in which employees--and not salaries--are known to belong to this same domain, the first reading is not even possible.","Ambiguities concerning different meanings of a word can often be resolved through domain checking.","Types can also be used to place modifiers other than relative clauses. Our system, however, does not exploit them in this way, although it does check that the modifiers it encounters are of the expected type. 150 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 Veronica Dahl Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic","Finally, let us mention that types in a finite world can contribute to solving an important problem arising in PROLOG programs in which negation is defined by proof failure (i.e., the failure to prove a given fact is taken as proof of its negative counterpart). This is the case for most practical data bases. As a discussion of this problem falls outside the scope of this paper, the interested reader is referred to [12]. 2.1.1 Contextual Typing","The use of variable typing to constrain the parse and aid in disambiguation is not new. Many language processors--such as LUNAR [34], CO-OP [17], LAD-DER [16], PHLIQA1 [1]--resort to some kind of typing to provide these capabilities.","In our particular approach, the selection of a semantic interpretation is dynamically made on a syntactic basis. This takes place automatically, in the standard PROLOG matching of terms. A simplified explanation follows, and more precise details are given in a later section.","Briefly, referential words (nouns, verbs and adjectives) parse into predicates whose arguments are typed. For instance, the verb \"to paint\" might induce predicates of the form: paint (person-x,object-y)","The expected types of a predicate's arguments are given in lexical entries. Ambiguous referential words have a lexical entry for each possible combination of meaning and syntactic role they can accept. For instance, the word \"blue\" can designate an object's col-our or a person's mood, giving rise to the following entries: Adjective (sad(person-x)) = blue Adjective(blue (object-x)) = blue where the function terms act as internal representations of the word. During the parsing process, which is non-deterministic, the correct parse is automatically chosen by matching appropriate terms. For instance, \"Which blue door is John painting?\" \" \" would generate a formula containing predicates of the form \"door(t-z)\", ,I","• paint(person-John,t-z)\" and \"p(t-z)\", where p is either \"sad\" or \"blue\". Only those lexical rules allow-ing t to take a value (namely, t=object) that is compatible with its three occurrences will result in a successful parse. Thus, the \"sad\" interpretation is ruled out by type requirements.","As we shall see later, types are actually represented by expressions that reflect subcategorizations and allow for domain intersections to be found automatically simply by leaving the PROLOG interpreter to match these expressions.","2.2 Presuppositions, Quantifiers and a Three-Valued Logic","Typed calculus in itself is not enough to make all sentences meaningful. A third logical truth value would be useful, because in NL there are two ways in which a statement may fail to be true: either because its negation holds, or because something presupposed by the statement fails to be satisfied. In the latter case, the statement is felt to be pointless rather than false.","There is another reason why it must not be considered false. Take for instance the statement: El sombrerero loco odia a Alicia. The mad hatter hates Alice. In a context in which no hatter is mad, it is obviously not true. However, we cannot consider it false either, since then the statement El sombrerero loco no odia a Alicia. The mad hatter does not hate Alice. would have to be considered true.","The nonexistence of a referent for the definite noun phrase makes the whole sentence pointless. The existence of more than one referent would also make it pointless. This is because the Spanish singular definite article induces a presupposition of existence and uniqueness on the noun phrase's referent. Our treatment of quantification has been devised to","account for those presuppositions induced by NL","quantifiers. We prefer to call them \"determiners\" \", as","they include all articles, cardinal numbers and words","l'","'1","II","'1","such as some , many , etc.","If a sentence contains a determiner, a quantification of the form \"those(x,p)\" is introduced, where x is a typed variable and p is a logical formula in our system. Its evaluation yields the set of all x's in x's associated domain which satisfy p. According to the determiner's meaning, presuppositions about the cardinality of such a set are represented within the output formula. For instance, \"Three blind mice run\" is represented as","equal(card(those(x,and(mice(x), and(blind(x) ,run(x) )) ) ),3 ) which says that the cardinality of the set of those blind mice that run is 3.","Definite articles introduce the formula \"if(fl,f2)\", the value of which is \"pointless\" whenever fl fails to be satisfied, and has the same value as f2 if fl is true.","Figure 1 shows an example, using the easier-to-picture tree representation. The formula represented in Figure 1 will evaluate to \"pointless\" if the set of mad hatters does not contain exactly one element. American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 151 Veronica Dahl Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic if I equal hate","I I ..................... I l l I card ! those Alice I I those .......... I I I",".......... x and I I I","x and ...........","I I I ............ hatter mad","I l I I hatter mad x x L I X X Figure 1. Representation of \"The mad hatter hates Alice\".","Examples of pragmatically based systems are PHLIQA1 [1] and CO-OP [17]. The semantic approach is taken for instance in [23], where it serves in particular to check presuppositions induced by pronouns. 2.2.1 Spanish Determiners and Their Translations","We can now examine the general process by which a determiner introduces a \"those\" formula. Let us consider a sentence consisting of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase, in which the noun phrase contains a noun introduced by a determiner. We can first represent the sentence through a three-branched quantification of the form: q(x,fl,f2) where q is a quantifier into which the determiner translates, fl is the noun phrase's translation, and f2 is the verb phrase's translation. Intuitively, fl specifies the domain of quantification, and q states what portion of the domain f2 holds for. Our previous example, for instance, can first be represented as in Figure 2.","Notice that the \"if\" formula could be used for representing other types of presuppositions as well (e.g., those of factive predicates), although our system only uses it for the presuppositions of definite articles.","An alternative approach to false presupposition","detection is the pragmatic one, in which false presup-","positions are caught by noting their empty extensions","in the data base, and a two-valued logic is preserved.","The question of whether a pragmatic or a semantic","analysis of presuppositions is best is far from settled,","and we shall not attempt to solve it here. Let us","merely note the following:","a) The pragmatic and semantic approaches are not incompatible: one can both report pragmatically detected failed assumptions, and assign non-traditional truth values to the sentences containing them.","b) Subtler truth-value assignments facilitate low-cost overall responses of the system. For instance, a given presupposition's failure can both be pointed out during its local evaluation, and carried on (via truth-values) to upper levels, for the system itself to see and to possibly take further action of its own (such as trying alternative ways of complying with the request).","Although not exploited in this sense in our system, this feature would allow a more flexible treatment of presuppositions, as it would enable the system to decide, for instance, in which cases they can be safely and usefully ignored. the","I .................................. I I and hate ......................","l I I t hatter mad x Alice l l X X Figure 2. A first representation of \"The mad hatter hates Alice\".","In our implementation, a variable's associated domain depends both on fl and f2 in the following manner: each predicate known to the data base system has a domain associated with each of its arguments. For instance, \"mad\" and \"hatter\" could require their arguments to belong to the human domain, whereas \"hate\" could require its first argument to belong to the animal domain.","When a three-branched quantification is generated, the variable it creates is typed by the intersection of all those domains it has been associated with by the predicates appearing in either fl or f2. In our example, x's type would be human (the intersection of the human and the animal domains).","Instead of generating a different quantifier for each determiner, it is useful to represent all quantifications through a single one of the form: 152 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 Veronica Dab! Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic for(x,p,c) the intuitive meaning of which is: \"c holds for the set E of all x's in x's domain which satisfy p\". In the formula c, the set E will be represented simply by the variable x, so that x plays a double role.","Each quantification is thus assigned an equivalent \"for\" expression, in which the determiner's meaning is represented. Here are the representations of some of our Spanish quantifiers. The rest are considered in Section 2.2.1.2. un(x,fl,f2) = for(x,and(fl,f2),greater-than(card(x),0)) a todo(x,f 1 ,f2) = for(x,and(fl ,not(f2)),equal(card(x),0)) every el(x,f 1 ,f2) = for(x,fl ,if(equal(card(x), 1 ),f2)) singular the los (x,f 1 ,f2) = for(x,f 1 ,if(greater-than(card(x), 1 ),f2)) plural the ningfin(x,fl,f2) = for(x,and(fl,f2),equal(card(x),0)) no i(x,fl,f2) = for(x,and(fl,f2),equal(card(x),i)) any cardinal number unos(x,fl,f2) = algunos(x,fl,f2) = some for(x,and(fl,f2),greater-than(card(x),l))","Notice that we have chosen to translate \"un\" (a) as \"at least one\" (a frequent sense for \"un\"). In order to avoid ambiguity, \"1\" should be used to mean \"exactly one\". This convention is particularly useful when negation is involved. For instance, \"No tengo un centavo\" (I have not a cent) would be wrongly represented in the \"exactly one\" interpretation: it would state that the number of cents I possess is not one,which means it can either be 0,2,3, etc.","Finally, any formula of the form \"for(x,p,c)\" can be replaced by just the formula c, in which all occurrences of x have been replaced by the formula: those(x,p) representing the subset of x's domain whose elements satisfy p. This replacement takes place in the data base component of our system.","The reader can now verify that the representations shown in Figures 1 and 2 are equivalent. 2.2.1.1 Quantifier Hierarchy","In our NL subset, quantifier hierarchy obeys the following three rules, which perhaps are too simplistic, but have proved useful. A more thorough description can be found in [4].","Rule 1: A determiner in a verb's subject introduces a quantification which dominates all quantifications introduced by the verb's complement(s). For instance, \"Toda rosa tiene (algunas) espinas\" (Every rose has (some) thorns) is represented: toda(x,rosa(x),algunas(y,espinas(y),tiene(x,y))) every rose some thorns has Notice that the representation some(y,thorn(y),every(x,rose(x),has(x,y))) would be incorrect, as it means instead: \"there exists a particular set of thorns which every rose has\". - Rule 2: Whenever a noun has a complement, the quantification introduced by the complement's determiner dominates the one introduced by the noun's determiner. For instance, \"Sfibato autografia el libro de cada visitante\" (Sizbato autographs the book of each visitor) is represented: cada(x,visitante(x),el(y,libro-de(x,y),","autografia(Sabato,y))) each visitor the book-of autographs - Rule 3: When a referential word (a verb, a noun or an adjective) has more than one complement, quantification takes place from right to left: the rightmost complement generates a quantification which dominates the quantification(s) introduced by the leftmost complement(s). For instance, \"Rafil regala un espejo a cada nifio\" (Raid gives a mirror to each child) is represented: cada(x,nino(x),un(y,espejo(y),regala(Raul,y,x))) each child a mirror gives 2.2.1.2 Determiners with a Negative Implication","As a general rule, the negation introduced by \"no\" in a sentence is translated by placing the operator \"no\" (not) right after the quantification introduced by the subject. For instance, \"La indemnizaci6n no compensa el despido de Martin\" (The indemnity does not compensate for Martin's dismissal) is represented: la(x,indemnizacion(x),no(el(y,despido-de(Martin,y),","compensa(x,y)))) the indemnity not the dismissal-of compensate","But negation is not always explicit. The Spanish determiner \"ningfin\" (no) can be regarded as an implicit negation, since it expresses that no portion of the domain of quantification satisfies the statement involved.","In a non-inverted subject position (e.g., \"Ningfin elefante vuela\" -No elephant flies), it generates a special quantifier called \"ningfin\", the representation of which takes this fact into account, as we have seen.","There are two other cases, however, in which the determiner \"ningfin\" coexists with an explicit negation. These cases require a different quantifier, as otherwise American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 153 Veronica Dahl Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic the negation would be represented twice. These cases are: - In a subject position, with subject-verb inversion: the \"ningfln\" determiner is assimilated to the \"every\" quantifier. For instance, \"No vino ningfln alumno\" (No student came) is represented: todo(x,alumno(x),no(vino(x))) every student not came -","In a position other than the subject: the \"ningfln\" determiner is assimilated to the indefinite article's quantifier. For instance, \"Carlos no tiene ningfln hijo\" (Carlos has not any chiM) is represented: no(un(x,hijo (x),tiene (Carlos,x))) not a child has","Another special case is the negation preceding the \"todo\" (every) determiner, e.g. \"No todo p~jaro can-ta\" (Not every bird sings). The analyser considers \"no todo\" as a single determiner generating its own associated quantifier:","no-todo(x,fl,f2) = for(x,and(fl ,not (f2)),greater-than(card(x),0)) 2.3 Distributive, Collective, and Respective Plural","Semantically, different kinds of plurals can be distinguished. For instance, the sentence \"Ana y Juan hablan espafiol y franc6s\" (Ann and John speak Spanish and French), which translates roughly into speak({Ann,John], {Spanish,French]), introduces a distributive plural and must therefore evaluate to true (false) if the following formulas are all true (false): speak(Ann,Spanish) speak(John,Spanish) speak(Ann,French) speak(John,French) On the other hand, the sentence \"A y B son paralelas\" (A and B are parallel), which translates into parallel({A,B]), introduces a collective plural and must evaluate to either true or false as a result of testing the whole set {A,B} for the property of being parallel.","Finally, the sentence \"Ana y Juan ganan respectivamente 1000 y 800 dolares\" (Ann and John respectively earn 1000 and 800 dollars), which translates into earn({Ann,John], {$1000,$800}), introduces a respective plural and must evaluate to true (false) if the following formulas are both true (false): earn(Ann,$1000) earn(John,S800)","Notice that both distributive and respective plurals presuppose that the set of formulas to be tested all have the same truth value. Whenever such a presupposition is not satisfied, the plural predication is neither true nor false. In the logic L3, the predication is assigned the \"pointless\" truth value; but in an improvement of this system, we are proposing the use of a fourth truth value, called \"mixed\", for this situation. It seems more appropriate to differentiate \"pointless\" and \"mixed\", so that the system has easy access to locally detected semantic information, in case it needs to take further action.","Distributive and collective plurals are distinguished in the lexicon by syntactically marking the relation they translate into.","Respective plurals are not handled in our implementation: they were introduced (although with only two logical values) in the Portuguese version of our system, where the analyser recognizes them through the words \"respective\" and \"respectively\". 2.4 Sets","Relations must be allowed to apply on sets if we are to deal with collective relations. Sets are moreover natural enough in data base applications, as retrieval often concerns sets of objects satisfying certain properties. They can also be useful for defining types. We represent them either extensionally (through lists) or intensionally (through \"those\" formulas).","Set operations are implicit while parsing--as dynamic type checking involves intersecting various domains--and also during formula evaluation (i.e., in the data base component of our system). In both cases they are kept invisible to the user.","In particular, the user can refer to either sets or individuals when defining a new relation, and rely on the system to make appropriate inferences from his definitions. 2.5 Linguistic Coverage","Our NL subset is extendible in the sense that the user can define those referential words (nouns, verbs and adjectives) associated with his particular data base. This includes the definition of synonyms, always useful regarding different users' views of a data base.","The analyser uses a syntactic variant of PROLOG, called (normalized) metamorphosis grammars (MGs) [5]. As such, MGs share a most useful feature of logic programs: a problem's description and the program which solves it are one and the same. This is due to the existence of an operational as well as a declarative interpretation for logic programs [19]. 154 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 3, July-September 1981 Veronica Dahl Translating Spanish into Logic through Logic","Thus, the grammar shown in the Appendix (in the Microfiche Supplement) both provides a formal definition of our linguistic coverage (in its declarative reading) and is the analyser itself (in its procedural reading, which the PROLOG interpreter gives it). An informal description of its coverage follows. - Fixed vocabulary Determiners:","el la los las un una unos unas","the a some ningfm todo i no every any cardinal number Prepositions: all Spanish prepositions Conjunction: y and Relative pronouns: que quien donde cuyo cual(es)","~: which who where whose Interrogative pronouns:","qu6 cu~nto(s) d6nde qui6n cu~l","which how much/many where who which Negative particle: no","Variable vocabulary. Each particular data base includes a definition of its associated proper names, nouns, adjectives and verbs. Only simple verbal forms in the third person are allowed. -","Structure. Sentences are either declarative or interrogative, in the active voice. A declarative sentence consists of a subject, an optional negation particle, a verb and its modifiers (in the restricted sense described below).","A subject consists of a noun phrase. A noun phrase is either a series of proper names or a kernel followed by noun modifiers and relative clauses (both optional).","A noun phrase's kernel consists of an optional determiner, an optional series of adjectives, a noun, and possibly a series of adjectival groups. Mass nouns are not dealt with. An adjectival group is an adjective with modifiers.","A modifier (of a noun, an adjective or a verb) is just a noun phrase as described above, possibly introduced by a preposition.","Both relative and interrogative clauses are modified versions of a declarative sentence, where some elements have changed places and some have been replaced by a relative or an interrogative pronoun.","Figure 3 gives a sample consultation session with the system.

The Internal Query Language: L3","Informally, three kinds of L3 formulas can be distinguished: typed formulas t, statement formulas s, and integer formulas n. - a typed formula t denotes a subset of a given domain. It can be either a list of constants, a variable or an expression of the form \"those(x,s)\". - a statement formula s evaluates to either true, false, or pointless. It can take any of the forms:","r(tl ..... tn) where r is an n-ary predicate symbol corresponding to a distributive, collective or respective relation. and(sl,s2) if(s 1,s2) not(s) equal(nl,n2) greater-than(nl,n2) - an integer formula nl denotes an integer number, and can take one of the forms: j where j is an integer such that j>0 card(t) Further details can be found in [11]. 4. Tools for Writing the Analyser","A brief and informal introduction to logic programs and metamorphosis grammars is given here, for the sake of completeness. Fuller accounts can be found in [5,19,20,29]. 4.1 On Logic Programming","Logic programs are essentially sets of clauses of the form: B <-- A1,A2 ..... An called Horn clauses, where B and Ai are atomic formulas, and all variables in the atomic formulas are understood to be universally quantified. \"<--\" is read \"if\", and the commas stand for conjunction. An empty right-hand side denotes a non-conditional assertion of fact. For example,","1) likes(mother(x),x) <-- every x is liked by his-her-its mother","2) likes(Rover,y) <-- likes(y,Rover) Rover likes every y who likes him","In the rest of the paper (except for the figures), variables appear in italics in order to distinguish them from constants.","With respect to a given set of clauses (i.e., a program), the user can ask for relations to be computed, by stating procedure calls, i.e., clauses of the form: <-- A1,A2,...,An","This triggers an automatic demonstration process, during which the variables in the call take values for which \"A1 and A2 and ... and An\" holds. Here \"<--\" can be interpreted as a question mark. An unsuccessful termination implies that no such values exist.","Thus, with respect to clauses 1 and 2 above, the following call:","3) <-- likes(z,Rover) Who likes Rover? results in z being unified (bound) to \"mother(Rover)\". The same result would have been obtained from the call:","4) <-- likes(z,Rover), likes(Rover,z) Who likes and is liked by Rover?","Alternative results for the same call may be obtained within non-deterministic programs.

A rule such as S --> A B is represented as s I I I A B v 0 ....... >0 ....... >0 xO xl x2 or, in Horn-clause terms: arrow(S,xO,x2 ) <-- arrow(A,xO,xl ), arrow(B,xl ,x2 ) which can be read, for every xO, xl and x2, there is an arrow labeled S between points xO and x2 if there is an arrow labeled A between xO and xl and another one labeled B between xl and x2.","Terminals in a rule are included as part of an edge's name and do not give rise to extra atoms. If a terminal symbol \"a\" labels an arc leading to point \"x\", the starting point is named \"a.x\" (where .... is a binary operator in infix notation). Thus, the rule S --> a B S c can be represented:","s ...................................... I I I a B S c v 0 ....... >0 ........ >0 ........ >0 ........ >0 a.xO xO xl c.x2 x2 arrow(S,a.x0,x2 ) <-- arrow(B,x,xl ), arrow(S,xl ,c.x2 )","Strings of consecutive terminals are treated as a single one named after their concatenation. 4.2.2 General Rewriting Rules","When the left-hand side of a rule contains more than one symbol, a single arrow is not enough to de-pict it: we need another path between the extreme points. For instance, the rule B a --> a B can be graphed as: B a.x a",".......... >0","........... I I I a B v 0 .......... >0 .......... >0 a.xO xO x where the lower path represents the right-hand side, as usual, and the upper path represents the left-hand side of the rule. In terms of Horn clauses, this gives: arrow(B,a.xO,a.x) <-- arrow(B,xO,x) Notice that no restrictions need be imposed on the length of the strings on either side of the rule. 4.2.3 A Full Example","Completing the last two rules, we obtain an MG grammar for the language {anbncn}: 1) S --> a B S c 2) S --> a b c 3) B a --> a B 4) B b --> b b where rules 2) and 4) translate respectively into: 2') arrow(S,a.b.c.x,x) <-- 4') arrow(B,b.b.x,b.x) <--","In the Horn-clause formulation of this grammar, recognition and parsing of a given string (e.g. \"a.a.b.b.c.c.nil\") is automatically obtained through the respective PROLOG calls: 5') <-- arrow(S,a.a.b.b.c.c.nil,x) 6') <-- arrow~,a.a.b.b.c.c.nil,x) where the value of x is of no interest to the user. In order that he need not specify it, a PROLOG predicate called \"syn\" (for \"synthesize\") is made available. Its general form is syn(x,y) where x stands for the internal representation of the surface sentence y. The above commands are therefore actually written: 5) <-- syn(S,a.a.b.b.c.c.nil) 6) <-- syn(y,a.a.b.b.c.c.nil) 4.2.4 Parsing and Generating","MGs can also be written for the purpose of generating sentences. The same syn command is used for this purpose, except that this time the second argument is the one represented by a variable, e.g.: <-- syn(S,x)","In some cases, it is even possible for the same grammar to work in both ways, although this requires a very careful design. In the rest of this paper, we shall only be concerned with parsing. 4.2.5 Arguments Within Grammar Symbols","We might normally want the parser to retrieve more information than mere recognition. The grammar shown above, for instance, can be also used to retrieve the substring of a's, if it is modified as follows: 1) S(a.x) --> a B S(x) c 2) S(a) --> a b c Call 6 would now bind y to S(a.a).

Pereira in the first draft of [24].","Notice that, once a variable takes a value, this value is propagated to each of its occurrences in the graph.

The fact that our system has been adapted to consultation in various natural languages without substantial modifications to either the parser or the internal language's features suggests that it might be possible to use a similar framework for language translation. Another possibility is to develop a single, multilingual grammar capable of switching to the user's mother tongue as soon as the dialogue opens.","Finally, let us point out that the evolution in PROLOG's features is likely to make it possible to improve on the implementation, at least, of the ideas presented here. For instance, our set evaluation primitives rely too much upon exhaustive domain enumera-tion. While solving PROLOG's negation problem satisfactorily for small domains, this is inefficient for very large data bases.","Our previous solution--query reordering [6]--was on the whole more adequate, but incurred the overhead of filtering each query through a coroutining interface. A recent DEC-10 PROLOG implementation of this solution [31,32], however, has proved very efficient in the Chat-80 system, which also shares other features with SOLAR 16 (namely, the minimiza-tion of the search space through query reordering and the addition of a set constructor predicate). Some of these features have actually been incorporated as standard into recent PROLOG versions (cf. in [28]), making it possible to develop more powerful systems at a low cost.","Similarly, further MG extensions could make possible a wider linguistic coverage with no loss in efficiency. Provisions for right as well as left extraposition, for instance, would facilitate a full treatment of coordination. 7. Concluding Remarks","Similar ideas to the ones discussed in this paper (in particular, those on quantification (cf. [35])) have influenced other NL data base systems, namely LUNAR [30] and PHLIQA1 [1]. But in spite of the points in common, our general approach is markedly different. We have tried to incorporate all relevant semantic as well as syntactic NL features into a single formalism, in order to do without intermediate sublanguages and have a single process perform the analysis of an input sentence. LUNAR, on the contrary, first generates deep structures and then maps them into a semantic representation. PHLIQA1 has several successive levels of semantic analysis, each requiring a special formal language. Some of them are meant to deal with ambiguity, which in our approach, as we have seen, is dealt with through the contextual typing of variables during the quantification process.","A common disadvantage of this integrated approach--namely, that the syntactic/semantic grammar obtained is too domain-specific and therefore less transportable--is avoided by relegating all domain-specific knowledge to the domain-dependent part of the lexicon (i.e., noun, verb, and adjective definitions). Furthermore, the fact that semantic agreement is equated with syntactic well-formedness evens the relative costs of doing semantic versus syntactic tests.","The use of logic as the single formalism underlying all aspects of our system's development is a distinctive feature of the approach. Logic serves both as the theoretical framework and as the implementation means, In particular, this gives our system a definitely non-procedural flavour: our programs, as we have seen, can be understood in purely declarative terms.

The parser is modular, in the sense that each rule can be understood declaratively by itself. Problem-independent concerns (e.g. backtracking, pattern-matching, etc.) are all left to PROLOG.","Performance. These assets do not imply sacrificing efficiency. Parsing times have been shown to compare favourably against those of the LUNAR system [30], by using an adaptation of our Spanish analyser to English [24, p.276].","As we have also seen, many improvements remain to be made. With the present study we hope to motivate further research into the uses of logic for natural language processing.
