{"sections":[{"title":"Limited Attention and Discourse Structure","paragraphs":["Marilyn A. Walker * ATT Research Laboratories 1. Hierarchical versus Linear Recency In computational theories of discourse, there are at least three processes presumed to operate under a limited attention constraint of some type: (1) ellipsis interpretation; (2) pronominal anaphora interpretation; and (3) inference of discourse relations between representations A and B of utterances in a discourse, e.g. B motivates A. In each case, the interpretation of the current element B of a discourse depends on the accessibility of another earlier element A. According to the limited attention constraint only a limited number of candidates need to be considered in the processing of B, for example, only a limited number of entities in the discourse model are potential cospecifiers for a pronoun.","The limited attention constraint has been defined by some researchers by linear recency: a representation of an utterance A is linearly recent for a representation of an utterance B if A is linearly adjacent to B. Using linear recency as a model of the limited attention constraint would mean that an antecedent for an anaphor is determined by a linear backward search of the text, or of a discourse model representation of the text (Clark and Sengul 1979, inter alia).","In contrast, other work has formulated the limited attention constraint in terms of hierarchical recency (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Hobbs 1985; Mann and Thompson 1987, inter alia). A representation of an utterance A is hierarchically recent for a representation of an utterance B if A is adjacent to B in the tree structure of the discourse. Of all theories based on hierarchical recency, only Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure provides an operationalization of hierarchical recency in terms of their stack model of attentional state (Sidner 1979; Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986). Thus, below, the relationship between limited attention and hierarchical recency will be discussed in terms of their stack model, but the discussion should also apply to claims about the role of hierarchical recency in other work.","In the remainder of this squib, I will argue that the limited attention constraint must account for three types of evidence: (1) the occurrence of informationally redundant utterances in naturally occurring dialogues (Walker 1993); (2) the infelicity of discourses that depend on accessing discourse entities that are not linearly recent; and (3) experiments that show that humans have limited attentional capacity (Miller 1956; Baddeley 1986). 2. Evidence for Limited Attention from Anaphoric Processing In Figure 1, dialogue A, hierarchical recency supports the interpretation of the proforms in utterance (8a) from a radio talk show for financial advice (Pollack, Hirschberg, * ATT Research Laboratories, 600 Mountain Ave., Rm. 2D-441, Murray Hill, NJ 07974.

Hank Is that H A N K? Yes. Go ahead Hank as well as her uh husband. They have a child. and they bring the child to us every day for babysitting. Figure 1 Dialogue B is identical to A except for utterances 6.2 and 6.3. and Webber 1982). In utterance A-5, H interrupts C's narrative to ask for his name, but in A-8, C continues as though A-4 had just been said. Utterance A-8a realizes the proposition my daughter's husband is working as well, but this realization depends on both an anaphoric referent and an anaphoric property.","According to the stack model, since utterances A-5 ... A-7 are part of an embedded segment, so A-4 is hierarchically recent when A-8 is interpreted. A new focus space is pushed on the stack during the processing of dialogue A when the intention of utterance 5 is recognized. Since utterance 7 clearly indicates completion of the in-terrupting segment, the focus space for the interruption in 5 to 7 is popped from the stack after utterance 7, leaving the focus space for utterances 1 to 4 on the top of the stack. This focus space supports the interpretation of the proforms in A-8a.","Consider the variation of dialogue A in dialogue B in Figure 1. Here, the segment between B-5... B-7 is also an embedded segment. Utterance B--7 indicates completion of the embedded segment and signals a pop. So, by the stack model, this segment is handled by the same focus stack popping mechanism as we saw for dialogue A.","However, in dialogue B, utterance 8a is more difficult, if not impossible, to interpret. This is surprising because utterance B-4 is hierarchically recent for B--8a, just as it is in dialogue A. The interruption in dialogue B is but a slightly longer version of that in dialogue A. Inasmuch as the stack model is a precise formulation of hierarchical recency, it does not predict the infelicity of dialogue B. The problem arises partly because the stack model includes no constraints related to the length, depth, or amount of processing required for an embedded segment. Thus, these types of extended embedded segments suggest that the limited attention constraint must be sensitive to some aspect of linear recency. 3. Evidence for Limited Attention from Informational Redundancy Additional evidence for the influence of linear recency arises from the analysis of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs) in naturally-occurring discourse (Walker 256 Walker Attention and Discourse Dialogue C (3) E: And I was wondering--should I continue on with the","certificates or (4) H: Well it's difficult to tell because we're so far away from any","of them--but I would suggest this--if all of these are 6 month","certificates and I presume they are (5) E: Yes (6) H: Then I would like to see you start spreading some of that money around (7) E: uh huh (8) H: Now in addition, how old are you? (discussion and advice about retirement investments) (21) E: uh huh and (22a) H: But as far as the certificates are concerned, (22b) I'D LIKE THEM SPREAD OUT A LITTLE BIT--- (22c) THEY'RE ALL 6 MONTH CERTIFICATES (23) E: Yes (24) H: And I don't like putting all my eggs in one basket ... Figure 2 Dialogue C, an excerpt from the financial advice corpus. 1993). 1 IRUs realize propositions already established as mutually believed in the discourse• IRUs have antecedents in the discourse, which are those utterances that originally established the propositions realized by the IRU as mutually believed. Consider dialogue C, in Figure 2. Here E has been telling H about how her money is invested, and then poses a question in C-3. IRUs in the examples below are capitalized and their antecedents are italicized.","The utterances in 22b and 22c realize propositions previously established as mutually believed, so they are IRUs. 2 The cue word but in utterance 22a indicates a push, a new intention (Grosz and Sidner 1986). The phrase as far as the certificates are concerned indicates that this new intention is subordinate to the previous discussion of the certificates. Thus, utterance 22a, but as far as the certificates are concerned, has the effect that the focus space related to the discussion of retirement investments, corresponding to utterances 8 to 21, is popped from the stack.","This means that the focus space representations of the intentions for utterances 4 to 7 are on the top of the stack after C-22a, when 22b and 22c are processed• Therefore, the fact that H restates the content of utterances 4, 5, and 6 in 22b and 22c is surprising for two reasons: (1) The propositions realized by 22b and 22c are already mutually believed; and (2) these mutual beliefs should be salient by virtue of being on top of the stack. If they are salient by virtue of being on top of the stack, they should be accessible for processes such as content-based inferences or the inference of discourse relations. If they must be accessible for these inferences to take place, as I will argue 1 A subclass of Attention IRUs, Open-Segment IRUs, is discussed here. 2 The antecedents are in utterances 4, 5 and 6: H asserted the content of 22b to E in 6. E indicated understanding and implicated acceptance of this assertion in 7 (Walker 1992), and E confirmed the truth of the content of 22c for H in 5. 257 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2 below, their reintroduction suggests that, in fact, they are not accessible. Many similar examples of IRUs are found in the corpus (Walker 1993). These types of IRUs show that hierarchical recency, as realized by the stack model, does not predict when information is accessible. 4. The Cache Model of Attentional State The evidence above suggests the need for a model of attentional state in discourse that reflects the limited attentional capacity of human processing. Here, I propose an alternate model to the stack model, which I will call the cache model, and discuss the evidence for this model. In Section 5, I compare a number of dimensions of the cache and stack models.","The notion of a cache in combination with main memory, as is standard in computational architectures, is a good basis for a computational model of human attentional capacity in processing discourse. All conversants in a dialogue have their own cache and some conversational processes are devoted to keeping these caches synchronized.","The cache model consists of: (1) basic mechanisms and architectural properties; (2) assumptions about processing; (3) specification of which mechanism is applied at which point. The cache represents working memory and main memory represents long-term memory. The cache is a limited capacity, almost instantaneously accessible, memory store. The exact specification of this capacity must be determined by future work, but previous research suggests a limit of two or three sentences, or approximately seven propositions (Kintsch 1988; Miller 1956). Main memory is larger than the cache, but is slower to access (Baddeley 1986; Kintsch 1988).","There are three operations involving the cache and main memory. Items in the cache can be preferentially retained and items in main memory can be retrieved to the cache. Items in the cache can also be stored to main memory.","When new items are retrieved from main memory to the cache, or enter the cache directly due to events in the world, other items may be displaced, because the cache has limited capacity. Displaced items are stored in main memory. The determination of which items to displace is handled by a cache replacement policy. The specification of the cache replacement policy is left open; however, replacing items that have not been recently used, with the exception of those items that are preferentially retained, is a good working assumption, as shown by previous work on linear recency. 3","The cache model includes specific assumptions about processing. Discourse processes execute on elements that are in the cache. All of the premises for an inference must be simultaneously in the cache for the inference to be made (McKoon and Ratcliff 1992; Walker 1993). If a discourse relation is to be inferred between two separate segments, a representation of both segments must be simultaneously in the cache (Fletcher, Hummel, and Marsolek 1990; Walker 1993). The cospecifier of an anaphor must be in the cache for automatic interpretation, or be strategically retrieved to the cache in order to interpret the anaphor (Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff 1992). Thus, what is contained in the cache at any one time is a working set consisting of discourse entities such as entities, properties, and relations that are currently being used for some process.","Two factors determine when cache operations are applied: (1) the speaker's in-3 Obviously, linear recency is simply an approximation to what is in the cache. If something has been recently discussed, it was recently in the cache, and thus it is more likely to still be in the cache than other items. However, linear recency ignores the effects of retention and retrieval. 258 Walker Attention and Discourse tentions and the hearer's recognition of intention; (2) expectations about what will be discussed.","The cache model maintains the distinction between intentional structure and attentional state first proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). This distinction is critical. Just as a cache can be used for processing the references and operations of a hierarchically structured program, so can a cache be used to model attentional state when discourse intentions are hierarchically structured. The intentions of a conversant and the recognition of the other's intentions determine what is retrieved from main memory and what is preferentially retained in the cache.","When conversants start working towards the achievement of a new intention, that intention may utilize information that was already in the cache. If so, that information will be preferentially retained in the cache because it is being used. Whenever the new intention requires information that is not currently in the cache, that information must be retrieved from main memory. Thus, the process of initiating the achievement of the new intention has the result that some, and perhaps all, of the items currently in the cache are replaced with items having to do with the new intention.","When conversants return to a prior intention, information relevant to that intention must be retrieved from main memory if it has not been retained in the cache.","When an intention is completed, it is not necessary to strategically retain in the cache information relevant to the completed segment. This does not mean that there is an automatic retrieval of information related to other intentions, however, automatic retrieval processes can be triggered by associations between information being currently discussed and information stored in main memory (Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff 1992). These processes make items salient that have not been explicitly mentioned.","Expectations about what will be discussed also determine operations on the cache. Expectations can arise from shared knowledge about the task, and from the prior discourse (Grosz 1977; Malt 1984). Expectations can arise from interruptions when the nature of the interruption makes it obvious that there will be a return to the interrupted segment. When the pursuit of an intention is momentarily interrupted, as in dialogue A, the conversants attempt to retain the relevant material in the cache during the interruption. 5. Evaluating Critical Evidence: Comparing the Cache with the Stack In this section, I wish to examine evidence for the cache model, look at further predictions of the model, and then discuss evidence relevant to both stack and cache models in order to draw direct comparisons between them. First, I contrast the mechanisms of the models with respect to certain discourse processes. New intention subordinate to current intention: (1) stack pushes new focus space; (2) cache retrieves entities related to new intention Intention completed: (1) stack pops focus space for intention from stack, entities in focus space are no longer accessible; (2) cache does not retain entities for completed intention, but they remain accessible until displaced New intentions subordinate to prior intention: (1) stack pops focus spaces for intervening segments, focus space for prior intention accessible after pop; (2) cache retrieves entities related to prior intention from main memory to cache, unless retained in the cache 259 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2 Informationally redundant utterances: (1) stack predicts no role for IRUs when they are represented in focus space on top of stack, because information should be immediately available; (2) cache predicts that IRUs reinstantiate or refresh known information in the cache Returning from interruption: (1) in the stack model, the length and depth of the interruption and the processing required is irrelevant; (2) in the cache model, the length of the interruption or the processing required predicts retrievals from main memory","First, consider the differences in the treatment of interruptions. The state of the stack when returning from an interruption is identical for interruptions of various lengths and depths of embedding. In the cache model, an interruption may give rise to an expectation of a return to a prior intention, and each participant may attempt to retain information relevant to pursuing that intention in their cache. However, it may not be possible to retain the relevant material in the cache. In dialogue B, the interruption is too long and the working set for the interruption uses all of the cache. When this happens, the relevant material is displaced to main memory. On returning after an interruption, the conversants must initiate a cued retrieval of beliefs and intentions. This will require some processing effort, yielding the prediction that there will be a short period of time in which the cache does not have the necessary information. This would mean that the processing of incoming information would be slower until all of the required information is in the cache# The ease with which the conversants can return to a previous discussion will then rely on the retrievability of the required information from main memory, and this in turn depends on what is stored in main memory and the type of cue provided by the speaker as to what to retrieve. For example, if processing involves the surface form of the utterance, as it might in dialogue B, we can explain the clear-cut infelicity by the fact that surface forms are not normally stored in main memory (Sachs 1967).","Next, consider the differences between the models with respect to the function of IRUs. In dialogue C, a version of the dialogue without the IRUs is possible but is harder to interpret. Consider dialogue C without 22b, 22c and 23, i.e., replace 22a to 24 with But as far as the certificates are concerned, I don't like all my eggs in one basket. Interpreting this alternate version requires the same inference, namely that having all your investments in six month certificates constitutes the negatively evaluated condition of having all your eggs in one basket. However, the inference requires more effort to process.","The stack model does not predict a function for the IRUs. However, according to the cache model, IRUs make information accessible that is not accessible by virtue of hierarchical recency, so that processes of content-based inferences, inference of discourse relations, and interpretation of anaphors can take place with less effort. Thus, one prediction of the cache model is that a natural way to make the anaphoric forms in dialogue B more easily interpretable is to re-realize the relevant proposition with an IRU, as in 8aq My problem is that my daughter is working, as well as her uh husband.","The IRU may function this way since: (1) the IRU reinstantiates the necessary information in the cache; or (2) the IRU is a retrieval cue for retrieval of information to the cache. Here reinstantiation is certainly sufficient, but in general these cases cannot be distinguished from corpus analysis. It should be possible to test psychologically, using reaction time methods, whether and under what conditions IRUs function to 4 This could predict the observed occurrence of disfluencies at segment boundaries (Passonneau and Litman 1994). 260 Walker Attention and Discourse simply reinstantiate an entity in the cache, and when they serve as retrieval cues.","Next, consider the differences in status of the entities in completed discourse segments. In the stack model, focus spaces for segments that have been closed are popped from the stack and entities in those focus spaces are not accessible. In the cache model, \"popping\" only occurs via displacement. Thus, even when a segment is clearly closed, if a new topic has not been initiated, the popped entities should still be available. Some support for the cache model predictions about popped entities is that (1) rules proposed for deaccenting noun phrases treat popped entities as accessible (Davis and Hirschberg 1988); and (2) rules for referring expressions in argumentative texts treat the conclusions of popped sisters as salient (Huang 1994). Stronger evidence would be the reaction times to the mention of entities in a closed segment, after it is clear that a new segment has been initiated, but before the topic of that new segment has initiated a retrieval to, and hence displacement from, the cache.","It should also be possible to test whether entities that are in the focus spaces on the stack, according to the stack model, are more accessible than entities that have been popped off the stack. In the cache model, the entities in these focus spaces would not have a privileged attentional status, unless of course they had been refreshed in the cache by being realized implicitly or explicitly in the intervening discussion.","Finally, consider one of the most studied predictions of the stack model: cases where a pronoun has an antecedent in a prior focus space. These cases have been called return pops or focus pops (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1979; Reichman 1985; Fox 1987; Passonneau and Litman to appear). In the stack model, any of the focus spaces on the stack can be returned to, and the antecedent for a pronoun can be in any of these focus spaces. As a potential alternative to the stack model, the cache model appears to be unable to handle return pops since a previous state of the cache cannot be popped to. Since return pops are a primary motivation for the stack model, I will re-examine all of the naturally occurring return pops that I was able to find in the literature. There are 21 of them. While it would be premature to draw final conclusions from such a small sample size, I will argue that the data supports the conclusion that return pops are cued retrieval from main memory and that the cues reflect the context of the pop (Ratcliff and McKoon 1988). Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model.","In the cache model, there are at least three possibilities for how the context is created so that pronouns in return pops can be interpreted: (1) The pronoun alone functions as a retrieval cue (Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff 1992); (2) the content of the first utterance in a return indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache, which implies that the interpretation of the pronoun is delayed; (3) the shared knowledge of the conversants (e.g. shared knowledge of the task structure) creates expectations that determine what is in the cache.","Let us consider the first possibility. The view that pronouns must be able to function as retrieval cues is contrary to the view that pronouns indicate entities that are currently salient (Prince 1981). However, there are certain cases where a pronoun alone is a good retrieval cue, such as when only one referent of a particular gender or number has been discussed in the conversation. If competing antecedents are those that match the gender and number of the pronoun (Fox 1987), then only 11 of the 21 return pops found in the literature have competing antecedents.","Thus, the numbers suggest that in about half the cases we could expect the pronoun to function as an adequate retrieval cue based on gender and number alone. In fact, Sidner proposed that return pops might always have this property in her stacked focus constraint: \"Since anaphors may co-specify the focus or a potential focus, an anaphor which is intended to co-specify a stacked focus must not be acceptable as co-specifying either the focus or potential focus. If, for example, the focus is a noun 261 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2 phrase which can be mentioned with an it anaphor, then it cannot be used to co-specify with a stacked focus.\" (Sidner 1979, 88-89)","In addition, the representation of the anaphor should include selectional restrictions from the verb's subcategorization frame as retrieval cues (Di Eugenio 1990). Of the 11 tokens with competing antecedents, 5 tokens have no competing antecedents if selectional restrictions are also applied. For example, in the dialogues about the construction of a pump from Grosz (1977), only some entities can be bolted, loosened, or made to work. Only 4 pronouns of the 21 return pops have competing referents if a selectional constraint can arise from the dialogue, for example, if only one of the male discourse entities under discussion has been riding a bike, then the verb rode serves as a cue for retrieving that entity (Passonneau and Litman to appear). Thus in 17 cases, an adequate retrieval cue is constructed from processing the pronoun and the matrix verb (Di Eugenio 1990).","The second hypothesis is that the content of the return utterance indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache. The occurrence of IRUs as in dialogue C is one way of doing this. IRUs at the locus of a return can: (1) reinstantiate required information in the cache so that no retrieval is necessary; (2) function as excellent retrieval cues for information from main memory. An examination of the data shows that IRUs occur in 6 of the 21 return pops. IRUs in combination with selectional restrictions leave only 2 cases of pronouns in return pops with competing antecedents.","In the remaining 2 cases, the competing antecedent is not and was never prominent in the discourse, i.e., it was never the discourse center, suggesting that it may never compete with the other cospecifier.","It should be possible to test how long it takes to resolve anaphors in return pops and under what conditions it can be done, considering the data presented here on competing referents, IRUs, explicit closing, and selectional restrictions. A probe just after a pronoun, and before the verb, in a return pop could determine whether the pronoun alone is an adequate retrieval cue, or whether selectional information from the verb is required or simply speeds processing.","Finally, it should be possible to test whether pronouns in return pops are accented, which signals to the hearer that the most recent antecedent is not the correct one (Cahn 1991).","To conclude, the analysis presented here suggests many hypotheses that could be empirically tested, which the currently available evidence does not enable us to resolve. 6. Discussion and Conclusion This squib has discussed the role of limited attention in a computational model of discourse processing. The cache model was proposed as a computational implemention of human working memory; operations on attentional state are formulated as operations on a cache. Just as a cache can be used for processing the references and operations of a hierarchically structured program, so can a cache be used to model attentional state when discourse intentions are hierarchically structured.","The store and retrieve operations of the cache model casts discourse processing as a gradient phenomenon, predicting that the contents of the cache will change gradually, and that change requires processing effort. The notion of processing effort for retrieval operations on main memory makes predictions that can be experimentally tested. In the meantime, the notion of increased processing effort in the cache model explains the occurrence of a class of informationally redundant utterances in discourse, as well 262 Walker Attention and Discourse as cases of infelicitous discourses constructed as variations on naturally occurring ones, while remaining consistent with evidence on human limited attentional capacity. Finally, the cache model appears to handle the class of return pops, which prima facie should be problematic for the model.
