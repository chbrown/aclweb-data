Only recently, however, have computers become powerful enough to permit the widescale application of this concept to real world problems in statistical estimation and pattern recognition. In this paper, we describe a method for statistical modeling based on maximum entropy. We present a maximum-likelihood approach for automatically constructing maximum entropy models and describe how to implement this approach efficiently, using as examples several problems in natural language processing. 1. Introduction Statistical modeling addresses the problem of constructing a stochastic model to predict the behavior of a random process. In constructing this model, we typically have at our disposal a sample of output from the process. Given this sample, which represents an incomplete state of knowledge about the process, the modeling problem is to parlay this knowledge into a representation of the process. We can then use this representation to make predictions about the future behavior about the process.","Baseball managers (who rank among the better paid statistical modelers) employ batting averages, compiled from a history of at-bats, to gauge the likelihood that a player will succeed in his next appearance at the plate. Thus informed, they manipulate their lineups accordingly. Wall Street speculators (who rank among the best paid statistical modelers) build models based on past stock price movements to predict to-morrow's fluctuations and alter their portfolios to capitalize on the predicted future. At the other end of the pay scale reside natural language researchers, who design language and acoustic models for use in speech recognition systems and related applications.","The past few decades have witnessed significant progress toward increasing the predictive capacity of statistical models of natural language. In language modeling, for instance, Bahl et al. (1989) have used decision tree models and Della Pietra et al. (1994) have used automatically inferred link grammars to model long range correlations in language. In parsing, Black et al. (1992) have described how to extract grammatical * This research, supported in part by ARPA under grant ONR N00014-91-C-0135, was conducted while the authors were at the IBM T. J.

The first task is to determine a set of statistics that captures the behavior of a random proceSs. Given a set of statistics, the second task is to corral these facts into an accurate model of the process--a model capable of predicting the future output of the process. The first task is one of feature selection; the second is one of model selection. In the following pages we present a unified approach to these two tasks based on the maximum entropy philosophy.","In Section 2 we give an overview of the maximum entropy philosophy and work through a motivating example. In Section 3 we describe the mathematical structure of maximum entropy models and give an efficient algorithm for estimating the parameters of such models. In Section 4 we discuss feature selection, and present an automatic method for discovering facts about a process from a sample of output from the process. We then present a series of refinements to the method to make it practical to implement. Finally, in Section 5 we describe the application of maximum entropy ideas to several tasks in stochastic language processing: bilingual sense disambiguation, word reordering, and sentence segmentation. 2. A Maximum Entropy Overview We introduce the concept of maximum entropy through a simple example. Suppose we wish to model an expert translator's decisions concerning the proper French rendering of the English word in. Our model p of the expert's decisions assigns to each French word or phrase f an estimate, p(f), of the probability that the expert would choose f as a translation of in. To guide us in developing p, we collect a large sample of instances of the expert's decisions. Our goal is to extract a set of facts about the decision-making process from the sample (the first task of modeling) that will aid us in constructing a model of this process (the second task).","One obvious clue we might glean from the sample is the list of allowed translations. For example, we might discover that the expert translator always chooses among the following five French phrases: {dans, en, ?l, au cours de, pendant}. With this information in hand, we can impose our first constraint on our model p: p(dans) + p(en) + p(h) + p(au cours de) + p(pendant) = 1","This equation represents our first statistic of the process; we can now proceed to search for a suitable model that obeys this equation. Of course, there are an infinite number of models p for which this identity holds. One model satisfying the above equation is p(dans) = 1; in other words, the model always predicts dans. Another model obeying this constraint predicts pendant with a probability of 1/2, and ~ with a probability of 1/2. But both of these models offend our sensibilities: knowing only that the expert always chose from among these five French phrases, how can we justify either of these probability distributions? Each seems to be making rather bold assumptions, with no empirical justification. Put another way, these two models assume more than we actually know about the expert's decision-making process. All we know is that the expert chose exclusively from among these five French phrases; given this, 40 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number I these questions, how do we go about finding the most uniform model subject to a set of constraints like those we have described?","The maximum entropy method answers both of these questions, as we will demonstrate in the next few pages. Intuitively, the principle is simple: model"]},{"title":"all","paragraphs":["that is known and assume nothing about that which is unknown. In other words, given a collection of facts, choose a model consistent with all the facts, but otherwise as uniform as possible. This is precisely the approach we took in selecting our model p at each step in the above example.","The maximum entropy concept has a long history. Adopting the least complex hypothesis possible is embodied in Occam's razor (\"Nunquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necesitate.') and even appears earlier, in the Bible and the writings of Herotodus (Jaynes 1990). Laplace might justly be considered the father of maximum entropy, having enunciated the underlying theme 200 years ago in his \"Principle of Insufficient Reason:\" when one has no information to distinguish between the probability of two events, the best strategy is to consider them equally likely (Guiasu and Shenitzer 1985). As E. T. Jaynes, a more recent pioneer of maximum entropy, put it (Jaynes 1990): ... the fact that a certain probability distribution maximizes entropy subject to certain constraints representing our incomplete information, is the fundamental property which justifies use of that distribution for inference; it agrees with everything that is known, but carefully avoids assuming anything that is not known. It is a transcription into mathematics of an ancient principle of wisdom ..."]},{"title":"3. Maximum Entropy Modeling","paragraphs":["We consider a random process that produces an output value y, a member of a finite set 3;. For the translation example just considered, the process generates a translation of the word in, and the output y can be any word in the set {dans, en, ?~, au cours de, pendant}. In generating y, the process may be influenced by some contextual information x, a member of a finite set X. In the present example, this information could include the words in the English sentence surrounding in.","Our task is to construct a stochastic model that accurately represents the behavior of the random process. Such a model is a method of estimating the conditional probability that, given a context x, the process will output y. We will denote by p(ylx) the probability that the model assigns to y in context x. With a slight abuse of notation, we will also use p(ylx) to denote the entire conditional probability distribution provided by the model, with the interpretation that y and x are placeholders rather than specific instantiations.

Here 7 ~ is the space of all (unconditional) probability distributions on three points, sometimes called a simplex. If we impose no constraints (depicted in (a)), then all probability models are allowable. Imposing one linear constraint Q restricts us to those p E P that lie on the region defined by C1, as shown in (b). A second linear constraint could determine p exactly, if the two constraints are satisfiable; this is the case in (c), where the intersection of C1 and C2 is non-empty. Alternatively, a second linear constraint could be inconsistent with the first--for instance, the first might require that the probability of the first point is 1/3 and the second that the probability of the third point is 3/4--this is shown in (d). In the present setting, however, the linear constraints are extracted from the training sample and cannot, by construction, be inconsistent. Furthermore, the linear constraints in our applications will not even come close to determining p C/v uniquely as they do in (c); instead, the set C = Q ~ C2 M ...

We envision, in practice, a separate maximum entropy model, pe(y]x), for each English word e, where pe(ylx) represents the probability that an expert translator would choose y as the French rendering of e, given the surrounding English context x. This is just a slightly recast version of a longstanding problem in computational linguistics, namely, sense disambiguation--the determination of a word's sense from its context.","We begin with a training sample of English-French sentence pairs (E, F) randomly extracted from the Hansard corpus, such that E contains the English word in. For each sentence pair, we use the basic translation model to compute the Viterbi alignment between E and F. Using this alignment, we then construct an (x, y) training event. The event consists of a context x containing the six words in E surrounding in and a future 56 Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra A Maximum Entropy Approach Table 3 Several actual training events for the maximum entropy translation model for in, extracted from the transcribed proceedings of the Canadian Parliament.

A few actual examples of such events for in are depicted in Table 3.","Next we define the set of candidate features. For this application, we employ features that are indicator functions of simply described sets. Specifically, we consider functions f(x,y) that are one if y is some particular French word and the context x contains a given English word, and are zero otherwise. We employ the following notation to represent these features: fl(x,y) = { 10 otherwiseify=enandAprilEI ] I ]'1 I I"]},{"title":"fa(x,y) {10 otherwiseifY pen antand weeks I I I\" I\" I\" J","paragraphs":["Here fl = 1 when April follows in and en is the translation of in; f2 = 1 when weeks is one of the three words following in and pendant is the translation.","The set of features under consideration is vast, but may be expressed in abbreviated form in Table 4. In the table, the symbol O is a placeholder for a possible French word and the symbol [] is a placeholder for a possible English word. The feature h mentioned above is thus derived from template 2 with O = en and [] = April; the feature f2 is derived from template 5 with O = pendant and [] = weeks.

When we include constraints derived from template 2 features, we take our first step towards a context-dependent model. Rather than simply constraining the expected probability of a French word y to equal its empirical probability, these constraints require that the expected joint probability of the English word immediately following in and the French rendering of in be equal to its empirical probability. An example of a template 2 constraint is p(y = pendant, e+l = several) = ~(y = pendant, e+] = several) A maximum entropy model that incorporates this constraint will predict the translations of in in a manner consistent with whether or not the following word is several. In particular, if in the empirical sample the presence of several led to a greater probability for pendant, this will be reflected in a maximum entropy model incorporating this constraint. We have thus taken our first step toward context-sensitive translation modeling.","Templates 3, 4, and 5 consider, each in a different way, various parts of the context. For instance, template 5 constraints allow us to model how an expert translator is biased by the appearance of a word somewhere in the three words following the word being translated.

On the other hand, if year appears within the same window of words (as in in the year 1941 or in that fateful year), then au cours de might be more likely. Together, the five constraint templates allow the model to condition its assignment of probabilities on a window of six words around e0, the word in question.","We constructed a maximum entropy model Pin (ylx) by the iterative model-growing method described in Section 4.

The feature selection algorithm described in Section 4 calculated that if this constraint were imposed on the model, the log-likelihood would rise by approximately 0.019059 bits; since this value was higher than for any other constraint considered, the constraint was selected.

This order is often very different from the French word order. One way Candide captures word-order differences in the two languages is to allow for alignments with crossing lines. In addition, Candide performs, during a preprocessing stage, a reordering step that shuffles the words in the input French sentence into an order more closely resembling English word order.","One component of this word reordering step deals with French phrases which have the NOUN de NOUN form. For some NOUN de NOUN phrases, the best English translation is nearly word for word: conflit d'intOr~t, for example, is almost always rendered as conflict of interest. For other phrases, however, the best translation is obtained by interchanging the two nouns and dropping the de. The French phrase taux d'int&Ot, for example, is best rendered as interest rate. Table 7 gives several examples of NOUN de NOUN phrases together with their most appropriate English translations.","In this section we describe a maximum entropy model that, given a French NOUN de NOUN phrase, estimates the probability that the best English translation involves an interchange of the two nouns. We begin with a sample of English-French sentence pairs (E, F) randomly extracted from the Hansard corpus, such that F contains a NOUN de NOUN phrase. For each sentence pair we use the basic translation model to compute the Viterbi alignment ,~ between the words in E and F. Using A we construct an (x, y) training event as follows: We let the context x be the pair of French nouns (NOUNL, NOUNR). We let y be no-interchange if the English translation is a word-for-word translation of the French phrase and y = interchange if the order of the nouns in the English and French phrases are interchanged.","We define candidate features based upon the template features shown in Table 8. 64 Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra A Maximum Entropy Approach Table 7 NOUN de NOUN phrases and their English equivalents.

We expect these features to be relevant when the decision of whether to interchange the nouns is influenced by the identity of the left noun. For example, including the template 1 feature","1 if y=interchange and NOUNL = systOme f (x, y) = 0 otherwise gives the model sensitivity to the fact that the nouns in French NOUN de NOUN phrases beginning with systOme (such as syst~me de surveillance.and systOme de quota) are more likely to be interchanged in the English translation. Similarly, including the template 1 feature","1 if y=no-interchange and NOUNL = mois f(x,y)= 0 otherwise gives the model sensitivity to the fact that French NOUN de NOUN phrases beginning with mois, such as mois de mai (month of May) are more likely to be translated word for word.","Template 3 features are useful in dealing with translating NOUN de NOUN phrases in which the interchange decision is influenced by both nouns. For example, NOUN de NOUN phrases ending in intdrOt are sometimes translated word for word, as in conflit d'intdrOt (conflict of interest) and are sometimes interchanged, as in taux d'intdrOt (interest rate).","We used the feature-selection algorithm of section 4 to construct a maximum entropy model from candidate features derived from templates 1, 2, and 3.

Conclusion We began by introducing the building blocks of maximum entropy modeling--real-valued features and constraints built from these features. We then discussed the maximum entropy principle. This principle instructs us to choose, among all the models 66 Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra A Maximum Entropy Approach consistent with the constraints, the model with the greatest entropy. We observed that this model was a member of an exponential family with one adjustable parameter for each constraint. The optimal values of these parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Thus two different philosophical approaches-- maximum entropy and maximum likelihood--yield the same result: the model with the greatest entropy consistent with the constraints is the same as the exponential model which best predicts the sample of data.","We next discussed algorithms for constructing maximum entropy models, concentrating our attention on the two main problems facing would-be modelers: selecting a set of features to include in a model, and computing the parameters of a model containing these features. The general feature-selection process is too slow in practice, and we presented several techniques for making the algorithm feasible.","In the second part of this paper we described several applications of our algorithms, concerning modeling tasks arising in Candide, an automatic machine translation system under development at IBM. These applications demonstrate the efficacy of maximum entropy techniques for performing context-sensitive modeling.
