Rood","In Situations and Attitudes (Barwise and Perry 1983) Barwise and Perry decide that meaning should be taken to be a triadic relation not a dyadic one. While there may be good reasons for deciding to procede on this basis, one of the reasons they give is definitely a bad one, and this is the principal subject of this note.","On pages 222-23 they remark that if meaning is to be a dyadic relation it is necessary that the complement of a situation should--at least sometimes--be another situation. In the set theory that is the basis for their development--KPU--it is elementary that the complement of a set is never a set. This compels the designers of situation semantics to make meaning a triadic relation as we will now explain.","Barwise and Perry take individuals, properties, relations, and locations as primitives. A situation-type is a partial function from n-ary relations and n individuals to the set {0, 1} (p. 8). In modern situation-semantic parlance, this is often referred to as an infon, or (more precisely) a basic infon. An event, or course-of-events (coe), is a function from locations to situation-types. For example, the situation-type corresponding to a (real-world) situation in which a dog named Molly barks would be: (at I, barks, Molly, 1 / and one related coe might be:","e = {(at I, barks, Molly, 1}, (at l', shouts at, Mr. Levine, Molly, 1), (at I\", barks, Molly, O) }","Consider the predicate SO (seeing option) on coes. In a given event, s, an individual, a, classifies events according to what s/he sees and knows. That is: (SO, a, el, 1) E s if ea is compatible with what a sees and knows; (SO, a, e2, O) E s if e2 is incompatible with what a sees and knows. This is a partial classification of events; i.e., some events may be neither SO-yes nor SO-no.","Further to this:","• Definition In a given situation, s, an event, e, is a visual option for agent a if ISO, a,e, 1) E s","• Definition Similarly, e is a visual alternative for a if it is not the case that (SO, a,e,O I E s Given s as above, let:","Xvo = {e:ISO, a,e, 1) Es} = collection of events that are visual/seeing options for a in s.

Thus the situational analysis of attitudinal reports extends to iterated reports such as or2 without violation of set membership dicta.","Whatever reasons caused Barwise and Perry to desire a set theory with ur-elements should presumably still be respected, so if we can find a consistent set theory with ur-elements and a universal set, the outlook will be a lot brighter. Fortunately there is such a system, the Jensen-Quine system of set theory known as NFU. For more on this see Holmes (1994, 1996). Of course, an easy consequence of an axiom of complementation such as we have in NFU is the negation of the axiom of foundation. Barwise has elsewhere (1984) argued that we should not regard the axiom of foundation as essential.","References","Barwise J. 1984. Situations, sets and the axiom of foundation.
