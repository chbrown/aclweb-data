McKeown t Columbia University Collocations are notoriously difficult for non-native speakers to translate, primarily because they are opaque and cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis. We describe a program named Champollion which, given a pair of parallel corpora in two different languages and a list of collocations in one of them, automatically produces their translations. Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages,for different domains. The algorithm we use is based on statistical methods and produces p-word translations of n-word collocations in which n and p need not be the same. For example, Champollion translates make ... decision, employment equity, and stock market into prendre ... d6cision, 6quit6 en mati6re d'emploi, and bourse respectively. Testing Champollion on three years' worth of the Hansards corpus yielded the French translations of 300 collocations for each year, evaluated at 73% accuracy on average. In this paper, we describe the statistical measures used, the algorithm, and the implementation of Champollion, presenting our results and evaluation. 1. Introduction Hieroglyphics remained undeciphered for centuries until the discovery of the Rosetta stone in the beginning of the 19th century in Rosetta, Egypt. The Rosetta stone is a tablet of black basalt containing parallel inscriptions in three different scripts: Greek and two forms of ancient Egyptian writings (demotic and hieroglyphics). Jean-Francois Champollion, a linguist and Egyptologist, made the assumption that these inscriptions were parallel and managed after several years of research to decipher the hieroglyphic inscriptions. He used his work on the Rosetta stone as a basis from which to produce the first comprehensive hieroglyphics dictionary (Budge 1989).","In this paper, we describe a modern version of a similar approach: given a large corpus in two languages, our system produces translations of common word pairs and phrases that can form the basis of a bilingual lexicon. Our focus is on the use of statistical methods for the translation of multiword expressions, such as collocations which are often idiomatic in nature. Published translations of such collocations are not readily available, even for languages such as French and English, despite the fact that collocations have been recognized as one of the main obstacles to second language acquisition (Leed and Nakhimovsky 1979). * The work reported in this paper was done while the author was at Columbia University.

Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou Translating Collocations for Bilingual Lexicons 2. Related Work The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al. 1993). Of these, aligning groups of words is most similar to the work reported here, although, as we shall show, we consider a greater variety of groups than is typical in other research. In this section, we describe work on sentence and word alignment and statistical translation, showing how these goals differ from our own, and then describe work on aligning groups of words. Note that there is additional research using statistical approaches to bilingual problems, but it is less related to ours, addressing, for example, word sense disambiguation in the source language by statistically examining context (e.g., collocations) in the source language, thus allowing appropriate word selection in the target language. (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994).","Our use of bilingual corpora assumes a prealigned corpus. Thus, we draw on work done at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Gale and Church (1991a, 1991b, 1993) and at IBM by Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) on bilingual sentence alignment. Sentence alignment programs take a paired bilingual corpus as input and determine which sentences in the target language translate which sentences in the source language. Both the AT&T and the IBM groups use purely statistical techniques based on sentence length to identify sentence pairing in corpora such as the Hansards. The AT&T group (Gale and Church 1993) defines sentence length by the number of characters in the sentences, while the IBM group (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991) defines sentence length by the number of words in the sentence. Both approaches achieve similar results and have been influential in much of the research on statistical natural language processing, including ours. It has been noted in more recent work that length-based alignment programs such as these are problematic for many cases of real world parallel data, such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) input, in which periods may not be noticeable (Church 1993), or languages where insertions or deletions are common (Shemtov 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994). These algorithms were adequate for our purposes, but could be replaced by algorithms more appropriate for noisy input corpora, if necessary. Sentence alignment techniques are generally used as a preprocessing stage, before the main processing component that proposes actual translations, whether of words, phrases, or full text, and they are used this way in our work as well.","Translation can be approached using statistical techniques alone. Brown et al. (1990, 1993) use a stochastic language model based on techniques used in speech recognition, combined with translation probabilities compiled on the aligned corpus, to do sentence translation. Their system,"]},{"title":"Candide,","paragraphs":["uses little linguistic and no semantic information and currently produces good quality translations for short sentences containing high frequency vocabulary, as measured by individual human evaluators (see Berger et al. [1994] for information on recent results). While they also align groups of words across languages in the process of translation, they are careful to point out that such groups may or may not occur at constituent breaks in the sentence. In contrast, our work aims at identifying syntactically and semantically meaningful units, which may be either constituents or flexible word pairs separated by intervening words, and provides the translation of these units for use in a variety of bilingual applications. Thus, the goals of our research are somewhat different. 3 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1","Kupiec (1993) describes a technique for finding noun phrase correspondences in bilingual corpora using several stages. First, as for Champollion, the bilingual corpus must be aligned by sentences. Then, each corpus is separately run through a part-of-speech tagger and noun phrase recognizer. Finally, noun phrases are mapped to each other using an iterative re-estimation algorithm. Evaluation was done on the 100 highest-ranking correspondences produced by the program, yielding 90% accuracy. Evaluation has not been completed for the remaining correspondences--4900 distinct English noun phrases. The author indicates that the technique has several limitations, due in part to the compounded error rates of the taggers and noun phrase recognizers.","Van der Eijk (1993) uses a similar approach for translating terms. His work is based on the assumption that terms are noun phrases and thus, like Kupiec, uses sentence alignment, tagging, and a noun phrase recognizer. His work differs in the correlation measure he uses: he compares local frequency of the term (i.e., frequency in sentences containing the term) to global frequency (i.e., frequency in the full corpus), decreasing the resulting score by a weight representing the distance between the actual position of the target term and its expected position in the corpus; this weight is small if the target term is exactly aligned with the source term and larger as the distance increases. His evaluation shows 68% precision and 64% recall. We suspect that the lower precision is due in part to the fact that van der Eijk evaluated all translations produced by the program while Kupiec only evaluated the top 2%. Note that the greatest difference between these two approaches and ours is that van der Eijk and Kupiec only handle noun phrases whereas collocations have been shown to include parts of noun phrases, categories other than noun phrases (e.g., verb phrases), as well as flexible phrases that involve words separated by an arbitrary number of other words (e.g., to take ... steps, to demonstrate ... support). In this work, as in earlier work (Smadja 1992), we address the full range of collocations including both flexible and rigid collocations for a variety of syntactic categories.","Another approach, begun more recently than our work, is taken by Dagan and Church (1994), who use statistical methods to translate technical terminology. Like van der Eijk and Kupiec, they preprocess their corpora by tagging and by identifying noun phrases. However, they use a word alignment program as opposed to sentence alignment and they include single words as candidates for technical terms. One of the major differences between their work and ours is that, like van der Eijk and Kupiec, they only handle translation of uninterrupted sequences of words; they do not handle the broader class of flexible collocations. Their system, Termight, first extracts candidate technical terms, presenting them to a terminologist for filtering. Then, Termight identifies candidate translations for each occurrence of a source term by using the word alignment to find the first and last target positions aligned with any words of the source terms. All candidate translations for a given source term are sorted by frequency and presented to the user, along with a concordance. Because Termight does not use additional correlation statistics, relying instead only on the word alignment, it will find translations for infrequent terms; none of the other approaches, including Champollion, can make this claim. Accuracy, however, is considerably lower; the most frequent translation for a term is correct only 40% of the time (compare with Champollion's 73% accuracy). Since Termight is fully integrated within a translator's editor (another unique feature) and is used as an aid for human translators, it gets around the problem of accuracy by presenting the sorted list of translations to the translator for a choice. In all cases, the correct translation was found in this list and translators were able to speed up both the task of identifying technical terminology and translating terms.","Other recent related work aims at using statistical techniques to produce translations of single words (Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu and Xia 1994; Fung 1995b) Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou Translating Collocations for Bilingual Lexicons as opposed to collocations or phrases. Wu and Xia (1994) employed an estimation-maximization technique to find the optimal word alignment from previously sentence-aligned clean parallel corpora 2, with additional significance filtering. The work by Fung and McKeown (1994) and Fung (1995b) is notable for its use of techniques suitable to Asian/Romance language pairs as well as Romance language pairs. Given that Asian languages differ considerably in structure from Romance languages, statistical methods that were previously proposed for pairs of European languages do not work well for these pairs. Fung and McKeown's work also focuses on word alignment from noisy parallel corpora, where there are no clear sentence boundaries or perfect translations.","Work on the translation of single words into multiword sequences that integrates techniques for machine-readable dictionaries with statistical corpus analysis (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann in press) is also relevant. While this work focuses on a smaller set of words for translation (movement verbs), it provides a sophisticated approach using multiple knowledge sources to address both one-to-many word translations and the problem of sense disambiguation. Given only one word in the source, their system, BICORD, uses the corpus to extend dictionary definitions and provide translations that are appropriate for a given sense but do not occur in the dictionary, producing a bilingual lexicon of movement verbs as output. 3. Collocations and Machine Translation Collocations, commonly occurring word pairs and phrases, are a notorious source of difficulty for non-native speakers of a language (Leed and Nakhimovsky 1979; Benson 1985; Benson, Benson, and Ilson 1986). This is because they cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis. Instead, a speaker must be aware of the meaning of the phrase as a whole in the source language and know the common phrase typically used in the target language. While collocations are not predictable on the basis of syntactic or semantic rules, they can be observed in language and thus must be learned through repeated usage. For example, in American English one says set the table while in British English the phrase lay the table is used. These are expressions that have evolved over time. It is not the meaning of the words lay and set that determines the use of one or the other in the full phrase. Here, the verb functions as a support verb; it derives its meaning in good part from the object in this context and not from its own semantic features. In addition, such collocations are flexible. The constraint is between the verb and its object and any number of words may occur between these two elements (e.g., You will be setting a gorgeously decorated and lavishly appointed table designed for a king). Collocations also include rigid groups of words that do not change from one context to another, such as compounds, as in Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.","To understand the difficulties that collocations pose for translation, consider sentences (le) and (lf) in Figure 1. Although these sentences are relatively simple, automatically translating (le) as (lf) involves several problems. Inability to translate on a word-by-word basis is due in part to the presence of collocations. For example, the English collocation to demonstrate support is translated as prouver son adhdsion. This translation uses words that do not correspond to individual words in the source; the English translation of prouver is prove and son adhdsion translates as one's adhesion. As a phrase, however, prouver son adhdsion carries the same meaning as the source phrase. Other groups of words in (le) cause similar problems, including to take steps to, provi-2 These corpora had little noise. Most sentences neatly corresponded to translations in the paired corpus, with few extraneous sentences. 5 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1","(le) \"Mr. Speaker, our Government has demonstrated its support for these important principles by taking steps to enforce the provisions of the Charter more vigorously.\"","(lf) \"Monsieur le Pr6sident, notre gouvernement a prouv6 son adh6sion ces importants principes en prenant des mesures pour appliquer plus syst6matiquement les pr6ceptes de la Charte.\" Figure 1 Example pair of matched sentences from the Hansards corpus. sions of the Charter, and to enforce provisions. These groups are identified as collocations for a variety of reasons. For example, to take steps is a collocation because to take is used here as a support verb for the noun steps. The agent our government doesn't actually physically take anything; rather, it has begun the process of enforcement through small, concrete actions. While the French translation en prenant des mesures does use the French for take, the object is the translation of a word that does not appear in the source, measures. These are flexible collocations exhibiting variations in word order. On the other hand, the compound provisions of the Charter is very commonly used as a whole in a much more rigid way.","This example also illustrates that collocations are domain dependent, often form-ing part of a sublanguage. For example, Mr. Speaker is the proper way to refer to the Speaker of the House in the Canadian Parliament when speaking English. The French equivalent, Monsieur le Prdsident, is not the literal translation but instead uses the translation of the term President. While this is an appropriate translation for the Canadian Parliament, in different contexts another translation would be better. Note that these problems are quite similar to the difficulties in translating technical terminology, which also is usually part of a particular technical sublanguage (Dagan and Church 1994). The ability to automatically acquire collocation translations is thus a definite advantage for sublanguage translation. When moving to a new domain and sublanguage, translations that are appropriate can be acquired by running Champollion on a new corpus from that domain.","Since in some instances parts of a sentence can be translated on a word-by-word basis, a translator must know when a full phrase or pair of words must be considered for translation and when a word-by-word technique will suffice. Two tasks must therefore be considered: . . Identify collocations, or phrases which cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis, in the source language. Provide adequate translation for these collocations.","For both tasks, general knowledge of the two languages is not sufficient. It is also necessary to know the expressions used in the sublanguage, since we have seen that idiomatic phrases often have different translations in a restricted sublanguage than in general usage. In order to produce a fluent translation of a full sentence, it is necessary to know the specific translation for each of the source collocations.","We use XTRACT (Smadja and McKeown 1990; Smadja 1991a; Smadja 1993), a Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou Translating Collocations for Bilingual Lexicons tool we developed previously, to identify collocations in the source language (task"]},{"title":"1).","paragraphs":["XTRACT works in three stages. In the first stage, word pairs that co-occur with significant frequency are identified. These words can be separated by up to four intervening words and thus constitute flexible collocations. In the second stage, XTRACT identifies combinations of word pairs from stage one with other words and phrases, producing compounds and idiomatic templates (i.e., phrases with one or more holes to be filled by specific syntactic types). In the final stage, XTRACT filters any pairs that do not consistently occur in the same syntactic relation, using a parsed version of the corpus. This tool has been used in several projects at Columbia University and has been distributed to a number of research and commercial sites worldwide.","XTRACT has been developed and tested on English-only input. For optimal performance, XTRACT itself relies on other tools, such as a part-of-speech tagger and a robust parser. Although such tools are becoming more widely available in many languages, they are still hard to find. We have thus assumed in"]},{"title":"Champollion","paragraphs":["that these tools were only available in one of the two languages; namely, English, termed the source language throughout the paper. 4. The Similarity Measure To rank the proposed translations so that the best one is selected,"]},{"title":"Champollion","paragraphs":["uses a quantitative measure of correlation between the source collocation and its complete or partial translations. This measure is also used to reduce the search space to a manageable size, by filtering out partial translations that are not highly correlated with the source collocation. In this section, we discuss the properties of similarity measures that are appropriate for our application. We explain why the Dice coefficient meets these criteria and why this measure is more appropriate than another frequently used measure--mutual information.","Our approach is based on the assumption that each collocation is unambiguous in the source language and has a unique translation in the target language (at least in a clear majority of the cases). In this way, we can ignore the context of the collocations and their translations, and base our decisions only on the patterns of co-occurrence of each collocation and its candidate translations across the entire corpus. This approach is quite different from those adopted for the translation of single words (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Dorr 1992; Klavans and Tzoukermann 1996), since for single words polysemy cannot be ignored; indeed, the problem of sense disambiguation has been linked to the problem of translating ambiguous words (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994). The assumption of a single meaning per collocation was based on our previous experience with English collocations (Smadja 1993), is supported for less opaque collocations by the fact that their constituent words tend to have a single sense when they appear in the collocation (Yarowsky 1993), and was verified during our evaluation of"]},{"title":"Champollion","paragraphs":["(Section 7).","We construct a mathematical model of the events we want to correlate, namely, the appearance of any word or group of words in the sentences of our corpus, as follows: To each group of words G, in either the source or the target language, we map a binary random variable Xc that takes the value \"1\" if G appears in a particular sentence and \"0\" if not.

Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 sentences (a 1-1 match) certainly contributes to their association and increases our belief that one is the translation of the other. Similarly, seeing only one of them (a 1-0 or 0-1 mismatch) decreases our belief in their association. But, given the many possible groups of words that can appear in each sentence, the fact that neither of two groups of words appears in a pair of aligned sentences does not offer any information about their similarity. Even when the word groups have been observed relatively few times (together or separately), seeing additional sentences containing none of the groups of words we are interested in should not affect our estimate of their similarity.","In other words, in our case, X and Y are highly asymmetric; a \"1\" value (and a 1-1 match) is much more informative than a \"0\" value (or 0-0 match). Therefore, we should select a similarity measure that is based only on 1-1 matches and mismatches. 0-0 matches should be completely ignored; otherwise, they would dominate the similarity measure, given the overall relatively low frequency of any particular word or word group in our corpus.","The Dice coefficient satisfies the above requirement of asymmetry: adding 0-0 matches does not change any of the absolute frequencies fxY, fx, and fy, and so does not affect"]},{"title":"Dice(X, Y).","paragraphs":["On the other hand, average mutual information depends only on the distribution of X and Y and not on the actual values of the random variables. In fact,"]},{"title":"I(X, Y)","paragraphs":["is a completely symmetric measure. If the variables X and Y are transformed so that every \"1\" is replaced with a \"0\" and vice versa, the average mutual information between X and Y remains the same. This is appropriate in the context of communications for which mutual information was originally developed (Shannon 1948), where the ones and zeros encode two different states with no special preference for either of them. But in the context of translation, exchanging the \"l\"s and \"0\"s is equivalent to considering a word or word group to be present when it was absent and vice versa, thus converting all 1-1 matches to 0-0 matches and all 0-0 matches to 1-1 matches. As explained above, such a change should not be considered similarity preserving, since 1-1 matches are much more significant than 0-0 ones.","As a concrete example, consider a corpus of 100 matched sentences, where each of the word groups associated with X and Y appears five times. Furthermore, suppose that the two groups appear twice in a pair of aligned sentences and each word group also appears three times by itself.

What is important is that the selected measure satisfy the conditions of asymmetry, insensitivity to marginal word probabilities, and convenience in testing for correlation. There are many other possible measures of association, and the general points made in this section may apply to them insofar as they also exhibit the properties we discussed. For example, the normalized chi-square measure (¢2) used in Gale and Church (1991a) shares some of the important properties of average mutual information (for example, it is completely symmetric with respect to 1-1 and 0-0 matches). 8 We are thankful to Ken Church and the AT&T Bell Laboratories for providing us with a prealigned Hansards corpus.

NUMBER OF SENTENCES IN COMMON: 167 The words appear together in 167 English sentences. Champollion now gives all the candidate final translations; that is, the best translations at each stage of the iteration process. The best single word translation is thus (officielles), the best pair (officielles, langues), the best translation with 8 words (suivantes, doug, ddposer, lewis, pdtitions, honneur, officielles, langues ). The word groups are treated as sets, with no ordering. The numbers are the associated similarity score (using the Dice coefficient)for the best translation at each iteration and the number of candidate translations that passed the threshold among the word groups considered at that iteration. There are thus 11 single words that pass the thresholds at the first iteration, 35 pairs of words, and so on. CANDIDATE TRANSLATIONS: officielles, 0.94 out of 11 officielles langues, 0.95 out of 35 honneur officielles langues, 0.45 out of 61 d6poser honneur officielles langues, 0.36 out of 71 d6poser p6titions honneur officielles langues, 0.34 out of 56 d6poser lewis p6titions honneur officielles langues, 0.32 out of 28 doug d6poser lewis p6titions honneur officielles langues, 0.32 out of 8 suivantes doug d4poser lewis p6titions honneur officielles langues, 0.20 out of 1 Champollion then selects the optimal translation, which is the translation with the highest similarity score.

EXAMPLE SENTENCE: Le d6put6 n' ignore pas que le gouvernement compte pr6senter, avant la fin de 1' ann6e, un projet de r6vision de la Loi sur les langues officielles. Finally, additional information concerning word order is computed and presented. For a rigid collocation such as this one, Champollion will print for all words in the selected translation except the first one their distance from the first word. In our example, the second word (langues) appears in most cases one word before officielles, to form the compound langues officielles. Note that this information is added during postprocessing after the translation has been selected, and takes very little time to compute because of the indexing.

However, as Figure 3 shows, high values of the threshold parameter cause the algorithm to miss a significant percentage of valid translations. Intuitively, we expect this problem to be alleviated if a higher threshold value is used for the final admittance of a translation, but a lower threshold is used internally when the subparts of the translation are considered. Our second simulation experiment tested this expectation for various values of the final threshold using a lower initial threshold equal to a constant ~ < 1 times the final threshold. The results are represented by the remaining curves of Figure 3. Surprisingly, we found that with moderate values of c~ (close to 1) this method gives a very low failure rate even for high final threshold values, and is preferable to using a constant but lower threshold just to reduce the failure rate. For example, running the algorithm at an initial threshold of 0.3 and a final threshold of 0.6 gives a failure rate of 0.45%, much less than the failure rate of 6.59% which corresponds to a constant threshold of 0.3 for both stages.

Since few of the 20,000 points in each sample meet the criterion of having Dice(AB, X) greater or equal to the threshold for high final threshold values, the estimate of the percentage of failures is more susceptible to random variation in such cases. Furthermore, since the same sample (for a given No) is used for all values of c~, any such random variation due to small sample size will be replicated in all curves of Figure 3. 25 Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou Translating Collocations for Bilingual Lexicons Table 7 Failure rate of several variants of the translation algorithm for representative thresholds.

Applications","paragraphs":["A bilingual lexicon of collocations has a variety of potential uses. The most obvious are machine translation and machine-assisted human translation, but other multilingual applications, including information retrieval, summarization, and computational lexicography, also require access to bilingual lexicons.","While some researchers are attempting machine translation through purely statistical techniques, the more common approach is to use some hybrid of interlingual and transfer techniques. These symbolic machine translation systems must have access to a bilingual lexicon and the ability to construct one semi-automatically would ease the development of such systems. Champollion is particularly promising for this purpose for two reasons. First, it constructs translations for multiword collocations. Collocations are known to be opaque; that is, their meaning often derives from the combination of the words and not from the meaning of the individual words themselves. As a result, translation of collocations cannot be done on a word-by-word basis, and some representation of collocations in both languages is needed if the system is to translate fluently. Second, collocations are domain dependent. Particularly in technical domains, the collocations differ from those in general use. Accordingly, the ability to automatically discover collocations for a given domain by using a new corpus as input to Champollion would ease the work required to transfer an MT system to a new domain.","Multilingual systems are now being developed in addition to pure machine translation systems. These systems also need access to bilingual phrases. We are currently developing a multilingual summarization system, in which we will use the results from Champollion. An early version of this system (McKeown and Radev 1995) produces short summaries of multiple news articles covering the same event using as input the templates produced by information extraction systems developed under the ARPA message understanding program. Since some information extraction systems, such as General Electric's NLToolset (Jacobs and Rau 1990), already produce similar representations for Japanese and English news articles, the addition of an English summary generator will automatically allow for English summarization of Japanese. In addition, we are planning to add a second language for the summaries. While the output is not a direct translation of input articles, collocations that appear frequently in the news articles will also appear in summaries. Thus, a list of bilingual collocations would be useful for the summarization process.","Information retrieval is another prospective application. As shown in Maarek and Smadja (1989) and more recently in Broglio et al. (1995), the precision of information retrieval systems can be improved through the use of collocations in addition to the more traditional single word indexing units. A collocation gives the context in which a given word was used, whicl~ will help retrieve documents using the word with the same sense and thus improve precision. The well-known New Mexico example in information retrieval describes an oft-encountered problem when single word searches are employed: searching for new and Mexico independently will retrieve a multitude of documents that do not relate to New Mexico. Automatically identifying and explicitly using collocations such as New Mexico at search or indexing time can help solve this problem. We have licensed XTRACT to several sites that are using it to improve the accuracy of their retrieval or text categorization systems.","A bilingual list of collocations could be used for the development of a multilingual information retrieval system. In cases where the database of texts includes documents written in multiple languages, the search query need only be expressed in one language. The bilingual collocations could be used to translate the query (particularly 30 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 Table 10 Some translations with closed class words produced by"]},{"title":"Champollion.","paragraphs":["English Collocation French Translation Found by"]},{"title":"Champollion","paragraphs":["amount of money capital gains consumer protection dispute settlement mechanism drug abuse employment equity environmental protection federal sales tax somme d' argent gains en capital la protection des consommateurs m6canisme de r6glement des diff6rends 1' abus des drogues 6quitd en mati~re d'emploi protection de 1' environnement taxe de vente f~derale"]},{"title":"Tools for the target language.","paragraphs":["Tools in French, such as a morphological analyzer, a tagger, a list of acronyms, a robust parser, and various lists of tagged words, would be most helpful and would allow us to improve our results.

In addition, running XTRACT on the French part of the corpus would allow for independent confirmation of the proposed translations, which should be French collocations. Similarly, a morphological analyzer would allow us to produce richer results, since several forms of the same word would be conflated, increasing both the expected and the actual frequencies of the co-occurrence events; this has been found empirically to have a positive effect in overall performance in other problems (Hatzivassiloglou in press). Note that ignoring inflectional distinctions can sometimes have a detrimental effect if only particular forms of a word participate in a given collocation.

This problem is due not only to the frequencies of the source collocations or of the words involved but also to the frequencies of their \"official\" translations.

Although organizations such as the United Nations, the European Community, and governments of countries with several official languages are big producers, such corpora are still difficult to obtain for research purposes. While aligned bilingual corpora will become 33 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 more available in the future, it would be helpful if we could relax the constraint for aligned data. Bilingual corpora in the same domain, which are not necessarily translations of each other, are more easily available. For example, news agencies such as the Associated Press and Reuters publish in several languages. News stories often relate similar facts but they are not direct translations of one another. Even though the stories probably use equivalent terminology, totally different techniques would be necessary to be able to use such \"nonalignable\" corpora as databases. Ultimately, such techniques would be more useful than those currently used, because they would be able to extract knowledge from noisy data. While this is definitely a large research problem, our research team at Columbia University has begun work in this area (Fung and McKeown 1994) that shows promise for noisy parallel corpora (in which the target corpus may contain either additional or deleted paragraphs and where the languages themselves do not involve neat sentence-by-sentence translations).

Finally, a quick look at a bilingual dictionary, even for two widely studied languages such as English and French, shows that correspondences between collocations in two languages are largely unexplored. Thus, the ability to compile a set of translations for a new domain automatically will ultimately increase the portability of machine translation systems. By applying"]},{"title":"Champollion","paragraphs":["to a corpus in a new domain, translations for the domain-specific collocations can be automatically compiled and inaccurate results filtered by a native speaker of the target language.","The output of our system is a bilingual list of collocations that can be used in a variety of multilingual applications. It is directly applicable to machine translation systems that use a transfer approach, since such systems rely on correspondences between words and phrases of the source and target languages. For interlingua systems, identification of collocations and their translations provide a means of augmenting the interlingua. Since such phrases cannot be translated compositionally, they indicate where concepts representing such phrases must be added to the interlingua. Such bilingual phrases are also useful for other multilingual tasks, including information retrieval of multilingual documents given a phrase in one language, summarization in one language of texts in another, and multilingual generation.","Finally, we have carried out three evaluations of the system on three separate years of the Hansards corpus.

This line of research aims at producing tools 34 Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou Translating Collocations for Bilingual Lexicons that satisfactorily handle relatively simple tasks. These tools can then be used by other systems to address more complex tasks. For example, previous work has addressed low-level tasks such as tagging a free-style corpus with part-of-speech information (Church 1988), aligning a bilingual corpus (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991), and producing a list of collocations (Smadja 1993). While each of these tools is based on simple statistics and tackles elementary tasks, we have demonstrated with our work on Champollion that by combining them, one can reach new levels of complexity in the automatic treatment of natural languages.
