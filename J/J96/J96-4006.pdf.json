Introduction A long-standing debate in the computational linguistic community is about the generality of lexical taxonomies. Many linguists (Nirenburg 1995; Hirst 1995) stress that taxonomies that are not language neutral, at least at the intermediate and high level, have little hope of success. On the other hand, lexicon builders who have experience of designing taxonomies for real applications claim that in sublanguages there exist very domain-dependent similarity relations. Given our experience and results, we are inclined to take the second position, but we are indeed sensitive to the theoretical motivations of the first.","The problem is that the similarity relations suggested by the thematic structures of words 1 in sentences are highly domain dependent, and it is difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to find common invariants across sublanguages when this model of word similarity is adopted. On the other hand, conceptual, or compositional models of similarity are much more difficult to understand and formalize on a systematic basis, because of the difficulty of defining a commonly agreed upon set of semantic primitives into which words may be decomposed.","It may be possible, however, and highly interesting, to integrate the results of a purely inductive method, such as the conceptual clustering system CIAULA (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c, 1996a), and a hand-encoded, domain-general classification, such as, for example, WordNet. The purpose of one such experiment, which we describe in this paper, is to find some points of contact between psychologically motivated models, as WordNet, and data-driven models, as CIAULA. 2 2. Detecting Verb Similarities with a Sublanguage To analyze verb similarities, we used CIAULA, a conceptual clustering algorithm for word classification, which we applied to the task of verb categorization. We will not provide details of the specific algorithm used (they may be found in works referred to above), we will simply summarize the main features of the system. * Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, 00133 Roma, Italy t Istituto di Informatica, Via delle Brecce Bianche, Ancona, Italy 1 This is referred to in the literature as a relational model of similarity. 2 This research has been partially funded by the European Commission, under the ESPRIT-ECRAN project.

We observed that, by tuning the model parameters to obtain clusters of \"very similar\" instances, a percentage varying between 30% and 60% of verbs (depending upon the number of input observations) belong to singletons, that is, are not \"similar enough\" to any other verb. If we relax these constraints, we obtain larger clusters and fewer singletons, but verbs in a cluster are less semantically close to each other.","In Figure 1 we show two basic-level categories obtained with different values of the model parameters, for the RSD.

Our contribution to this long-standing issue will be empirical, rather than methodological.","3. Analysing the Relations between Corpus-induced and Human-deduced Categories In this section, we propose a method to analyze the relations between a domain-general ontology, such as WordNet, derived by linguists seeking language-neutral principles, and our example-driven clusters, derived by CIAULA. The purpose of this analysis is not to validate CIAULA with WordNet, nor to augment WordNet with CIAULA. Rather, our purpose is to identify commonalities and discrepancies, and to investigate the possibility of profitably integrating the two approaches.","One of the motivations for using WordNet is that, in WordNet, verb meaning is represented in terms of semantic relations, rather than semantic primitives (Miller and Fellbaum 1991).

In some cases, the problem is the overambiguity and the very fine-grained concept labels adopted in WordNet. Especially with large CIAULA clusters, the number of synsets becomes too large, and the algorithm does not gain enough evidence of any significantly promising pattern in the hierarchy. The second problem is the overspecificity of CIAULA. For example, verbs in the second cluster of the previous example (i.e., the \"bad\" choice), have been clustered because they occurred in patterns like:"]},{"title":"the laW~DoCUMENT indicates (establish, determine... ) the deadline/TaMeorcaa_ENT~Ty for the presentation ....","paragraphs":["It is unlikely that the linguists who developed WordNet had in mind such a narrow use of these verbs when classifying them.","WordNet labels for CIAULA classes are somewhat overly general. Different CIAULA clusters received the same WordNet label, and this was used as a hint to further structure the induced classification. An example is shown in Figure 3. The resulting taxonomy is built under a default node.","In a second set of experiments, we ran CIAULA on a more homogeneous set of verbs. Rather than inducing verb categories from scratch, we augmented the semantic bias of CIAULA by preclassifying all the verbs in the RSD using the 15 WordNet semantic domains for verbs, which are:"]},{"title":"bodily care, change, cognition, communication,","paragraphs":["563 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 competition, consumption, contact, creation, emotion, motion, perception, possession, social in-teraction, stative, and weather. We then fed CIAULA with groups of verbs belonging to each of these categories. Of course, many of these verbs are ambiguous, but we used a probabilistic method (Basili et al. 1995) to select the observations of each verb that are genuine examples of a semantic domain.","This experiment produced rather appropriate classifications. Table 1 shows the labels assigned to some basic-level clusters generated by CIAULA for the RSD verbs belonging to the semantic category cognition. Figure 4 shows an excerpt of the CIAULA clusters of Table 1, with the prototypical description of each cluster.","In Table I the fourth column (Overlap Score) is the ratio between verbs in a cluster (column 1) that belong to the WordNet synset of column 3, and the cardinality of the cluster. In fact the best synset for a cluster does not necessarily cover all the cluster members. In the full experiment, 67% of the clusters have a score _> 0.5, indicating a good overlap between CIAULA and WordNet. Worst clusters, as far as the overlap score is concerned, are those in which there are very high-level and ambiguous verbs, like make. These verbs usually produce noise, because of WordNet ambiguity and of the spurious (for the category) input examples fed to CIAULA.","There are instead clusters with a low overlap score that seem very appropriate if one looks at the usage patterns in the corpus. For examples, the verbs of cluster 2,725 in Table I are highly characterized (i.e., have high local membership values) by the fact that they take as object some physical PROPERTY (PR) of a NATURAL_OBJECT. If we consider the prototypical descriptions of clusters globally, we observe recurrent patterns of use of the clustered verbs. Verbs of cognition in the RSD are strongly characterized by a MENTAL OBJECT (MO), or COGNITIVE_PROCESS (CO), or ABSTRACTION (ABS), in the position of direct object (AFFECTED). Frequently, the object of a cognition verb is a physical PROPERTY or a NATURAL_OBJECT, and the analysis is performed with some INSTRUMENTALITY (INS) (... cloud parameters are derived from satellite... ).","In order to analyze the correspondence/divergence between human-coded verb classes and data-driven clusters we can compare the argument structure proposed for the synsets in WordNet and the intentional description of the classes, i.e., the prototypical semantic patterns of CIAULA clusters (Figure 4).","The WordNet argument structure for verbs, however, simply provides a qualitative description of the possible phrasal patterns in which verbs in a given synset can be used. For example the sense record, enter, put down, make a record of of the verb to record (line 1 in Table 1), is described by","(3) {Somebody, Something} records {something, somebody} Somebody records that CLAUSE","As shown, the information available is mainly syntactic, with the exception of the ANIMATE/INANIMATE distinction for the arguments.","The classification of CIAULA assigns the verb to record to four classes: (1) record, enter, put down, make a record of, (2) decide, make up one's mind, decide upon, determine, (3) create, make, and (4) investigate, look into, as shown in Table 1.

Within the general properties of taking an (INANIMATE or ANIMATE) entity as subject and object, however, CIAULA specifies the semantics of the object and subject typical of the domain. For example (see cluster 4,170) in this domain, the activity of recording, evaluating, plotting a PROPERTY (e.g., sea surface temperature, wind speed .... ) is significant; In some cases the (weak) semantic expectations on the argument structure in WordNet are violated.

Some relations are not predicted by WordNet, as for example pattern (iii). Locative relations are treated in WordNet as lexical adjuncts of the verb to record. However, they seem very relevant in the sublanguage (as for example in sentences like: ... pollutants are recorded and analyzed in surface waters, temperature is recorded (collected) in the bay area ... ). It seems that (some) lexical adjuncts may play an important role in the definition of domain-specific senses of verbs. 566","paragraphs":["Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi Verb Classification","It appears that much information relevant for the lexical encoding of verbs is domain specific and is completely missing in a general-purpose classification like WordNet. Therefore, semantically driven NL interpreters may profitably be augmented with the information obtained by merging these different sources.","A further interesting issue is related to identical tags assigned to different clusters. Verbs in these classes should express similar acts or events. An analysis of the prototypical patterns that CIAULA assigns to these classes suggests that despite the shared WordNet tags, verbs in these classes are very different.","For example, the classes 2,383, 2,055, 3,518, 2,102, 914 are all labeled create, make, a very general synset in WordNet. Their patterns are very different, and show almost no overlap. The main motivation for this divergence between WordNet tagging and the meanings of CIAULA clusters is twofold. On the one hand, CIAULA clusters are very fine grained, as they are built from single observations of verb uses. On the other hand, WordNet is often missing most of these precise (technical) uses of verbs. As a result, the labeling algorithm of Figure 2 is forced to generalize over many levels, with a consequent loss of information. The argument structure of the reached synset is thus too generic. It is worth noticing that even in these cases, we still achieve useful information, since the WordNet argument structure can be further specified by domain-specific semantic constraints. The class 2,055, for example, may be described by an extended argument structure like","(4) {Somebody, Something} makes {X}, where X is an ABSTRACTION 4. Conclusions The results illustrated in this paper are very interesting, though not conclusive. Verbs are vessels for human creativity in language communication, and so much is left to further studies. We discovered thematic features that are apparently more \"basic\" than others, with respect to a given semantic domain (cognition) and a given sublanguage (RSD). We could specify features that were described at a very general level in WordNet, and detect semantic restrictions specific to the sublanguage, not accounted for in WordNet. These results suggest that, with appropriate customization, it is still possible to exploit the information in general-purpose on-line thesauri that would be otherwise almost unusable in real NLP applications. As proposed in this paper, an appropriate process of lexical tuning can significantly reduce the overgenerality (excessive ambiguity) and underspecificity (weak constraints on verb argument structures) that is typical of general-purpose resources.","References","Basili, R., Della Rocca M., Pazienza, P.
