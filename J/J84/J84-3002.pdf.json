For any L, one can consider two collections of strings of symbols, one consisting of all strings over the terminal vocabulary of L, call it W*(L), the other consisting of that always very proper subcollection of W*(L) consisting of all and only those members of W*(L) that are well-formed, that is, that correspond to sentences of L. Call the latter collection WF(L).","During the early development of generative grammar, a number of attempts were made to show, for various choices of L, that WF(L) was"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["a context-free (CF) string collection. These attempts all had, naturally, a common logical structure. First, it was claimed that there was some mathematical property P which, if possessed by some collection of strings, C, rendered C non-CF. Second, it was claimed that WF(C) had P, so the conclusion followed. Two sorts of criticisms can be, and have • been, directed at such attempted demonstrations. One attacks the mathematical foundations and argues, for particular choices of P, that a collection manifesting P is not necessarily not CF. The other type of criticism admits that if a collection manifests a particular property P, it is thereby not CF, but contends that the WF(L)s claimed to manifest P in fact don't.","A survey of the various attempts, from roughly 1960 to 1982, to prove for various L that WF(L) is not CF is provided in Pullum and Gazdar (1982). These authors conclude, justifiably we believe, that for one or the other of the reasons mentioned above, none of these attempts, including those by the present authors, stand up. Despite widespread belief to the contrary, as of 1982 there had been no demonstration that there is some NL L for which WF(L) is not CF. 2","However, Langendoen and Postal (1984) have obtained a result infinitely stronger than the claim that for some L, WF(L) is not CF. This work shows that for any L, WF(L) is a proper class, hence not a set, much less a recursively enumerable set. There is thus no question of WF(L) being CF. Moreover, WF(L) can then have no constructive characterization (generative grammar), although there is no reason to doubt that it can be given a nonconstructive characterization. But the demonstration of Langendoen and Postal (1984) is based on principles that determine WF(L) includes nonfinite strings corresponding to nonfinite (transfinite) sentences. It is the existence of such sentences that places complete NLs beyond generative (constructive) characterization. Nevertheless, as noted in Langendoen and Postal (1984: 103), this novel result still leaves entirely open the question of whether that subpart of WF(L) consisting of all and only the well-formed"]},{"title":"finite","paragraphs":["strings in W*(L) is CF.

Postal and D. Terence Langendoen 1. Neither FWF(E1) nor FWF(E2) is CF. The demonstration of (1) makes use of the following corollary of a theorem of Arbib (1969) about language intersections:","2. The Intersection Theorem Let L be a stringset ar~l let R be a regular stringset. If L n R is not a CF stringset, then neither is L. One can then show that, for example, FWF(E1) and FWF(E2) are not CF by finding some regular set R such that R n FWF(EI) and R n FWF(E2) are not CF (Daly 1974)."]},{"title":"1. The Sluicing Construction","paragraphs":["The present demonstration that FWF(E), E ranging over various forms of English, is not CF is based on the sluicing construction, first discussed by Ross (1969) and more recently by van Riemsdijk (1978) and Levin (1982). Standard examples of this construction include: 3a. He stole something but it's not known what. b. Someone stole the jewels and I can tell you who. c. The police found him in some bar but the paper","didn't say which one. The sluicing construction has the following properties:","4a. It consists of n (n > 2) clauses, often, but not necessarily coordinate clauses joined by but","b. Each of the second to nth clauses counting from the left contains a wh-phrase, WH, which corresponds to a potential indefinite phrase found in the first clause.","c. WH has an interpretation equivalent to an entire wh-clause, WH+Z, and the 'missing parts' are understood as identical to the first clause minus the potential indefinite phrase. The reason for the strange usage 'potential indefinite phrase' in (4b) is the existence of sluicing cases like (5b) and (6b) alongside (5a) and (6a):","5a. Martha was abducted by someone but we don't","know by who(m).","b. Martha was abducted but we don't know by","who(m). 6a. The doctors screamed for some reason but we don't","know why. b. The doctors screamed but we don't know why. Depending on frameworks, one might analyze cases like (5b) and (6b) as involving invisible versions of indefinite phrases like those in the corresponding (5a) and (6a). But this matter need not concern us. We can concentrate on cases where alternatives like (5b) and (6b) are not possible, as in (7): 7a. Max visited someone but we don't know who. b. *Max discussed Tom but we don't know who. c. *Max discussed but we don't know who. English and the Class of Context-Free Languages That is, we pick cases where WH can only be anaphorically connected to a visible element in the first clause. From this point on, references to the sluicing construction only denote cases of this restricted sort. The nature of the formal argument to be presented is such that this limitation in no way impugns the validity of the present result, since one can still construct a model of the intersection situation described at the end of the previous section.","In (3a), WH is what, the indefinite phrase corresponding to it is something and WH is understood as equivalent to the wh-clause what he stole, since he stole is the whole first clause minus the indefinite phrase. A similar analysis holds for (3b).","In (3), as in most of the examples in the literature previously illustrating the sluicing construction, the indefinite phrase in the first clause is an indefinite pronoun, and WH is a wh-pronoun. However, both phrases can consist of multi-word sequences:","8a. Sarah considered some proposals but it's unknown","how many.","b. If any books are still left on the sale table, find out","which ones.","c. The warehouse will ship us several typewriters but","we have no idea how many machines.","d. A few physicians still use this drug and Sam can tell","you how many doctors.","e. Joe discussed certain formulas but which formulas","is uncertain. Let us from this point on, for simplicity, limit attention to sluicing constructions consisting of only two clauses. Then it is possible to represent all the relevant cases schematically as follows:","9. V QI XI W [Y Q2 X2 Z], where V, W, Y and Z are strings; QI is an indefinite quantifier or pronoun; Xl is the rest of the nominal quantified by Q1; Q2 is a wh-quantifier or pronoun anaphorically related to Q1; and X2 is the rest of the nominal quantified by Q2. Moreover, Q2 X2 (= WH) is understood as a wh-clause that contains material from V or W. Table 1 presents the values of Q1, X1, Q2 and x2 in the examples in (8a-e). Henceforth, we further restrict the class of sluicing constructions under consideration, limit-ing attention only to examples like (8c-e), in which X1 and X2 are neither empty nor pronouns.","In (8c-e), the main stress on the wh-phrase can fall on either Q2 or on X2. If it falls on X2, then the wh-phrase can not be anaphorieally related to the corresponding indefinite phrase in the first clause. While we cannot, and need not, give a theoretical account of \"anaphorically related\", informally it means that the potential reference of the wh-phrase is determined by that of its antecedent. Hence the lack of anaphoric connection in cases of stressed X2 means that in particular, in (8c), machines does not denote the same things that typewriters does in that sentence; in (8d), physicians 178 Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Paul M.

The whole compound can be used as an anaphor for itself in both E1 and E2, as in (15a). But store cannot be used as an anaphor for candy store in (15b) in El, since SMC is not satisfied. On the other hand, store can be used as an anaphor for candy store in (15b) in E2, presumably since a candy store is a certain kind of store; that is, candy store is an endocentric compound. However, escape cannot be used as an anaphor for fire escape, even in E2, since a fire escape, which is a certain kind of physical object, is not an escape, which is a certain kind of event; that is, fire escape is an exocentric compound. Finally, hater and lover cannot be used as anaphors for bourbon hater or bourbon lover in (15d,e), since the agentive noun hater is used only in compounds and lover; by itself has a limited (sexual) meaning which makes it unsuitable as an anaphor for compounds such as bourbon lover","An important consequence for the present discussion is that if one limits the vocabulary over which sluicing constructions are formed in the right way, the conditions of linkage in E1 and E2, though intensionally distinct, become extensionally identical.

A copying language is any language of the form: L {cxdxe ] x E (a,b)* and a,b,c,d,e are fixed strings} Given that English contains a sluicing construction characterized as in section 1, one can prove that FWF(E), E ranging over E1 and E2, is not CF by means of the Intersection Theorem of (2) and the fact that copying languages are not CF (Langendoen 1977). To prove that FWF(E) is not CF, one must find a regular language R whose intersection I with FWF(E) is not CF. Such an R is given in (18):","18. R = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH bourbon y is unknown t x,y E (hater, lover)*} Since R is a concatenation of regular languages, it is itself regular.","Now consider the intersection of R with FWF(E). The matching condition on sluicing constructions guarantees that this intersection is the copying language I in (19):","19. I = {Joe discussed some bourbon x but WHICH bourbon x is unknown ] x,y ~ (hater, lover)*} Since I is not CF, by the Intersection Theorem, neither is FWF(E).","As has been stressed, limitations on the vocabulary render the distinct sluicing conditions of E1 and E2 equivalent over certain subcollections of sluicing cases. It follows that the demonstration just presented holds not only for E1 and E2 but more generally for any variant of English whose matching condition for sluicing, even if different from that of both E1 and E2 for the full collection of English sentences, has the same extension for the language R of (18). We see no current reason to doubt that this will include every variant of English. 3."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["Gazdar (1983: 86), summarizing inter alia the conclusions of Pullum and Gazdar (1982), makes the following claims:","20a. \"There is no reason, at the present time, to think that NLs are not CFLs.\"","b. \"There are good reasons for thinking that the notations we need to capture significant syntactic generalisations will characterise CF-PSGs, or some minor generalisations of them, such as Indexed Grammars.\" 180 Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1984 Paul M. Postal and D. Terence Langendoen English and the Class of Context-Free Languages But as Langendoen and Postal (1984) shows, NLs are proper classes not sets, so the question of WF(L)s as wholes being CF no longer arises. Restricting attention to FWF(L)s, the result of Section 2 shows that for any dialect E of English for which MC holds, FWF(E) is not CF.","Since, however, neither FWF(E) nor any other FWF(L) has been shown to lie outside the domain of indexed languages (ILs) in the sense of Aho (1968), it would appear that one can conclude that while the collection of all sentences in an NL K is a proper class, FWF(K) is an IL. Consequently, a correct account of NL grammars must be such that a proper grammar for K specifies K as an appropriate proper class 5 and entails that FWF(K) is an IL. A grammatical theory with just these properties remains to be constructed. 5By 'appropriate', we mean one which satisfies inter alia the axiom called Closure Under Coordinate Compounding of Sentences in Langendoen and Postal (1984: 53). This is necessary for the proof that NLs are proper classes."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Aho, A.V. 1968 Indexed Grammars-An Extension of Context-Free Grammars, Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery 15: 647-671.","Arbib, M. 1969 Theories of Abstract Automata.
