It mostly relies on intuitive reasoning and lacks a sound theoretical foundation. This paper sets a formal and quantitative proposal for this task. In particular, a measure of performance that allows the basic input-output characteristics of a system to be evaluated is introduced first at an abstract level. The definition of concrete measures is then obtained by assigning actual values to the functional parameters of the abstract definition; some particular cases are shown and discussed in detail. Finally, the task of measuring performance in practice is considered, and a model for experimental performance evaluation is presented. Comparison with related works is also briefly discussed; open problems and promising directions for future research are outlined. A limited case study experimentation with the model proposed is presented in the appendix. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Research on natural language processing has recently been featured by the design and implementation of a number of experimental systems. Recent survey reports (Waltz 1977, Kaplan 1982) mention more than one hundred items among the most successful and relevant systems in the classical application fields of data base inquiry, machine translation, question answering, and man-machine interfacing.","This trend is not surprising in the context of research whose specific aim is that of providing automat-ed tools for the understanding or translating of natural languages; but it is also evident even in natural language research with a more theoretical flavour.

Despite its large recognized relevance (Woods 1977, Tennant 1980), measuring the performance of a system for natural language processing is still poorly defined. It mostly relies on intuitive reasoning and lacks a sound theoretical foundation. As Tennant clearly points out (1980), there is a nearly complete absence of meaningful evaluation in current natural language processing research. This leaves several crucial questions unanswered: • What is the relevance and value of obtained results? • How general are the proposed solutions? • How do they compare with other proposals? • What problems are still open? • What directions have to be followed? • What issues are to be faced in the progress of the","research?

In particular, we give a formal definition of \"understanding power\", and we propose some techniques for measuring this feature in practice. Our proposal is based on several assumptions we discuss be-low.","First, we assume as object of our attention only that module of a natural language system that is devoted to understanding natural language, that is, to map-ping input expressions into formal internal representations. This can clearly include several kinds of processing activities, such as linguistic analysis, reasoning, inferencing, etc.; but must have as ultimate goal the construction of a correct internal representation, not the production of any type of service to the end user of the natural language system. Thus, for example, a question answering system (Tennant 1979) does not belong to the class of natural language understanding systems that concern us; instead, it is the natural language interface it contains that meets exactly our requirements.","Second, we assume the following naive notion of performance: the extent to which a system is able to correctly understand natural language expressions in a given application domain. The resources needed by the system to accomplish its task are irrelevant in this case. In other words, we want to capture and measure the \"power\" of the system, in terms of how much and how well it is capable of understanding, not its \"efficiency\", that is, how much does it cost (for example, in terms of time and memory requirements) to understand what it is capable of understanding.","Third, we want to define a measure of performance that allows the evaluation of the input-output characteristics of a particular system in a given domain. This kind of measure is clearly inappropriate to reveal and test features, such as the power of a model as opposed to that of a particular implementation of it, the applicability of the model to other domains, its extensibility, etc., which are more closely related to the internal structure and mode of operation of a system, rather than to its input-output behaviour. The goal of evaluating such more general properties, worked on by Tennant (1980) through the method of"]},{"title":"abstract analysis","paragraphs":["(mainly based on taxonomies of conceptual, linguistic, and implementational issues), is not considered in this work.","This paper is organized in the following way. In section 2 we discuss in an intuitive, yet precise, way the basic concepts involved in the performance evaluation problem, in order to have a sufficiently clear specification of what we want to formalize. Then, in section 3, we give an abstract definition of the formal model, and in section 4 we discuss some actual cases of particular interest. Section 5 presents some techniques that could be used to measure in practice the performance of a natural language understanding system. In section 6 we discuss some concluding remarks, and present open problems and promising topics for future research. A limited case study experimentation with the model proposed is presented in the appendix.","2. Basic Definitions and Statement of the Problem Let us introduce some background definitions needed to clearly state the problem of performance evaluation, as discussed in this work.

Introducing a more definite notion of expression is not necessary at this point for our purpose of stating the problem of performance evaluation.","Although the above definition includes expressions of arbitrarily (finite) length, so that A contains infinitely many expressions, in a more pragmatic approach the length of existing expressions of a natural language at a given moment of its history has an upper bound.

A Theoretical Framework Before tackling the core topic of this section in a formal way, let us examine from an intuitive point of view the basic requirements for a measure of performance ~r to be reasonably acceptable. The primary goal is that it should allow consistent comparison among different systems, in the sense that if ~r(U 1) = qr(U 2) the behaviour of the two systems U 1 and U 2 should be sufficiently similar, and that if ~r(Ul)>~r(U2), U 1 should perform better than U 2.","Furthermore, this comparison should be as fine and precise as possible, in such a way to capture all the essential features of the behaviour of a system U in a given domain.","Finally, comparison might be between two different systems, between two versions of the same system, between a system and a given set of issues, or between a system and an independent scale (Tennant 1980).","To capture the intuitive notion of performance according to the above requirements, at least two points of view seem worth considering. First, a measure of performance should give a numerical value for","u the \"distance\" between the two functions gR/D and gD' that is, the measure should allow us to formalize","u how near gR/D(e) approaches ~D(e) for any eeE, or, more explicitly, how well each expression e£E is understood by the system U. Second, it should weight this notion of \"distance\" in such a way as to take into account the fact that, generally, it is not equally important to understand well any expression in E; for example, it could be reasonable to suppose that correct understanding of expressions in L D is far more relevant than in E--LD, or that correct understanding is more important for frequently used expressions than for unusual and rare ones.","According to the above remarks, an appropriate notion of performance qr will depend on two basic parameters: (i) the shifting #","u","between gR/D(e) and ~D(e) for any eEE (ii) the importance p for any expression eeE to be correctly understood. Different choices of /z and p clearly provide differ-","ent notions of performance, ~r[/~,0], that fit different needs for capturing particular classes of features in a natural language understanding system.","Let us now go further in defining an appropriate formal framework embedding the above ideas.

For example, we can further refine the above case (v), r'#4~ and r'N r\" = ~, by taking into account the actual structure of the elements of r' and r\".

Also, it generally allows far more meaningful definitions of shifting, thus further approaching the intuitive notion of \"distance\" as \"degree of understanding\".","Let us turn our attehtion now to the importance function 0.","Also for this function, a first simple proposal can be a boolean definition: no importance at all is assigned to expressions in E-L D and the same (not null) importance to every expression in L D. So we can define Pl as:","pl(e) = /~ ife~LD if eeL D for each eeE.","A refinement of p] can be obtained by analyzing the case eeL D and taking into account the frequency of use of expressions in L o. This will give more importance to the correct understanding of more frequently used expressions and less importance to that of rare or unusual ones. From the human point of view, it is obvious that texts with a greater frequency are used, and hence understood, by a larger number of people.","Therefore, it seems meaningful to consider a system that can understand quite well the relatively small number of the most common texts and fails on the most unusual ones, to be better than a system that understands a lot of very rare texts but often fails in understanding the most common ones. Formally, we can define the frequency of expressions of e as a map z : E--[0,1], with the constraint that E z(e) = 1.

It is worth noting that the length of a text is not independent of its frequency of use; we feel that in several application domains (such as, for example, man-machine interaction) short texts are much more frequent than long ones and that texts exceeding a given length are not used at all.","A more refined notion of structural complexity of an expression may be given by taking into account its syntactic structure, defined on the basis of an appropriate set of characteristic features - see, for example, the classification proposed in Tennant (1980). E can be partitioned into different and disjoint classes E i, according to the set of syntactical features they match, and an importance function P4 can be defined as above: P4(e) = ,0 i iff eEEi, where ~0iE[0,1], for i = 1 ..... m.","Let us note that, contrary to the above illustrated relation between the length of a text and its frequency, it seems reasonable to consider syntactical complexity as fully independent of frequency; in fact, quite complex syntactical features (such as ellipsis, anaphora, broken text, etc.) are frequently found in several application domains.","Finally, a couple of other possible choices for assigning the importance function p are worth mention-ing: one based on the notions of \"information content\" or \"structural complexity\" according to Kolmogorov (1965, 1968), and the other based on the concept of \"semantic complexity\" of an expression, which could be formally defined, for example, in the represented domain R. However, some more theoretical work on these notions is necessary before we can use them for our needs; hence we will not further develop these notions here."]},{"title":"5. Measuring Performance in .Practice","paragraphs":["In the preceding sections, some theoretical tools for measuring the performance of a natural language understanding system have been illustrated. At this point we have to put them to work: that is, we must discuss how the performance of a system can be actually evaluated and how the comparison between two different systems can be carried out.","We distinguish two steps in the process of performance evaluation: (i) to assign the functions/~ and p; (ii) to compute ~r[#,p]. Let us examine in detail each of the two points.","The choice 'of the shifting function /~ depends only on the degree to which we want to refine the notion of error in understanding and on the varying importance we want to assign to each type of error. Hence it is often only a matter of subjective feeling choosing appropriate values for /~ in order to analyse particular features of the system to be evaluated. Also, the definition of # is strongly dependent on the representation language R for the domain D: the richer and more structured R is, the more refined and subtle are the possible definitions of/~.","On the contrary, however, the choice of the importance function p can generally be based on more objective arguments, once an appropriate ranking among the desired understanding capabilities of the system to be evaluated has been defined. For example, in the case where the frequency of texts is taken into account, an appropriate experimental activity can provide reliable statistical estimations for the frequency z(e) of each expression eEE, thus allowing the effective computation of p(e). (Problems connected with the choice of a meaningful sample to estimate z(e) - which could freely include millions of millions of expressions - are not dealt with here, since they are more related to statistics than to computational linguistics.)","Clearly, the choice of t~ and p fully determines the numerical value of ~r[/~,p] (or of the matrix [Pi,j]) in correspondence to a given system U.

Tennant's proposal is based on the three main concepts of habitability, completeness, and abstract analysis.

The approach to performance evaluation presented in this paper has two major limitations: first, it is only concerned with input-output behaviour and does not take into account the internal model on which a system is based; second, it does not deal with the efficiency of the natural language understanding process. As far as the former topic is concerned, it is clear that, except in the case where commercial applications are considered, one is primarily interested in models rather than in particular implementations. It is far more significant that a model, a knowledge representation method, and a parsing algorithm have been designed to build natural language understanding systems rather than that a specific system has been constructed in a particular domain for a particular use.

Wider experiments will be the subject of a future paper.","For this limited experimentation we have chosen the PARNAX system (Comino et al. 1983): a natural language interface for querying in Italian ADABAS data bases. The toy data base utilized concerns the employees of a company, and contains just the EMPLOYEE file with the following record structure: (ii) eliminating all queries differing only for the val-","ues of the attributes (for example, \"Tell me the","birth-date of John\" and \"Tell me the birth-date","of Robert\"), except one. Note that this preprocessing constitutes a kind of very naive stratification, consisting in the choice of only some elements as representative for a class of cases. A v contains about 800 queries.","The shifting function /z has been chosen to be the boolean function:","{0 if g(e)=g(e) /~(g(e),g(e)) = if g(e)#g(e) NAME DATE-OF-BIRTH PLACE-OF-BIRTH PLACE-OF-RESIDENCE HIRING-DATE DEPARTMENT JOB-LEVEL DEGREE","The PARNAX system, that is, the natural language understanding system U to be evaluated, maps natural language queries (more generally, query dialogues) into expressions of the formal query language used to access the ADABAS data base, namely the NATURAL language.","Owing to the very simple data base chosen, the domain D is reasonably limited, and so are L D (the set of all possible queries in Italian to the EMPLOYEE file) and R (the set of all possible NATURAL queries).","We consider two goals for this experiment: namely, evaluating some aspects of the conceptual competence and of the linguistic competence.","According to these goals, two samples of queries have been collected from LtD-ZL D (recall that the linguistic coverage L wD-E should generally be larger than L D - see section 6): A: A sample of casual queries to the data base. Nine","hundred fifty queries have been collected from 90","people chosen from several different classes of","possible users of the data base. B: A sample of linguistic variations for expressing a","specific request. The sentence to be rephrased","has been chosen of medium-level complexity with","respect to the sample data base so as to allow","meaningful linguistic variations to be formed.","The query utilized is: \"Tell me the birth-date of","all employees who have a master degree in","mathematics\". Five hundred queries have been","collected from 35 people. The sample A was then slightly preprocessed before being used for the evaluation.

For what concerns the sample A t , two functions have been considered: - pl=l -- 02(e) = if eeL D (see section 4, 02).","For the sample B the most natural choice for 0 seemed to be the frequency of queries. Unfortunately, only very few (30 queries in sample B turned out to be repeated (one repetition for two queries, two repetitions for another query; note that this result is highly surprising even if the set from which B has been extracted is enormously large). Therefore, frequency was abandoned. Two other criteria were considered: namely length and structural features.","For what concerns the former, the length (number of words) of each sentence was computed first and Table 1 obtained. The length interval [5,26] was then partitioned into three parts: [12,16], into which about 70% of the sentences of B fall; [7,111U[17,18], includes about 25% of the expressions of B; [5,61U[19,26], to which less than 5% of the sentences of B belong. has been","Here, the importance of recognizing an expression is assumed to be proportional to the \"weight\" (cardinality) of the length class to which it belongs. For what concerns the latter criterion, we first defined a taxonomy of linguistic elements suitable for analys-ing the structural features of the sentences of Sample B. The following attributes were considered (Tennant 1980): 28 Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Number 1, January-March 1984 Giovanni Guida and Giancarlo Mauri A Formal Basis for Performance Evaluation of NLUS D declarative structure G interrogative structure E imperative structure T telegraphic sentences V cleft and discontinuous sentences, parenthetic","clauses, inversions M multiple sentences R relative clauses I interrogative clauses N non-finite clauses (-ing, -ed participle) P prepositional phrases Q quantifiers, predeterminers S possessive and demonstrative clauses, personal","pronouns The sentences of B were then classified according to the above taxonomy by assigning to each of them all the relevant attributes. Fifty-two classes were obtained: 44 containing 1 to 12 sentences (total 315) 5 containing 13 to 24 sentences (total 92) 3 containing 25 to 36 sentences (total 93)","NUMBER OF LENGTH SENTENCES 5 2 6 7 7 11 8 17 9 13 10 25 11 40 12 53 13 130 14 62 15 45 16 50 17 24 18 12 19 5 20 2 21 1 26 1 Table 1.","This result suggested restricting the analysis to a smaller number of classes to be obtained through a less refined taxonomy of linguistic elements. The following attributes, which characterize the most crude features of the sentence structure, were chosen: D, G, E, T, V, M.

A global analysis of qr shows that the linguistic capabilities of PARNAX are generally higher than the conceptual ones (qr],~r 2 >> ~'3,~'4).

Cases 2 and 3 show that the system performs better in correspondence to sentences with higher importance, and, hence, it is reasonably well tailored. On the contrary, it generally lacks robustness.
