Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper addresses the problem of morphological disambiguation in Hebrew by extracting statistical information from an untagged corpus. Yet, the primary point is not to propose a method for morphological disambiguation per se, but rather to suggest a method to compute morpho-lexical probabilities to be used as a linguistic source for morphological disambiguation. Let us start with a few definitions and terminology that will be used throughout this paper.","We consider written languages, and for the purpose of this paper, a word is a string of letters delimited by spaces or punctuation.

The number and character of the analyses depend on the language model. We have used the definitions of the automatic morphological analyzer developed at the IBM Scientific Center, Haifa, Israel (Bentur, Angel', and Segev 1992).","Given a text T with n words: Wl,..., wn, for each morphologically ambiguous word Wi E T, with k analyses: A1 .....

The same word wi in a different text, may have, of course, a different right analysis, thus, right and wrong in this case are meaningful only with respect to the context in which wi appears.","Morphological disambiguation of a text T is done by indicating for each ambiguous word in T--which of its different analyses is the right one. At present, this can be done manually by a speaker of the language, and hopefully in the future it will be done automatically by a computer program. When dealing with automatic disambiguation of a text it is sometimes useful to reduce its ambiguity level. A reduction of the ambiguity level of an ambiguous word w, with k morphological analyses: A1 ..... Ak, occurs when it is possible to select from A1 ..... Ak, a proper subset of I analyses 1 G 1 < k, such that the right analysis of w is one of these 1 analyses. In the case where l = 1, we say that the word w is fully disambiguated.","Since this paper suggests a method for morphological disambiguation using probabilities, the notion of morpho-lexical probabilities is also required. Our model of the language is based on a large fixed Hebrew corpus. For a word w with k analyses, A1,..., Ak, the morpho-lexical probability of Ai is the estimate of the conditional probability P(Ai [ w) from the given corpus, i.e., Pi = P(ai ] w) =","no. of times Ai was the right analysis of w no. of occurrences of w Note that Pi is the probability that Ai is the right analysis of w independently of","the context in which w appears.

One such problem is sense disambiguation. In the context of machine translation, Dagan and Itai (Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994) used corpora in the target language to resolve ambiguities in the source language. Yarowsky (1992) proposed a method for sense disambiguation using wide contexts. Part-of-speech tagging--deciding the correct part of speech in the current context of the sentence--has received major attention. Most successful methods have followed speech recognition systems (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992) and used large corpora to deduce the probability of each part of speech in the current context (usually the two previous words--trigrams). These methods have reported performance in the range of 95-99% \"correct\" by word (DeRose 1988; Cutting et al. 1992; Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992; Kupiec 1992). (The difference in performance is due to different evaluation methods, different tag sets, and different corpora). See Church (1992) for a survey.","Our work did not use the trigram model, since because of the relatively free word order in Hebrew it was less promising, and also, in some cases the different choices are among words of the same part-of-speech category. Thus tagging for part of speech alone would not solve our problems. Note that a single morphological analysis may correspond to several senses. Even though each sense may have different behavior patterns, in practice this did not present a problem for our program.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 through 4 include a description of the morphological ambiguity problem in Hebrew, followed by the claim that knowing the morpho-lexical probabilities of an ambiguous word can be very effective for automatic morphological disambiguation in Hebrew. 384 Moshe Levinger et al."]},{"title":"Table","paragraphs":["1 The dimension of morphological ambiguity in Hebrew.

Morphological Ambiguity in Hebrew","paragraphs":["Morphological ambiguity is a severe problem in modern Hebrew. Thus, finding methods to reduce the morphological ambiguity in the language is a great challenge for researchers in the field and for people who wish to develop natural language applications for Hebrew.","Table 1 demonstrates the dimension of the morphological ambiguity in Hebrew. The data was obtained by analyzing large texts, randomly chosen from the Hebrew press, consisting of nearly 40,000 word-tokens. According to this table, the average number of possible analyses per word-token was 2.1, while 55% of the word-tokens were morphologically ambiguous. The main reason for this amount of ambiguity is the standard writing system used in modern Hebrew (unpointed script). In this writing system not all the vowels are represented, several letters represent both consonants and different vowels, and gemination is not represented at all (Ornan 1986, 1991). The rich morphology of the language and the fact that many particles are attached to the word, forming a single string, further contribute to the morphological ambiguity.","In order to demonstrate the complexity of the problem, we should take a closer look at Hebrew morphology. A"]},{"title":"morphological analysis","paragraphs":["of a word in Hebrew should extract the following information: • lexical entry 385 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 • category • tense (for verbs only) • attached particles (i.e., prepositions, connectives, determiners)","• status--a flag indicating whether a noun is in its construct or absolute form • gender, number, and person (for nouns, adjectives, verbs etc.) • gender, number, and person of pronoun suffixes","For example, the morphological analysis of the Hebrew string 1)D~I'~'lVd~I (written in a Latin transliteration 2 WK$RAYTYW) is as follows: • lexical entry: RĤ (nN'l)--the verb 'to see' • category: verb • tense: past • attached particles: W + K$ (~ + ~) = 'and when' • gender: feminine/masculine, number: singular, person: first person • object pronoun: masculine, singular, third person Thus, WK$RŶTYW should be translated into English as: 'and when I saw him.' To see the nature of the morphological ambiguity in Hebrew, consider, for example,","the string HQPH (ngpn), which has three possible analyses: 1. The determiner H + the noun QPH (ngp + D, 'the coffee'). 2. The noun HQPH (ngpn, 'encirclement').","3. The noun HQP + the feminine possessive suffix H (n + qpn, 'her perimeter').","The use of computers for morphological analysis of Hebrew words is nowadays well studied and understood. Several high-quality morphological analyzers for Hebrew have been developed in the last decade. One such morphological analyzer 3 was used to supply the input for the morphological disambiguation project described in this paper. 3. Former Approaches Eliminating or reducing the ambiguity at this early stage of automatic processing of Hebrew is crucial for the efficiency and the success rate of parsers and other natural language applications. It should be noted that the morphological ambiguity in Hebrew makes even \"simple\" applications--as is often considered when dealing with other languages--complicated. 2 See Appendix A for the Hebrew-Latin transliteration. 3 The morphological analyzer was developed at the IBM Scientific Center, Haifa, Israel (Bentur, Angel, and Segev 1992). We would like to thank the center for letting us use it for research purposes. 386 Moshe Levinger et al. Learning Morpho-Lexical Probabilities","One good example for this is full-text retrieval systems (Choueka 1980). Such systems must handle the morphological ambiguity problem. To see that, consider, for example, the case where we look for all the texts with the word HQPH ('encirclement'). Without morphological disambiguation, we get many texts which really include the word H+QPH ('the coffee'), or even HQP+H ('her perimeter') (Ornan 1987). Another application which is more difficult in Hebrew than in other languages is text-to-speech systems, which cannot be implemented in Hebrew without first solving the morphological ambiguity, since in many cases different analyses of a word imply different pronunciations. A much simpler problem occurs in English, where for some words the correct syntactic tag is necessary for pronunciation (Church 1988).","The notion that this ambiguity problem in Hebrew is very complicated and that it can be dealt with only by using vast syntactic and semantic knowledge has led researchers to look for solutions involving a considerable amount of human interaction.","Ornan (1986) for instance, developed a new writing system for Hebrew, called 'The Phonemic Script.' This script enables the user to write Hebrew texts that are morphologically unambiguous, in order to use them later as an input for various kinds of natural language applications. However, since regular Hebrew texts are not written in this script, they first must be transcribed to phonemic texts. Choueka and Lusignan (1985) presented a system for the morphological tagging of large texts that is based on the short context of the word but also depends heavily on human interaction.","Methods using the short context of a word in order to resolve ambiguity (usually categorical ambiguity) are very common in English and other languages (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Karlsson 1990). A system using this approach was developed by Levinger and Ornan in order to serve as a component in their project of morphological disambiguation in Hebrew (Levinger 1992). The main resource, used by this system for disambiguation, is a set of syntactic constraints that were defined manually by the authors and followed two theoretical works that defined short context rules for Hebrew (Pines 1975; Albeck 1992). The syntactic constraints approach, which is an extension of the short context approach, was found to be useful and reliable, but its applicability (based on the proportion of ambiguous words that were fully disambiguated) was very poor. Hence, the overall performance of this system is much less promising in Hebrew than in other languages. These results can be explained by the following properties of the ambiguity problem in Hebrew: 1. . (a) (b) In many cases two or more alternative analyses share the same category, and hence these alternatives satisfy the same syntactic constraints. Moreover, there are cases where two or even more analyses share exactly the same morphological attributes and differ only in their lexical entry. For instance, the word XLW (~n) has two such morphological analyses: The verb XLH (n~n), fem./masc., plural, third person, past tense ('they became ill'). The verb XL (Vn), fem./masc., plural, third person, past tense ('they occurred'). The short context constraints use unambiguous anchors that are often function words such as determiners and prepositions. In English most such function words are unambiguous. In Hebrew, these words are almost always morphologically ambiguous. Moreover, many of them appear as prefixes of the word to be analyzed, and their identification is part of the morphological analysis. We thus have a circularity problem: In order to perform the morphological analysis, we need the short context, 387 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 to identify the short context, we have to find anchors, but in order to find such words, we need first to perform the morphological analysis. 3. The word order in Hebrew is rather free."]},{"title":"4. Our Approach","paragraphs":["The purpose of this paper is to suggest a new approach to deal with the above-mentioned problem. This approach provides highly useful data that can be used by systems for automatic, unsupervised morphological tagging of Hebrew texts. In order to justify and motivate our approach, we must first make the following conjecture: Although the Hebrew language is highly ambiguous morphologically, it seems that in many cases a native speaker of the language can accurately \"guess\" the right analysis of a word, without even being exposed to the concrete context in which it appears. The accuracy can even be enhanced if the native speaker is told from which sublanguage the ambiguous word was taken.","If this conjecture is true, we can now suggest a simple strategy for automatic tagging of Hebrew texts: For each ambiguous word, find the morpho-lexical probabilities of each possible analysis. If any of these analyses is substantially more frequent than the others, choose it as the right analysis.","As we have already noted, by saying morpho-lexical probabilities, we mean the probability of a given analysis to be the right analysis of a word, independently of the context in which it appears. It should be emphasized that having these morpho-lexical probabilities enables us not only to use them rather naively in the above-mentioned strategy, but also to incorporate these probabilities into other systems that exploit higher level knowledge (syntactic, semantic etc.). Such a system that uses the morpho-lexical probabilities together with a syntactic knowledge is described in Levinger (1992)."]},{"title":"5. Acquiring the Probabilities","paragraphs":["Adopting this approach leaves us with the problem of finding the morpho-lexical probabilities for the different analyses of every ambiguous word in the language.

The main drawback of this solution is the need for a very large tagged corpus. No such corpus exists for modern Hebrew. Moreover, for such a solution a separate"]},{"title":"tagged","paragraphs":["corpus is required for each domain. The method we are about to present saves us the laborious effort of tagging a large corpus, and enables us to find a good approximation to the morpho-lexical probabilities by learning about them from an untagged corpus. Using this method, one can easily move to a new domain by applying the method to a new untagged corpus suited to this new domain. 388 Moshe Levinger et al. Learning Morpho-Lexical Probabilities","This might seem, at first sight, an impossible mission. When we see the word HQPH in an untagged corpus we cannot automatically decide which of its possible readings is the right one. The key idea is to shift each of the analyses of an ambiguous word in such a way that they all become distinguishable. To be more specific, for each possible analysis (lexical entry + the morphological information), we define a set of words that we call Similar Words (SW). An element in this set is another word form of the same lexical entry that has similar morphological attributes to the given analysis. These words are assumed similar to the analysis in the sense that we expect them to have approximately the same frequency in the language as the analysis they belong to. A reasonable assumption of this kind would be, for instance, to say that the masculine form of a verb in a certain tense in Hebrew is expected to have approximately the same frequency as the feminine form of the same verb, in the same tense. This assumption holds for most of the Hebrew verbs, since all Hebrew nouns (and not only animate ones) have the gender attribute. 4 To see a concrete example, consider the word RĤ (nt~7) and one of its analyses: the verb 'to see', masculine, singular, third person, past tense. A similar word for this analysis is the following one: • RATH (n~t~7), feminine, singular, third person, past tense.","The choice of which words should be included in the SW set of a given analysis is determined by a set of pre-defined rules based on the intuition of a native speaker. Nevertheless, the elements in the SW sets are not determined for each analysis separately, but rather are generated automatically, for each analysis, by changing the contents of one or several morphological attributes in the morphological analysis. In the previous example the elements are generated by changing the contents of the gender attribute in the morphological analysis, while keeping all the other attributes unchanged.","The set of rules used by the algorithm for automatic generation of SW sets for each analysis in the language are of a heuristic nature. For the problem in Hebrew, a set of ten rules 5 was sufficient for the generation of SW sets for all the possible morphological analyses in Hebrew. In case we wish to move to some other domain in Hebrew, we should be able to use the same set of rules, but with a suitable training corpus. Hence, the set of rules are language-dependent but not domain-dependent. To clarify this point, consider the word MCBY& (~'~Xr2), which has the following two morphological analyses: . . The verb HCBY& (~2Xn), masculine, singular, present tense ('indicates' or 'votes'). The noun MCBY& (~2xr~, 'a pointer').","The set of rules defined for Hebrew would enable us to observe that in the domain of daily newspaper articles, the first analysis probably has a high morpho-lexical probability while the second analysis has a very low probability. Using the same set of rules, we should be able to deduce for a domain of articles dealing with computer languages that the second analysis is probably much more frequent than the first one. Whenever we wish to apply our method to some other language that has a similar 4 This assumption does not hold for a small number of verbs that take as a subject only animate nouns with a specific gender, such as YLDH (n\"f~ ~, 'she gave birth.') 5 See Appendix B for the list of the rules used for Hebrew. 389 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 ambiguity problem, all we need to do is define a new set of rules for generation of SW sets in that other language.","By choosing the elements in the SW set carefully so that they meet the requirement of similarity, we can study the frequency of an analysis from the frequencies of the elements in its SW set. Note that we should choose the words for the SW sets such that they are morphologically unambiguous. We assume that this is the case in the following examples, and will return to this issue in the next two sections.","To illustrate the whole process, let us reconsider the ambiguous word HQPH (~flpn) and its three different analyses. The SW sets for each analysis is as follows:","• HQPH (n~pn, 'encirclement') SW1 = { HHQPH (n~pnn, 'the encirclement') }","• H + QPH ( n~p + n, 'the coffee') SW2 = { QPH (hillY, 'coffee') }","• HQP + H (n + qpn, 'her perimeter')","SW3 = { HQPW (~flpn, 'his perimeter'),","HQPM (O~pn, masculine 'their perimeter'),","HQPN (lflpn, feminine 'their perimeter') }.","Given the SW set of each analysis we can now find in the corpus how many times each word appears, calculate the expected frequency of each analysis, and get the desired probabilities by normalizing the frequency distribution.","Had our similarity assumption been totally correct, namely, that each word in the SW set appears exactly the same number of times as the related analysis, we would have expected to get a neat situation such as the following (assuming that the ambiguous word HQPH appears 200 times in the corpus): 6 • SW 1 = { HHQPH = 18 } \" SW2={QPH=180} • SW3 = { HQPW = 2, HQPM = 2, HQPN = 2 }.","These counters suggest that if we manually tagged the 200 occurrences of the string HQPH in the corpus, we would find that the first analysis of HQPH is the right one 18 times out of the 200 times that the word appears in the corpus, that the second analysis is the right one 180 times, and that the third analysis is the right analysis only twice.","Using these counters we can relate the following morpho-lexical probabilities to the three analyses of HQPH: 0.09, 0.90, 0.01, respectively. These probabilities must be considered an approximation to the real morpho-lexical probabilities, because of the following reasons: . . The words in the SW set are only expected to appear approximately the same number of times as the analysis they represent. The reliability of the probabilities we acquire using our method depends on the number of times the ambiguous word appears in the corpus 6 The numbers in this example are fictitious. They were chosen in order to clarify our point. 390 Moshe Levinger et al. Learning Morpho-Lexical Probabilities (which is really the size of the sample we use to calculate the morpho-lexical probabilities).","In the corpus we worked with, the word HQPH appeared 202 times, and the number of occurrences of the words in its SW sets were as follows: • SW1 ={HHQPH=3} • SW2={QPH=368} • SW3 = { HQPW = 0, HQPM = 0, HQPN = 0 }.","By applying now the algorithm of the next section on these counters, we can calculate the desired probabilities. 6. The Algorithm Our algorithm has to handle the frequently occurring case in which a certain word appears in more than one SW set. In that case, we would like to consider the counter of such a word appropriately. The algorithm takes care of this problem and works as follows: Initially we assume that the proportions between the different analyses are equal. For each analysis we compute its average number of occurrences, by summing up all the counters for each word in the SW set and dividing this sum by the SW size. Note that in this stage we also include the ambiguous word in each of the SW sets. 7 If a word appears in several SW sets, we calculate its contribution to the total sum according to the proportions between all those sets, using the proportions calculated in the previous iteration. Calculate the new proportions between the different analyses by computing the proportions between the average number of occurrences of each analysis. This process is iterated until the new proportions calculated are sufficiently close to the proportions calculated in the previous iteration. Finally, the proportions are normalized to obtain probabilities. A formal description of the algorithm written in a pseudo-code is given in Figure 1. 7 This is done mainly in order to handle cases where a certain analysis has an empty SW set, since it does not have naturally similar words. The third example in the next section serves to clarify this point. 391 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 Input: w - A word with k analyses: A1 ..... Ak. SW1 .....

This property agrees with common statistical practice (Agresti 1990). 392 Moshe Levinger et al.

As long as the other possible analyses of such a word are not too frequent, it only slightly affects the final probabilities. Otherwise, we might get wrong results by erroneously crediting the high number of occurrences of such a word 9 to one of the analyses. For this reason, we try to construct the SW sets from as many suitable elements as possible, in order to be able to detect \"misleading\" words of this sort.

The problem stems from the fact that we have been able to use the morphological analyzer on personal computers only, while both the corpus and the program that automatically generates the SW sets for each analysis could have been used only on our mainframe computer. Given this, the morphological analyzer was only used in order to obtain the input files for the disambiguation project.","Nonetheless, the fact that ambiguous words in the SW sets cannot be automatically identified does not affect the quality of the probabilities obtained by our method for most ambiguous words. 1° To see the reason for this, consider the word XWD$ (vd'nn) and its two analyses: . .

This solution was not applicable in cases where all the similar words in a given SW set were misleading words.","10 In our test sample of 53 words, the probabilities were significantly affected by this phenomenon in only three cases. 394 Moshe Levinger et al.

The feminine, singular, second person, nominal personal pronoun AT (feminine 'you'). SW2 = { AT = 197,501, ATH (n~I'() = 1689, ATM (t3nt~) = 891, ATN Qnl'0 ="]},{"title":"105 }","paragraphs":["3.

This is since the ambiguous word AT is very frequent in the corpus, while the counters in the SW sets for the second and third analyses indicate that these analyses are not the \"reason\" for the high frequency of AT in the corpus.","Adding the ambiguous word to all the SW sets allows the algorithm to take this fact into account. Applying the algorithm on the above sets and counters yields the following morpho-lexical probabilities: P1 = 0.9954, P2 = 0.0045, P3 = 0.0001. 8. Evaluating the Probabilities Before we evaluate the quality of the approximated probabilities that can be acquired using our method, we would like to start with a definition of three terms that will be used in this section:","Morpho-Lexical Probabilities Estimated from a Training Corpus Given a large corpus in Hebrew the morpho-lexical probabilities of a given word are the probabilities of its analyses as calculated by manually tagging all the occurrences of the given word in the corpus. We will use the abbreviation morpho-lexical probabilities to denote this term.","Morpho-Lexical Probabilities Estimated over a Test-Corpus In order to avoid the laborious effort needed for the manual tagging of all the occurrences of an ambiguous word in a large corpus, we estimate the morpho-lexical probabilities by calculating them from a relatively small corpus. The abbreviation test-corpus probabilities will be used for this term.","Approximated Probabilities Given an ambiguous word, the approximated probabilities of the word are the probabilities calculated using the method described in this paper.","The approximated probabilities obtained by our method were evaluated by comparing these probabilities with test-corpus probabilities obtained by manual tagging of a relatively small corpus. Since the approximation we acquire depends on the corpus we have been using--texts taken from the Hebrew newspaper Ha'aretz12--we have to 11 In fact, all the prepositions in the language lack natural similar words. 12 We would like to thank Ha'aretz for the permission to use magnetic tapes from its archives. 395 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 calculate the test-corpus probabilities from texts taken from the same source. For this purpose we used a small corpus consisting of more than 500,000 word-tokens taken from the same newspaper.","For our experiment we picked from this small corpus two kinds of test groups. Test-group1 consisted of 30 ambiguous word-types chosen randomly from all the ambiguous word types appearing more than 100 times in the corpus. For the second test group, test-group2, we randomly picked a short text from the corpus from which we extracted all the ambiguous word-tokens appearing at least 30 times in the small corpus. This test group consisted of 23 words.","These two test groups are of a different nature. Test-group1 consists only of very frequent word types in Hebrew, but the test-corpus probabilities for these word types can be viewed as a reliable estimate of the morpho-lexical probabilities. The word-tokens in test-group2 better represent the typical ambiguous word in the language, but their test-corpus probabilities were calculated from a relatively small sample of tagged words.","For each word in these test groups, we extracted from the small corpus all the sentences in which the ambiguous word appears. We then manually tagged each ambiguous word and found for each one of its analyses how many times it was the right analysis. For example, the word AWLM (O~1b0 (taken from test-group1) has the following two morphological analyses: 1. The particle AWLM ('but'). 2. The noun ŴLM ('a hall').","The word AWLM appeared 236 times in the small corpus. By manually tagging all the relevant sentences we found that the first analysis, 'but,' was the right analysis 232 times, and the second analysis, 'a hall,' was the right analysis only 4 times. Given these numbers we can calculate the relative weights of these two analyses: 232/236, 4/236 and the test-corpus probabilities: 0.983, 0.017, respectively. In the same way, using the small corpus we found the test-corpus probability,"]},{"title":"Ptest,","paragraphs":["for each of the analyses in the test groups.","Table 2 shows the test-corpus probabilities and the approximated probabilities for five representative ambiguous words from our test groups.

As for the fifth word, here the approximation we got is totally incorrect. At the end of this section we shall identify some cases for which our method fails to find a reasonable approximation for the morpho-lexical probabilities of an ambiguous word.","In order to evaluate the quality of the approximation we got by our method, we should compare the approximated probabilities for the words in these test groups with the test-corpus probabilities we found.","When we tried to make a quantitative comparison using statistical methods we found that for many analyses"]},{"title":"Papp","paragraphs":["\"looks\" like a good approximation for"]},{"title":"Ptest,","paragraphs":["but from a statistical point of view the approximation is not satisfying.

A robust morphological analyzer for Hebrew that gives for each word in the language all its possible analyses. The input for our project is supplied by this module.","2.

Each word is accompanied by a counter indicating how many times it appears in the corpus.

Conclusions A method to acquire morpho-lexical probabilities from an untagged corpus has been described. The main idea was to use the rich morphology of the language to learn the 401 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 frequency of a certain analysis from the frequency of other word forms of the same lexical entry.","The results of the experiment confirm the conjecture we made about the nature of the morphological ambiguity problem in Hebrew. It can be argued, therefore, that the computer with its complete morphological knowledge is facing a much more complex problem than that of a human who may be ignorant of some rare analyses reading a Hebrew text. This observation is also supported by the fact that humans are very often surprised to see the amount of possible analyses of a given ambiguous word. It may even have a significance from a psycholinguistic point of view, by suggesting that these kind of probabilities are also used by a human reader of Hebrew. However, this conjecture should be tested empirically.","An experiment to test the usefulness of the morpho-lexical probabilities for morphological disambiguation in Hebrew yielded the following results: a recall of 70% for full disambiguation, and a recall of 90% for analysis assignment.","However, the morpho-lexical probabilities cannot serve as the only source of information for morphological disambiguation, since they are"]},{"title":"imperfect","paragraphs":["by definition--they always choose the same analysis as the right one, regardless of the context in which the ambiguous word appears.
