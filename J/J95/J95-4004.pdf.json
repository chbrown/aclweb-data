Manual encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning as a method of providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge. Although corpus-based approaches have been successful in many different areas of natural language processing, it is often the case that these methods capture the linguistic information they are modelling indirectly in large opaque tables of statistics. This can make it difficult to analyze, understand and improve the ability of these approaches to model underlying linguistic behavior. In this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to automated learning of linguistic knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture information in a clearer and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed case study of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["It has recently become clear that automatically extracting linguistic information from a sample text corpus can be an extremely powerful method of overcoming the linguistic knowledge acquisition bottleneck inhibiting the creation of robust and accurate natural language processing systems. A number of part-of-speech taggers are readily available and widely used, all trained and retrainable on text corpora (Church 1988; Cutting et al. 1992; Brill 1992; Weischedel et al. 1993). Endemic structural ambiguity, which can lead to such difficulties as trying to cope with the many thousands of possible parses that a grammar can assign to a sentence, can be greatly reduced by adding empirically derived probabilities to grammar rules (Fujisaki et al. 1989; Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer 1990; Black et al. 1993) and by computing statistical measures of lexical association (Hindle and Rooth 1993). Word-sense disambiguation, a problem that once seemed out of reach for systems without a great deal of handcrafted linguistic and world knowledge, can now in some cases be done with high accuracy when all information is derived automatically from corpora (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Yarowsky 1992; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Bruce and Wiebe 1994). An effort has recently been undertaken to create automated machine translation systems in which the linguistic information needed for translation is extracted automatically from aligned corpora (Brown et al. 1990). These are just a few of the many recent applications of corpus-based techniques in natural language processing. • Department of Computer Science, Baltimore, MD 21218-2694.

There are a number of efforts worldwide to manually annotate large corpora with linguistic information, including parts of speech, phrase structure and predicate-argument structure (e.g., the Penn Treebank and the British National Corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994)). A vast amount of on-line text is now available, and much more will become available in the future. Useful tools, such as large aligned corpora (e.g., the aligned Hansards (Gale and Church 1991)) and semantic word hierarchies (e.g., Wordnet (Miller 1990)), have also recently become available.","Corpus-based methods are often able to succeed while ignoring the true complexities of language, banking on the fact that complex linguistic phenomena can often be indirectly observed through simple epiphenomena.

However, in order to make progress in corpus-based natural language processing, we must become better aware of just what cues to linguistic structure are being captured and where these approximations to the true underlying phenomena fail. With many of the current corpus-based approaches to natural language processing, this is a nearly impossible task. Consider the part-of-speech tagging example above.

This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994). We have also recently begun exploring the use of this technique for letter-to-sound generation and for building pronunciation networks for speech recognition. In this approach, the learned linguistic information is represented in a concise and easily understood form. This property should make transformation-based learning a useful tool for further exploring linguistic modeling and attempting to discover ways of more tightly coupling the underlying linguistic systems and our approximating models. 544 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning UNANNOTATED TEXT STATE /~kI~INOTETAx.T ~D TRUTH Figure 1 Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning. RULES 2. Transformation-Based Error-Driven Leaming Figure I illustrates how transformation-based error-driven learning works. First, unannotated text is passed through an initial-state annotator. The initial-state annotator can range in complexity from assigning random structure to assigning the output of a sophisticated manually created annotator. In part-of-speech tagging, various initial-state annotators have been used, including: the output of a stochastic n-gram tagger; labelling all words with their most likely tag as indicated in the training corpus; and naively labelling all words as nouns. For syntactic parsing, we have explored initial-state annotations ranging from the output of a sophisticated parser to random tree structure with random nonterminal labels.","Once text has been passed through the initial-state annotator, it is then compared to the truth. A manually annotated corpus is used as our reference for truth. An ordered list of transformations is learned that can be applied to the output of the initial-state annotator to make it better resemble the truth. There are two components to a transformation: a rewrite rule and a triggering environment. An example of a rewrite rule for part-of-speech tagging is: Change the tag from modal to noun. and an example of a triggering environment is: The preceding word is a determiner.","Taken together, the transformation with this rewrite rule and triggering environment when applied to the word can would correctly change the mistagged: The~determiner can~modal rusted~verb ./. 545 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 to:"]},{"title":"The~determiner can~noun rusted~verb ./.","paragraphs":["An example of a bracketing rewrite rule is: change the bracketing of a subtree from: A B C to: C A B where A, B and C can be either terminals or nonterminals.

In this example, we assume there are only four possible transformations, T1 through T4, and that the objective function is the total number of errors. The unannotated training corpus is processed by the initial-state annotator, and this results in an annotated corpus with 5,100 errors, determined by comparing the output of the initial-state annotator with the manually derived annotations for this corpus.

After applying the initial-state annotator, followed by T2 and then T3, no further reduction in errors can be obtained from applying any of the transformations, so learning stops.

If the effect of a transformation is recorded immediately, then processing the string left to right would result in: ABABAB, whereas processing right to left would result in: ABBBBB. 3. A Comparison With Decision Trees The technique employed by the learner is somewhat similar to that used in decision trees (Breiman et al. 1984; Quinlan 1986; Quinlan and Rivest 1989). A decision tree is trained on a set of preclassified entities and outputs a set of questions that can be asked about an entity to determine its proper classification. Decision trees are built by finding the question whose resulting partition is the purest, 2 splitting the training data according to that question, and then recursively reapplying this procedure on each resulting subset.","We first show that the set of classifications that can be provided via decision trees is a proper subset of those that can be provided via transformation lists (an ordered list of transformation-based rules), given the same set of primitive questions. We then give some practical differences between the two learning methods. 3.1 Decision Trees c_ Transformation Lists We prove here that for a fixed set of primitive queries, any binary decision tree can be converted into a transformation list. Extending the proof beyond binary trees is straightforward.","Proof (by induction)","Base Case:","Given the following primitive decision tree, where the classification is A if the answer to the query X? is yes, and the classification is B if the answer is no: X? B A 2 One possible measure for purity is entropy reduction. 548 this tree can be converted into the following transformation list: . 2. 3. X? Label with S/* Start State Annotation */ If X, then S --* A S --* B/* Empty Tagging Environment--Always Applies To Entities Currently Labeled With S */ Induction:","Assume that two decision trees T1 and T2 have corresponding transformation lists L1 and L2. Assume that the arbitrary label names chosen in constructing L1 are not used in L2, and that those in L2 are not used in L1. Given a new decision tree T3 constructed from T1 and T2 as follows: Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning we construct a new transformation list L3. Assume the first transformation in L1 is: Label with S' and the first transformation in L2 is: Label with S\" The first three transformations in L3 will then be: 1. Label with S 2. If X then S --* S' 3. S --+ S\" followed by all of the rules in L1 other than the first rule, followed by all of the rules in L2 other than the first rule. The resulting transformation list will first label an item as S' if X is true, or as S\" if X is false. Next, the tranformations from L1 will be applied if X is true, since S' is the initial-state label for L1. If X is false, the transformations from L2 will be applied, because S\" is the initial-state label for L2. [] 3.2 Decision Trees # Transformation Lists We show here that there exist transformation lists for which no equivalent decision trees exist, for a fixed set of primitive queries. The following classification problem is one example. Given a sequence of characters, classify a character based on whether the position index of a character is divisible by 4, querying only using a context of two characters to the left of the character being classified. 549 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4","Assuming transformations are applied left to right on the sequence, the above classification problem can be solved for sequences of arbitrary length if the effect of a transformation is written out immediately, or for sequences up to any prespecified length if a transformation is carried out only after all triggering environments in the corpus are checked. We present the proof for the former case.","Given the input sequence: A A A A A A A A A A 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 the underlined characters should be classified as true because their indices are 0, 4, and 8. To see why a decision tree could not perform this classification, regardless of order of classification, note that, for the two characters before both A3 and A4, both the characters and their classifications are the same, although these two characters should be classified differently. Below is a transformation list for performing this classification. Once again, we assume transformations are applied left to right and that the result of a transformation is written out immediately, so that the result of applying transformation x to character ai will always be known when applying transformation x to ai+l.","1. Label with S RESULT: A/S A/S A/S A/S","2. If there is no previous character, RESULT: A/F A/S A/S A/S","3. If the character two to the left is RESULT: A/F A/S A/F A/S","4.

This is not the case for decision trees, where the outcome of questions asked is saved implicitly by the current location within the tree. 3.3 Some Practical Differences Between Decision Trees and Transformation Lists There are a number of practical differences between transformation-based error-driven learning and learning decision trees. One difference is that when training a decision tree, each time the depth of the tree is increased, the average amount of training material available per node at that new depth is halved (for a binary tree). In transformation-based learning, the entire training corpus is used for finding all transformations. There-fore, this method is not subject to the sparse data problems that arise as the depth of the decision tree being learned increases.","Transformations are ordered, with later transformations being dependent upon the outcome of applying earlier transformations. This allows intermediate results in 550 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning classifying one object to be available in classifying other objects. For instance, whether the previous word is tagged as to-infinitival or to-preposition may be a good cue for determining the part of speech of a word. 3 If, initially, the word to is not reliably tagged everywhere in the corpus with its proper tag (or not tagged at all), then this cue will be unreliable. The transformation-based learner will delay positing a transformation triggered by the tag of the word to until other transformations have resulted in a more reliable tagging of this word in the corpus. For a decision tree to take advantage of this information, any word whose outcome is dependent upon the tagging of to would need the entire decision tree structure for the proper classification of each occurrence of to built into its decision tree path. If the classification of to were dependent upon the classification of yet another word, this would have to be built into the decision tree as well. Unlike decision trees, in transformation-based learning, intermediate classification results are available and can be used as classification progresses. Even if decision trees are applied to a corpus in a left-to-right fashion, they are allowed only one pass in which to properly classify.","Since a transformation list is a processor and not a classifier, it can readily be used as a postprocessor to any annotation system. In addition to annotating from scratch, rules can be learned to improve the performance of a mature annotation system by using the mature system as the initial-state annotator. This can have the added advantage that the list of transformations learned using a mature annotation system as the initial-state annotator provides a readable description or classification of the errors the mature system makes, thereby aiding in the refinement of that system. The fact that it is a processor gives a transformation-based learner greater than the classifier-based decision tree. For example, in applying transformation-based learning to parsing, a rule can apply any structural change to a tree. In tagging, a rule such as: Change the tag of the current word to X, and of the previous word to Y, if Z holds can easily be handled in the processor-based system, whereas it would be difficult to handle in a classification system.","In transformation-based learning, the objective function used in training is the same as that used for evaluation, whenever this is feasible. In a decision tree, using system accuracy as an objective function for training typically results in poor performance 4 and some measure of node purity, such as entropy reduction, is used instead. The direct correlation between rules and performance improvement in transformation-based learning can make the learned rules more readily interpretable than decision tree rules for increasing population purity, s","4. Part of Speech Tagging: A Case Study in Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning In this section we describe the practical application of transformation-based learning to part-of-speech tagging. 6 Part-of-speech tagging is a good application to test the 3 The original tagged Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982) makes this distinction; the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993) does not. 4 For a discussion of why this is the case, see Breiman et al. (1984, 94-98). 5 For a discussion of other issues regarding these two learning algorithms, see Ramshaw and Marcus (1994). 6 All of the programs described herein are freely available with no restrictions on use or redistribution. For information on obtaining the tagger, contact the author. 551 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 learner, for several reasons. There are a number of large tagged corpora available, allowing for a variety of experiments to be run. Part-of-speech tagging is an active area of research; a great deal of work has been done in this area over the past few years (e.g., Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; Hindle 1989; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Brill 1992; Black et al. 1992; Cutting et al. 1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al. 1993; Weischedel et al. 1993; Schutze and Singer 1994).","Part-of-speech tagging is also a very practical application, with uses in many areas, including speech recognition and generation, machine translation, parsing, information retrieval and lexicography. Insofar as tagging can be seen as a prototypical problem in lexical ambiguity, advances in part-of-speech tagging could readily translate to progress in other areas of lexical, and perhaps structural, ambiguity, such as word-sense disambiguation and prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation. 7 Also, it is possible to cast a number of other useful problems as part-of-speech tagging problems, such as letter-to-sound translation (Huang, Son-Bell, and Baggett 1994) and building pronunciation networks for speech recognition. Recently, a method has been proposed for using part-of-speech tagging techniques as a method for parsing with lexicalized grammars (Joshi and Srinivas 1994).","When automated part-of-speech tagging was initially explored (Klein and Simmons 1963; Harris 1962), people manually engineered rules for tagging, sometimes with the aid of a corpus. As large corpora became available, it became clear that simple Markov-model based stochastic taggers that were automatically trained could achieve high rates of tagging accuracy (Jelinek 1985). Markov-model based taggers assign to a sentence the tag sequence that maximizes"]},{"title":"Prob(word I","paragraphs":["tag),Prob(tag"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["previous n tags). These probabilities can be estimated directly from a manually tagged corpus, s These stochastic taggers have a number of advantages over the manually built taggers, including obviating the need for laborious manual rule construction, and possibly capturing useful information that may not have been noticed by the human engineer. However, stochastic taggers have the disadvantage that linguistic information is captured only indirectly, in large tables of statistics. Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part-of-speech taggers has been on further exploring Markov-model based tagging (Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Cutting et al. 1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al. 1993; Weischedel et al. 1993; Schutze and Singer 1994). 4.1 Transformation-based Error-driven Part-of-Speech Tagging Transformation-based part of speech tagging works as follows. 9 The initial-state annotator assigns each word its most likely tag as indicated in the training corpus. The method used for initially tagging unknown words will be described in a later section. An ordered list of transformations is then learned, to improve tagging accuracy based on contextual cues. These transformations alter the tagging of a word from X to Y iff 7 In Brill and Resnik (1994), we describe an approach to prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation that obtains highly competitive performance compared to other corpus-based solutions to this problem. This system was derived in under two hours from the transformation-based part of speech tagger described in this paper. 8 One can also estimate these probabilities without a manually tagged corpus, using a hidden Markov model. However, it appears to be the case that directly estimating probabilities from even a very small manually tagged corpus gives better results than training a hidden Markov model on a large untagged corpus (see Merialdo (1994)). 9 Earlier versions of this work were reported in Brill (1992, 1994). 552 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning either: 1.

Tagi-n)) express the likelihood of a tag immediately following n other tags, and emit probabilities (P(Wordj I Tagi)) express the likelihood of a word, given a tag. Many useful relationships, such as that between a word and the previous word, or between a tag and the following word, are not directly captured by Markov-model based taggers. The same is true of the nonlexicalized transformation-based tagger, where transformation templates do not make reference to words.","To remedy this problem, we extend the transformation-based tagger by adding","13 In Kupiec (1992), a limited amount of lexicalization is introduced by having a stochastic tagger with word states for the 100 most frequent words in the corpus. 555 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 contextual transformations that can make reference to words as well as part-of-speech tags. The transformation templates we add are: Change tag a to tag b when: . 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. . The The The The t. The preceding (following) word is w. The word two before (after) is w. One of the two preceding (following) words is w. current word is w and the preceding (following) word is x. current word is w and the preceding (following) word is tagged z. current word is w. preceding (following) word is w and the preceding (following) tag is The current word is w, the preceding (following) word is w2 and the preceding (following) tag is t. where w and x are variables over all words in the training corpus, and z and t are variables over all parts of speech.","BelOw we list two lexicalized transformations that were learned, training once again on the Wall Street Journal. Change the tag: (12) From IN to RB if the word two positions to the right is as. (16) From VBP to VB if one of the previous two words is n't. TM","The Penn Treebank tagging style manual specifies that in the collocation as ... as, the first as is tagged as an adverb and the second is tagged as a preposition. Since as is most frequently tagged as a preposition in the training corpus, the initial-state tagger will mistag the phrase as tall as as: as/IN tall/JJ as/IN The first lexicalized transformation corrects this mistagging. Note that a bigram tagger trained on our training set would not correctly tag the first occurrence of as. Although adverbs are more likely than prepositions to follow some verb form tags, the fact that P(as ] IN) is much greater than P(as ] RB), and P(JJ ] IN) is much greater than P(JJ ] RB) lead to as being incorrectly tagged as a preposition by a stochastic tagger. A trigram tagger will correctly tag this collocation in some instances, due to the fact that P(IN ] RB JJ) is greater than P(IN ] IN JJ), but the outcome will be highly dependent upon the context in which this collocation appears.","The second transformation arises from the fact that when a verb appears in a context such as We do n't eat or We did n't usually drink, the verb is in base form. A stochastic trigram tagger would have to capture this linguistic information indirectly from frequency counts of all trigrams of the form shown in figure 5 (where a star can match any part-of-speech tag) and from the fact that P(n't ] RB) is fairly high. 14 In the Penn Treebank, n't is treated as a separate token, so don't becomes do/VBP n't/RB. 556 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning * RB VBP * RB VB RB * VBP RB * VB Figure 5 Trigram Tagger Probability Tables.","In Weischedel et al. (1993), results are given when training and testing a Markov-model based tagger on the Penn Treebank Tagged Wall Street Journal Corpus. They cite results making the closed vocabulary assumption that all possible tags for all words in the test set are known. When training contextual probabilities on one million words, an accuracy of 96.7% was achieved. Accuracy dropped to 96.3% when contextual probabilities were trained on 64,000 words. We trained the transformation-based tagger on the same corpus, making the same closed-vocabulary assumption. 15 When training contextual rules on 600,000 words, an accuracy of 97.2% was achieved on a separate 150,000 word test set. When the training set was reduced to 64,000 words, accuracy dropped to 96.7%. The transformation-based learner achieved better performance, despite the fact that contextual information was captured in a small number of simple nonstochastic rules, as opposed to 10,000 contextual probabilities that were learned by the stochastic tagger. These results are summarized in table 1. When training on 600,000 words, a total of 447 transformations were learned. However, transformations toward the end of the list contribute very little to accuracy: applying only the first 200 learned transformations to the test set achieves an accuracy of 97.0%; applying the first 100 gives an accuracy of 96.8%. To match the 96.7% accuracy achieved by the stochastic tagger when it was trained on one million words, only the first 82 transformations are needed.","To see whether lexicalized transformations were contributing to the transformation-based tagger accuracy rate, we first trained the tagger using the nonlexical transformation template subset, then ran exactly the same test. Accuracy of that tagger was 97.0%. Adding lexicalized transformations resulted in a 6.7% decrease in the error rate (see table 1). 16","We found it a bit surprising that the addition of lexicalized transformations did not result in a much greater improvement in performance. When transformations are allowed to make reference to words and word pairs, some relevant information is probably missed due to sparse data. We are currently exploring the possibility of incorporating word classes into the rule-based learner, in hopes of overcoming this problem. The idea is quite simple. Given any source of word class information, such","15 In both Weischedel et al. (1993) and here, the test set was incorporated into the lexicon, but was not used in learning contextual information. Testing with no unknown words might seem like an unrealistic test. We have done so for three reasons: (1) to allow for a comparison with previously quoted results, (2) to isolate known word accuracy from unknown word accuracy, and (3) in some systems, such as a closed vocabulary speech recognition system, the assumption that all words are known is valid. (We show results when unknown words are included later in the paper.)","16 The training we did here was slightly suboptimal, in that we used the contextual rules learned with unknown words (described in the next section), and filled in the dictionary, rather than training on a corpus without unknown words. 557 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 Table 1 Comparison of Tagging Accuracy With No Unknown Words","Training # of Rules","Corpus or Context.

As stated above, the initial-state annotator for tagging assigns all words their most likely tag, as indicated in a training corpus. Below we show how a transformation-based approach can be taken for tagging unknown words, by automatically learning cues to predict the most likely tag for words not seen in the training corpus. If the most likely tag for unknown words can be assigned with high accuracy, then the contextual rules can be used to improve accuracy, as described above.","In the transformation-based unknown-word tagger, the initial-state annotator naively assumes the most likely tag for an unknown word is \"proper noun\" if the word is capitalized and \"common noun\" otherwise. 17","Below, we list the set of allowable transformations. Change the tag of an unknown word (from X) to Y if: 1. . 3. . 5. Deleting the prefix (suffix) x, Ixl < 4, results in a word (x is any string of length 1 to 4). The first (last) (1,2,3,4) characters of the word are x. Adding the character string x as a prefix (suffix) results in a word (Ixl ~ 4). Word w ever appears immediately to the left (right) of the word. Character z appears in the word.","17 If we change the tagger to tag all unknown words as common nouns, then a number of rules are learned of the form: change tag to proper noun if the prefix is \"E', \"A\", \"B', etc., since the learner is not provided with the concept of upper case in its set of transformation templates. 558 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning","Change Tag # From To Condition 1 NN NNS Has suffix -s 2 NN CD Has character. 3 NN JJ Has character - 4 NN VBN Has suffix -ed 5 NN VBG Has suffix -ing 6 ??

Of these, 950,000 words were used for training and 150,000 words were used for testing. Annotations of the test corpus were not used in any way to train the system. From the 950,000 word training corpus, 350,000 words were used to learn rules for tagging unknown words, and 600,000 words were used to learn contextual rules; 243 rules were learned for tagging unknown words, and 447 contextual tagging rules were learned. Unknown word accuracy on the test corpus was 82.2%, and overall tagging accuracy on the test corpus was 96.6%. To our knowledge, this is the highest overall tagging accuracy ever quoted on the Penn Treebank Corpus when making the open vocabulary assumption. Using the tagger without lexicalized rules, an overall accuracy of 96.3% and an unknown word accuracy of 82.0% is obtained. A graph of accuracy as a function of transformation number on the test set for lexicalized rules is shown in figure 7. Before applying any transformations, test set accuracy is 92.4%, so the transformations reduce the error rate by 50% over the baseline. The high baseline accuracy is somewhat misleading, as this includes the tagging of unambiguous words. Baseline accuracy when the words that are unambiguous in our lexicon are not considered is 86.4%. However, it is difficult to compare taggers using this figure, as the accuracy of the system depends on the particular lexicon used. For instance, in our training set the word the was tagged with a number of different tags, and so according to our lexicon the is ambiguous. If we instead used a lexicon where the is listed unambiguously as a determiner, the baseline accuracy would be 84.6%.","For tagging unknown words, each word is initially assigned a part-of-speech tag based on word and word-distribution features. Then, the tag may be changed based on contextual cues, via contextual transformations that are applied to the entire corpus, both known and unknown-words. When the contextual rule learner learns transformations, it does so in an attempt to maximize overall tagging accuracy, and not unknown-word tagging accuracy. Unknown words account for only a small percentage of the corpus in our experiments, typically two to three percent. Since the distributional behavior of unknown words is quite different from that of known words, and transformations are not English-specific, the set of transformation templates would have to be extended to process languages with dramatically different morphology, 560 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning Table 2 Tagging Accuracy on Different Corpora Corpus Accuracy Penn WSJ 96.6% Penn Brown 96.3% Orig Brown 96.5% since a transformation that does not increase unknown-word tagging accuracy can still be beneficial to overall tagging accuracy, the contextual transformations learned are not optimal in the sense of leading to the highest tagging accuracy on unknown words. Better unknown-word accuracy may be possible by training and using two sets of contextual rules, one maximizing known-word accuracy and the other maximizing unknown-word accuracy, and then applying the appropriate transformations to a word when tagging, depending upon whether the word appears in the lexicon. We are currently experimenting with this idea.","In Weischedel et al. (1993), a statistical approach to tagging unknown words is shown. In this approach, a number of suffixes and important features are prespecified. Then, for unknown words:"]},{"title":"p(W I T) -=","paragraphs":["p(unknown word I T) • p(Capitalize-feature"]},{"title":"I T) * p(suffixes, hyphenation I T)","paragraphs":["Using this equation for unknown word emit probabilities within the stochastic tagger, an accuracy of 85% was obtained on the Wall Street Journal corpus. This portion of the stochastic model has over 1,000 parameters, with 108 possible unique emit probabilities, as opposed to a small number of simple rules that are learned and used in the rule-based approach. In addition, the transformation-based method learns specific cues instead of requiring them to be prespecified, allowing for the possibility of uncover-ing cues not apparent to the human language engineer. We have obtained comparable performance on unknown words, while capturing the information in a much more concise and perspicuous manner, and without prespecifying any information specific to English or to a specific corpus.","In table 2, we show tagging results obtained on a number of different corpora, in each case training on roughly 9.5 x 10 s words total and testing on a separate test set of 1.5-2 x 10 s words. Accuracy is consistent across these corpora and tag sets.","In addition to obtaining high rates of accuracy and representing relevant linguistic information in a small set of rules, the part-of-speech tagger can also be made to run extremely fast. Roche and Schabes (1995) show a method for converting a list of tagging transformations into a deterministic finite state transducer with one state transition taken per word of input; the result is a transformation-based tagger whose tagging speed is about ten times that of the fastest Markov-model tagger. 4.4 K-Best Tags There are certain circumstances where one is willing to relax the one-tag-per-word requirement in order to increase the probability that the correct tag will be assigned to each word. In DeMarcken (1990) and Weischedel et al. (1993), k-best tags are assigned within a stochastic tagger by returning all tags within some threshold of probability of being correct for a particular word. 561 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 Table 3 Results from k-best tagging.","# of Rules Accuracy Avg. # of tags per word 0 96.5 1.00 50 96.9 1.02 100 97.4 1.04 150 97.9 1.10 200 98.4 1.19 250 99.1 1.50","We can modify the transformation-based tagger to return multiple tags for a word by making a simple modification to the contextual transformations described above. The initial-state annotator is the tagging output of the previously described one-best transformation-based tagger. The allowable transformation templates are the same as the contextual transformation templates listed above, but with the rewrite rule: change tag X to tag Y modified to add tag X to tag Y or add tag X to word W. Instead of changing the tagging of a word, transformations now add alternative taggings to a word.","When allowing more than one tag per word, there is a trade-off between accuracy and the average number of tags for each word. Ideally, we would like to achieve as large an increase in accuracy with as few extra tags as possible. Therefore, in training we find transformations that maximize the function: Number of corrected errors Number of additional tags","In table 3, we present results from first using the one-tag-per-word transformation-based tagger described in the previous section and then applying the k-best tag transformations. These transformations were learned from a separate 240,000 word corpus. As a baseline, we did k-best tagging of a test corpus. Each known word in the test corpus was tagged with all tags seen with that word in the training corpus and the five most likely unknown-word tags were assigned to all words not seen in the training corpus. 19 This resulted in an accuracy of 99.0%, with an average of 2.28 tags per word. The transformation-based tagger obtained the same accuracy with 1.43 tags per word, one third the number of additional tags as the baseline tagger. 2° 5. Conclusions In this paper, we have described a new transformation-based approach to corpus-based learning. We have given details of how this approach has been applied to part-of-speech tagging and have demonstrated that the transformation-based approach obtains","19 Thanks to Fred Jelinek and Fernando Pereira for suggesting this baseline experiment.","20 Unfortunately, it is difficult to find results to compare these k-best tag results to. In DeMarcken (1990), the test set is included in the training set, and so it is difficult to know how this system would do on fresh text. In Weischedel et al. (1993), a k-best tag experiment was run on the Wall Street Journal corpus. They quote the average number of tags per word for various threshold settings, but do not provide accuracy results. 562 Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning competitive performance with stochastic taggers on tagging both unknown and known words. The transformation-based tagger captures linguistic information in a small number of simple nonstochastic rules, as opposed to large numbers of lexical and contextual probabilities. This learning approach has also been applied to a number of other tasks, including prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik 1994), bracketing text (Brill 1993a) and labeling nonterminal nodes (Brill 1993c). Recently, we have begun to explore the possibility of extending these techniques to other problems, including learning pronunciation networks for speech recognition and learning mappings between syntactic and semantic representations."]},{"title":"Appendix A: Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech Tags (Excluding Punctuation)","paragraphs":["1.
