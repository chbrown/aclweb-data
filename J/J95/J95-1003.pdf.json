In this paper we present a single model that accounts for referent resolution of deictic and anaphoric expressions in a research prototype of a multimodal user interface called EDWARD. The linguistic expressions are keyed in by a user and are possibly accompanied by pointing gestures. The proposed model for reference resolution elaborates on Alshawi's (1987) notions of context factors and salience and integrates both linguistic and perceptual context effects. The model is contrasted with two alternative referent resolution models, namely, a simplistic one and the more sophisticated model proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). Based on empirical and analytical grounds, we conclude that the model we propose is preferable from a computational and engineering point of view. 1. Introduction This paper deals with the automatic referent resolution of deictic and anaphoric expressions in a research prototype of a multimodal user interface called EDWARD. The primary aim of our project is the development and the assessment of an interface that combines the positive features of the language mode and the action mode of interaction (Claassen et al. 1990). EDWARD (Huls and Bos 1993; Bos et al. 1994) integrates a graphical graph-editor called Gr 2 (Bos in press) and a Dutch natural language (NL) dialogue system called DoNaLD (Claassen and Huls 1991). One of the application domains involves a file system environment with documents, authors, a garbage container, and so on. The user can interact with EDWARD by manipulating the graphical representation of the file system (a directed graph), by menus, by written natural or formal language, or by combinations of these. EDWARD responds in NL (either written or spoken) and graphics.","In this paper we will go into the semantic and pragmatic processes involved in the referent resolution of deictic and deixis-related expressions by EDWARD. (Syntactic issues will not be discussed here; for these, see Claassen and Huls 1991.) The proper interpretation of deictic expressions depends on the identity of the speaker(s) and the audience, the time of speech, the spatial location of speaker and audience at the time of speech, and non-linguistic communicative acts like facial expressions and eye, hand, and body movements. Lyons (1977, p. 637), provides the following definition of deixis: * Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information, P.O. Box 9104, 6500 HE Nijmegen, The Netherlands. E-mail: huls@nici.kun.nl @ 1995 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 the location and identification of persons, objects, events, processes and activities being talked about, or referred to, in relation to the spatiotemporal context created and sustained by the act of utterance and the participation in it, typically, of a single speaker and at least one addressee. In the context of the present paper, we distinguish three types of deixis: personal, temporal, and spatial deixis. Personal deixis involves first- and second-person pronouns (e.g., I, we, and you). Temporal deixis is realized by the tense system of a language (e.g., he lives in Amsterdam) and by temporal modifiers (e.g., in an hour). Temporal deixis relates the time of speech to the relation(s) expressed by the utterance. Spatial deixis involves demonstratives or other referring expressions that are produced in combination with a pointing gesture (e.g., thisS file, in which 7 represents the pointing gesture). In the present paper, most attention will be given to spatial deixis.","Deictic expressions can be contrasted with anaphors. Unlike deictic expressions, anaphors can be interpreted without regard to the spatiotemporal context of the speak-ing situation. Their interpretation depends merely on the linguistic expressions that precede them in the discourse. For example, this is an anaphor in Print the file about dialogue systems. Delete this. In many languages, the words used in deictic expressions are also used in anaphoric expressions.","Deictic and anaphoric expressions frequently cause problems for NL analysis. Sijtsma and Zweekhorst (1993) find referent resolution errors in all three commercial NL interfaces they evaluate. In research laboratories, a couple of systems capable of interpreting deictic expressions recently have been developed. Allgayer et al. (1989) describe XTRA, a German NL interface to expert systems, currently applied to supporting the user's filling out a tax form. XTRA uses a dialogue memory and a tax-form hierarchy to interpret multimodal referring expressions. Data from the dialogue memory and from gesture analysis are combined (e.g., by taking the intersection of two sets of potential referents suggested by these information sources). Neal and Shapiro (1991) describe a research prototype called CUBRICON, which combines NL (English) with graphics. The application domain is military tactical air control. Like XTRA, CUBRI-CON uses two models to interpret deictic expressions: an attentional discourse focus space representation (adapted from Grosz and Sidner 1986) and a display model. Stock (1991) describes ALFresco, a prototype built for the exploration of frescoes, using NL (Italian) and pictures. For referent resolution in ALFresco, topic spaces (Grosz, 1978) are combined with Haji~ov~'s (1987) approach, in which entities are assumed to \"fade away\" slowly. Cohen (1992) presents Shoptalk, a prototype information and decisionsupport system for semiconductor and printed-circuit board manufacturing with a NL (English) component. In Shoptalk too, the interpretation process is based on the approach of Grosz and Sidner. We believe that the fact that these systems use two separate mechanisms for modeling linguistic and perceptual context is a disadvantage over the use of only one mechanism for referent resolution. From a computational and an engineering position, one mechanism that handles both deictic and anaphoric expressions in the same way is preferable.","We will (try to) show how both deictic and anaphoric references can be resolved using a single model. We have used the framework presented by Alshawi (1987) to develop a general context model that is able to represent linguistic as well as non-linguistic effects on the dialogue context. This model is used, in conjunction with a knowledge base, by EDWARD's interpretation component to solve deictic and anaphoric referring expressions. The same model and knowledge base are used by EDWARD's generation component to decide the form (e.g., he, the writer, a man), the 60 Carla Huls et al.

Next, we describe the knowledge sources EDWARD uses to interpret deictic and anaphoric expressions (Section 3). In Section 4, we go into the process of interpreting deictic and anaphoric expressions in some detail. Subsequently, in Section 5, we present some user interactions with EDWARD and we compare the results of EDWARD's referent resolution model with two other models including that of Grosz and Sidner (1986). 2. Overview of EDWARD EDWARD is implemented in Allegro Common Lisp and runs on DECstations. Figure 1 presents a schematic overview of EDWARD's system architecture. The arrows represent the information flow between the main components. EDWARD accepts input from two devices: ke.yboard and mouse device. The output is directed to two devices on the screen: a NL output text window and a graphics display, and, optionally, to a speech synthesizer. The dialogue manager coordinates input and output expressions and controls the linguistic and graphics processes. It maintains the Context Model, the knowledge base, and the lexicon; in addition, it decides which individual instances stored in the knowledge base must be represented on the graphics display, and it makes sure that the display is always up to date. The language interpreter and the language generator consult the Context Model, the knowledge base, and the lexicon. Both the interpreter and the generator operate in an incremental fashion. Figure 2 illustrates how the user can interact with EDWARD.","The area occupying most of the screen is the graphics display: a window called Modelwereld (Model World). The tree shown in Figure 2 represents a hierarchy of directories (depicted as bookcases) and files (e.g., reports, papers, e-mail messages, and books). The viewport shows only part of the Model World window, which in principle extends indefinitely. In the bottom-left corner of the viewport, a garbage container and a copier are displayed. The bear icon, at the bottom in the middle, represents the system itself (i.e., EDWARD). Using a mouse, the user can manipulate the graphical representation of the domain objects by pointing, clicking, and dragging.

In the bottom-left area of the screen is the NL interaction window labeled Dialoog (Dialogue). Here the user can enter NL commands, questions, or assertions. Depending on the number of words and ambiguities in a linguistic expression, interpretation takes between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds when running on a Personal DECstation 5000. In Figure 2, the user has requested the system to copy all reports except for this one. At the bottom right, the trace window Context displays the salience values of some of the discourse referents.

Knowledge Sources To be able to interpret referring expressions, EDWARD uses three knowledge sources: a knowledge base, a context model, and a lexicon. The knowledge base stores the permanent generic and specific world knowledge of the system, whereas the Context Model temporarily \"memorizes\" which individual instances from the knowledge base have been referred to in the dialogue. The lexicon specifies morphophonological and syntactic features of words and contains links between words and the knowledge base","paragraphs":["62 Carla Huls et al. Deixis and Anaphora that represents lexical meaning. In this section we will describe the knowledge base and Context Model. 3.1 The Knowledge Base The knowledge base is a semantic network implemented in CommonORBIT (De Smedt 1987), a frame- based language somewhat similar to KL-ONE (Brachman and Schmolze 1985). The nodes in the network represent classes and instances of entities and relations. For example, the class <person> contains two subordinate classes, <man> and <woman>, and the concept of sending an object to someone is represented by a generic relation called <send>. Individual objects in the domain are represented by instances; e.g., an individual who is a man might be represented as <man#24>. If he sends a message, a relation instance is created; e.g., <send#89>. Contrary to KL-ONE, relations have a time interval associated with them, which represents the period of time during which the relation is assumed to hold. A time interval has a start value and an end value. The end value may be *NOW*, which is a dynamic value representing openendedness in a time interval. Much like in KL-ONE, relations 1 contain role-filler class restrictions and role-set restrictions. For example, with the generic relation <send>, three semantic (case) roles are associated, called <agent>, <goal>, and <recipient>. The role-filler class restrictions then specify, for example, that the fillers of the <agent> and <recipient> roles must be either persons or institutions and that the filler of the <goal> role (the object that is sent) must be concrete and excludes persons. This information is used by the interpretation component to restrict the referent sets of the role fillers of a relation. The role-set restrictions specify, for example, that the filler of the <recipient> role in a <send> relation is not, at least not in our current domain, allowed to be identical to the filler of the <agent> role. 2 The interpreter could use these restrictions to exclude certain referents from the set of potential referents.","Depending on the domain EDWARD is being applied to, a filter is defined to determine which concepts of the knowledge base should be visually represented on the screen. The file system domain filter, for instance, allows instances of particular file system classes, such as directories, e-mail messages, reports, and books. The instances passing the filter are represented by icons that depict their class. The only relation instances passing the file system domain filter are <contain> relations and <name> relations. A <contain> relation is represented graphically by a straight line linking the icon that represents the container and the icon representing the object contained. <Name> relations (if present) are represented by a label underneath the icon of the named object (see Figure 2). 3.2 The Context Model The second knowledge source EDWARD uses to analyze referring expressions is the Context Model. The central notion in this model is salience. The intuitive notion of salience has two important characteristics. In the first place, the salience of an instance at a given moment is determined by a diversity of factors of varying importance. In written language, recency of mention is known to be an important factor, as are syntactic and semantic parallelism, the markedness of expressions and constructions, and so on. Spoken language adds intonation, and when the situational context gets involved, various perceptual factors like visibility join in. The second important characteristic 1 KL-ONE represents relations by \"roles\" that correspond to two-placed predicates. 2 Usually, the notion of C-command is used to handle these kind of restrictions. However, this syntactic solution works only for restrictions within one sentence. The role-set restriction approach we propose is independent of the size of units processed by the interpreter. 63 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Table 1 Context factors and their significance weights after successive updates.","Successive Context Factors Objects in Scope Weights Linguistic CFs Major-constituent referents CF Subject referent CF Nested-term referent CF Relation CF Referents of subject, (in)direct object, [3, 2,1, 0] and modifier Referents of the subject phrase [2,1, 0] Referents of noun phrase modifiers [1, 0] (e.g., prepositional phrase, relative clause) Relations expressed by subject, [3, 2,1, 0] prepositional phrase, and relative clause","Perceptual CFs Visible referent CF Referents visible in the current viewport [1,..., 1, 0] Selected referent CF Referents selected in the model world [2,..., 2, 0] Indicated referent CF Referents indicated by a pointing gesture [30,1, 0] of salience is its gradedness. An individual instance may be more or less salient, may gradually become less salient, etc.","Alshawi (1987) provides a general framework for modeling salience that does justice to both characteristics mentioned above. The central construct in this framework is that of context factor (CF). A CF is defined by a scope, which is a collection of individual instances; a significance weight, represented by an integer; and a decay function, which indicates by what amount the CF's significance weight is to be decreased at the next update. In EDWARD we have adopted Alshawi's notion of CFs and elaborated it. Table 1 presents an overview of the CFs EDWARD uses.","The salience value (SV) of an individual instance (inst) at any given moment is obtained simply by adding the current significance weights of the CFs which have that instance in their scope: SV(inst) = ~ significance weight"]},{"title":"(CFinst).","paragraphs":["i=1","Henceforward, we will say that an individual instance is in context if its SV is more than 0. The elegance of this particular notion of salience is that it allows for a unified measure of salience, which is determined by an indefinite number of independent factors that can be monitored separately. This architecture differs from the architectures of related work on multimodal interfaces described in the introduction, which all adopt Grosz and Sidner's approach to modeling referents in context. In Section 5, we will compare their approach with ours.","In EDWARD we presently use seven CFs (see Table 1): four serve to model linguistic context effects and three to model perceptual context effects. The linguistic CFs are major-constituent referent CF, subject referent CF, nested-term referent CF, and relation CE Major-constituent referents are the referents of the subject, the direct object, the indirect object, and the main modifiers of a sentence. They are the role fillers of the relation expressed by the main clause. A major-constituent referent CF has an initial significance weight of 3. (All significance weights have been determined by trial and error and, as will be shown in Section 5, work fine.) Subject referent CFs model the 64 Carla Huls et al.

Their initial significance weight is 2. 3 Nested-term referents are the referents expressed by NP modifiers. These referents are mentioned in the sentence, but they are less prominent than the subject referents or major referents. Nested-term referent CFs have an initial significance weight of 1. Relation CFs are created for all the relations expressed by a sentence, e.g., by the main clause, or by NPs modifying prepositional phrases. Their purpose is to make references to actions expressed in a sentence possible, as in, for example, do it again. Their initial significance weight is 3. The decay function of the linguistic CFs subtracts 1 from a CF's weight at each successive update. If a CF's weight equals 0, the CF is discarded.","Table 2 shows how the salience of some individual instances changes in the course of a short dialogue. The three rightmost columns present the SVs after the interpretation of the utterance in the left column. These values are used for the interpretation of the next sentence. After each sentence, the existing CFs are updated by calling their decay functions, and new CFs are created.","The perceptual CFs are as follows: visible referent CF, selected referent CF, and indicated referent CE Visible referent CFs cause referents that are visible to have a higher SV than referents that are not visible. A visible referent CF has an initial significance weight of 1, so a referent that is visible will be a little more salient than a referent that is not. As soon as the graphical representations (icons) of the referents in the scope of a visible referent CF become invisible (e.g., as a result of a scroll action), the weight drops to 0 and the CF will be discarded. Selected referent CFs cause selected referents to be more salient than referents that are merely visible. A selected referent CF is created when an icon has been selected by the user (by moving the mouse to the icon and clicking the left mouse button), or when the user has requested the system (in natural or formal language) to select icons. Its significance weight is initially 2, and it remains 2 for as long as the icon remains selected. As soon as the icon is deselected, the weight drops to 0 and the CF will be discarded. An indicated referent CF, finally, causes a referent that is indicated by either the system or the user to be very salient for a short time. Indication by the system is done by means of a simulated pointing gesture: a fat, animated growing arrow to a particular icon (for instance, generated upon the question \"Which e-mail message is about parsing?\"). An indicated referent CF has an initial significance weight of 30 to make sure that the referent in its scope 3 Note that the subject referent resides in two scopes: subject and major-constituent CFs. 65 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Table 3 The four types of referring expressions. Anaphoric expressions are only possible in the NL mode.

After the first update, its significance weight drops to 1, and at the next update, it becomes 0. Notice the difference between selection and indication. Selection is an action only the user can initiate; if the selection is done with a pointing action, both a selected referent CF and an indicated referent CF are created (e.g., for donald_report in Figure 2); otherwise only a selected referent CF is created. However, both the user and EDWARD can point, creating indicated referent CFs; pointing has a more temporary effect than selection. 4. Interpreting Deictic and Anaphoric Expressions in EDWARD EDWARD is able to interpret the two kinds of referring expressions distinguished in the introduction, viz., deictic and anaphoric expressions. When combined with the three categories of interaction modes--unimodal graphical, unimodal linguistic, and multimodal--this results in the four types of referring expressions listed in Table 3. 4","The basic principle that is used by EDWARD to solve referring expressions is the same for all four types of referring expressions shown in Table 3. Both EDWARD's graphics processes and its syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic interpretation processes operate on line (i.e., interpretation starts directly and goes on while the user enters the remaining of his utterance), incrementally (i.e., the interpretation is built up piece by piece from left to right), and in parallel (i.e., more than one interpretation process can be handled at every moment).","To determine the referent of a phrase, first all individual instances satisfying the semantic restrictions of the phrase are listed. The one with the highest SV, being the most likely referent, is put at the front. Next, after completion of the phrase, the salience of each referent is retrieved by adding the significance weights of all CFs that have this individual instance in their scope, s The most salient individual instance is taken to be the referent of the phrase. In the final sentence of Table 2, for example, the referent of the phrase het artikel (the article), is the most salient individual instance belonging to the class Karticle> or to any of its subordinate classes. This approach 4 Referring by name is not included in this table, because it is neither a deictic nor an anaphoric reference. However, EDWARD solves referring by name the same as it does the other four types of referring expressions. 5 The programming language CommonORBIT used in EDWARD provides pointers back from the object to the CFs that have the object in its scope (which compares to Alshawi's notion of marking). 66 Carla Huls et al.

We have discarded this option because it is unattractive from a computational point of view. In many domains, the number of associated individual instances of a mentioned individual instance may be very high. Creating associative CFs for all of these associate individual instances is computationally expensive, especially since most of them would have been created without being of any use (only seldom are there several bridges to cross simultaneously). In a worst case scenario, associative CFs interfere with the referent resolution of normal anaphoric expressions. Not-mentioned individual instances that are in the intersection of the sets of associate individual instances of several consecutively mentioned referents may become more salient than instances that have been mentioned.

We currently use the following tentative heuristic for associated individual instance retrieval: All relations are taken into account between the referent in context (in this example, <department#276>, having a <name> relation with NICI) and a referent of the requested class that can be expressed by the lemma van (of). In the example, this simulates the NPs: the secretary of the department. 6 An advantage of this approach is that referent resolution for phrases other than inferential anaphors is not affected. No effort is wasted in creating associative CFs for individual instances that are not mentioned. Starting the search process at the most salient instance saves computational costs. 4.1.2 Deixis. Personal deixis. The intension of the personal pronouns ik (I) and jij (you) is represented using the following predicates: ik --* 3(x,y) cognizer(x) Atalking-to(x,y) jq --* 3(x,y) cognizer(x) Atalking-to(y,x) where the predicate cognizer is taken from Pylyshyn (1984), meaning any rational agent, e.g., a person or a dialogue system, and talking-to is a predicate that represents the dialogue situation at any time. For example, when the user is entering an input sentence, the clause talking-to(user, system) is true so the pronoun ik (I) refers to the user. It is the dialogue manager's task to keep track of who is talking to whom and to update the knowledge base accordingly. Temporal deixis. The interpretation of temporal deixis critically depends on the time of speech of the utterance. EDWARD uses the machine time as an anchoring point. For example, the time interval of the relation <live-in#I> expressed by Koen woont in Nijmegen. (Koen lives in Nijmegen.) is an open-ended time interval starting at the machine time at the time of interpretation and ending at *NOW*. If another related relation is added to the knowledge base, e.g., <live-in#2> expressed by a subsequent Koen woont in Amsterdam. (Koen lives in Amsterdam.), the open-ended time interval of the first <live-in> relation is closed, ending at the current machine time at the time of interpretation of the second relation. The first <live-in> relation can now be referred to in simple past tense; the second, in present tense. For example, in case of a subsequent question like Woont Koen in Amsterdam? (Does Koen live in Amsterdam?), the time interval of this question relation, viz., *NOW*, is included by the time interval of <live-in#2> found in the knowledge base, and thus the system would respond with Ja, hij woont er. (Yes, he lives there.). If, however, the question were Woont Koen in Nijmegen? (Does Koen live in Nijmegen?), *NOW* is not included by the time interval of <live-in# 1>, the relation no longer holds, and the system would respond negatively. Since the system, in this case, knows what <live-in> relation does hold, it can respond cooperatively with Nee, hij woont in Amsterdam. (No, he lives in Amsterdam.). Currently, simple present and simple past tense are the only two tenses handled. Spatial deixis. The presence of a visible model world invites the user to generate referring linguistic expressions involving the spatial environment. We call definite NPs referring to the only object of a certain type visible at that moment implicit spatial 6 The heuristic can be seen as a practical solution to find attributes of a concept and in Dutch seems to work in almost every case. A more general solution consists, of course, of specifying associated concept links in the semantic network, which currently contains only is-a links. 68 Carla Huls et al.

So, if the user points to an icon, the salience of its referent increases immediately, making it the most likely candidate referent of the phrase at hand.

Assessing the Quality of EDWARD's Referent Resolution Model To assess the quality of EDWARD's referent resolution model, we collected a series of referring expressions, which were processed by three different referent resolution models, namely that of EDWARD, as described above, a very simplistic model, and the sophisticated and often applied model proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). Since there are no benchmarks available to evaluate referent resolution models, we had subjects interact with EDWARD to compile a set of referring expressions. Usually, NL test sentences are made up by evaluators/designers themselves, but we think made-up test sentences may to some extent be unconsciously biased. In the course of developing EDWARD's referent resolution model, we used hundreds of test sentences made up by ourselves to debug and test the program. Real referring expressions, generated by users not familiar with the internal processes of the interpreter, provide a more solid empirical basis for evaluation. In Section 5.1, we present an overview of these user-generated referring expressions. In Section 5.2, we briefly describe the way the two alternative referent resolution models work. The results of feeding the test sentences to the three different referent resolution models are given in Section 5.3. In assessing the quality of a referent resolution model, it is, however, also necessary to analyze the internal affairs of the model and determine the inherent limitations that follow from its design. In Section 5.4, we present the inherent limitations of EDWARD's referent resolution model as well as those of the two alternative models. 5.1 A Test Set of Referring Expressions By having five subjects (two men and three women) interact with EDWARD, we obtained a total of 125 real, user-generated referring expressions. The subjects all had some previous experience with the system, but this was limited to 1 or 2 hours and dated from 2 to 3 months before. None of them had knowledge of the internal affairs of EDWARD's referent resolution model. The subjects were to perform 19 tasks; most were information retrieval tasks, but some tasks involved effectuating a change in the file system. The subjects were not informed which words and syntactic and semantic constructs could be handled by the system and which could not, but they all knew from their previous encounters that the system was not an unrestricted NL interface. We did explicitly encourage the subjects to use the shortest referring expression possible whenever they felt it was appropriate. From earlier experiments with EDWARD (Huls and Bos 1993; Huls et al. 1993), we know that some users are reluctant to use referring expressions other than by name (probably due to the impact of command language interfaces for familiar file management systems). Examples of the tasks the subjects were to perform are the following: . ."]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["Find out who is the boss of the NICI; followed by Find out who is the secretary of the NICI. Find out who live in Nijmegen; followed by Find out whether all women living in Nijmegen work at the NICI. Put a copy of this"]},{"title":"[experimentor points at leftmost file on screen]","paragraphs":["file in this"]},{"title":"[experimentor points again]","paragraphs":["directory. These tasks were supposed to induce inferential anaphors (1), plural referring expressions (2), spatial deixis (3), and multimodal referring expressions (3). 72 Carla Huls et al. Deixis and Anaphora","As we expected, different subjects performed the tasks differently. Some, for example, needed two questions to find out who is the secretary of the NICI, others just one, of which two subjects indeed used the induced inferential anaphor. Table 4 shows several translated sample sentences taken from the set of sentences the five subjects keyed in to perform the 19 tasks. To show the variety in use of referring expressions, we present under (a) the sentences with the largest amount of deictic and anaphoric expressions keyed in by the subjects and under (b) the least amount. For example, (19a) shows the sentence subject #4 used for task 19, with two pronouns, and (19b) shows subject #3's sentences with only one pronoun:","The frequency with which the different types of referring expressions occurred can be found in Table 5. Here a clearer view on the variety among subjects in the way of referring is presented. (The types of referring expressions of Table 5 do not exactly match the four types mentioned in Table 3. Unimodal graphical deixis was not encouraged in the experiment and therefore did not occur; reference by name occurred frequently, but this type of reference is not considered to be deictic or anaphoric, and their interpretation is therefore less interesting from a computational linguistics point of view.)","Finally, we present some data on the frequencies of use of the two most common words that can feature in both deictic and anaphoric expressions, viz., dit and deze (two demonstrative pronouns, respectively neuter and non-neuter). Table 6 shows the variety in use. 5.2 Two Alternative Referent Resolution Models The sentences with the referring expressions as described in the previous section were processed by EDWARD's referent resolution model and two alternative referent resolution models. The first alternative model is a very simplistic one. It simply takes the last mentioned semantically appropriate referent. For example, in the sequence The secretary is Hil. Where does she live? the pronoun she is taken to refer to the last mentioned female, in this case Hil. We implemented this Simplistic Model and provided EDWARD with a switch to determine whether sentences should be processed either with the original Context Model or with this alternative Simplistic Model. Each referent mentioned in the dialogue is put on a stack, and when interpreting a referring expression, the stack is processed from top to bottom. To prevent uncontrolled growing of the stack, we had the system discard the object at the bottom of the stack as soon as the stack length exceeded a certain maximum.","The second alternative referent resolution model is that of Grosz and Sidner (1986). Their model consists of two separate mechanisms, each resolving a specific type of referring expression. The first mechanism is called focusing. Focusing is used to limit the information that must be considered in identifying the referents of certain classes of definite NPs. A stack is created in which the focus spaces corresponding to the discourse segment purposes are stored. All entities mentioned in a discourse segment purpose and all related entities (e.g., parts of mentioned entities) are stored in a focus space. New focus spaces are put on top of the focus stack, and the referent for a NP will be searched from the top down. For our data analysis, we suppose a new discourse segment purpose for each new sentence. A second mechanism, called centering (or immediate focusing), is used for pronoun resolution. In brief, a backward-looking center is associated with each utterance in a discourse segment. Of all focused elements, the backward-looking center is the one that is central in that utterance. A combination of syntactic, semantic, and discourse information is used to identify the backward-looking center. The fact that some entity is the backward-looking center is used to constrain the search for the referent of a pronoun in a subsequent utterance. Unfortunately, 73 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Table 4 A translated compilation of the sentences the subjects used to perform the tasks.

Consequently, we could use only a pen and paper analysis of how their model processes the test set of referring expressions. 5.3 How the Referent Resolution Models Dealt with the Test Set The sentences with 125 referring expressions entered by the five users to perform the 19 tasks were processed by the three referent resolution models. Table 7 shows the scores. 5.3.1 Context Model. EDWARD's Context Model determined the right referent in all 125 referring expressions. However, in the session of subject #2, we discovered an 75 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 error in the interpretation of a dozen sentences this subject keyed in just for curiosity after she had completed the 19 tasks. She continued as follows: Alice wrote him an e-mail. Put that e-mail in Dijkstra. Is thisTthe e-mail to Lou? Which one? What is in this e-mail? What is the topic of this e-mail? Where is her e-mail to Lou? OK, information added. OK, information added. No, thisTone is. ThisTone. Sorry, please rephrase. I don't know. Here, the referent of the pronoun her was mentioned too long ago for EDWARD to be able to locate the referent Alice. EDWARD therefore had to ask the user Whom do you mean with 'her'? 5.3.2 Simplistic Model. The results of the simplistic referent resolution model were surprising: we counted only 6 misses. Task (15) particularly showed the restrictions of the Simplistic Model: (14) Which are the e-mails sent by Alice? Alice mailed thisSe-mail to Wim, thisTe-mail to Koen and thisTe-mail to Carla. (15) She sent an e-mail about Bos to Wietske. The she of (15) is considered to refer to Carla, the last mentioned female, but the user actually referred to Alice. Similar problems occurred with this in task (16). 5.3.3 Grosz and Sidner. Using a pen and paper analysis of how the Grosz and Sidner Model processes the sentences, we think their model resolves all but 1 referring expression correctly. The only problem we encountered concerned the use of two pronouns in one sentence: he lives in her town. The original model excluded these double occurrences. 5.4 Inherent Limitations of the Referent Resolution Models In this section, we describe several problems of the three reference resolution models that follow from their design but did not become apparent in the test set evaluation.","First, EDWARD's Context Model and the Simplistic Model do not make any predictions about discourse intention. Discourse intentions play a primary role in explaining discourse structure, defining discourse coherence, and providing a coherent conceptualization of the term \"discourse\" (Grosz and Sidner 1986). Discourse intentions can provide clues for the beginning and ending of dialogues and subdialogues. Referent resolution can make use of this structure to exclude referents to (sub)dialogues that are ended. Furthermore, subdialogues do not interfere with the referent resolution of the main dialogue. Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, on the other hand, does address these problems.","The Context Model obviously still lacks several factors that can influence the salience of a referent. An example is the different context effects of reference by a pronoun versus reference by a definite full-fledged NP. Grosz and Sidner mention this distinction but do not, however, provide a thorough analysis of all syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules they envisage to play a role in either focusing or centering. 76 Carla Huls et al. Deixis and Anaphora","A problem for all three of the referent resolution models is the resolution of cataphors. In contrast with anaphors, cataphors refer to instances that will be introduced later in the discourse (e.g., He will win who... ). All three models will (try to) locate the referent of he in the set of individual instances mentioned before. The resolution of cataphors, however, requires a more lazy evaluation. 6. Conclusions We have collected some indications about the quality of the Context Model for referent resolution we implemented in our multimodal user interface EDWARD. We have compared the capabilities of this model with two alternative models, both empirically, using a test set of 125 user-generated referring expressions obtained from interactions with EDWARD and, analytically, studying the inherent limitations that follow from the models' designs.","On empirical grounds we conclude that the Simplistic Model, in which anaphoric expressions are considered to refer to the last mentioned semantically appropriate object, is inadequate. Though it performed, by far, better than we anticipated, too often the wrong object is taken to be the referent.","The quality of the other alternative model for referent resolution, the Grosz and Sidner Model, seems to compare to the quality of EDWARD's Context Model. As we understand the Grosz and Sidner Model, it processed 124 referring expressions correctly (but this may be inaccurate, since we do not have an implemented version of the model at our disposal). Furthermore, it will have problems with interpreting cataphora properly. EDWARD's Context Model performed well on all 125 test expressions, but cataphora will also be misinterpreted. The Grosz and Sidner Model has a much broader scope. In particular, their model addresses the notion of discourse coherence. It would be interesting to explore how the insights of Grosz and Sidner with respect to discourse coherence can be used to elaborate EDWARD's Context Model to render it able to deal with subdialogues.","EDWARD's Context Model differs significantly from the Grosz and Sidner Model from an engineering and computational point of view. The Context Model is relatively simplistic. EDWARD never needs to figure out the type of an expression that is being analyzed: for all referring expressions, the most salient referent is chosen. Moreover, entities and relations are handled in a uniform fashion, and syntactic as well as perceptual influences on salience are incorporated into one model. The general applicability of the technique adds to its beauty. The language generation component uses it as well. Both components use the role-filler class restrictions, the cardinality information, and the role-set restrictions from the knowledge base, and they use the same CFs, with the same initial significance weights, and the same decay functions of the Context Model. Grosz and Sidner propose a complex system of rules. In the Context Model, on the other hand, influences originating from different levels and types of processing are modeled by individual CFs, which are created and managed locally, i.e., by these processes themselves. As a result, the influences on an object's salience are represented distributed and independently, which is attractive from a computational point of view. Furthermore, the addition of new CFs, which would require explicit detailed changes in Grosz and Sidner's rules, will be easier because the procedures that use the salience information can stay exactly the same.","Though our empirical and analytical studies were only small and provide no firm basis for drawing conclusions, we do find indications that the quality of EDWARD's Context Model compares to a large extent to the quality of the more complex Grosz and Sidner Model. Therefore, if one is in need of a referent resolution model for a particular 77 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 NL interpreter in a setting where subdialogues are rare, we think that EDWARD's Context Model is a good alternative to the complex rule system of Grosz and Sidner. The model is easy to build, to maintain, and to expand, and it is computationally fairly inexpensive.
