Heeman* University of Rochester Graeme Hirst t University of Toronto This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in order to make a referring action successful. The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation. 1. Introduction People are goal-oriented and can plan courses of actions to achieve their goals. But sometimes they might lack the knowledge needed to formulate a plan of action, or some of the actions that they plan might depend on coordinating their activity with other agents. How do they cope? One way is to work together, or collaborate, in for-mulating a plan of action with other people who are involved in the actions or who know the relevant information.","Even the apparently simple linguistic task of referring, in an utterance, to some object or idea can involve exactly this kind of activity: a collaboration between the speaker and the hearer. The speaker has the goal of the hearer identifying the object that the speaker has in mind. The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by constructing a description of the object that she thinks will enable the hearer to identify it. But since the speaker and the hearer will inevitably have different beliefs about the world, the hearer might not be able to identify the object. Often, when the hearer cannot do so, the speaker and hearer collaborate in making a new referring expression that accomplishes the goal.","This paper presents a computational model of how a conversational participant collaborates in making a referring action successful. We use as our basis the model proposed by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), which gives a descriptive account of the conversational moves that participants make when collaborating upon a referring expression. We cast their work into a model based on the planning paradigm.","We propose that referring expressions can be represented by plan derivations, and that plan construction and plan inference can be used to generate and understand them.

The acceptance of a clarification results in the current plan being updated. So, it is these rules that specify how plan inference and plan construction affect and are affected by the mental state of the agent. Thus, the mental state, together with the rules, provides the link between these two processes. An important consequence of our proposal is that the current plan need not allow the successful achievement of the goal. Likewise, the clarifications that agents propose need not result in a successful plan in order for them to be accepted.","As can be seen, our approach consists of two tiers. The first tier is the planning component, which accounts for how utterances are both understood and generated. Using the planning paradigm has several advantages: it allows both tasks to be captured in a single paradigm that is used for modeling general intelligent behavior; it allows more of the content of an utterance to be accounted for by a uniform process; and only a single knowledge source for referring expressions is needed instead of having this knowledge embedded in special algorithms for each task. The second tier accounts for the collaborative behavior of the agents: how they adopt goals and coordinate their activity. It provides the link between the mental state of the agent and the planning processes.","In accounting for how agents collaborate in making a referring action, our work aims to make the following contributions to the field. First, although much work has been done on how agents request clarifications, or respond to such requests, little attention has been paid to the collaborative aspects of clarification discourse. Our work attempts a plan-based formalization of what linguistic collaboration is, both in terms of the goals and intentions that underlie it and the surface speech acts that result from it. Second, we address the act of referring and show how it can be better accounted for by the planning paradigm. Third, previous plan-based linguistic research has concentrated on either construction or understanding of utterances, but not both. By doing both, we will give our work generality in the direction of a complete model of the collaborative process. Finally, by using Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model as a basis for our work, we aim not only to add support to their model, but also to gain a much richer understanding of the subject.","In order to address the problem that we have set out, we have limited the scope of our work. First, we look at referring expressions in isolation, rather than as part of a larger speech act. Second, we assume that agents have mutual knowledge of the mechanisms of referring expressions and collaboration. Third, we deal with objects that both the speaker and hearer know of, though they might have different beliefs about what propositions hold for these objects. Fourth, as the input and the output to our system, we use representations of surface speech actions, not natural language strings. Finally, although belief revision is an important part of how agents collaborate, we do not explicitly address this. 352 Peter A. Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions 2. Referring as a Collaborative Process Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) investigated how participants in a conversation collaborate in making a referring action successful. They conducted experiments in which participants had to refer to objects--tangram patterns--that are difficult to describe. They found that typically the participant trying to describe a tangram pattern would present an initial referring expression. The other participant would then pass judgment on it, either"]},{"title":"accepting","paragraphs":["it,"]},{"title":"rejecting","paragraphs":["it, or"]},{"title":"postponing","paragraphs":["his decision.

The referring expression that results from this is then judged, and the process continues until the referring expression is acceptable enough to the participants for current purposes. This final expression is contributed to the participants' common ground.","Below are two excerpts from Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's experiments that illustrate the acceptance process. (2.1) A: 1 Um, third one is the guy reading with, holding his book to the left. B- 2 Okay, kind of standing up? A: 3 Yeah. B\" 4 Okay.

It looks like a hat that's upside down. B: 2 The guy that's pointing to the left again? A\" 3 Yeah, pointing to the left, that's it! (laughs) B: 4 Okay. In the second dialog, B implicitly rejects A's initial presentation by replacing it with a new referring expression in line 2, \"the guy that's pointing to the left again.\" A then accepts the refashioned referring expression in line 3.","Below, we give an algorithmic interpretation of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's collaborative model, where present, judge, and refashion are the conversational moves that the participants make, and"]},{"title":"ref, re,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"judgment","paragraphs":["are variables that represent the referent, the current referring expression, and its judgment, respectively.

The algorithm also illustrates how the model of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs minimizes the distinction between the roles of the person who initiated the referring expression and the person who is trying to identify it. Both have the same moves available to them, for either can judge the description and either can refashion it. Neither is controlling the dialog, they are simply collaborating.","In later work, Clark and Schaefer (1989) propose that \"each part of the acceptance phase is itself a contribution\" (p. 269), and the acceptance of these contributions depends on whether the hearer \"believes he is understanding well enough for current purposes\" (p. 267). Although Clark and Schaefer use the term contribution with respect to the discourse, rather than the collaborative effort of referring, their proposal is still relevant here: judgments and refashionings are contributions to the collaborative effort and are subjected to an acceptance process, with the result being that once they are accepted, the state of the collaborative activity is updated. So, what constitutes grounds for accepting a judgment or clarification? In order to be consistent with Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model, we can see that if one agent finds the current referring expression problematic, the other must accept that judgment. Likewise, if one agent proposes a referring expression, through a refashioning, the other must accept the refashioning."]},{"title":"3. Referring Expressions 3.1 Planning and Referring","paragraphs":["By viewing language as action, the planning paradigm can be applied to natural language processing. The actions in this case are speech acts (Austin 1962; Searle 1969), and include such things as promising, informing, and requesting. Cohen and Perrault (1979) developed a system that uses plan construction to map an agent's goals to speech acts, and Allen and Perrault (1980) use plan inference to understand an agent's plan from its speech acts. By viewing it as action (Searle 1969), referring can be incorporated into a planning model. Cohen's model (1981) planned requests that the hearer identify a referent, whereas Appelt (1985) planned concept activations, a generalization of referring actions.","Although acts of reference have been incorporated into plan-based models, determining the content of referring expressions hasn't been. For instance, in Appelt's model, concept activations can be achieved by the action describe, which is a primitive, not further decomposed. Rather, this action has an associated procedure that determines a description that satisfies the preconditions of describe. Such special procedures have been the mainstay for accounting for the content of referring expressions, both in constructing and in understanding them, as exemplified by Dale (1989), who chose descriptors on the basis of their discriminatory power; Ehud Reiter (1990), who focused 1 For simplicity, we have not shown the change in speakers between refashionings and judgments. 354 Peter A. Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions on avoiding misleading conversational irnplicatures when generating descriptions; and Mellish (1985), who used a constraint satisfaction algorithm to identify referents.","Our work follows the plan-based approach to language generation and understanding. We extend the earlier approaches of Cohen and Appelt by accounting for the content of the description at the planning level. This is done by having surface speech actions for each component of a description, plus a surface speech action that expresses a speaker's intention to refer. A referring action is composed of these primitive actions, and the speaker utters them in her attempt to refer to an object.","These speech actions are the building blocks that referring expressions are made from. Acting as the mortar are intermediate actions, which have constraints that the plan construction and plan inference processes can reason about. These constraints encode the knowledge of how a description can allow a hearer to identify an object. First, the constraints express the conditions under which an attribute can be used to refer to an object; for instance, that it be mutually believed that the object has a certain property (Clark and Marshall 1981; Perrault and Cohen 1981; Nadathur and Joshi 1983). Second, the constraints keep track of which objects could be believed to be the referent of the referring expression. Third, the constraints ensure that a sufficient number of surface speech actions are added so that the set of candidates associated with the entire referring expression consists of only a single object, the referent. These constraints enable the speaker to construct a referring expression that she believes will allow the hearer to identify the referent. As for the hearer, the explicit encoding of the adequacy of referring expressions allows referent identification to fall out of the plan inference process.","Our approach to treating referring as a plan in which surface speech actions correspond to the components of the description allows us to capture how participants collaborate in building a referring expression. Plan repair techniques can be used to refashion an expression if it is not adequate, and clarifications can refer to the part of the plan derivation that is in question or is being repaired. Thus we can model a collaborative dialog in terms of the changes that are being made to the plan derivation.","The referring expression plans that we propose are not simply data structures, but are mental objects that agents have beliefs about (Pollack 1990). The plan derivation expresses beliefs of the speaker: how actions contribute to the achievement of the goal, and what constraints hold that will allow successful identification. 2 So plan construction reasons about the beliefs of the agent in constructing a referring plan; likewise, plan inference, after hypothesizing a plan that is consistent with the observed actions, reasons about the other participant's (believed) beliefs in satisfying the constraints of the plan. If the hearer is able to satisfy the constraints, then he will have understood the plan and be able to identify the referent, since a term corresponding to it would have been instantiated in the inferred plan. Otherwise, there will be an action that includes a constraint that is unsatisfiable, and the hearer construes the action as being in error. (We do not reason about how the error affects the satisfiability of the goal of the plan nor use the error to revise the beliefs of the hearer.) 3.2 Vocabulary and Notation Before we present the action schemas for referring expressions, we need to introduce the notation that we use. Our terminology for planning follows the general literature. 3 2 Since we assume that the agents have mutual knowledge of the action schemas and that agents can execute surface speech actions, we do not consider beliefs about generation or about the executability of primitive actions. 3 See the introductory chapter of Allen, Hendler, and Tate (1990) for an overview of planning. 355 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 We use the terms"]},{"title":"action schema, plan derivation, plan construction,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"plan inference.","paragraphs":["An action schema consists of a"]},{"title":"header, constraints, a decomposition,","paragraphs":["and an"]},{"title":"effect;","paragraphs":["and it encodes the constraints under which an effect can be achieved by performing the steps in the decomposition.

Plan Construction.","paragraphs":["Given an effect, the plan constructor finds a plan derivation that has a minimal number of primitive actions, that is valid (with respect to the planning agent's beliefs), and whose root action achieves the effect. The plan constructor uses a 359 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 best-first search strategy, expanding the derivation with the fewest number of surface speech actions. The yield of this plan derivation can then be given as input to a module that generates the surface form of the utterance. Plan Inference. Following Pollack (1990), our plan inference process can infer plans in which, in the hearer's view, a constraint does not hold. In inferring a plan derivation, we first find the set of plan derivations that account for the primitive actions that were observed, without regard to whether the constraints hold. This is done by using a chart parser that parses actions rather than words (Sidner 1994; Vilain 1990). For referring plans that contain more than one modifier, there will be multiple derivations corresponding to the order of the modifiers. We avoid this ambiguity by choosing an arbitrary ordering of the modifiers for each such plan.","In the second part of the plan inference process, we evaluate each derivation by attempting to find an instantiation for the variables such that all of the constraints hold with respect to the hearer's beliefs about the speaker's beliefs. It could, however, be the case that there is no instantiation, either because this is not the right derivation or because the plan is based on beliefs not shared by the speaker and the hearer. In the latter case, we need to determine which action in the plan is to blame, so that this knowledge can be shared with the other participant.","After each derivation has been evaluated, if there is just one valid derivation, an instantiated derivation whose constraints all hold, then the hearer will believe that he has understood. If there is just one derivation and it is invalid, the action containing the constraint that is the source of the invalidity is noted. (We have not explored ambiguous situations, those in which more than one valid derivation remains, or, in the absence of validity, more than one invalid derivation.)","We now need to address how we evaluate a derivation. In the case where the plan is invalid, we need to partially evaluate the plan in order to determine which action contains a constraint that cannot be satisfied. However, any instantiation will lead to some constraint being found not to hold. Care must therefore be taken in finding the right instantiation so that blame is attributed to the action at fault. So, we evaluate the constraints in order of mention in the derivation, but postpone any constraints that have multiple solutions until the end. We have found that this simple approach can find the instantiation for valid plans and can find the action that is in error for the others.","To illustrate this, consider the"]},{"title":"headnoun","paragraphs":["action, which has the following constraints."]},{"title":"speaker(Speaker) hearer(Hearer) world(World) bmb(Speaker, Hearer, category(Object, Category)) subset(World, AX. bmb(Speaker, Hearer, category(X, Category)),Cand)","paragraphs":["During the first step, finding the derivation, all co-referential variables will be unified.

Clarifications 4.1 Planning and Clarifying Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) have presented a model of how conversational participants collaborate in making a referring action successful (see Section 2 above). Their model consists of conversational moves that express a judgment of a referring expression and conversational moves that refashion an expression. However, their model is not computational. They do not account for how the judgment is made, how the judgment affects the refashioning, or the content of the moves.","Following the work of Litman and Allen (1987) in understanding clarification subdialogs, we formalize the conversational moves of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs as discourse actions. These discourse actions are meta-actions that take as a parameter a referring expression plan. The constraints and decompositions of the discourse actions encode the conditions under which they can be applied, how the referring expression derivations can be refashioned, and how the speaker's beliefs can be communicated to the hearer. So, the conversational moves, or clarifications, can be generated and understood within the planning paradigm. 7 Surface Speech Actions. An important part of our model is the surface speech actions. These actions serve as the basis for communication between the two agents, and so they must convey the information that is dictated by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model.

However, such reasoning is beyond the scope of this work. 362 Peter A. Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions used to replace some of the actions in the referring expression plan with new ones, and the second is to add new actions. Replacements can be used if the referring expression either overconstrains or underconstrains the choice of referent, while the expansion can be used only if it underconstrains the choice. So, these plans can check for these conditions.","The decomposition of the refashioning plans encodes how a new referring expression can be constructed from the old one.

He uses heuristics to relax the constraints of the description and to pick one that"]},{"title":"nearly","paragraphs":["fits it. This problem is beyond the scope of this paper, and so we choose one of the referents arbitrarily (but see Heeman [1991] for how a simplified version of Goodman's algorithm that relaxes only a single constraint can be incorporated into the planning paradigm).","The second step is to refashion the referring expression so that it identifies the candidate chosen in the first step. This is done by using plan repair techniques (Hayes 1975; Wilensky 1981; Wilkens 1985). Our technique is to remove the subplan rooted at the action in error and replan with another action schema inserted in its place. This technique has been encoded into our refashioning plans, and so can be used for both constructing repairs and inferring how another agent has repaired a plan.","Now we consider the effect of these refashioning plans. As we mentioned in Section 2, once the refashioning plan is accepted, the common ground of the participants is updated with the new referring expression. So, the effect of the refashioning plans is that the hearer will believe that the speaker wants the new referring expression plan to replace the current one. Note that this effect does not make any claims about whether the new expression will in fact enable the successful identification of the referent. For if it did, and if the new referring expression were invalid, this would imply that the refashioning plan was also invalid, which is contrary to Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model of the acceptance process. So, the understanding of a refashioning does not depend on the understanding of the new proposed referring expression, but only on its derivation. 4.2 Action Schemas This section presents action schemas for clarifications. Each clarification action includes a surface speech action in its decomposition. However, all reasoning is done at the level of the clarification actions, and so the surface actions do not include any constraints or effects.

So, when a"]},{"title":"replan","paragraphs":["action is part of a plan that is being evaluated, the success of this action depends only on whether the plan that is its parameter can be derived, but not whether the derived plan is valid. 13 5. Modeling Collaboration In the last two sections, we discussed how initial referring expressions, judgments, and refashionings can be generated and understood in our plan-based model. In this section, we show how plan construction and plan inference fit into a complete model of how an agent collaborates in making a referring action successful. Previous natural language systems that use plans to account for the surface speech acts underlying an utterance (such as Cohen and Perrault 1979; Allen and Perrault 1980; Appelt 1985; Litman and Allen 1987) model only the recognition or only the construction of an agent's plans, and so do not address this issue.","In order to model an agent's participation in a dialog, we need to model how the mental state of the agent changes as a result of the contributions that are made to the dialog. The change in mental state can be modeled by the beliefs and goals that a participant adopts. When a speaker produces an utterance, as long as the hearer finds it coherent, he can add a belief that the speaker has made the utterance to accomplish some communicative goal. The hearer might then adopt some goal of his own in response to this, and make an utterance that he believes will achieve this goal. Participants expect each other to act in this way. These social norms allow participants to add to their common ground by adopting the inferences about an utterance as mutual beliefs.","To account for how conversants collaborate in dialog, however, this cooperation is not strong enough. Not only must participants form mutual beliefs about what was said, they must also form mutual beliefs about the adequacy of the plan for the task","13 Another approach would be to have the plan inference process reason about the intended effects of the plan that it is inferring in order to decide whether it should evaluate embedded plans and whether this evaluation should affect the evaluation of the parent plan. 366 Peter A. Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions they are collaborating upon. If the plan is not adequate, then they must work together to refashion it. This level of cooperation is due to what Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs refer to as a"]},{"title":"mutual responsibility,","paragraphs":["or what Searle (1990) refers to as a"]},{"title":"we-intention.","paragraphs":["This allows the agents to interact so that neither assumes control of the dialog, thus allowing both to contribute to the best of their ability without being controlled or impeded by the other. This is different from what Grosz and Sidner (1990) have called master-servant dialogs, which occur in teacher-apprentice or information-seeking dialogs, in which one of the participants is controlling the conversation (cf. Walker and Whittaker 1990). Note that the noncontrolling agent may be helpful by anticipating obstacles in the plan (Allen and Perrault 1980), but this is not the same as collaborating.","The mutual responsibility that the agents share not only concerns the goal they are trying to achieve, but also the plan that they are currently considering. This plan serves to coordinate their activity and so agents will have intentions to keep this plan in their common ground. The plan might not be valid (unlike the"]},{"title":"shared plan","paragraphs":["of Grosz and Sidner [1990]), so the agents might not mutually believe that each action contributes to the goal of the plan. Because of this, agents will have a belief regarding the validity of the plan, and an intention that this belief be mutually believed.","The discourse plans that we described in the previous section can now be seen as plans that can be used to further the collaborative activity. Judgment plans express beliefs about the success of the current plan, and refashioning plans update it. So, the mental state of an agent sanctions the adoption both of goals to express judgment and of goals to refashion. It also sanctions the adoption of beliefs about the current plan. 14 If it is mutually believed that one of the conversants believes there is an error with the current plan, the other also adopts this belief. Likewise, if one of the conversants proposes a replacement, the other accepts it. Since both conversants expect the other to behave in this way, each judgment and refashioning, so long as they are understood, results in the judgment or refashioning being mutually believed. Thus the current plan, through all of its refashionings, remains in the common ground of the participants.","Below, we discuss the rules for updating the mental state after a contribution is made. We then give rules that account for the collaborative process. 15 5.1 Rules for Updating the Mental State After a plan has been contributed to the conversation, by way of its surface speech actions, the speaker and hearer update their beliefs to reflect the contribution that has been made. Both assume that the hearer is observant, can derive a coherent plan (not necessarily valid), and can infer the communicative goal, which is expressed by the effect of the top-level action in the plan.

We do not explicitly address this, however. 15 For simplicity, we represent the rules for entering into a collaborative activity, adopting beliefs, and adopting goals with the same operator, 4==.

Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions 7. Comparisons to Related Work In providing a computational model of how agents collaborate upon referring expressions, we have touched on several different areas of research. First, our work has built on previous work in referring expressions, especially their incorporation into a model based on the planning paradigm. Second, our work has built on the research done in modeling clarifications in the planning paradigm and on plan repair. Third, our work is related to the research being done on modeling collaborative and joint activity. 7.1 Referring Expressions Cohen (1981) and Appelt (1985) have also addressed the generation of referring expressions in the planning paradigm. They have integrated this into a model of generating utterances, a step that we haven't taken. However, we have extended their model by incorporating even the generation of the components of the description into our planning model. One result of this is that our surface speech actions are much more fine-grained. 7.2 Clarifications and Plan Repair An important part of our work involves accounting for clarifications of referring expressions by using meta-actions that incorporate plan repair techniques. This approach is based on Litman and Allen's work (1987) on understanding clarification subdialogs, in which meta-actions were used to model discourse relations, such as clarifications. There are several major differences between our work and theirs. First, our work addresses not only understanding, but also generation, and how these two tasks fit into a model of how agents collaborate in discourse. Second, Litman and Allen use a stack of unchanging plans to represent the state of the discourse. We, however, use a single"]},{"title":"current plan,","paragraphs":["modifying it as clarifications are made. This difference has an important ramification, for it results in different interpretations of the discourse structure. Consider dialog (7.1), which was collected at an information booth in a Toronto train station (Horrigan 1977). (Although the participants are not collaborating in making a referring expression, the dialog will serve to illustrate our point.)","(7.1) P- 1 The 8:50 to Montreal? C\" 2 8:50 to Montreal.

In our model, the acceptance of \"Gate 7\" would be presupposed, and so it would be incorporated into the"]},{"title":"take-train-trip","paragraphs":["plan. So, the passenger's question of \"Where is it?\" would be viewed as a request for the clerk to clarify that plan.","The work of Moore and Swartout (1991), Cawsey (1991), and Carletta (1991) on interactive explanations also addresses clarifications using plan repair techniques. This body of work uses plan construction techniques to generate explanations, and uses the 377 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 constructed plan as a basis for recovery strategies if the user doesn't understand the explanation. In the cases of Cawsey and Carletta, both use meta-actions to encode the plan repair techniques. However, none of these approaches is within a collaborative framework, in which either agent can contribute to the development of the plan.","Other relevant work is that of Lambert and Carberry (1991). In their model of understanding information-seeking dialogs, they propose a distinction between problem-solving activities and discourse activities. In contrast, our clarifications embody both functions in the same actions, thus allowing for a simpler approach to inferring the refashioned referring expressions, since we need not chain to a meta-operator. In later work, Chu-Carroll and Carberry (1994) extended this model to generate responses to proposals that are viewed as sub-optimal or invalid. Like Litman and Allen (1987), they adopt the view that subsequent modifications apply to the preceding modifica-tion, rather than the underlying plan. 7.3 Collaboration Grosz, Sidner, and Lochbaum (Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner, 1990) are interested in the type of plans that underlie discourse in which the agents are collaborating in order to achieve some goal. They propose that agents are building a shared plan in which participants have a collection of beliefs and intentions about the actions in the plan. Our model differs from theirs in two important aspects. First, not only do agents have a collection of beliefs and intentions regarding the actions of a shared plan, but we feel that they also have an intention about the goal (Searle 1990; Cohen and Levesque 1991). It is this intention, in conjunction with the current plan, that sanctions the adoption of beliefs and intentions about potential actions that will contribute to the goal, rather than just the shared plan.","Second, we feel that their definition of a partial shared plan is too restrictive. Although they address partial plans, they require, in order for an action to be part of a partial shared plan, that both agents believe that the action contributes to the goal. However, this is too strong. In collaborating to achieve a mutual goal, participants sometimes propose an action that is not believed by the other participant or even by the participant that is proposing it. In failing to represent such states, their model is unable to represent the intermediate states in which a hearer might have understood how the speaker's utterance contributes to a plan, but doesn't agree with it. This is important, since if the refashioned plan is invalid, only the referring expression should be refashioned, not the refashioning itself.","Traum (1991; Traum and Hinkelman, 1992) is concerned with providing a computational model of grounding, the process in which conversational participants add to the common ground of a conversation (Clark and Schaefer 1989; Clark and Brennan 1990). Traum models the grounding process by proposing that utterances move through a number of states, 'pushed' by grounding acts, which include initiate, continue, repair, request repair, acknowledge, and request acknowledge. Once an utterance has been acknowledged, it will reside in mutual belief as a proposal of the person who initiated it. The proposal state is a subspace of the mutual belief space of the conversants. Only once it has been accepted will it be moved into the shared space (also in mutual belief). Unlike Traum's, our work does not differentiate the proposal state from the shared state. If a proposal is understood, it is incorporated into the current plan. Judgments of acceptability are not on proposals but on the current plan, or a part of it.","Sidner (1994) addressed the issue of how conversational participants collaborate in building a shared plan. In this work, Sidner presents a number of speech actions for use in collaborative tasks. These actions are those that an artificial agent could use in negotiating which actions or beliefs to accept into the shared plan of the agents. As 378 Peter A. Heeman and Graeme Hirst Collaborating on Referring Expressions with Traum, it is the"]},{"title":"proposals","paragraphs":["that are refashioned, before they are integrated into the shared plan, rather than the shared plan.","Cohen and Levesque (1991) focus on formalizing joint intention in a logic. They use this formalism to explain how such elements of communication as confirmations arise when agents are engaging in a joint action. However, they have not addressed how agents collaborate in building a plan, only how agents collaborate while executing a plan. Once this limitation is overcome, their approach could offer us a route for formalizing the mental states of the collaborating agents in our model and for proving that our acceptance and goal adoption rules follow from such states. 8. Conclusion We have presented a computational model of how a conversational participant collaborates in making and understanding a referring expression, based on the view that language is goal-oriented behavior. This has allowed us to do the following. First, we have accounted for the tasks of building a referring expression and identifying its referent by using plan construction and plan inference. Second, we have accounted for the conversational moves that participants make during the acceptance process by using meta-actions. Third, we have accounted for collaborative activity by proposing that agents are in a certain mental state that includes a goal, a plan that they are currently considering, and intentions. This mental state sanctions the acceptance of clarification plans, and sanctions the adoption of goals to clarify. Although our work has focused on referring expressions, we feel that it is relevant to collaboration in general and to how agents contribute to discourse.","This paper is based on the model of collaboration proposed by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986). Their model makes two strong claims about how agents collaborate. First, it minimizes the distinction between the roles of the person who initiates the referring expression and the person who is trying to identify it. Both have the same moves available to them, for either can judge the description and either can refashion it. This allows both participants to contribute without being controlled or impeded by the other. Second, their model gives special status to the role of the current referring expression (current plan): participants judge and refashion the current referring expression directly, rather than recursively modifying modifications (e.g. Litman and Allen 1987; Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994) or incrementally adding to the current plan with each accepted proposal (e.g. Traum and Hinkelman 1992; Sidner 1992). In our work, we have taken Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's descriptive model and recast it into a computational one, thus demonstrating the computational feasibility of their work and its compatibility with current practices in artificial intelligence.","There are many ways that this research could be extended. Perhaps the most obvious would be to extend the planning component of our model. First, our coverage of referring expressions could be extended to handle references to objects in focus and to descriptions that include a plan of physical actions for identifying the referent. Second, the treatment of clarifications could be improved; specifically, how plan failures are reasoned about, how plan failures affect the agent's beliefs, and how these failures are repaired. Third, this research needs to be integrated into a more complete plan-based approach to language, and needs to be extended so as to handle more general discourse plan failures (McRoy and Hirst 1993; McRoy and Hirst 1995; Horton and Hirst 1991; Heeman 1993; Edmonds 1994; Hirst et al. 1994). A benchmark for such future work could be dialog (8.1) below, from the London-Lund corpus (Svartvik and Quirk 1980, S.2.4a:1-8, which is the basis of the example used in Section 6. This dialog shows how collaboration on a referring expression can be embedded in other 379 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 3 activities, how agents can return back to a collaborative activity, and even how agents can take advantage of a mistaken referent."]},{"title":"(8.1)","paragraphs":["A'- 1 What's that weird creature over there? B: 2 In the corner? _~: 3 affirmative noise B.\" 4 It's just a fern plant. A: 5 No, the one to the left of it. B-\" 6 That's the television aerial. It pulls out.","A second avenue for future work is to further investigate collaborative behavior and protocols for interaction. We need to formalize what it means for agents to be collaborating, in a theory that takes account of rational interaction and the beliefs and knowledge of the participants. Such a theory would do the following. First, it would give a more complete motivation for the processing rules that we used for how agents interact in a collaborative activity. Second, it would account for why agents would enter into such a mode of interaction, how it is initiated, how it is carried forward (especially how agents' beliefs and knowledge influence their actions), and how it ends. Third, it would be extendable to other forms of interaction, such as information-seeking dialogs. Fourth, it would specify how collaborative activity could be embedded in, or embed, other types of interactions. By answering these questions, we will not only have a better model to base natural language interfaces on, but we will also have a better understanding of how people interact.
