This paper addresses this issue in the context of the expression of procedural relations between actions in instructional text. It employs the following four-step approach to achieve this goal: (1) collect a corpus of the relevant text type; (2) perform a detailed linguistic study of a portion of this corpus, called the training set, and reserve the remainder as a testing set; (3) implement the results of this study in a text generation system; and (4) compare the output of the system with the text found in the entire corpus. This has resulted in the construction of IMAGENE, an instructional text generation system that embodies a model of the forms of expression consistently used by instructional text writers over a broad range of instruction types. The details of IMAGENE'S treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full system. 1. Introduction Natural language provides an extensive set of lexical and grammatical forms for expressing concepts, many of which may, taken out of context, appear to be interchangeable. They are not interchangeable. Writers systematically choose the particular form from this set that they feel will produce the most effective expression given the communicative context. An important task of the text generation researcher is to inform the text generation process with a specification of both the range of these forms and the contexts in which they are used.","The current study addresses this issue in the context of expressing procedural relations between actions in instructional text, that is, in written, procedural directions. The complexity of procedural relations typically expressed in such text has given rise to complex variations of expression in language. Consider, for example, the problem of expressing purpose relations. Such expressions could take many conceivable forms, all of which are perfectly grammatical: (la) Pull out sharply in order to remove the phone. (lb) To remove phone, pull out sharply. * Information Technology Research Institute, University of Brighton, Lewes Road, Brighton BN2 4AT, UK.

Formal linguistic analyses are useful for weeding out grammatically unacceptable forms, but they do not provide a principled means of determining which of the grammatically acceptable forms should be used in any given communicative context. As an alternative, the current study has employed the following four-step process for identifying both the relevant forms of expression and the contexts in which they are used: . . . 4. Collect a corpus of text from the relevant genre and encode a full range of the lexical and grammatical features of all of the text. Perform a linguistic analysis of part of the corpus. This analysis involves determining the range of forms used in the corpus and then using an iterative cycle of hypothesis formation and testing to determine the communicative contexts in which each is used. Implement the results of this analysis in the text generation system. Compare, in detail, the output of the system with the text found in the corpus, differentiating between the predictions concerning text that was specifically used in the analysis (the training set) and text that was not (the testing set).","This process begins and ends with the corpus, providing an empirically based approach to identifying the range of lexical and grammatical forms that are used in real text and to determining the contextual issues that are relevant to choosing among them. Although the corpus study has become a common methodology in natural language generation, seldom are the representation and analysis techniques given in any detail, and detailed evaluations of the resulting text are not provided. These details are provided, for our study, in this paper.","Our corpus is divided into training and testing portions. The training portion, used in step 2, constitutes approximately one-third of the full corpus and consists entirely of 30 Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations cordless telephone manuals. The methodology is successfully applied to this portion, showing that there are, in fact, patterns of expression in cordless telephone manuals that can be identified and implemented. The study is then extended by testing the system's predictions on a separate and more diverse portion of the corpus that includes instructions for different types of devices and processes. This additional testing serves both to disallow over-fitting of the data in the training portion and to give a measure of how far beyond the telephone domain the predictions can legitimately be applied. No testing was done on noninstructional texts, and no claims are made concerning the applicability of the system's predictions in those areas.","Following a review of relevant work in the area of natural language generation, this paper will discuss how these four steps have been applied to the generation of rhetorical relations in instructional text. It will detail what rhetorical relations in instructional text are and how they were collected and represented. It will then discuss how the corpus analysis was performed and how the results were implemented in IMAGENE, an instructional text generation system. The details of IMAGENE'S treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full system (more details concerning the other relations can be found elsewhere [Vander Linden 1993c]). It will conclude with a discussion of how well IMAGENE'S predictions match the text in the training and the testing portions of the corpus. 2. Related Work in Natural Language Generation In pursuit of other issues, many studies have adopted a temporary solution to the problem of managing diverse forms of expression, namely, that of choosing a single lexical and grammatical form to express each of the relevant types of information dealt with by the system. It is then a simple matter of allowing the type of information to determine the appropriate expressional form. Hovy's text structurer (Hovy 1988b), for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed. It does not make any decision as to how a chosen relation is to be expressed, but rather leaves this task to the rudimentary implementation of the rhetorical relations provided by the Penman text generation system (Mann 1985). In the case of a purpose, for example, Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p. 167): \"Knox is en route in order to rendezvous with CTG 070.10.\" A similar approach to expressing rhetorical relations was taken in McKeown's TEXT system (McKeown 1985).","Text generators specifically designed for instructional text, such as Mellish and Evans' generator (Mellish and Evans 1989), EPICURE (Dale 1992), COMET (McKeown et al. 1990), and TECHDOC (R6sner and Stede 1992b), display similar characteristics. (See the analytical work of Delin, Scott, and Hartley [1993] for a notable exception to this pattern.)","Mellish and Evans' generator, for example, uses the output of NONLIN, a nonlinear planner (Tate 1976), as the preliminary rhetorical structure for the text. Because this often produced text that was monotonous or hard to understand, they included what was termed a message optimization phase that specifies rules for removing or modifying certain elements of the plan structure that are known to produce poor text. Although this greatly improves the text, it still tends toward text that is difficult to read. This problem is, in part, due to the fact that some of the plans they look at are quite complex and correspondingly difficult to express, but it is also attributable to the lack of a detailed corpus study of the linguistic tools used by technical writers in instructional text. The IMAGENE project can be seen as an extension of their work 31 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 that employs such a study to help manage diversity of forms of expression. There are other natural language generation projects that have addressed similar issues. Two such examples are Hovy's Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer's Spokesman (Meteer 1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies.","Pauline produces an impressive range of expressional forms that are based on a list of pragmatic features of the communicative environment, including information about the conversational atmosphere, the speaker, the hearer, the relationship between the two, and the interpersonal communicative goals of the speaker. Its construction required a considerable amount of analysis of sample texts, but unfortunately, very little is said about how this analysis was actually performed and how well the text produced by Pauline matches the text in the corpus. The concerns of the IMAGENE project are similar, except that both the text type (instructional text) and the linguistic phenomenon (expressing rhetorical relations) are much more focused. The results of our study are therefore more detailed, but also more constrained (see the concept of"]},{"title":"domain communication knowledge,","paragraphs":["as described by Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow","[1991]).","In the Spokesman project, Meteer proposed an architecture for addressing what she","termed the problem of"]},{"title":"expressibility","paragraphs":["in text planning (Meteer 1992). Her fundamental thesis is that an abstract linguistic representation is needed to provide the text planner with information on constraints of expression (see Vaughan, and McDonald 1987). Her constraints are taken, at least in part, from a study of text revisions made by expert editors. The IMAGENE project concurs with this concern for detailed forms of expression, but its methodology is geared toward determining the elements of the communicative context used to choose between equally acceptable alternative forms of expression. Meteer does not address what to do if, after using her constraints to remove unacceptable forms of expression, there are a number of remaining acceptable forms. This issue of choice is central to the current study."]},{"title":"3. Corpus Collection and Representation","paragraphs":["The corpus developed for this study was taken from various types of instructional text, including instruction booklets, recipes, and auto-repair manuals. It contains approximately 1000 clauses (6000 words) of instructions, taken from 17 different sources representing a diverse array of process types. These sources include instructions for electronic devices like cordless telephones and clock radios, manipulative processes like auto repair and first aid, and creative processes like cooking and craft making. The one common feature is that they all involve the expression of actions and of the procedural relations between them. 1 As an example of the nature of this text, consider the following excerpt from the instructions for the GTE Airfone (Airfone 1991), which will be called the Remove-Phone text:","(2) When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out. Return to seat to place calls. (Airfone 1991) 2 1 It should be noted that this corpus is much smaller than the language corpora used in larger statistical studies (Church and Mercer 1993). The deep semantic and pragmatic knowledge that was required for the current study has necessitated this. 2 This paper will add a reference to the end of all examples that have come directly from the corpus, indicating the manual from which they were taken. Examples of actual IMAGENE output will be fully italicized. All other examples are contrived for explanatory purposes. 32 Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations","This passage gives an example of the variation of expressional form that is common in instructional text. It contains, among other things, two expressions of purpose: \"remove phone\" and \"to place calls.\" This notion of purpose, which will be detailed in the next section, is one of actions that are to be realized through the execution of expressed sub-actions. The first is stated as an imperative (\"remove the phone\"), with the sub-actions expressed in participial form within a by prepositional phrase (\"by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out\"). The second (\"to place calls\"), on the other hand, is expressed in final position as a to infinitive, with its sub-action stated as an imperative (\"return to seat\"). The problem to be addressed by the corpus analysis in step 2 is to determine the contextual features used to choose these forms as opposed to the alternate forms that could have expressed the \"same basic information.\"","A relational-style database is used to represent the rhetorical, grammatical, and lexical aspects of the corpus. The representation of the grammatical form of the clauses and phrases is based on traditional principles of syntax and semantics. Clauses and phrases are represented in separate tables. Links within the clause table are used to indicate subordinate relations, and links between the clause and phrase tables are used to represent relative clauses and predicate-argument relations. It also includes semantic information such as the agent of a particular action (e.g., the reader or the device) and the semantic type of the predication (e.g., material or relational process). More detail on the database can be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993c). The goal was to allow for the representation of any element of the pragmatic, semantic, or syntactic context that might be relevant in the analysis.","Mann and Thompson's RST has been used to encode the rhetorical relations between expressions in the corpus (Mann and Thompson 1987, 1988). It was developed as a framework for describing text structure, viewed in terms of the semantic and pragmatic relations that hold between text spans at all levels. The current study has made use of five such relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent. This section will now make some general observations concerning RST, present an example RST analysis of the Remove-Phone text, and conclude with definitions of the relations used in the study.","RST distinguishes between what are called nucleus-satellite and multi-nuclear schemata. The nucleus-satellite schema relates two spans of text: one designating a more central span, called the nucleus, and a more peripheral one, called the satellite. This relation is represented graphically with a directed arrow from the satellite to the nucleus. Definitions of relations of this sort specify constraints that apply to the nucleus (N), the satellite (S), and the combination of the two and specify the effects of the expression. Purpose, Precondition, and Result are examples of such relations. The multi-nuclear schema relates one or more spans, designating no span as superordinate or subordinate to any other. Definitions of relations of this sort include specification of the constraints on the nuclei and the combination of nuclei, as well as a specification of the effect of the expression. The Sequence and Concurrent relations are such relations.","RST was attractive for the IMAGENE project because of its ability to represent the hierarchical structure of text with rhetorical structures that matched the level of analysis required for the study of expressions of procedural relations. There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other. The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b).","Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; R6sner 33 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1"]},{"title":"Precondition [","paragraphs":["(1) Instruct ~ 1 (2) Remove"]},{"title":"~uence","paragraphs":["(3) Grasp (4) Pull"]},{"title":"Purpose","paragraphs":["151 Return (6) Place Figure 1 The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text. and Stede 1992a). This testifies not only to RST's usefulness, but also to the direct applicability of the results of the current study to the field of natural language generation. Because of the common use of RST, the results can be more easily applied to other work in this area. In particular, the focus on the precise forms of expression of rhetorical relations in instructional text fills an important gap in current work (see the work of Scott and Souza [1990] on expressing rhetorical relations).","Consider the application of RST to the Remove-Phone text. The first problem that must be addressed in any RST analysis is the segmentation of the text into spans that will serve as the atomic units of description. In RST, these spans have typically been clauses, as is the case in the Remove-Phone passage, but certain phrases with propositional content may be considered as well. The spans used in our analysis are propositional units that express single actions. In the Remove-Phone text, there are six such action expressions, listed here in segmented form: . 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. When instructed (approx. 10 sec.) remove phone by firmly grasping top of handset and pulling out. Return to seat to place calls.","The second problem is one of relating these segments in the appropriate rhetorical structure. The current study has used the two aspects of the RST specification that can be mapped onto the procedural structure of the process being expressed, namely, the hierarchical structure of RST and the subset of RST relations that correspond to procedural relations. Each of these two aspects will be discussed with reference to the RST representation for the Remove-Phone text, shown in Figure 1. 3","The first aspect of this structure is its hierarchical nature. The procedural sequence schema at the top of the text hierarchy, for example, indicates that there are two 3 The actual RST and grammatical analyses of the text were performed by one of the authors, and the examples crucial to the formalization of the results were reviewed by both authors. This approach would be difficult in the analysis of certain more complex texts such as persuasive texts, but proved to be adequate in the study of local structure in instructional text. 34 Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations spans of text that express a sequence of two actions. The spans themselves can be expressed as single propositional units or as more complex spans, the latter being the case with the two spans in this sequence. This is a representational manifestation of the hierarchical nature of the processes themselves and is displayed graphically by extending the horizontal line of a span to cover all of its subordinate spans. The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text is a small portion of the full hierarchy that represents the entire manual. The current study has focused on the expression of just such local sub-trees; the problems of expression of macro-structure are beyond the scope of the analysis (see Mooney, Carberry, and McCoy 1991).","The second aspect of this structure is the nature of the rhetorical relations themselves. The representation makes use of five relations: Purpose, Precondition, Result, Sequence, and Concurrent, which are used as abstractions to identify the lexical and grammatical manifestations of the procedural relations inherent in the process.

In the hypothesis phase, the analyst hypothesizes a feature of the communicative context that appears to correlate with the variation of some aspect of the lexical and grammatical forms.

All of these types of features have proven relevant in the analysis. In the test phase, the analyst attempts to validate the hypothesis by querying the database for the relevant information. These two phases are repeated until a good match is achieved or until a relevant hypothesis cannot be found.","As an example of this methodology, consider the issue of slot, that is, the determination of which span in a rhetorical relation should be expressed first.

Of the 119 purpose expressions, approximately 48% are fronted and 52% are not fronted. These values are similar to the percentages of initial and final purpose clauses found by Thompson (1985) for procedural texts. Although she reports just over 18% initial purpose clauses for English text in general, she reports 49% initial purpose clauses for a book of recipes and 34% for an auto-repair manual.","Thompson's study indicated that one common feature of fronted purpose clauses is that their scope is global, that is, there is more than one expressed proposition that is directly related to the fulfillment of the purpose (e.g., \"To achieve purpose A, do B and do C.\" where there are two sub-actions, B and C). Such a purpose clause is expressing a context in which the prescribed sub-actions are to be interpreted and thus should be fronted. This provides a good starting hypothesis for determining the slot of purposes, namely, that global purpose clauses are fronted. Upon inspection, we find that only three cases of global purpose expressions in our corpus (7.9%) are not fronted. This yields strong support for the hypothesis and allows us to go on and discern what factors motivated the counter-examples. This process continues either until no distinctions can be found, or until there are not enough examples on which to base the distinctions.","The next question to be asked is whether this is the"]},{"title":"only","paragraphs":["explanation of fronted purpose expressions, or whether there are other fronted purpose expressions that are not global. This can be addressed by querying all the fronted, non-global purpose clauses in the corpus. In the current corpus, this set is non-empty, which leads to the conclusion that there are other factors at work in the question of purpose slot. The iterative process of hypothesis generation and testing can then be conducted on these other cases in a similar manner.","This analysis technique is designed to identify covariation between elements of the communicative context on the one hand and grammatical form on the other. The purpose slot analysis just discussed, for example, identifies the existence of a covariation between purpose scope and slot. This covariation, however, does not constitute proof that the technical writer actually considers the issue of slot during the generation process, nor that the prescribed form is actually more effective than any other. Proof of either of these issues would require psycholinguistic testing. This study provides detailed prescriptions concerning how such testing should be performed, i.e., what forms should be tested and what contexts controlled for, but it does not actually perform the tests. A discussion of this may be found elsewhere (Vander Linden 1993a). 5. IMAGENE This section will discuss the theoretical framework of the implementation and then detail the treatment for purpose expressions. The full IMAGENE architecture, as depicted in Figure 2, consists of a System Network and a Sentence Building routine and is built on top of Penman. It transforms inputs (shown on the left in Figure 2) into instructional text (shown on the right). 5.1 IMAGENE's Architecture Penman, a sentence-level generator developed at the USC Information Sciences In-stitute (Mann 1985; Penman 1989), was employed not only because of its broad coverage of English syntax, but also because it is based on a Systemic-Functional view of language (Halliday 1976). The Systemic view is distinctly functional, that is, it is particularly interested in mapping elements of the communicative context onto the appropriate grammatical forms.

We will present a detailed discussion of the purpose sub-network below, which is representative of the other grammatical form sub-networks. 7 Paris (1988, 1993) discusses this issue in more detail, particularly as it pertains to user modeling. 41 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Content and Rhetorical Status Selection Systems Grammatical Form Selec!i.o.n..Systems ............. .~ Purpose Systems 1/~..P.r.ec°ndi.t.i°.n..SY .s!e.m.s..., , Result Systems i NN~N~.

This input is implemented as a set of responses to the inquiries made by the IMAGENE system network pursuant to determining the appropriate path to be taken through the IMAGENE system network. They are analogous to Penman's sentence-level inquiries. Currently, the data structures and code necessary to respond to the inquiries automatically have not been implemented. Rather, the inquiries are answered manually, allowing us to focus on determining the appropriate set of inquiries and the precise lexical and grammatical consequences of the responses of these inquiries. The dashed lines in Figure 2 indicate some of the information sources that the inquiry implementations will access (i.e., the Process Structure, the Penman lexicon and grammar, and the evolving text structure). As a side effect of traversing the network, IMAGENE'S realization statements automatically realize these consequences in a text structure (also shown in Figure 2). The Text Structure, to be discussed more fully in Section 5.3, is represented in IMAGENE'S Text Representation Language (TRL). TRL itself is implemented in LOOM (MacGregor and Bates 1987; Loom 1993).","A second input shown in Figure 2, the"]},{"title":"Process Structure,","paragraphs":["is a representation of the process to be expressed. It is built in IMAGENE'S Process Representation Language (PRL), which is also implemented in LOOM and will also be discussed in Section 5.3. It is a representation like that produced by a procedural planner, containing the procedural hierarchy of the process being expressed as well as some information about the lexical items used to express each action and its arguments. It is currently built by hand, which allows us to focus on the problem of expression rather than on planning.","As previously mentioned, the Process Structure will eventually become a fundamental source of procedural information for the text inquiries. Currently, however, it is simply used by the final component of the architecture, the Sentence Builder, to specify the appropriate lexical items and case structures for the action input to the text-level inquiries. The Sentence Builder uses the lexical information given in the Process Structure just described, to translate the Text Structure, described above, into the appropriate sentence specification to be passed to Penman for surface realization. This specification is coded in terms of Penman's Sentence Planning Language (SPL) (Kasper 1989), a language that allows the specification of the lexical items and gram-42 Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations matical structures to be generated by Penman. The translation process is performed by a recursive descent of the Text Structure hierarchy. One SPL command is produced for each sentence in the Text Structure. 5.2 Purpose Relations in Instructional Text Purpose expressions arise in the context in which actions are viewed as being related hierarchically, that is, in which one higher level action is realized by the execution of a set of lower level actions. 8 As Section 4 indicated, there are a large number of lexical and grammatical forms in which such procedural relations are typically expressed, each used in a particular functional context. This section discusses the systems that have been included in IMAGENE to distinguish among these contexts.","There are other studies of purpose expressions from the point of view of representation and understanding that are of use here (Di Eugenio 1992; Balkanski 1992). Di Eugenio, for example, has worked with by purposes and to infinitive (TNF) purposes in the context of understanding, but does not appear to have distinguished the two forms in her analysis of the procedural relations between actions. The current study is critically interested in discerning principled reasons for choosing between these sorts of expressions.","The issues of slot and form of purpose expressions are treated largely independently by IMAGENE. The slot is determined by the sub-network shown in Figure 5. The form is determined by the sub-networks shown later in Figures 7 and 8. This portion of the system network is capable of generating a greater range of purpose expressions than is typical in generation systems and of identifying the functional reasons for choosing one form over the other. It should be noted that while the determinations made by the systems are based solely on the results of the corpus analysis conducted in step 2, the following sections will include intuitive motivations for the realizations the systems make. 5.2.1 Purpose Slot. The slot determination portion of the purpose sub-network, shown in Figure 5, formalizes Thompson's notion of the \"vastly different functions\" for initial and final purpose clauses (Thompson 1985) in the context of instructional text. It typically places the purpose expression in the final position. The exceptions to this are when the scope of the purpose is global, the purpose is considered optional, or the purpose is considered contrastive. These three exceptions are handled by the three systems depicted in Figure 5. 9","The first exception, handled by the Scope system, concerns the number of actions pertained to by the purpose. This correspondence between global purposes and fronted purpose expressions was already discussed in the corpus analysis section, but to give an intuitive feel for this empirical result, consider the awkwardness of restating example (3a) as \"?? Hold down FLASH [6] for about two seconds, then release it to end a previous call. \"1° The restatement seems to imply, incorrectly, that the purpose applies 8 Goldman has termed these hierarchical relations generation relations (Goldman 1970). A detailed discussion of them can be found elsewhere (Balkanski 1993; Di Eugenio 1993). 9 In the system network notation, vertical lines indicate decision points. The boldfaced names are systems, the normal font names are features, and the italicized names are realization statements. The ordering realization statements are denoted with the operators > and ], meaning order the clauses in the same sentence and order the clauses in separate sentences, respectively. More detail on this notation can be found elsewhere (Winograd 1983, ch. 6).","10 The \"??\" notation is used to denote a possible form of expression that is not typically found in our corpus; it does not indicate ungrammaticality. 43 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Scope Global Copy(Purpose, Internal-Purpose) Unlink( lnternal-Purpose, Form) Unlink( Inte rnal-Purpose, Trace) Unlink( Purpose, Schema) Structure(Internal-Purpose, Purpose)","Optionality Local Optional Purpose>Nucleus","Contrastiveness Required Contrastive Purpose>Nucleus Not-Contrastive Nucleus>Purpose Figure 5 The purpose slot selection network. A Grasp Pull B Purpose Remove quence Grasp Pull Figure 6 A structural view of purpose demotion. to the last action alone rather than to the sequence of actions. The fronted form, in example (3a), makes no such implication.","As can be seen in Figure 5, the Global feature of the Scope system contains five realization statements, all making changes to the evolving text structure. In the Remove-Phone text, for example, these statements restructure or demote the Remove action in the hierarchical structure shown in Figure 6A into a satellite node in the RST structure shown in Figure 6B. They do not, however, actually contain the realization statement to set the textual order of the purpose expression (which would read Purpose > Nucleus); later systems in this branch of the decision network execute this statement.","The remaining exceptions occur when the purpose is considered optional or contrastive and are handled by Optionality and Contrastiveness, respectively. Here are examples of them from the corpus:","(4) For more information and wall installation instructions, see the Installation Notes on page 3. (Code-a-phone 1989)","(5) To place call, dial AREA CODE and NUMBER. To end call, press red HANG UP button. (Airfone 1991) 44 • Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations","In example (4), the action of getting more information is optional, that is, the reader may or may not want more information at this point in the text. 11 The purpose expression is therefore stated first to set the appropriate context for interpreting the prescribed sub-action. In example (5), the purpose of ending a call is stated in contrast to placing a call in the previous sentence. It is thus fronted to set the appropriate context for the prescribed action. This fronting of contrastive purposes occurred in our corpus in the context of three oppositional semantic situations: (1) initiating/ending; (2) allowing/preventing; and (3) activating/deactivating.","The results of this study predict a number of cases in which purposes should not be fronted, which is in contrast to the general claim made by Dixon (1987). He claimed that purposes should always be fronted because this facilitates the top~lown construction of a procedural plan by readers as they progress through the text. Our results show cases in which this rule is not followed by technical writers, that is, when the purpose is neither global, optional, nor contrastive. 5.2.2 Purpose Form. The form selection sub-network, shown in Figures 712 and 8, determines the grammatical form of purpose expressions. The first element of the form selection sub-network is Conditional-Status, which determines whether the high-level purpose being expressed has special conditions pertaining to it, such as the expressed precondition in example (6a) or other conditions that restrict the applicability of the purpose, as in example (7a) (\"to wall unit"]},{"title":"from which it was taken\").","paragraphs":["If so, either a"]},{"title":"by","paragraphs":["purpose or an adjoined purpose expression is used, depending upon the complexity of the resulting sentence as determined by Sentence-Complexity.

The adjoined purpose form is an example of a case in which the rhetorical structure of a text need not be explicitly signaled with a lexical or grammatical cue (except textual order), called an \"inferred connective\" by Crothers (1979). RST allows the representation of this situation because its relations are not defined in terms of lexical and grammatical forms (Mann and Thompson 1987).","When a purpose does not have conditions upon it and the scope is global, Purpose-TNF marks the purpose as a to infinitive (TNF).

A full explanatory account, in the spirit of current Discourse-Functional studies (e.g., Matthiessen and Thompson 1987; Thompson 1987), would attempt to identify the precise aspect of the action or the context of its expression that would dictate the use of a nominalization, thus resulting in the development of a nominalized form in the English language.

Verifying IMAGENE's Prescriptions","paragraphs":["Finally, we compare the output of the text generator with the text in the corpus.

This way, the extensive lexicon that would have been necessary for the surface realization was not required. IMAGENE currently includes a domain model and lexical entries for cordless telephones and a few other specific examples.","The match was judged on four separate lexical and grammatical issues: linker, form, slot, and clause combining. The resulting TRL structure had to specify the identical linker (either preposition or conjunction), form (tense, aspect, mood, and voice, or non-finite verb or nominalization), slot (textual order), and combining (if the expression was combined with the following one). An example of this verification process can be found in Section 5.3, in which the IMAGENE-produced Remove-Phone text is shown to match the original text on all four of these issues.","Note that the match must be exact. For example, if IMAGENE specifies the conjunction and for a sequence expression when then occurs in the text, the choice of linker would be counted as incorrect, in spite of the fact that the resulting text might be quite understandable.

Although the general philosophy of the approach taken in the current study is to assume that the choices made by the writers of the corpus are correct, there are isolated cases ~in which the forms in the corpus are probably inappropriate. IMAGENE embodies choices that are consistently made over a range of instructions and thus does not reflect isolated examples.","The analysis conducted in step 2 has been based primarily on a small subset of the full corpus, namely on the instructions for a set of three cordless telephone manuals. This training set constitutes approximately 35% of our corpus. The results of this analysis were then implemented in IMAGENE and applied to the full corpus, providing a detailed characterization of the instructions found in the original telephone manuals and a quantitative analysis of how well this characterization applies to the other forms of instructions. IMAGENE's realizations correctly match all four lexical and grammatical issues in 71% of the expressions in the training set and 52% in the testing set. The specific levels of match for the four most common rhetorical relations are detailed in Figures 12 and 13. There is one table for each of the major rhetorical relations, Purpose, Precondition, Result, and Sequence. 17 These tables show the percentage of","16 The training corpus included some non-procedural text that was included for a pilot study done before the focus on procedural text had been determined. It is not handled particularly well by IMAGENE, and the results given in this section will not include it.

IMAGENE'S accuracy for results and sequence expressions is similar to that presented for purposes and preconditions. It is detailed in Figure 13. 7. Conclusions This paper has addressed the problem of determining the precise lexical and grammatical forms for expressing procedural relations between actions in the context of instructional text generation. The corpus-based methodology employed is well suited for this problem, providing both a principled means for cataloging the lexical and grammatical forms that are consistently used in instructional text and an environment for testing and confirming hypotheses concerning the contextual issues that co-vary with these forms.","The issues of procedural planning, user modeling, and content selection, although of unquestionable importance to the broad goal of generating instructions, were not specifically addressed here. The current study makes a number of prescriptions for the type of information that such techniques would need to provide to the text planner pursuant to the generation of instructional text, but says nothing about how they should be implemented in order to achieve this.","There are two fundamental contributions of the current study to the field of computational linguistics. The first is the analysis of instructional text itself. The current study has provided a characterization of certain aspects of instructional text that has been effectively applied to the generation of instructional text in general. This characterization is directly applicable to current work on instructional text, particularly in the context of natural language generation. The results can also serve as a source of preliminary hypotheses with respect to the analysis of other related genres. 54 Keith Vander Linden and James H. Martin Expressing Rhetorical Relations","The second is the detailed presentation of a methodology for managing diversity of expression at the textual level in the context of text generation. The approach involves collecting a suitable corpus of text, analyzing that text, implementing the results of the analysis in a text generator, and verifying the output of the generator. This approach is applicable not just to the problem of expressing procedural relations in instructional text, but rather to any lexical or grammatical aspect of any linguistic genre."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This paper is based on earlier work done with Susanna Cumming, whose approach to language study has inspired much of what we have done here.
