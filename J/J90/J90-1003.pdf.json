{"sections":[{"title":"WORD ASSOCIATION NORMS, ] /IUTUAL INFORMATION, AND LEXICOGRAPHY Kenneth Ward Church Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, N.J. Patrick Hanks Collins Publishers Glasgow, Scotland The term word association is used in a very particular sense in the psycholinguistic literature. (Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor.) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand :mbjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words.","paragraphs":["1 MEANING AND ASSOCIATION It is common practice in linguistics to classify words not only on the basis of their meanings but also on the basis of their co-occurrence with other words.

Lexical relations come in several varieties. There are some like refraining from that are fairly fixed, others such as coming from that may be separated by an argument, and still others like keeping from that are almost certain to be separated by an argument.","The ideal window size is different in each case. For the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to five words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out constraints that make use of strict adjacency)","Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word pairs with f(x,y) _< 5. An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant. Unfortunately, this requires an estimate of the variance off(x,y), which goes beyond the scope of this paper. For the remainder of this paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts.","Technically, the association ratio is different from mutual information in two respects. First, joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric: P(x,y) = P(y, x), and thus, mutual information is also symmetric: I(x,y) = I(y, x). However, the association ratio is not symmetric, sincef(x, y) encodes linear precedence. (Recall thatf(x, y) denotes the number of times that word x appears before y in the window of w words, not the number of times the two words appear in either order.) Although we could fix this problem by redefiningf(x, y) to be symmetric (by averag-ing the matrix with its transpose), we have decided not to do so, since order information appears to be very interesting. Notice the asymmetry in the pairs in Table 2 (computed from 44 million words of 1988 AP text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging from sexism to syntax.","Second, one might expect f(x, y) <_ f(x) and f(x, y) <_ f(y), but the way we have been counting, this needn't be the case if x and y happen to appear several times in the window. For example, given the sentence, \"Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins,\" which appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988, f(prohibited) = 1 and f(prohibited, from) = 2. This problem can be fixed by dividingf(x, y) by w - 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2 (w - 1) = 2 from our association ratio scores). This adjustment has the addi-Table 2.

In contrast, when I(x, y) ---: 0, the pairs are less interesting. (As a very rough rule; of thumb, we have observed that pairs with I(x, y) > 3 tend to be interesting, and pairs with smaller I(x, y) are generally not. One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures. Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels, e.g. with 95% confidence, P(x, y) > e(x) P(y).)","If I(x, y) << 0, we would predict that x and y are in complementary distribution. However, we are rarely able to observe I(x, y) << 0 because our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude). Suppose, for example, that both x and y appear about 10 times per million words of text. Then, P(x) = P(y) = 10 -5 and chance is P(x) P(x) = 10 -I°. Thus, to say that I(x, y) is much less than 0, we need to say that P(x, y) is much less than 10 -t°, a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora. In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N ~ 10 -7, and therefore it is hard to know if I(x, y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large. (In fact, the pair a... doctors in Table 3, appears significantly less often than chance. But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to - 1.04), and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as Good (1953). 4 5 LEXICO-SYNTACTIC REGULARITIES Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/ nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about Table 3.

In addition to identifying semantic rela-","tions of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association","ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexico-","syntactic relationships between verbs and typical argu-","ments/adjuncts. The proposed association ratio can be","viewed as a formalization of Sinclair's argument: How common are the phrasal verbs with set? Set is particularly rich in making combinations with words like about, in, up, out, on, off, and these words are themselves very common. How likely is set offto occur? Both are frequent words [set occurs approximately 250 times in a million words and off occurs approximately 556 times in a million words... [T]he question we are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur immediately after set?... This is 0.00025 x 0.00055 [P(x) P(y)], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 ... The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our terminology]. It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure of how much set and offattract each other is to compare the probability with what actually happens ... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus [P(x, y) = 70/(7.3 x 106) >> P(x) P(y)]. That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the description of a substantial collection of phrases ... (Sinclair 1987c, pp. 151-152).","Using Sinclair's estimates P(set) ~ 250 x 10 -6, P(off) ~-","556 x 10 -6, and P(set, off) ~ 70/(7.3 x 106), we would","estimate the mutual information to be I(set; off) =","log2P(set, off)/(P(set) P(off)) ~ 6.1. In the 1988 AP","corpus (N = 44,344,077), we estimate P(set) ~ 13,046/N,","P(off) ~ 20,693/N, and P(set, off) ~ 463/N. Given these","estimates, we would compute the mutual information to be","l(set; off) ~ 6.2. In this example, at least, the values seem to be fairly","comparable across corpora. In other examples, we will see","some differences due to sampling. Sinclair's corpus is a","fairly balanced sample of (mainly British) text; the AP","corpus is an unbalanced sample of American journalese. This association between set and offis relatively strong;","the joint probability is more than 26 = 64 times larger than","chance. The other particles that Sinclair mentions have","association ratios that can be seen in Table 4. The first three, set up, set off, and set out, are clearly Table 4.

As Sinclair suggests, the approach is well suited for identifying the phrasal verbs, at least in certain cases.","6 PREPROCESSING WITH A PART OF SPEECH TAGGER Phrasal verbs involving the preposition to raise an interesting problem because of the possible confusion with the infinitive marker to. We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to~in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to~to. (Part of speech notation is borrowed from Francis and Kucera (1982); in = preposition; to = infinitive marker; vb = bare verb; vbg = verb + ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb + en.) The association ratio identifies quite a number of verbs associated in an interesting way with to; restricting our attention to pairs with a score of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated with the preposition to~in and 551 verbs with the infinitive marker to/to. The ten verbs found to be most associated before to/in are:","• to~in: alluding/vbg, adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, relating/ vbg, amounting/vbg, revert/vb, reverted/vbn, resorting/ vbg, relegated/vbn","• to~to: obligated/vbn, trying/vbg, compelled/vbn, enables/vbz, supposed/vbn, intends/vbz, vowing/vbg, tried/vbd, enabling/vbg, tends/vbz, tend/vb, intend/vb, tries/vbz Thus, we see there is considerable leverage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating the inventory of tokens. 7 PREPROCESSING WITH A PARSER Hindle (Church et al. 1989) has found it helpful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983a, 1983b) to identify associations between verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes for nouns on this basis. Hindle's method is able to find some very interesting associations, as Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate.","After running his parser over the 1988 AP corpus (44 million words), Hindle found N = 4,112,943 subject/verb/ object (SVO) triples. The mutual information between a verb and its object was computed from these 4 million triples by counting how often the verb and its object were found in the same triple and dividing by chance. Thus, for example, disconnect/V and telephone/0 have a joint probability of 7/N. In this case, chance is 84/N x 481/N because there are 84 SVO triples with the verb disconnect, and 481 SVO triples with the object telephone. The mutual information is log z 7N/(84 × 481) = 9.48. Similarly, the mutual information for drink/Vbeer/O is 9.9 = log 2 29N/ (660 × 195). (drink/V and beer/O are found in 660 and Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 25 Kenneth Church and Patrick Hanks Word Association Norms, Mutual Information, and Lexicography Table 5.

For measuring syntactic constraints, it may be useful to include some part of speech information and to exclude much of the internal structure of noun phrases. For other purposes, it may be helpful to tag items and/or phrases with semantic labels such as *person*, *place*, *time*, *body part*, *bad*, and so on. 8 APPLICATIONS IN LEXICOGRAPHY Large machine-readable corpora are only just now becoming available to lexicographers.

These learners' dictionaries pay more attention to language structure and collocation than do American collegiate dictionaries, and lexicographers trained in the British tradition are often fairly skilled at spotting these generalizations. However, teasing out such facts and distinguishing true intuitions from false intuitions takes a lot of time and hard work, and there is a high probability of inconsistencies and omissions. Which other verbs typically associate with from, and where does save rank in such a list? The association ratio identified 1530 words that are associated with from; 911 of them were tagged as verbs. The first 100 verbs are: refrain/vb, gleaned/vbn, stems/vbz, stemmed/vbd, stemming/vbg, ranging/vbg, stemmed/vbn, ranged/ vbn, derived/vbn, ranged/vbd, extort/vb, graduated/ vbd, barred/vbn, benefiting/vbg, benefitted/vbn, benefited/vbn, excused/vbd, arising/vbg, range/vb, exempts/ vbz, suffers/vbz, exempting/vbg, benefited/vbd, prevented/vbd (7.0), seeping/vbg, barred/vbd, prevents/ vbz, suffering/vbg, excluded/vbn, marks/vbz, profiting/ vbg, recovering/vbg, discharged/vbn, rebounding/vbg, vary/vb, exempted/vbn, separate/vb, banished/vbn, withdrawing/vbg, ferry/vb, prevented/vbn, profit/vb, bar/vb, excused/vbn, bars/vbz, benefit/vb, emerges/ vbz, emerge/vb, varies/vbz, differ/vb, removed/vbn, exempt/vb, expelled/vbn, withdraw/vb, stem/vb, separated/vbn, judging/vbg, adapted/vbn, escaping/vbg, in-herited/vbn, differed/vbd, emerged/vbd, withheld/vbd, leaked/vbn, strip/vb, resulting/vbg, discourage/vb, prevent/vb, withdrew/vbd, prohibits/vbz, borrowing/vbg, preventing/vbg, prohibit/vb, resulted/vbd (6.0), preclude/vb, divert/vb, distinguish/vb, pulled/vbn, fell/ vbn, varied/vbn, emerging/vbg, suffer/vb, prohibiting/ vbg, extract/vb, subtract/vb, recover/vb, paralyzed/ vbn, stole/vbd, departing/vbg, escaped/vbn, prohibited/ vbn, forbid/vb, evacuated/vbn, reap/vb, barring/vbg, removing/vbg, stolen/vbn, receives/vbz. Save...from is a good example for illustrating the advantages of the association ratio. Save is ranked 319th in this list, indicating that the association is modest, strong enough to be important (21 times more likely than chance), but not so strong that it would pop out at us in a concordance, or that it would be one of the first things to come to mind. If the dictionary is going to list save.., from, then, for consistency's sake, it ought to consider listing all of the more important associations as well. Of the 27 bare verbs (tagged 'vb') in the list above, all but seven are listed in Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary as occurring with from. However, this dictionary does not note that vary, ferry, strip, divert, forbid, and reap occur with from. If the Cobuild lexicographers had had access to the proposed measure, they could possibly have obtained better","coverage at less cost. 8.2 EXAMPLE 2: IDENTIFYING SEMANTIC CLASSES Having established the relative importance of save ... from, and having noted that the two words are rarely Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 27 Kenneth Church and Patrick Hanks Word Association Norms, Mutual Information, and Lexicography adjacent, we would now like to speed up the labor-intensive task of categorizing the concordance lines. Ideally, we would like to develop a set of semi-automatic tools that would help a lexicographer produce something like Figure 2, which provides an annotated summary of the 65 concordance lines for save ... from. 5 The save ... from pattern occurs in about 10% of the 666 concordance lines for save.","Traditionally, semantic categories have been only vaguely recognized, and to date little effort has been devoted to a systematic classification of a large corpus. Lexicographers have tended to use concordances impressionistically; semantic theorists, AI-ers, and others have concentrated on a few interesting examples, e.g. bachelor, and have not given much thought to how the results might be scaled up.","With this concern in mind, it seems reasonable to ask how well these 65 lines for save...from fit in with all other uses of save A laborious concordance analysis was undertaken to answer this question. When it was nearing completion, we noticed that the tags that we were inventing to capture the generalizations could in most cases have been suggested by looking at the lexical items listed in the association ratio table for save. For example, we had failed to notice the significance of time adverbials in our analysis of save, and no dictionary records this. Yet it should be save X from Y (65 concordance lines) 1 save PERSON from Y (23 concordance lines) 1.1 save PERSON from BAD (19 concordance lines)","( Robert DeNiro ) to save Indian tribes(PERSON] from genocide[DESTRUCT[BAD]] at the hands of","\" We wanted to save","him(PERSON] ~orn undue ~ouble[BAD] and loss(BAD] of money , \" Murphy was sacrificed to save more powerful Democrats(PERSON] from harm(BAD] .","\" God sent this man to save my five children(PERSON] from being burned to death(DESTRUCT(BAD]] and Pope John Paul I] to \" save us(PERSON] fl~m sin(BAD] . \" 1.2 save PERSON from (BAD) LOC(AT1ON) (4 concordance lines) rescuers who helped save the toddler(PERSON] from an abandoned weU[LOC] will be feted with a parade while attempting to save two drowning hoys[PERSON] from a turbulent(BAD] creeklLOC] in Otdo[LOC] 2. save INST(ITUTION) from (ECON) BAD (27 concordance lines) member states to help save the EEC[INSTI from possible bankaxlptcy[BCON][BAD] this year. should be sought \" to save the compeny[CORP[1NST]] from bankmptfy[BCON][BAD].","law","was necessary","to","save the counffy[NATIOlq[lNST]] flora disaster(BAD].","operation \" to save","the nation(NATION(INS'r]] from COmmUnL~n[BAD][POL1TICAL] . were not needed to save the system from benkauptcy[ECON][BAD].","his efforts to save","the wodd[INST] from the like~ of Lothax and the Spider Woman 3. save ANIMAL from DESTRUCT(ION) (5 concordance lines) give them the money to save the dogs(ANIMAL] from being destroyed(DESTRUCT] , program intended to save the giant birds(ANIMAL] ~om extinction[DESTRUCTI, UNCLASSIFIED (10 concordance lines) walnut and ash tx~es to save them from the axes and saws of a logging company.","after the a~aek to save","the ship from a temble[BAD] fire, Navy reports concluded Thursday. cemficates that would save shopper~[pERSON] anywhere f~m $50[MONEY] [NUMBER] to $500[MONEY] (/flu Figure 2 Some AP 1987 Concordance Lines to \"save...from, \" Roughly Sorted into Categories. clear fi'om the association ratio table above that annually and month 6 are commonly found with save. More detailed inspection shows that the time adverbials correlate interestingly with just one group of save objects, namely those tagged [MONEY]. The AP wire is full of discussions of saving $1.2 billion per month; computational lexicography should measure and record such patterns if they are general, even when traditional dictionaries do not.","A,; another example illustrating how the association ratio tables would have helped us analyze the save concordance lines, we found ourselves contemplating the semantic tag ENV(IRONMENT) to analyze lines such as:","the trend to save the forests[ENV] it's our turn to save the lake[ENV], joined a fight to save their forests[ENV],","can we get busy to save the planet[ENV] ? If we had looked at the association ratio tables before labC.ing the 65 lines for save ... from, we might have noticed the very large value for save.., forests, suggesting that there may be an important pattern here. In fact, this pattern probably subsumes most of the occurrences of the \"save [ANIMAL]\" pattern noticed in Figure 2. Thus, these tables do not provide semantic tags, but they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needs to be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags.","It may be that everything said here about save and other words is true only of 1987 American journalese. Intuitively, however, many of the patterns discovered seem to be good candidates for conventions of general English. A future step would be to examine other more balanced corpora and test how well the patterns hold up. 9 CONCLUSIONS We began this paper with the psycholinguistic notion of word association norm, and extended that concept toward the information theoretic definition of mutual information. This provided a precise statistical calculation that could be applied to a very large corpus of text to produce a table of associations for tens of thousands of words. We were then able to show that the table encoded a number of very interesting patterns ranging from doctor.., nurse to save ....from. We finally concluded by showing how the patterns in the association ratio table might help a lexicographer organize a concordance.","In point of fact, we actually developed these results in basically the reverse order. Concordance analysis is still extremely labor-intensive and prone to errors of omission. The ways that concordances are sorted don't adequately support current lexicographic practice. Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as from or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines. In other words, they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense. This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distribu-28 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 Kenneth Church and Patrick Hanks Word Association Norms, Mutual Information, and Lexicography tional evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning. Thus, the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not address semantics (interpretation), even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values.","The triangulation approach requires \"art.\" How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are \"interesting\" and which are merely due to chance? The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure that is often a fairly good approximation to the \"art.\" Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity.","But on the other hand, the objective score can be mislead-ing. The score takes only distributional evidence into account. For example, the measure favors set ... for over set ... down; it doesn't know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional. In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church's parts program or Hindle's parser. Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the \"natural\" similarity between nouns such as picture and photograph. Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case, there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly beyond the objectivity of a computer.","Despite these problems, the association ratio could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather like an index to the concordances. It can help us decide what to look for; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep.

The last unclassified line .... save shoppers anywhere from $50... raises interesting problems. Syntactic \"chunking\" shows that, in spite of its co-occurrence of from with save, this line does not belong here. An intriguing exercise, given the lookup table we are trying to construct, is how to guard against false inferences such as that since shoppers is tagged [PERSON], $50 to $500 must here count as either BAD or a LOCATION. Accidental coincidences of this kind do not have a significant effect on the measure, however, although they do serve as a reminder of the probabilistic nature of the findings.","6. The word time itself also occurs significantly in the table, but on closer examination it is clear that this use of time (e.g. to save time) counts as something like a commodity or resource, not as part of a time adjunct.
