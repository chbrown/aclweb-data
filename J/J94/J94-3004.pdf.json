Introduction","paragraphs":["The essential step in historical reconstruction is the arrangement of related words in different languages into sets of cognates and the specification of the regular phonological correspondences that support that arrangement; the well-known means for carrying out this arrangement and specification is the comparative method (see, for example, Meillet 1966; Hoenigswald 1950, 1960; Watkins 1989; Baldi 1990). Words that are not demonstrably related (via regular sound change) are explained by reference to other diachronic processes that are beyond the scope of the comparative method and of this paper.

A word family might contain both native words and words borrowed from related languages; the borrowings may be recent or ancient. 2 RE is written in SPITBOL, a dialect of SNOBOL4.

It treats those words of the lexicon that fall into pile C in Figure 1 above (and to a lesser extent those that fall into pile E). It must be emphasized that the relative sizes of the piles in Figure 1 are completely arbitrary. It would not be unusual for the list of problems (H) to be the largest. Especially in cases where languages are in close contact or are only distantly related, the regular component of the lexicon may be expected to be quite small.","RE functions as a \"checker\" of hypotheses proposed by the linguist. It has no in-ferential component in the sense usually used in describing expert systems (Charniak & McDonald 1985). Our aim is to verify the internal consistency of a set of phonological correspondences, created beforehand by the linguist, against the lexicons of an ensemble of putatively related languages, and to gauge the extent to which those data are consistent with the given phonological and phonotactic descriptions (i.e. correspondences and syllable canon).","RE has several features that represent a significant advance in the automated handling of diachronic data. First, it provides exhaustive treatment of the data in several dimensions:","• It processes complete lexicons of modern languages. Every modern form is evaluated by the program in a consistent and complete way.","• Each form is completely analyzed. Modern forms that are only partially regular are not included in cognate sets.","• The correspondences and syllable canon form a complete and unified statement of the diachronic phonology of the languages treated. Second, RE contains a number of features that make it flexible in handling the kinds of data realistically encountered in historical research.","• Provisions exist for allowing several different transcriptions to be used in representing the data.","• There are no requirements that the data be organized beforehand by gloss, semantic field, phonological shape, or other criteria.","• The size and type of constituents used in the analysis are not limited by the program. There is no requirement, for example, that a segmental analysis be used (as opposed to the initial-plus-rhyme-plus-tone analysis commonly used for many Asian languages, for example). However, the program does not provide for nonlinear representations or discontinuous constituents: the \"absolute slicing hypothesis\" is assumed. Also, the linearization of constituents must be the same for all the language data used by the program. For example, the tone numbers used in the languages cited in this paper, which might equally well be ordered before as after the segmental strings to which they apply, are uniformly written at the beginning.","• Several competing analyses of the same data can be managed and compared simultaneously.","The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces some terminology, explains some particulars of the group of Tibeto-Burman languages used in 383 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 examples, and describes RE in broad strokes to motivate and provide context for subsequent discussion. Section 3 reviews some of the past work in the area of computational historical linguistics, especially as it relates to the current effort. Section 4 details the algorithms and data structures used in RE. Section 5 discusses the results obtained using RE and comments on practical and methodological limitations to this approach. Section 6 discusses extensions to the \"core\" functions of RE: the handling of imprecise data, the treatment of variation due to diachronic and synchronic processes, the ad hoc semantic system for disambiguating homophones at both the modern and proto levels, and semi-automatic methods for generalizing over sets of phonological rules. Section 7, the conclusion, offers some caveats about computer applications in the area of historical linguistics and invites collaboration on more comprehensive software of this type. 2.

The reconstructed ancestor, Proto Tamang-Gurung-Thakali-Manang, is abbreviated *TGTM. Four modern tones (numbered 1 to 4) are recognized in the modern languages and two proto-tone categories (labelled A and B) are reconstructed. The tones of both reconstructed and daughter forms are transcribed before the syllable, e.g. Abap. The eight dialects used are discussed in detail by Mazaudon (1978). The dialects and their abbreviations are (as cited in columns 5 to 12 of the Table of Correspondences in Figure 9a): Risiangku (ris), Sahu (sahu), Taglung (tag), Tukche (tuk), Marpha (mar), Syang (syang), Ghachok (gha), and Prakaa (pra). 2.2 Synopsis of the Reconstruction Engine RE implements (i) a set of algorithms that generate possible reconstructions given word forms in modern languages (and vice versa as well) and (ii) a set of algorithms that arrange input modern forms into possible cognate sets based on those reconstructions.

Previous Research in Computational Historical Linguistics In order to provide some context for a discussion of our efforts, we first present a brief discussion of the computational approaches to the study of sound change and review some of the software developed (see also Hewson 1989).","Applications of computers to problems in historical linguistics fall into two distinct categories: those based on numerical techniques, usually relying on methods of statistical inference; and those based on combinatorial techniques, usually implementing some type of rule-driven apparatus specifying the possible diachronic development 4 In fact, the situation is slightly more complicated than is shown here: there are two other possible reconstructions and another possible cognate set that are not shown because of space considerations.

The major features of a few of these programs are reviewed briefly below. The programs discussed by no means exhaust the field; the criteria for selecting them is that they have been described in the literature sufficiently for an evaluation, and that for this reason they have come to the attention of the authors. Indeed, the literature in this field is fragmented: starting in the 1960s and 1970s a sizable literature on the lexicostatistic properties of language change developed following Swadesh's earlier glottochronological studies (for example, Swadesh 1950). On the other hand, only a handful of attempts to produce and evaluate software of the rule-application type (for use in historical linguistics) are documented in the literature (Becker 1982; Brandon 1984; Durham & Rogers 1971; Frantz 1970; Kemp 1976). In general these programs seem to have been abandoned after a certain amount of experimentation. Certainly the problem of articulating a set of algorithms and associated data sets that completely describe the regular sound changes evidenced by a group of languages is a daunting task.","To the first class belong lexicostatistic models of language change. The COMPASS module of the WORDSURV program described below belongs to this class (cf. Wimbish 1989). It measures degree of affiliation using a distance metric based on the degree of similarity between corresponding phonemes in different languages. Also to this class belong applications that measure genetic affiliation as a function of the number of shared words in a selected vocabulary set. Any method that depends on counting \"shared words,\" we note, assumes the existence and prior application of a means of determining which forms are cognate; and any such estimates of the relatedness of languages are only as good as the metric that determines which ones are cognate. 387 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 Language C1 C2 C3 C4 Reflex Gloss Fox p lak ~ m poohke~amwa 'he cuts it open' Cree p sk s m pooskosam 'he cuts it open' Menomini ....

Examples of programs of this sort are PHONO, being applied to Latin-to-Spanish data (and described below); VARBRUL (by Susan Pintzuk) used to analyze Old English, and two programs used to analyze Romance languages: Iberochange, based on a rule-processing subsystem called BETA, used for lbero-Romance languages (Eastlack 1977) and one unnamed (Burton-Hunter 1976)."]},{"title":"3.1 Hewson's Proto-Algonkian Experiment","paragraphs":["The \"proto-projection\" techniques used by RE were implemented earlier by John Hewson and others at the Memorial University of Newfoundland (Hewson 1973, 1974). 5 The strategy is transparent; as Hewson notes, he and his team decided to \"follow the basic logic used by the linguist in the comparative method\" (Hewson 1974:193). The results of this research have recently been published in the form of an etymological dictionary of Proto-Algonkian (Hewson 1993).","The program as first envisioned was to operate on \"consonant only\" transcriptions of polysyllabic morphemes from four Amerindian languages. The program would take a modern form, \"project it backwards\" into one or more proto-projections, then project these proto-projections into the next daughter language, deriving the expected regular reflexes. The lexicon for this language would be checked for these predicted reflexes; if found, the program would repeat the projection process, zig-zagging back and forth in time until all reflexes were found. For example, given Fox/poohke~amwa/he cuts it open, the program would match the correct Cree form, as indicated in Figure 5.","There were problems with this approach. In cases where no reflex could be found (as in Figure 5, where no Menomini cognates for this form existed in the database), the process would grind to a halt. Recognizing that \"the end result of such a programme would be almost nil\" (Hewson 1973:266), the team developed another approach in which the program generated all possible proto-projections for the 3,403 modern forms. These 74,049 reconstructions were sorted together, and 'only those that showed identical proto-projections in another language' (some 1,305 items) were retained for further examination. At this point Hewson claimed that he and his colleagues were then able to quickly identify some 250 new cognate sets (Hewson 1974:195). The vowels were added back into the forms, and from this a final list of cognate sets was created. A cognate set from this file, consisting of a reconstruction and two supporting forms, is reproduced below (Figure 6). 5 The authors of RE developed this technique independently and later discovered this methodologically similar computer project on Proto-Algonkian. 388 Lowe and Mazaudon The Reconstruction Engine Language Form Gloss Protomorpheme * (ProtoAlg.)

One of these tools, the COMPASS module of WORDSURV, allows linguists to compare and analyze word lists from different languages and to perform phonostatistic analysis. To do so, the linguist first enters \"survey data\" into the program; reflexes are arranged together by gloss, as illustrated in the reproduction in Figure 7.","In addition to the a priori semantic grouping of reflexes by gloss, the linguist must also re-transcribe the data in such a way that each constituent of a reflex is a single character, that is, \"no digraphs are allowed. Single unique characters must be used to represent what might normally be represented by digraphs.., e.g. N for ng.\" (Wimbish 1989:43). The program also requires that part of the diachronic analysis be carried out before entering the data into the computer in order to incorporate that analysis into the data. For example, when the linguist hypothesizes that \"a process of sound change has caused a phone to be lost (or inserted), a space must be inserted to hold its place in the forms in which it has been deleted (or not been inserted)\" (Wimbish 1989:43). That is, the zero constituent must be represented in the data itself. The program also contains a \"provision for metathesis .... Enter the symbols > n (where n is a one- or two-digit"]},{"title":"(1) (2) (3) (4)","paragraphs":["Group Reflex Lan@ua~e Abbreviation 0 R A A A B C C C D D -- no entry -- fader fater padre area a~)a --"]},{"title":"hapa da","paragraphs":["tataN tatay >4 E G S iT MPB I h at) Figure 7 \"Properly aligned word forms\" for FATHER in WORDSURV (Wimbish 1989:43). 389 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 number) after a word to inform WORDSURV that metathesis has occurred with the nth character and the one to its right\" (Wimbish 1989:43). An example of this may be seen in column 3 of Figure 7. To represent tone, the author notes that \"there are at least two solutions. The first is to use a number for each tone (for example lma3na). The second solution is to use one of the vowel characters with an accent .... The two methods will produce different results\" when the analysis is performed (Wimbish 1989:44). While the last statement may surprise some strict empiricists (after all, the same data should give the same results under an identical analysis), it should come as no surprise to linguists who recognize that the selection of unit size, the type of constituency, and other problems of representation may have a dramatic effect on conclusions. RE is distinguished from this program in that (i) no a priori grouping of forms by gloss is required (a step that is fraught with methodological problems inasmuch as it requires the linguist to decide a priori which forms might be related), (ii) no alignment of segments is required (also a problematic step for a number of reasons), and (iii) the constituent inventory is not limited to segments. In passing, the lexicostatistics that are computed are based on the \"Manhattan distance\" (in a universal feature matrix) between corresponding phonemes from different languages as a measure of their affiliation. The validity of this measure for establishing genetic affiliation is suspect: corresponding phonemes may be quite different in terms of their phonological features without altering the strength of the correspondence or the closeness of the genetic affiliation. Also, the metrics of feature spaces are notoriously hard to quantify, so any distance measures are themselves likely to be unreliable. RE computes no such statistics, though some tools (described below) that might be used in subgrouping do exist. 3.3 DOC: Chinese Dialect Dictionary on Computer DOC is one of the earliest projects to attempt a comprehensive treatment of the lexicons of a group of related languages. DOG was developed \"for certain problems [in which] the linguist finds it necessary to organize large amounts of data, or to perform rather involved logical tasks--such as checking out a body of rules with intricate ordering relations.\" (Wang 1970:57). A sample dialect record (in one of the original formats) is illustrated in Figure 8. Note that as in the case of WORDSURV, the data must be pre-segmented according to a universal phonotactic description (in this case the Chinese syllable canon) that the program is built to handle. The one-byte-one-constituent restriction does not exist, though the (maximum) size of constituents is fixed with the data structure.","At least four versions of this database and associated software were produced (Cheng 1993:13). Originally processed as a punched-card file on a LINC-8, the program underwent several metamorphoses. An intelligent front-end was developed in Clipper (a microcomputer-based database management system) that allows the user to perform faceted queries (i.e. multiple keyterm searches) against the database. The database is available as a text file (slightly over one megabyte) containing forms in 17 dialects for some 2,961 Chinese characters (Cheng 1993:12). DOG has no \"active\" component: it is a database of phonologically analyzed lexemes organized for effective retrieval. 3.4 Phono: A Program for Testing Models of Sound Change PHONO (Hartman 1981, 1993) is a DOS program that applies ordered sets of phonological rules to input forms. The rules are expressed by the user in a notation composed of if-then clauses that refer to feature values and locations in the word. PHONO converts input strings (words in the ancestor language) into their equivalent feature matrices using a table of alphabetic characters and feature values supplied by the user. The program then manipulates the feature matrices according to the rules, converting the 390 Lowe and Mazaudon The Reconstruction Engine Dialect Tone Initial Medial Nucleus Endinq","0052 192 - 3 L HI KN 7 PEZ]iXY3 3 L U A N XI-AN 3 L U A Z TAI -YUAN 3 L U A Z HAN-KCU 3 L U ~E Z CHEkE--UJ 3 L A N YA~SHCU 3 L U O Z WEN-ZHO 3B L U 03 CHAGV~SHA 3B N 0 Z Figure 8 A dialect record in DOC (cited from Figure 7 in Wang [1970]). matrices back into strings for output. Hartman has developed a detailed set of rules that derive Spanish from Proto-Romance. Besides allowing the expression of diachronic rules in terms of features, facilities are included to handle metathesis. Unlike RE, which handles only one step (at a time) in the development of multiple languages, PHONO traces the history of the words of a single language through multiple stages. 4. Description of Data Structures and Algorithms We turn now to RE, which represents another step in the application of computational techniques to the problems faced by historical linguists. As will become clear, any computational tools designed to be used by historical linguists must be able to operate in the face of considerable uncertainty. In the course of carrying out a diachronic analysis the linguist is likely to have several competing hypotheses that might explain the observed variation. Data from many sources, varying in quality and transcription, will be compared. The research will proceed incrementally, both in terms of the portions of the lexicons and phonologies treated and in the number of languages or dialects included. RE as a tool helps with only a portion of this task, the problem of creating and maintaining regular cognate sets and the reconstructions that accompany them. 4.1 Principal Data Structures: The Table and the Canon Two data structures (internal to the program) are relevant to the phonological reconstruction, and these are passed as arguments to RE. The first is a Table of Correspondences (Fig. 9a) representing the linguist's hypothesis about the development of the languages being treated. The columns of the table are (1) a correspondence set number, uniquely identifying the correspondence; (2) the distribution of the correspondence within the syllable structure (i.e. the type of syllable constituent: in this case, Tone, Initial, Liquid, Glide, Onset, Rhyme, Vowel, or Final); (3) the PROTOCONSTITUENT itself; (4) the phonological context (if any) to which the correspondence is limited; (5-12) the OUTCOME or reflex of the protoconstituent in the daughter languages. 6 The 6 The term reflex will be reserved for describing a complete modern form that is the regular descendant of some protoform. Outcome will be used for the regular descendent of a protoconstituent. 391 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) N ConT * con~xt 1 T A /_Cv 1 3 T A /_eva ... 93 I k 94 I k /_w 181 F k ,.. 142 L r /p,ph,b_ 169 0 r 102 0 kr /_e: 103 0 kr /u 104 0 kr /_a 105 0 kr /_a t 106 0 kr 31 R,V a 186 V a /_p (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) ris s~'~hu tag tuk mar svang mha ora i X H I IjH 1 H 1 i H i 1 3 X~ L 3 3 3 3 3 L 3 3 k k k k k k k k k ~ h k k k k k r r r r r r r 1-=r r r r r r r r r k k k ~ k k kr kr kr kr h t k k kr kr kr kr hw t kj kj kr kr kr kr h ~ kj kj kr kr kr kr h t k k kr kr O. 8. ~.

Thus, the outcomes for a final/k/(correspondence 181) and an initial/k/(correspondence 93) are never confused by the program. The program takes the syllable canon as an 392 Lowe and Mazaudon The Reconstruction Engine argument expressing the adjacency constraints on the constituents found in the table. For example, the canon for *TGTM, illustrated in Figure 9b, has three slots, each of which has its own substructure: first, a tone (optional, as indicated by the possibility of a zero element); followed by an (also optional) initial element consisting of various combinations of Onset, Glide, Initial, and Liquid; and terminating with either a Rhyme element or a Vowel plus Final consonant. A syllable is composed of zero or more elements from each of these slots. Picking the longest possible combination from each slot produces the maximal syllable permitted by the canon containing six constituents (TILGVF), one from each constituent type except O and R. Similarly, the minimal one has only one constituent (R). Parentheses indicate optional elements and brackets separate sequential slots in the syllable structure.","This description, a type of regular expression, provides a shorthand device for expressing several possible syllable structure trees. Indeed, the Proto-Tamang Syllable Canon is quite complex in this respect, because several hypotheses about syllable structure are encoded in it. For other languages, in which only consonant and vowel need be distinguished in describing syllable structure, a simpler canon (e.g. CV(C)) might suffice. Polysyllabic syllable canons can be expressed and used by the canon in two ways:","• Explicitly, for example [CV(C)][CV, O] a bisyllabic canon in which the minimal form is CV and the maximal is CVCCV. As a recursive application of a single syllable. This is done via a software toggle that allows the canon structure to be repeatedly mapped over an input form. For example, if the polysyllable toggle is turned on, the canon [(C)V(C)] would match forms of the form V, CVC, CVCCV, CVCVCVV, etc."]},{"title":"4.2 Algorithms","paragraphs":["4.2.1 Generating Proto-Projections. Given a form, three steps are required to project or transform a modern form into a set of possible reconstructions or vice versa: (i) tokenizing the given form into a list of row numbers in the table of correspondences (column 1 of Figure 9a), (ii) filtering the tokenized forms according to syllabic and phonological constraints, and (iii) substituting the actual outcomes in the Table of Correspondences for the tokens. Tokenization. On a first recursive pass RE generates (recursively from the left of the input form) all possible segmentations of the form. That is, starting from the left, the program divides the form into two, and then repeats the process on the right-hand part until the end of the form is reached. Essentially, this algorithm implements a standard solution to a standard problem, that of finding all parses of an input form given a regular expression (encoded in this case in the syllable canon and table). As the segmentation tree is created, the program checks to see that the node being built is actually specified as an element of the Table of Correspondences and thus avoids building branches of the tree that cannot produce outcomes (according to the Table of Correspondences). The pseudocode in Figure 10 outlines the algorithm.

The process is illustrated in Figure 16. Note that forms that fail to produce any reconstructions are saved in a residue file for further analysis. In the example below (Figure 16), we see that a Nepali loan word, Tukche/2gar/ house, failed to produce any reconstructions in the proto-language, because there exists a phonological subsystem for Nepali loans in Tukche that does not conform to the phonology of native words (i.e. the phonology described by the Table of Correspondences). In particular, no voiced initials have survived in Tukche. In other cases, forms collected :in the check files may indicate a mistake in the Table of Correspondences, which needs to be corrected to allow the word to reconstruct successfully.

However, there is a certain amount of redundancy and uncertainty in the rules that tends to result in several possible reconstructions for the same cognate set.

We will examine some of the implications of this situation. 5.1 Many Reconstructions May Be Possible for a Given Set of Cognates The process of \"triangulation\" (discussed in Section 4.2.3 and in some detail in Lowe and Mazaudon [1989, 1990] and Mazaudon and Lowe [1991]) provides a means for"]},{"title":"11","paragraphs":["Merger"]},{"title":"refers to the diachronic process by which the distinction between two (or more) phonemes is lost.

If it were possible a priori to determine which reflexes might fall together based on the correspondences, it would be possible to preserve just those reconstructions from which all the reflexes might descend (and discard the other reconstructions). This situation is the one illustrated with the words for snow in Figure 13. However, when entire lexicons are processed, it is not necessarily possible nor even desirable to attempt to partition the lexemes into comparable sets to begin with. It is necessary to generate all possibilities and later to eliminate the undesirable ones through a sort of competition. Using the number of supporting forms in a cognate set as the sole or primary criterion for keeping the set was found to be an inadequate heuristic: some perfectly good sets have only three members, while others with more members are shaky and in some cases simply wrong.","An example of this competition is illustrated in Figure 19 (another representation of the data presented in Figure 3). Here, as in the Bgli~ snow example (Figure 13), several different cognate sets composed of the same reflexes but having different reconstructions have been generated. The reflexes clearly fall together into the same overall cognate set, but the reconstruction of several of the forms is non-unique: the reconstruction *Abo: is supported by forms from Marpha and Syang, while *Abap is supported by all four languages. This cognate set, then, reflects a merger of several smaller sets, as indicated in the Venn diagram. The Risiangku form disambiguates the reconstructions, showing that *Abap should be recognized as the winning reconstruction (it is marked with the *; other reconstructions supported by various subsets of the reflexes are marked with !*). As an aside, this process of set conflation can only be accomplished once all the words in all the lexicons are processed. The problem then presented is a set-covering problem (one of the various kinds of NP-complete problems for which no fast or easy solution exists). In the case of our Tamang database, in which about 7,000 modern forms yield about 8,000 different reconstructions that have supporting forms from at least two languages, set conflation takes several hours on our 386-based machine. 5.2 Other Kinds of Competition for Reflexes A number of other types of overlapping can occur. And in general, the cognate sets of competing reconstructions do not nest as neatly as they do in the previous example. It is often the case that the cognate sets may merely overlap to some extent. These cases fall into several distinct classes:","First, there exist some overlapping sets in which neither set is a proper subset of the other; the reflexes fit semantically, so the problem is one of reconciling the recon-403 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 *AbLp/3.138.47. ris 3pLp beer-mLsh !*Abep13.138.26. pra 3pe beer-mLsh !~Abo=/3.138.61 mar 3po beer-m~sh sya~q ~po beer-mash *Abap/3.138.47. !*Ab op/3.138.26. !*Ab o :/3.138.61. mar Spo pra Spe ris 3pap syang"]},{"title":"~po","paragraphs":["beer-mash beer-mash beer-mash beer-mash Figure 19 Nested cognate sets. structions.

This explanation is based on knowledge of the language and an internal analysis of its phonology. At this time it is not clear what algorithm (if any) could be used to sort out cases like these.","A similar but more complicated situation can be seen in Figure 21. Here the free variation in vowel length generates additional possible reconstructions, and those dialects where final consonants have been lost permit the reconstruction of variants with a final stop as well. However, the form from the Risiangku dialect, which normally preserves finals, cannot reconstruct (according to the table) to either the short vowel or stopped rhyme, and so another cognate set supporting a long vowel reconstruction is created. 6. Extensions to RE The processing described above produces cognate sets that are often found wanting when examined. For example, homophones may be conflated in the same set though they can be derived from different etyma. Also, small irregularities in the data, which may be partially understood by the linguist, may cause forms to fail to reconstruct into the set in which they plausibly belong.

Using a computer to mechanically apply a set of rules to the data implies that we believe to a large extent in the regularity of sound change. But the comparative method itself implies such an assumption. This does not mean that we cannot also admit that \"each word has its own history,\" when we take into account competing trends or influences on the languages. This flexibility toward irregularity has been incorporated everywhere in the computing mechanism.","One example of this flexible approach is evident in examining the table of correspondences. Turning back to the table excerpt (Figure 9a), notice the presence of multiple outcomes separated by commas in the columns of modern outcomes (columns 5-12). These mean that we do not know yet what the regular outcome of a given change is. Question marks are also allowed, in which case the program can (with the proper switch settings) borrow the outcomes from adjacent languages. Neither of these conventions should remain in the table of correspondences when the analysis of the group of languages is completed. But, as a working tool, the table of correspondences tolerates them, and they do not hamper the functioning of RE. 6.3 \"Fuzzy\" Matching in the Table of Correspondences We can also reduce some of the specificity of the rules in the Table of Correspondences in a controlled way in order to produce \"allofam\" sets or \"irregular cognate\" sets. 16 Allofamy, the relationship between words in a word family, is described in more detail in Section 1,","especially in the footnote to Figure 1. 17 For example, English have and Latin hab~re. 409 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3"]},{"title":"TGTM X=A, B TGTM 8=k, k k, g TGTM 8R=kr, khr, gr TGTM GL =kl, khl, gl","paragraphs":["TGTM 8W =k-w, khw, qw TGTM"]},{"title":"6a =kj,k h j,gj","paragraphs":[".., TGTM P=p,pk,b TGTM PR=pr, pkr, br TGTM PL =pl, phl, bl TGTM PW=pw, pkw, bw"]},{"title":"Figure 26","paragraphs":["A \"Fuzzy file.\" These cognate sets are composed of reflexes that are irregular only by one or two features specified as parameters by the linguist.

Such analysis could be useful to produce a more refined characterization of the genetic relationship among the languages.","On one hand, the table could be analyzed to determine what traits the languages have in common. An example of this is shown in Figure 28. Here the correspondences have been re-analyzed to show cases in which languages share a common outcome and cases in which they differ. Where the outcome is the same, a '1' appears in that language's slot in column (2). If all or most of the columns have a '1,' we conclude that this type of change is universal (within this language group). Looking at the types of change that are universally shared, we further note that a generalization over a feature (in this case a devoicing rule) is possible. Such a generalization is the result of two levels of abstraction: bringing together all languages that have an outcome in common, and then comparing those outcomes at the level of phonological features. We hope to have the computer hunt through the table of correspondences attempting to make such generalizations. This would require that the algorithm be able to analyze table constituents at the feature level and to characterize the changes in proto and modern feature sets in some reasonable way. 411 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) Corr Languages: Proto N ° RSTTMSGP Se~rment Outrome v (138) IIiiiii0 *b > p (136) iiiiiiii *h > p (144) Iiiiiii0 *~ l > pl (143) iiiiiiii *bl > pl (132) iiiiiii0 *d > t (121) iiiiiiii *dz > ts (97) Iiiiiiii *g > k~ g"]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["Environment B_j,r A B A B A A etc ....

A pattern of innovation shared consistently by a subset of the languages but not by the rest may be evidence of close genetic relationship, continued contact, or typological similarity arising from some other source. As Figure 29 illustrates, the languages on the left side of the table (Risiangku, Sahu, and perhaps Taglung) seem to preserve final consonants better than the rest of the languages in the group.

Some method for handling cases where data is missing or inconsistent in some \"minor\" way must be developed. Should the assumption be that missing data supports a generalization, refutes it, or should it not affect the interpretation at all? It is unclear how to have the computer generalize intelligently. 6.4.2 On the Notions \"Rule\" and \"Correspondence.\" Elaboration of the relationship between the protolanguage and each of the daughter languages implies an item-by-item comparison of modern reflexes with their ancestors. A correspondence, in the strictest sense, reflects only an observed or even hypothesized relationship between modern constituents. It need not embody a claim about the exact features of the ancestor.","When correspondence sets are matched with a protosegment, as is the case in the table used by RE, each correspondence set can be viewed as a set of simultaneous rules. The three correspondence sets given in Figure 30a, for example, can be rewritten as a number of \"input-output\" type rules as expressed in Figure 30b. Note that these are not \"rules\" in the sense the word is used by generative linguists, where there is the implication of some kind of process or \"rewriting\" of material. One indication of this is that some of the rules in Figure 30b are of the form \"X remains X\" (see rules 181, 366, and 505). The status of such rules in a generative sense is suspect. However, in RE, as shown below, such rules have quite concrete implications.","Figure 31b illustrates what a \"feature bundle\" in RE looks like. To create this representation, the linguist provides a list of features, and specifies the set of constituents to which the feature applies (as exemplified in Figure 31a).","The feature sets represent a statement of the significant distinctions in each language; we note in passing that RE thus implements the notion that the phonemes of each language pattern in their own way, and that even though the same symbol may be used to transcribe words in different languages, this does not necessarily indicate that they share features in common.

This aspect of the program is the subject of ongoing research. 7. Conclusion While both the program and the results of its first application are incomplete, some conclusions are warranted. First, we have shown the validity of this approach by producing reasonable, defensible, and well-defined cognate sets using the program. Second, a concrete understanding of semantics and of morphological and phonological variation at the proto level, both quite external to the core phonological functions of the program and perhaps only available via the intuitions and experience of the linguist, are required to interpret the initial results of upstream computations. Finally, the combinatorial complexity of the reconstruction process and the potentially large linguistic data sets that might be treated make the problems of performance and data reduction computationally challenging. There is much room for work here applying techniques already developed in other areas of computational linguistics.","We have occasionally been asked why we have not developed software that would create tables of correspondences based on universal or at least subgroup-wide phonological principles of analysis and comparison. Such an algorithm has already been proposed by Martin Kay (Kay 1964). Our research has focused on evaluating existing hypotheses rather than the process of creating new ones. There is indeed much work that could be done here and we hope that the burgeoning interest in computational historical linguistics will lead to the investigation of this question.","Finally, we recognize that for these algorithms to be useful to other researchers in historical linguistics they must ultimately be implemented as part of a larger software 415 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 suite providing conventional (and standardized) database management functions and other computational linguistic tools; we have begun design of this software and invite collaboration from interested specialists.
