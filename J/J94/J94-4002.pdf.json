The relative contributions of the algorithm's components to its overall success rate in this blind test are examined. Experiments were conducted with an enhancement of the algorithm that contributes statistically modelled information concerning semantic and real-world relations to the algorithm's decision procedure. Interestingly, this enhancement only marginally improves the algorithm's performance (by 2%). The algorithm is compared with other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the search procedure of Hobbs'algorithm was implemented in the Slot Grammar framework and applied to the sentences in the blind test set. The authors\" algorithm achieves a higher rate of success (4%) than Hobbs' algorithm. The relation of the algorithm to the centering approach is discussed, as well as to models of anaphora resolution that invoke a variety of informational factors in ranking antecedent candidates. 1. Introduction We present an algorithm for identifying both intrasentential and intersentential antecedents of pronouns in text. We refer to this algorithm as RAP (Resolution of Anaphora Procedure). RAP applies to the syntactic structures of McCord's (1990, 1993, in press) Slot Grammar parser, and like the parser, it is implemented in Prolog. It relies on measures of salience derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state to select the antecedent noun phrase (NP) of a pronoun from a list of candidates. It does not employ semantic conditions (beyond those implicit in grammatical number and gender agreement) or real-world knowledge in evaluating candidate antecedents; nor does it model intentional or global discourse structure (as in Grosz and Sidner 1986). * School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, London WCIH OXG, UK.

The Anaphora Resolution Algorithm","paragraphs":["RAP contains the following main components.","• An intrasentential syntactic filter for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP on syntactic grounds (This filter is presented in Lappin and McCord 1990a.)","• A morphological filter for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP due to non-agreement of person, number, or gender features • A procedure for identifying pleonastic (semantically empty) pronouns","• An anaphor binding algorithm for identifying the possible antecedent binder of a lexical anaphor (reciprocal or reflexive pronoun) within the same sentence (This algorithm is presented in Lappin and McCord 1990b.)","• A procedure for assigning values to several salience parameters (grammatical role, parallelism of grammatical roles, frequency of mention, proximity, and sentence recency) for an NP. (Earlier versions of these procedures are presented in Leass and Schwall 1991.) This procedure employs a grammatical role hierarchy according to which the evaluation rules assign higher salience weights to (i) subject over non-subject NPs, (ii) direct objects over other complements, (iii) arguments of a verb over adjuncts and objects of prepositional phrase (PP) adjuncts of the verb, and (iv) head nouns over complements of head nouns. 1","• A procedure for identifying anaphorically linked NPs as an equivalence class for which a global salience value is computed as the sum of the salience values of its elements.","• A decision procedure for selecting the preferred element of a list of antecedent candidates for a pronoun. 1 This hierarchy is more or less identical to the NP accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977). Johnson (1977) uses a similar grammatical role hierarchy to specify a set of constraints on syntactic relations, including reflexive binding. Lappin (1985) employs it as a salience hierarchy to state a non-coreference constraint for pronouns. Guenthner and Lehmann (1983) use a similar salience ranking of grammatical roles to formulate rules of anaphora resolution. Centering approaches to anaphora resolution use similar hierarchies as well (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990). 536 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J. Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution 2.1 Some Preliminary Details RAP has been implemented for both ESG and GSG (English and German Slot Grammars); we will limit ourselves here to a discussion of the English version. The differences between the two versions are at present minimal, primarily owing to the fact that we have devoted most of our attention to analysis of English. As with Slot Grammar systems in general (McCord 1989b, 1993, in press), an architecture was adopted that \"factors out\" language-specific elements of the algorithm.","We have integrated RAP into McCord's (1989a, 1989b) Logic-Based Machine Translation System (LMT). (We are grateful to Michael McCord and Ullrike Schwall for their help in implementing this integration.) When the algorithm identifies the antecedent of a pronoun in the source language, the agreement features of the head of the NP corresponding to the antecedent in the target language are used to generate the pronoun in the target language. Thus, for example, neuter third person pronouns in English are mapped into pronouns with the correct gender feature in German, in which inanimate nouns are marked for gender.","RAP operates primarily on a clausal representation of the Slot Grammar analysis of the current sentence in a text (McCord et al. 1992). The clausal representation consists of a set of Prolog unit clauses that provide information on the head-argument and head-adjunct relations of the phrase structure that the Slot Grammar assigns to a sentence (phrase). Clausal representations of the previous four sentences in the text are retained in the Prolog workspace. The discourse representation used by our algorithm consists of these clausal representations, together with additional unit clauses declaring discourse referents evoked by NPs in the text and specifying anaphoric links among discourse referents. 2 All information pertaining to a discourse referent or its evoking NP is accessed via an identifier (ID), a Prolog term containing two integers. The first integer identifies the sentence in which the evoking NP occurs, with the sentences in a text being numbered consecutively. The second integer indicates the position of the NP's head word in the sentence. 2.1.1 The Syntactic Filter on Pronoun-NP Coreference.

Other than sentence recency, the factors used in RAP differ from Alshawi's and are more specific to the task of pronominal anaphora resolution. Alshawi's framework is designed to deal with a broad class of language interpretation problems, including reference resolution, word sense disambiguation, and the interpretation of implicit relations. While Alshawi does propose emphasis factors for memory entities that are \"referents for noun phrases playing syntactic roles regarded as foregrounding the referent\" (Alshawi 1987, p. 17), only topics of sentences in the passive voice and the agents of certain be clauses receive such emphasis in his system.

We treat the antecedent-anaphor relation in much the same way as the \"equality\" condition of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981), as in u---y. This indicates that the discourse referent u, evoked by an anaphoric NP, is anaphorically linked to a previously introduced discourse referent y. To avoid confusion with 5 The specific values of the weights are arbitrary. The significance of the weighting procedure is in the comparative relations among the factors as defined by the weights. We have determined the efficacy of this relational structure of salience factors (and refined it) experimentally (see Section 4.2). 541 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 mathematical equality (which, unlike the relation discussed here, is symmetric), we represent the relation between an anaphor u and its antecedent y by y antecedes u. Two discourse referents u and y are said to be co-referential, 6 written as coref(u~y) if any of the following holds: • y antecedes u • u antecedes y • z antecedes u for some discourse referent z and coref(z.y) • z antecedes y for some z and coref(z.u) Also, coref(u,u) is true for any discourse referent u. The coref relation defines equivalence classes of discourse referents, with all discourse referents in an \"anaphoric chain\" forming one class: equiv(u) = {y I coref(u,y)}","Each equivalence class of discourse referents (some of which consist of only one member) has a salience weight associated with it. This weight is the sum of the current weight of all salience factors in whose scope at least one member of the equivalence class lies.","Equivalence classes, along with the sentence recency factor and the salience degradation mechanism, constitute a dynamic system for computing the relative attentional prominence of denotational NPs in text. 2.2 The Resolution Procedure RAP's procedure for identifying antecedents of pronouns is as follows. . . a. b.

Apply salience factors to the discourse referents evoked in the previous step as appropriate. Apply the syntactic filter and reflexive binding algorithm (first phase). 6 We have not attempted to distinguish among various types of anaphoric relations between discourse referents. Our use of \"coreference\" is in the spirit of Sidner's (1981) \"co-specification\" and Webber's (1988) \"referencem.\" 542 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J.

This list contains the pronoun-NP pairs in the sentence for which coreference can be ruled out on syntactic grounds (using the conditions stated above).

Each lexical anaphor is paired with all of its possible antecedent binders. If any non-pleonastic pronouns are present in the current sentence, attempt to identify their antecedents. Resolution is attempted in the order of pronoun occurrence in the sentence.","In the case of lexical anaphors (reflexive or reciprocal pronouns), the possible antecedent binders were identified by the anaphor binding algorithm. If more than one candidate was found, the one with the highest salience weight was chosen (see second example of Section 3.1).","In the case of third person pronouns, resolution proceeds as follows:","1. A list of possible antecedent candidates is created. It contains the most recent discourse referent of each equivalence class.

If a candidate follows the pronoun, its salience weight is reduced substantially (i.e., cataphora is strongly penalized).","b. If a candidate fills the same slot as the pronoun, its weight is increased slightly (i.e., parallelism of grammatical roles is rewarded). It is important to note that, unlike the salience factors described in Section 2.1.4, these modifications of the salience weights of candidates are local to the the resolution of a particular pronoun.","2.

First, it applies a powerful syntactic and morphological filter to lists of pronoun-NP pairs to reduce the set of possible NP antecedents for each pronoun. Second, NP salience measures are specified largely in terms of syntactic properties and relations (as well as frequency of occurrence). These include a hierarchy of grammatical roles, level of phrasal embedding, and parallelism of grammatical role. Semantic constraints and real-world knowledge play no role in filtering or salience ranking. Third, proximity of an NP relative to a pronoun is used to select an antecedent in cases in which several candidates have equal salience weighting. Fourth, intrasentential antecedents are preferred to intersentential candidates. This preference is achieved by three mechanisms: • An additional salience value is assigned to NPs in the current sentence.","• The salience values of antecedent candidates in preceding sentences are progressively degraded relative to the salience values of NPs in the current sentence.","• Proximity is used to resolve ties among antecedent candidates with equal salience values. The fifth property which we note is that anaphora is strongly preferred to cataphora. 544 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J. Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution 3. Examples of RAP's Output RAP generates the list of non-coreferential pronoun-NP pairs for the current sentence, the list of pleonastic pronouns, if any, in the current sentence, the list of possible antecedent NP-lexical anaphor pairs, if any, for the current sentence, and the list of pronoun-antecedent NP pairs that it has identified, for which antecedents may appear in preceding sentences in the text. Each NP appearing in any of the first three lists is represented by its lexical head followed by the integer that corresponds to its position in the sequence of tokens in the input string of the current sentence.

A much larger value (175) was found to be necessary for the cataphora penalty. The final results that we obtained for the training corpus are given in Table 2.","Interestingly, the syntactic-morphological filter reduces the set of possible antecedents to a single NP, or identifies the pronoun as pleonastic in 163 of the 475 cases (34%) that the algorithm resolves correctly. 11 It significantly restricts the size of the candidate list in most of the other cases, in which the antecedent is selected on the basis of salience ranking and proximity. This indicates the importance of a powerful syntactic-morphological filtering component in an anaphora resolution system.","We then performed a blind test of RAP on a test set of 345 sentences randomly selected from a corpus of 48 computer manuals containing 1.25 million words. 12 The results which we obtained for the test corpus (without any further modifications of RAP) are given in Table 3.13","This blind test provides the basis for a comparative evaluation of RAP and Dagan's","• 9 These sentences and those used in the blind test were edited slightly to overcome parse inaccuracies.

We will discuss the blind test in greater detail in the following sections. 4.1 Limitations of the Current Algorithm Several classes of errors that RAP makes are worthy of discussion. The first occurs with many cases of intersentential anaphora, such as the following: This green indicator is lit when the controller is on. It shows that the DC power supply voltages are at the correct levels. Morphological and syntactic filtering exclude all possible intrasentential candidates. Because the level of sentential embedding does not contribute to RAP's salience weighting mechanism, indicator.(1.3) and controller.(1.8) are ranked equally, since both are subjects. RAP then erroneously chooses controller.(1.8) as the antecedent, since it is closer to the pronoun than the other candidate.","The next class of errors involves antecedents that receive a low salience weighting owing to the fact that the evoking NP is embedded in a matrix NP or is in another structurally nonprominent position (such as object of an adverbial PP). The users you enroll may not necessarily be new to the system and may already have a user profile and a system distribution directory entry. &ofc. checks for the existence of these objects and only creates them as necessary. Despite the general preference for intrasentential candidates, user.(1.2) is selected as the antecedent, since the only factor contributing to the salience weight of object.(2.8) is sentence recency. Selectional restrictions or statistically measured lexical preferences (see Section 5) could clearly help in at least some of these cases.","In another class of cases, RAP fails because semantic/pragmatic information is required to identify the correct antecedent.","conditions. 13 Proper resolution was determined by a consensus of three opinions, including that of the first author. 550 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J.

We present the results in Table 4 and discuss their significance.","Ten variants are presented in Table 4; they are as follows: I \"standard\" RAP (as used in the blind test) II parallelism reward deactivated III non-adverbial and head emphasis deactivated IV matrix emphasis used instead of non-adverbial emphasis V cataphora penalty deactivated","VI subject, existential, accusative, and indirect object/oblique complement emphasis (i.e., hierarchy of grammatical roles) deactivated VII equivalence classes deactivated VIII sentence recency and salience degradation deactivated IX all \"structural\" salience weighting deactivated (II +III + V + VI) X all salience weighting and degradation deactivated","The single most important element of the salience weighting mechanism is the recency preference (sentence recency factor and salience degradation; see VIII). This is not surprising, given the relative scarcity of intersentential anaphora in our test corpus (less than 20% of the pronoun occurrences had antecedents in the preceding sentence). Deactivating the equivalence class mechanism also led to a significant deterioration in RAP's performance; in this variant (VII), only the salience factors applying to a 551 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 particular NP contribute to its salience weight, without any contribution from other anaphorically linked NPs. The performance of the syntactic filter is degraded some-what in this variant as well, since NPs that are anaphorically linked to an NP fulfilling the criteria for disjoint reference will no longer be rejected as antecedent candidates. The results for VII and VIII indicate that attentional state plays a significant role in pronominal anaphora resolution and that even a simple model of attentional state can be quite effective.","Deactivating the syntax-based elements of the salience weighting mechanism in-dividually led to relatively small deteriorations in the overall success rate (II, III, IV, V, and VI). Eliminating the hierarchy of grammatical roles (VI), for example, led to a deterioration of less than 4%. Despite the comparatively small degradation in performance that resulted from turning off these elements individually, their combined effect is quite significant, as the results of IX show. This suggests that the syntactic salience factors operate in a complex and highly interdependent manner for anaphora resolution.","X relies solely on syntactic/morphological filtering and proximity to choose an antecedent. Note that the sentence pairs of the blind test set were selected so that, for each pronoun occurrence, at least two antecedent candidates remained after syntactic/morphological filtering (see Section 5.1). In the 17 cases in which X correctly disagreed with RAP, the proper antecedent happened to be the most proximate candidate.","We suspect that RAP's overall success rate can be improved (perhaps by 5% or more) by refining its measures of structural salience. Other measures of embeddedness, or perhaps of \"distance\" between anaphor and candidate measured in terms of clausal and NP boundaries, may be more effective than the current mechanisms for non-adverbial and head emphasis. 14 Empirical studies of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora (ideally in accurately and uniformly parsed corpora) could be helpful in defining the most effective measures of structural salience. One might use such studies to obtain statistical data for determining the reliability of each proposed measure as a predictor of the antecedent-anaphor relation and the orthogonality (independence) of all proposed measures. 5. Salience and Statistically Measured Lexical Preference Dagan (1992) constructs a procedure, which he refers to as RAPSTAT, for using statistically measured lexical preference patterns to reevaluate RAP's salience rankings of antecedent candidates. RAPSTAT assigns a statistical score to each element of a candidate list that RAP generates; this score is intended to provide a measure (relative to a corpus) of the preference that lexical semantic/pragmatic factors impose upon the candidate as a possible antecedent for a given pronoun, is","14 Such a distance measure is reminiscent of Hobbs' (1978) tree search procedure. See Section 6.1 for a discussion of Hobbs' algorithm and its limitations. The results for IV confirm our suspicions from the training phase that matrix emphasis (rewarding NPs not contained in a subordinate clause) does not contribute significantly to successful resolution.","15 Assume that P is a non-pleonastic and non-reflexive pronoun in a sentence such that RAP generates the non-empty list L of antecedent candidates for P. Let H be the lexical head (generally a verb or a noun) of which P is an argument or an adjunct in the sentence. RAPSTAT computes a statistical score for each element Ci of L, on the basis of the frequency, in a corpus, with which Ci occurs in the same grammatical relation with H as P occurs with H in the sentence. The statistical score that RAPSTAT assigns to Ci is intended to model the probability of the event where Ci stands in the relevant grammatical relation to H, given the occurrence of Ci (but taken independently of the other elements of L). 552 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J. Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution","RAPSTAT reevaluates RAP's ranking of the elements of the antecedent candidate list L in a way that combines both the statistical scores and the salience values of the candidates. The elements of L appear in descending order of salience value. RAPSTAT processes L as follows. Initially, it considers the first two elements Cl and C2 of L. If (i) the difference in salience scores between C1 and C2 does not exceed a parametrically specified value (the salience difference threshold) and (ii) the statistical score of C2 is significantly greater than that of C1, then RAPSTAT will substitute the former for the latter as the currently preferred candidate. If conditions (i) and (ii) do not hold, RAPSTAT confirms RAP's selection of C1 as the preferred antecedent. If these conditions do hold, then RAPSTAT selects C2 as the currently preferred candidate and proceeds to compare it with the next element of L. It repeats this procedure for each successive pair of candidates in L until either (i) or (ii) fails or the list is completed. In either case, the last currently preferred candidate is selected as the antecedent.","An example of a case in which RAPSTAT overules RAP is the following. The Send Message display is shown, allowing you to enter your message and specify where it will be sent. The two top candidates in the list that RAP generates for it.(1.17) are display.(1.4) with a salience value of 345 and message.(1.13), which has a salience value of 315. In the corpus that we used for testing RAPSTAT, the verb-object pair"]},{"title":"send-display","paragraphs":["appears only once, whereas"]},{"title":"send-message","paragraphs":["occurs 289 times. As a result, message receives a considerably higher statistical score than display. The salience difference threshold that we used for the test is 100, and conditions (i) and (ii) hold for these two candidates. The difference between the salience value of message and the third element of the candidate list is greater than 100. Therefore, RAPSTAT correctly selects message as the antecedent of it. 5.1 A Blind Test of RAP and RAPSTAT Dagan et al. (in press) report a comparative blind test of RAP and RAPSTAT. To construct a database of grammatical relation counts for RAPSTAT, we applied the Slot Grammar parser to a corpus of 1.25 million words of text from 48 computer manuals. We automatically extracted all lexical tuples and recorded their frequencies in the parsed corpus. We then constructed a test set of pronouns by randomly selecting from the corpus sentences containing at least one non-pleonastic third person pronoun occurrence. For each such sentence in the set, we included the sentence that immediately precedes it in the text (when the preceding sentence does not contain a pronoun). 16 We filtered the test set so that for each pronoun occurrence in the set, (i) RAP generates a candidate list with at least two elements, (ii) the actual antecedent NP appears in the candidate list, and (iii) there is a total tuple frequency greater than 1 for the candidate See Dagan 1992 and Dagan et al. (in press) for a discussion of this lexical statistical approach to ranking antecedent candidates and possible alternatives.","16 In the interests of simplicity and uniformity, we discarded sentence pairs in which the first sentence contains a pronoun. We decided to limit the text preceding the sentence containing the pronoun to one sentence because we found that in the manuals which we used to tune the algorithm, almost all cases of intersentential anaphora involved an antecedent in the immediately preceding sentence. Moreover, the progressive decline in the salience values of antecedent candidates in previous sentences ensures that a candidate appearing in a sentence which is more than one sentence prior to the current one will be selected only if no candidates exist in either the current or the preceding sentence. As such cases are relatively rare in the type of text we studied, we limited our test set to textual units containing the current and the preceding sentence. 553 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 list (in most cases, it was considerably larger). ~7 The test set contains 345 sentence pairs with a total of 360 pronoun occurrences. The results of the blind test for RAP and RAPSTAT are as follows. TM","RAP RAPSTAT Total correct: 310 (86%) 319 (89%) Total decided: 360 (100%) 182 (51%) Correctly decided: 310 (86%) 144 (79%) RAPSTAT Disagrees with RAP: Correctly disagrees with RAP: Incorrectly disagrees with RAP: 41 (22% of cases decided) 25 (61%) 16 (39%) RAP/RAPSTAT Both wrong: Either RAP or RAPSTAT is correct: 22 (12%) 335 (93%)","When we further analyzed the results of the blind test, we found that RAPSTAT's success depends in large part on its use of salience information. If RAPSTAT's statistically based lexical preference scores are used as the only criterion for selecting an antecedent, the statistical selection procedure disagrees with RAP in 151 out of 338 instances. RAP is correct in 120 (79%) of these cases and the statistical decision in 31 (21%) of the cases. When salience is factored into RAPSTAT's decision procedure, the rate of disagreement between RAP and RAPSTAT declines sharply, and RAPSTAT's performance slightly surpasses that of RAP, yielding the results that we obtained in the blind test.","In general, RAPSTAT is a conservative statistical extension of RAP. It permits statistically measured lexical preference to overturn salience-based decisions only in cases in which the difference between the salience values of two candidates is small and the statistical preference for the less salient candidate is comparatively large. ~9 The comparative blind test indicates that incorporating statistical information on lexical preference patterns into a salience-based anaphora resolution procedure can yield a modest improvement in performance relative to a system that relies only on syntactic salience for antecedent selection. Our analysis of these results also shows that statistically measured lexical preference patterns alone provide a far less efficient basis for anaphora resolution than an algorithm based on syntactic and attentional measures of salience. 2°"]},{"title":"6. Comparison with Other Approaches to Anaphora Resolution","paragraphs":["We will briefly compare our algorithm with several other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been suggested.","17 In previous tests of RAP we found that it generates a candidate list that includes the correct antecedent of the pronoun in approximately 98% of the cases to which it applies.","18 We take RAPSTAT as deciding a case when it considers at least two candidates rather than deferring to RAP after the initial candidate because of a large salience difference between this candidate and the next one in the list. In cases in which RAPSTAT does not make an independent decision, it endorses RAP's selection. RAPSTAT's total success rate includes both sorts of cases.","19 John Justeson did the statistical analysis of the comparative blind test of RAP and RAPSTAT.

By contrast, RAP uses a multi-dimensional measure of salience that invokes a variety of syntactic properties specified in terms of the head-argument structures of Slot Grammar, as well as a model of attentional state.","Hobbs' tree search procedure selects the first candidate encountered by a left-right depth first search of the tree outside of a minimal path to the pronoun that satisfies certain configurational constraints. The algorithm chooses as the antecedent of a pronoun P the first NPi in the tree obtained by left-to-right breadth-first traversal of the branches to the left of the path T such that (i) T is the path from the NP dominating P to the first NP or S dominating this NP, (ii) T contains an NP or S node N that contains the NP dominating P, and (iii) N does not contain NPi.

The original formulation of the algorithm encodes syntactic constraints on pronominal anaphora in the definition of the domain to which the search for an antecedent NP applies.

Moreover, our Slot Grammar implementation of the algorithm gives it the full advantage of RAP's syntactic-morphological filter, which is more powerful than the configurational filter built into the original specification of the algorithm. Therefore, the test results provide a direct comparison of RAP's salience metric and Hobbs' search procedure.","Hobbs' algorithm was more successful than RAP in resolving intersentential anaphora (87% versus 74% correct). 21 Because intersentential anaphora is relatively rare in our corpus of computer manual texts and because RAP's success rate for intrasentential anaphora is higher than Hobbs' (89% versus 81%), RAP's overall success rate on the blind test set is 4% higher than that of our version of Hobbs' algorithm. This indicates that RAP's salience metric provides a more reliable basis for antecedent selection than Hobbs' search procedure for the text domain on which we tested both algorithms.","It is clear from the relatively high rate of agreement between RAP and Hobbs' algorithm on the test set (they agree in 83% of the cases) that there is a significant degree of convergence between salience as measured by RAP and the configurational prominence defined by Hobbs' search procedure. This is to be expected in English, in which grammatical roles are identified by means of phrase order. However, in languages in which grammatical roles are case marked and word order is relatively free, we expect that there will be greater divergence in the predictions of the two algorithms. The salience measures used by RAP have application to a wider class of languages than Hobbs' order-based search procedure. This procedure relies on a correspondence of grammatical roles and linear precedence relations that holds for a comparatively small class of languages. 6.2 Discourse Based Methods Most of the work in this area seeks to formulate general principles of discourse structure and interpretation and to integrate methods of anaphora resolution into a computational model of discourse interpretation (and sometimes of generation as well). Sidner (1981, 1983), Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1986), Grosz and Sidner (1986),","21 The difficulty that RAP encounters with such cases was discussed in Section 4.1. We are experimenting with refinements in RAP's scoring mechanism to improve its performance in these and other cases. 556 Shalom Lappin and Herbert J. Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), and Webber (1988) present different versions of this approach. Dynamic properties of discourse, especially coherence and focusing, are invoked as the primary basis for identifying antecedence candidates; selecting a candidate as the antecedent of a pronoun in discourse involves additional constraints of a syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic nature.","In developing our algorithm, we have not attempted to consider elements of discourse structure beyond the simple model of attentional state realized by equivalence classes of discourse referents, salience degradation, and the sentence recency salience factor. The results of our experiments with computer manual texts (see Section 4.2) indicate that, at least for certain text domains, relatively simple models of discourse structure can be quite useful in pronominal anaphora resolution. We suspect that many aspects of discourse models discussed in the literature will remain computationally intractable for quite some time, at least for broad-coverage systems.","A more extensive treatment of discourse structure would no doubt improve the performance of a structurally based algorithm such as RAP. At the very least, formatting information concerning paragraph and section boundaries, list elements, etc., should be taken into account. A treatment of definite NP resolution would also presumably lead to more accurate resolution of pronominal anaphora, since it would improve the reliability of the salience weighting mechanism.","However, some current discourse-based approaches to anaphora resolution assign too dominant a role to coherence and focus in antecedent selection. As a result, they establish a strong preference for intersentential over intrasentential anaphora resolution. This is the case with the anaphora resolution algorithm described by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987). This algorithm is based on the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1986). 22 Constraints and rules for centering are applied by the algorithm as part of the selection procedure for identifying the antecedents of pronouns in a discourse. The algorithm strongly prefers intersentential antecedents that preserve the center or maximize continuity in center change, to intrasentential antecedents that cause radical center shifts. This strong preference for intersentential antecedents is inappropriate for at least some text domains--in our corpus of computer manual texts, for example, we estimate that less than 20% of referentially used third person pronouns have intersentential antecedents. 23","There is a second difficulty with the Brennan et al. centering algorithm. It uses a hierarchy of grammatical roles quite similar to that of RAP, but this role hierarchy does not directly influence antecedent selection. Whereas th e hierarchy in RAP contributes to a multi-dimensional measure of the relative salience of all antecedent candidates, in Brennan et al. 1987, it is used only to constrain the choice of the backward-looking center,"]},{"title":"Cb,","paragraphs":["of an utterance.

On this view, the score of a candidate is a composite of several distinct scoring procedures, each of which reflects the prominence of the candidate with respect to a specific type of information or property. The systems described by Asher and Wada (1988), Carbonell and Brown (1988), and Rich and LuperFoy (1988) are examples of this mixed evaluation strategy.","In general, these systems use composite scoring procedures that assign a global rank to an antecedent candidate on the basis of the scores that it receives from several 24 Other factors, such as level of embedding, may also be considered in generating an ordering for the list of forward-looking centers.

Leass An Algorithm for Pronominal Anaphora Resolution evaluation metrics. Each such metric scores the likelihood of the candidate relative to a distinct informational factor. Thus, for example, Rich and LuperFoy (1988) propose a system that computes the global preference value of a candidate from the scores provided by a set of constraint source modules, in which each module invokes different sorts of conditions for ranking the antecedent candidate. The set of modules includes (among others) syntactic and morphological filters for checking agreement and syntactic conditions on disjoint reference, a procedure for applying semantic selection restrictions to a verb and its arguments, a component that uses contextual and real-world knowledge, and modules that represent both the local and global focus of discourse. The global ranking of an antecedent candidate is a function of the scores that it receives from each of the constraint source modules.","Our algorithm also uses a mixed evaluation strategy. We have taken inspiration from the discussions of scoring procedures in the works cited above, but we have avoided constraint sources involving complex inferencing mechanisms and real-world knowledge, typically required for evaluating the semantic/pragmatic suitability of antecedent candidates or for determining details of discourse structure. In general, it seems to us that reliable large scale modelling of real-world and contextual factors is beyond the capabilities of current computational systems. Even constructing a comprehensive, computationally viable system of semantic selection restrictions and an associated type hierarchy for a natural language is an exceedingly difficult problem, which, to our knowledge, has yet to be solved. Moreover, our experiments with statistically based lexical preference information casts doubt on the efficacy of relatively inexpensive (and superficial) methods for capturing semantic and pragmatic factors for purposes of anaphora resolution. Our results suggest that scoring procedures which rely primarily on tractable syntactic and attentional (recency) properties can yield a broad coverage anaphora resolution system that achieves a good level of performance. 7. Conclusion We have designed and implemented an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that employs measures of discourse salience derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state. We have performed a blind test of this algorithm on a substantial set of cases taken from a corpus of computer manual text and found it to provide good coverage for this set. It scored higher than a version of Hobbs' algorithm that we implemented for Slot Grammar.","Results of experiments with the test corpus show that the syntax-based elements of our salience weighting mechanism contribute in a complexly interdependent way to the overall effectiveness of the algorithm. The results also support the view that attentional state plays a significant role in pronominal anaphora resolution and demonstrate that even a simple model of attentional state can be quite effective.","The addition of statistically measured lexical preferences to the range of factors that the algorithm considers only marginally improved its performance on the blind test set. Analysis of the results indicates that lexical preference information can be useful in cases in which the syntactic salience ranking does not provide a clear decision among the top candidates, and there is a strong lexical preference for one of the less salient candidates.","The relatively high success rate of the algorithm suggests the viability of a computational model of anaphora resolution in which the relative salience of an NP in discourse is determined, in large part, by structural factors. In this model, semantic and real-world knowledge conditions apply to the output of an algorithm that resolves pronominal anaphora on the basis of syntactic measures of salience, recency, 559 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 and frequency of mention. These conditions are invoked only in cases in which salience does not provide a clear-cut decision and/or there is substantial semantic-pragmatic support for one of the less salient candidates. 27 Acknowledgments We would like to thank Martin Chodorow, Ido Dagan, John Justeson, Slava Katz, Michael McCord, Hubert Lehman, Amnon Ribak, Ulrike Schwall, and Marilyn Walker for helpful discussion of many of the ideas and proposals presented here.
