The basic idea is that each empty no& must be associated with a lexical item appearing in the input string, called its sponsor. A lexical item, as well as labeling the no&for the corresponding word, provides labels for a fixed number, possibly zero, of empty nodes. The number of nodes appearing in the parse tree is thus bounded before parsing begins. Termination follows trivially. The technique is applicable to any standard parsing algorithm. 1. Introduction One way of guaranteeing that a parsing algorithm will terminate is to ensure that each step consumes some finite amount of the input. There are two main situations in which this does not automatically occur, both arising from properties of the grammar. The first comes from nonbranching dominance chains of unbounded length. The second comes from empty nodes. Most modern grammars do not admit unbounded nonbranching chains, so that the problem of handling the phenomenon in parsing does not arise in practice. It is widely believed that these grammars also do not admit unbounded numbers of empty nodes. However, these generally constitute a problem in the design of parsing algorithms because the parser's domain of locality does not coincide with that of the constraints that govern their appearance.","This paper presents a proposal for constraining the appearance of empty nodes that is applicable to a wide variety of parsing strategies and linguistic theories, including many of those within the GB framework. Ideas like the ones to be presented here have been a part of other parsing systems, e.g., Fong (1991a, 1991b) and Millies (1991), and our notion of sponsorship, which we introduce below, can be viewed as a weak version of lexicalization in TAGs that is specifically focused on determining the distribution of empty nodes. The novelty of our approach lies principally in the identification of a single simple constraint as sufficient to ensure termination of the process. While its motivation is computational, its justification is primarily linguistic. The next section presents the problem that empty nodes pose for standard parsing techniques. Section 3 introduces the notion of sponsorship, and Section 4 discusses linguistic examples that demonstrate the role we see it playing. Section 5 shows how this proposal might be integrated into general parsing strategies. The conclusion summarizes what has been achieved, suggests avenues for further development, and draws parallels with some different approaches. * Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, Box 1978, Brown University, Providence, RI.

The Problem with Empty Nodes The empty-node problem arises for the following reason. Given a parsing scheme with a standard notion of locality, there is no limit on the number of empty nodes that it might be necessary to posit before a configuration emerges in which the constraints governing the appearance of any of them can be verified.","We claim that most standard parsing algorithms will face difficulties in constraining the appearance of empty nodes in structures like the one in Figure 1.","A bottom-up parser would have to consider the possibility that every V' should be combined with a following empty NP, like the upper V' in Figure 1, to form another V', which could then be treated in like manner. If the subcategorization frame of the V head were available, it could be used to bound the number of V r nodes posited. But, in a structure involving verb movement, the head of the V chain is only integrated onto the structure after all of the V' nodes have been constructed, so its subcategorization frame is not available when the V ~ nodes are constructed. Similarly, the head of the NP chain is integrated too late to constrain the positing of V' nodes.","A top-down parser would fare no better because the example is a classic case of left recursion. It might be argued that a top-down parser would have encountered the I head of the V chain before beginning to construct the V' nodes and could therefore use its subcategorization frame to determine how many to construct. However, this would require an analysis of the grammar that is beyond the scope of standard parsing procedures. Notice that the V trace from which the subcategorization frame is projected is incorporated into the structure only after all the of V ~ nodes have been constructed. Finally, the number of VP nodes is not determined by the subcategorization frame. No amount of grammar analysis will allow a top-down parser to predict the number of adjuncts attached to VP.","A head-first parser (Kay 1989; van Noord 1993) seems best adapted to the treatment of empty nodes. This mixed parsing strategy in effect predicts a head top-down and builds its complements and specifiers bottom-up. The trace of the verb would be identified immediately after the I gave had been recognized, since that trace is the 290 Mark Johnson and Martin Kay Parsing and Empty Nodes head of the complement of the I. But it is not clear how such a strategy would cope with empty nodes that do not stand in a head-to-head relationship, such as the trace associated with the adjoined NP. The construction of the NP"]},{"title":"a big picture of George","paragraphs":["would take place only after that of all of the V ~ nodes to its left.","In summary, all of these parsing strategies suffer from the problem that they can posit too many--in some cases infinitely many---empty nodes. They do this because there is no limit on the number of empty nodes that can be posited before the constraints governing their appearance are verified.","Sometimes relatively simple strategies suffice to constrain the appearance of empty nodes and ensure parser termination. For example, given a grammatical constraint that all empty nodes be siblings of appropriate lexical heads, then simply delaying the introduction of an empty node until the node that dominates it is constructed suffices to constrain the number of empty nodes that a bottom-up parser posits. Similarly, for some theories of filler-gap dependencies, notably those based on 'slash features' (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag 1985; Pereira 1981), it is possible to use a kind of prediction to constrain the possible occurrences of empty nodes in a wide variety of parsing strategies. However, with more complex theories of grammar, such as those within the GB framework, it is no longer so clear how, or even if, these sorts of techniques can be applied."]},{"title":"3. Sponsoring","paragraphs":["Our solution to this problem is a device inspired by the notion of licensing in GB (Abney 1986). According to this conception, the presence and location of each empty node is justified by the specific structural relations it stands in with other nodes. For example, every noun phrase might be required to receive Case and a &role, and it may be that the phrase would have to appear at different places in the structure for both of these assigrunents to be made.

In a lexicalized grammar every node in the parse tree originates from some lexical entry, so parsing becomes a jigsaw puzzle-like problem of finding a consistent way of assembling the pieces of trees associated with each lexical item. Sponsoring is a weaker notion, in that only some of the constituent structure, namely the lexical items and empty nodes, are specified in lexical entries. This seems plausible in a framework in which general principles of grammar (e.g., X ~ theory, Case theory, etc.) determine the overall structure of the parse tree. In addition, finding an appropriate association of constituent structure nodes with lexical items can be a difficult task. Because the sponsoring approach is only concerned with empty nodes, it should be easier to apply it to a wider variety of grannnatical theories than a lexicalization 291 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 Lexicon ~ii~;:iiiii:iiii!i~iii i'i ~ ,5 Extended Lexical Items"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["Non-empty Empty Figure 2 The structure of the lexicon and ELIs. approach, which requires that every node (empty or not) be associated with a lexical item (but see the remarks in the conclusion below).","We now discuss one way to formulate a sponsoring approach. A lexical item and the set of empty categories that it sponsors constitute an extended lexical item (ELI) as sketched in Figure 2. In simple systems, such as the parser described in the next section, each lexical and morphological entry explicitly specifies the traces that it sponsors, but in more sophisticated implementations this could be determined automatically from principles of the grammar and properties of the lexical entry. It is not intended that sponsoring be used to change grammar, but only to impose relatively weak global constraints on the appearance of empty categories.","There are several variants of the basic idea. For example, one could require that all the empty nodes supplied by the lexicon be used in the analysis. On the one hand, this could lead to a proliferation of lexical entries. On the other, it could prune the search space more effectively if the role of each empty node were made as specific as possible.","As we remarked, previous proposals have made the number of empty nodes-posited a function of the length of the input string. The novelty of our proposal is twofold. First, it provides a finer way of estimating the number of empty nodes that will occur. In fact, in the simplest version of the theory, the number of empty and nonempty terminals in a sentence is simply the sum of the sizes of the ELIs of the words in it. The number of empty categories is therefore this number minus the number of words. The fact that the number of empty nodes is bounded before parsing begins is the most important part of our proposal.","Our second proposal is that each of the items in an ELI is marked to show the specific role it must fill. Only one member, for example, will be capable of receiving a 0-role, and this member will not be capable of filling any position in which a 0-role is not assigned. 292 Mark Johnson and Martin Kay Parsing and Empty Nodes CP NP C' which book C IP does NP I' i the professor I VP I"]},{"title":", I I","paragraphs":["t___. t V' V CP"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["think NP C'"]},{"title":"I t G A I","paragraphs":["that I ....

Linguistic Aspects of Sponsoring The goal of this section is to demonstrate that the constraints that sponsoring imposes are plausible with respect to current linguistic assumptions. To the extent that they are, an important step will have been taken in establishing the decidability of these theories.","Consider once again the example in Figure 1. Because there is a government relationship between the V trace and the NP trace, and a movement relationship between the gave node under I and the V trace, it seems reasonable to include both of these traces in the ELI that permits gave to appear under I. The alternative clearly exists of allowing every N to sponsor an NP trace to allow, for example, for heavy NP shift of its maximal projection. It does not matter that this would lead to the provision of empty NP nodes in cases where no movement could occur, because the structures produced by the parser must independently satisfy all the requirements of the grammar.","Now consider an example involving cyclic WH-movement, as depicted in Figure 3. For English, WH-items such as which could sponsor the NP trace at the base of the chain (in Figure 3 the NP trace in embedded object position). However, we have already motivated a trace for the subcategorized complement, which should also serve as the foot of the WH-chain.

Because the number of intermediate traces that can appear in WH-constructions is not bounded, these intermediate traces cannot be sponsored by either the WH-item or the embedded verb. However, they can be sponsored by the bridge verbs that govern their CP parents. For example, the intermediate NP trace in Figure 3 is sponsored by the verb think.","Another possibility, inspired by the work of Grimshaw (1990) and Speas and Fukui (1986) on extended projections, is that inflection sponsors a complete set of empty functional nodes (and their specifiers) that can appear in the clause. In this example, the intermediate trace would be sponsored by the inflection -s on knows. While the first approach is perhaps more elegant, the second one also covers relative clauses, as discussed below. Either way, each potential location of an intermediate trace will have a sponsor; it is the independent constraints on WH-movement that are responsible for ensuring that, if a trace appears, it will be properly incorporated into a WH-chain.","The verb movement in Figure 3 can be treated as before. Presumably the ELI for does that permits it to appear under C also sponsors the corresponding trace in I, and the ELI for knows (or perhaps for the inflectional ending -s) that permits the verb to appear under I also sponsors the trace in V.","Next, consider the example in Figure 4. As well as the by now familiar V to ! movement, it also exhibits two examples of empty categories that are not members of chains, so their sponsors cannot be determined on this basis. Responsibility for sponsorship of the empty C as well as the PRO could be ascribed to the verb wants that governs the CP in which they appear. This is a control verb and is in any case responsible for identifying George as the antecedent of the PRO. According to this view the inflected verb wants (i.e., the lexical stem and the inflection) sponsors a total of three empty categories. Alternatively, one could allow the infinitive marker to to sponsor PRO and the empty complementizer.

The inflection element in the relative clause seems to be the most appropriate lexical item to sponsor these traces.","To summarize, it seems that it is possible to identify sponsors for the empty nodes for a variety of linguistic constructions. Of course, the above examples do not demonstrate that it will always be possible to identify appropriate sponsors. In any given theory a detailed analysis of each construction is required to determine the appropriate sponsors. 296 Mark Johnson and Martin Kay Parsing and Empty Nodes 5. Implementation The diagram in Figure 7 shows the structure of a possible implementation of a parsing system that exploits the notion of sponsoring. Square cornered boxes are used for data, and round corners for processes. Lexical access is applied to the input string to produce (nondeterministically) the extended lexical item (ELI) of each word. Its output is split into a sequence of lexical items and a bag of empty nodes.","The parser can be based on any standard algorithm. It is special only in that all the terminal items in the phrases it constructs come either from the string of lexical items or from the bag of empty nodes, so it is impossible for any empty node to appear more than once in an analysis.","An obvious defect of the architecture in this simple form is that, in the absence of some form of prediction, the parser will consider at all points in the string all the structures that can be built entirely from empty nodes. A simple solution to this problem is to compute all the trees consisting solely of empty nodes sponsored by lexical items appearing in the utterance to be parsed before beginning the main parsing process. This will make it possible to use a parser that does not deal with empty nodes explicitly. The idea is to modify the interface between the parser and the grammar. The fact that sponsoring can be implemented entirely within the \"rule-maker\" interface shows that it can be used with any parsing algorithm. We take it that the main job of this interface will be to manufacture \"rules\" that enshrine the local well-formedness constraints on individual nodes. The modification consists in adding rules to this set.","A rule a ~ bl ... bn will be passed in its original form to the parser, which can use it to build a phrase from n nonempty daughters. In addition, the rule maker supplies the parser with rules derived from this one by replacing k < n of the bi with empty trees, yielding a rule with n-k items on the right-hand side. The parser treats all these rules on equal footing. Apart from the sponsoring relationship, there is no requirement that any of the k empty trees be related to the n-k nonempty trees that the parser proper gets to see.","There are certain bookkeeping tasks that can best be undertaken by the rule maker. The most important of these have to do with ensuring that no empty terminal appears more than once in any structure. Concomitantly, it makes it possible to verify, at the end of the parse, that all empty terminals appear in the structure, if this is a requirement. The rule maker can also be used to percolate constraints up or down the tree, possibly discharging some of them in the process.","One remaining problem is to arrange for the parser to include the empty trees in the structures that it builds. We assume that this information accompanies the Input string","~ Lexical items Empty nodes Analyses Figure 7 A simple architecture. 297 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 Input ~ Lexical string items nodes Analyses Figure 8 The modified architecture. rule, perhaps in the form of features on the parent category, as in many unification grammars. 6. Conclusions It has not been our purpose here to solve the problem of parsing for GB, but only to provide a mechanism for ensuring that empty nodes do not cause nontermination of parsing in an important class of cases. We have made only very general remarks on the architecture of a parsing system that would incorporate these ideas, largely because we believe that the details of such a design would depend heavily on the mechanism that was chosen for managing constraints. Efficient implementation would depend on a good resolution of a number of interacting trade-offs, and there are several of these within our scheme that need to be explored. In particular, the components of an ELI could be more or less narrowly specified for the roles they are to fill. If the nodes are highly specialized, there will be greater ambiguity in the lexicon and consequently greater nondeterminism in the parser. On the other hand, many of these search paths will presumably be curtailed earlier than they would have been with less specialized nodes.","A major determinant of system performance will clearly be the manner in which constraints are enforced. It is possible to distinguish a class of constraints that arise in the course of parsing but which cannot, in general, be discharged there, and should therefore be treated as part of the result that the parser delivers. Notable among these are contraindexing constraints from the Binding theory.","Ensuring that each node in an ELI fills the role for which it was intended could be resolved through the general constraint mechanism. However, more specialized mechanisms could sometimes be useful. Suppose, for example, that the lexical entry for a noun contained a node specifically intended to receive Case. If these were the only nodes whose Case attribute was unspecified, all others having an explicit zero value, the required mechanism could consist simply in having all rules assign a value to this feature, that value being zero except for rules that assign a substantive Case.","A somewhat different problem consists of verifying that nodes from a given ELI appear in a certain structural configuration. Assigning each node a unique identifier allows this problem to be solved straightforwardly by the general constraint mechanism.","It might be advantageous for the ELI to encode very specific information about a lexical item and the empty nodes that it sponsors. For example, the ELI for a WH 298 Mark Johnson and Martin Kay Parsing and Empty Nodes item might specify that the traces it sponsors are coindexed with the WH item itself. Assuming that indices are just unbound variables (thus coindexing is unification and contraindexing is an inequality constraint), an interesting technical problem arises if the basic parsing engine uses a chart (Kay 1967, 1980). Because it is fundamental to such devices that the label on an edge is copied before it is used as a component of a larger phrase, the variables representing indices will be copied or renamed and the indices on the WH item and its sponsored trace will no longer be identical. However, it is important that the sharing of variables among the components of an ELI be respected when they come together in a phrase. One way of overcoming this problem is to associate a vector of variables with each edge, in which each variable that is shared between two or more edges is assigned a unique position. Whenever edges are combined their associated vectors are unified, thus ensuring that the corresponding variables in each edge are identified.","Finally, our linguistic examples suggest to us that a more focused notion of sponsoring might be formulated. We observe that, modulo adjunction, empty nodes tend to stand in fixed structural relations to their sponsors. If this is indeed generally true, then these strong locality constraints should clearly be exploited in the parsing process. This amounts to adopting the framework of Tree Adjoining Grammars (Frank 1990; Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi 1975; Kroch and Joshi 1985; Schabes 1990). The emphasis would then fall on deriving the initial and auxiliary trees from the general principles of grammar.
