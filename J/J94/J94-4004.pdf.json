Introduction There are many cases in which the natural translation of one language into another results in a very different form than that of the original. The existence of translation divergences (i.e., cross-linguistic distinctions) makes the straightforward transfer from source structures into target structures impractical. This paper demonstrates that a systematic solution to the divergence problem can be derived from the formalization of two types of information: (1) the linguistically grounded classes upon which lexical-semantic divergences are based; and (2) the techniques by which lexical-semantic divergences are resolved. An important result of this formalization is the provision of a framework for proving that the lexical-semantic divergence classification proposed in the current approach covers all source-language/target-language distinctions based on lexical-semantic properties. Other types of divergences and mismatches are outside of the scope of this paper; these include distinctions based on purely syntactic information, idiomatic usage, aspectual knowledge, discourse knowledge, domain knowledge, or world knowledge/","Although other translation approaches have attempted to account for divergences, the main innovation of the current approach is that it provides a formalization of these divergences and the techniques by which they are resolved.

In addition, the formalization allows one to make an evaluation of the status of the system. For example, given the formal description of the interlingua and target-language root words, one is able to judge whether a particular target-language sentence fully covers the concept that underlies the corresponding source-language sentence. Finally, the formalization of the divergence types and the associated solution allows one to prove certain properties about the system. For example, one might want to determine whether the system is able to handle two or more simultaneous divergences that interact in some way. With the mechanism of the current approach, one is able to prove formally that such cases are handled in a uniform fashion.","This paper will focus on the problem of lexical-semantic divergences and will provide support for the view that it is possible to construct a finite cross-linguistic classification of divergences and to implement a systematic mapping between the interlingual representation and the surface syntactic structure that accommodates all of the divergences in this classification.

Section 3 formally defines the terms used to classify divergences. Section 4 uses this terminology to formalize the divergence classification and to define the solution to the divergence problem in the context of detailed examples. Finally, Section 5 discusses certain issues of relevance to the divergence problem including the resolution of several (recursively) interacting divergence types. 2. Classification of Machine Translation Divergences The divergence problem in machine translation has received increasingly greater attention in recent literature (see, for example, Barnett et al. 1991a, 1991b; Beaven 1992a, 1992b; Dorr 1990a, 1990b; Kameyama et al. 1991; Kinoshita, Phillips, and Tsujii 1992; Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Tsujii and Fujita 1991; Whitelock 1992; related discussion can also be found in work by Melby [1986] and Nirenburg and Nirenburg [1988]). In particular, Barnett et al. (1991a) divide distinctions between the source language and the target language into two categories: translation"]},{"title":"divergences,","paragraphs":["in which the same information is conveyed in the source and target texts, but the structures of the sentences are different (as in previous work by Dorr [1990a, 1990b]); and translation"]},{"title":"mismatches,","paragraphs":["in which the information that is conveyed is different in the source and target languages (as described by Kameyama et al. [1991]). 3 Although translation mismatches are a major problem for translation systems that must be addressed, they are outside the scope of the model presented here. (See Barnett et al. 1991a, 1991b; Carbonell and Tomita 1987; Meyer, Onyshkevych, and Carlson 1990; Nirenburg, Raskin, and Tucker 1987; Nirenburg and Goodman 1990; Nirenburg and Levin 1989; Wilks 1973; among others, for descriptions of interlingual machine translation approaches that take into account knowledge outside of the domain of lexical semantics.)","Although researchers have only recently begun to classify divergence types systematically, the notion of translation divergences is not a new one in the machine translation community. For example, a number of researchers working on the Eurotra project have sought to solve divergent source-to-target translations, although the divergences were named differently and were resolved by construction-specific transfer rules. (For cogent descriptions of the Eurotra project, see, for example, Arnold and des Tombe 1987; Copeland et al. 1991; and Johnson, King, and des Tombe 1985). head switching cases will be made clearer in Section 4.3. 3 An example of the latter situation is the translation of the English word fish into Spanish: the translation is pez if the fish is still in its natural state, but it is pescado if the fish has been caught and is suitable for food. It is now widely accepted that, in such a situation, the machine translation system must be able to derive the required information from discourse context and a model of the domain that is being discussed. 599 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 Figure 2 Formal definition of lexical conceptual structure. A comprehensive survey of divergence examples is presented by Lindop and Tsujii (1991). The term used in this work is \"complex transfer,\" but it describes a class of problems inherent in machine translation itself, not just in the transfer (or interlingual) approaches.","One of the claims made by Lindop and Tsujii (1991) is that the non-Eurotra literature rarely goes into great detail when discussing how divergences are handled. An additional claim is that combinations of divergences and interaction effects between divergent and nondivergent translations are not described in the literature. This paper seeks to change this perceived state of affairs by providing a detailed description of a solution to all of the (potentially interacting) divergences shown in Figure 1, not just a subset of them as would typically be found in the description of most translation systems. The framework assumed for the current approach makes use of a linguistically grounded classification of divergence types that can be formally defined and systematically resolved.","We now turn to a formal description of the terminology used to define the divergence problem. 3. Definitions This section formally defines the lexical-semantic representation that serves as the interlingua of the system (Definitions 1-3). This representation, which is influenced primarily by Jackendoff (1983, 1990), has been described in detail elsewhere (see, for example, Dorr 1992b, 1993a) and thus will not be the focus of this paper. In addition to a formal description of the lexical-semantic representation, definitions are provided for syntactic phrases (Definition 4) and two translation mappings (Definitions 5 and 6).

Note that the logical argument is itself a LCS that contains a logical argument, SCHOOL (of type Location), i.e., LCSs are recursively defined.","The LCS representation is used both in the lexicon and in the interlingual representation. The former is identified as a root LCS (RLCS) and the latter is identified as a composed LCS (CLCS): Definition 2 A RLCS (i.e., a root LCS) is an uninstantiated LCS that is associated with a word definition in the lexicon (i.e., a LCS with unfilled variable positions).

The LCS has been studied as the basis of a representation for multiple languages (see, for example, Hale and Keyser 1986a, 1986b, 1989; Hale and Laughren 1983; Levin and Rappaport 1986; Zubizarreta 1982, 1987) and is discussed in the context of machine translation by Dorr (1992b). 601 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4"]},{"title":"( { ) x / \\ ...","paragraphs":[", l Position )"]},{"title":"I(' [ x","paragraphs":["7.

That is, the generation process operates on the CLCS in a unification-like fashion that roughly mirrors the LCS composition process, but it is not a direct inverse of this process. The notion of unification used here also differs from others in that it is a more \"relaxed\" notion: those words that are mapped in a relaxed way are associated with special lexical information (i.e., the :INT, :EXT, :PROMOTE, :DEMOTE, ,, :CAT, and :CONFLATED parameters, each of which will be formalized shortly).","A fundamental component of the mapping between the interlingual representation and the surface syntactic representation is the"]},{"title":"syntactic phrase.

The syntactic operations that determine word order are completely independent from the lexical-semantic operations that use these definitions. Thus, the formal definitions can be stated in terms of an arbitrary ordering of constituents, without loss of generality, as long as it is understood that the constituent order is independently determined. 603 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["N-MAX"]},{"title":"A","paragraphs":["John C-MAX"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["I-MAX"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["V-MAX V ADV P-MAX"]},{"title":"I I /\\","paragraphs":["went happily to N-MAX school Figure 6 Syntactic phrase representation for John went happily to school. the LCS representation and the surface syntactic form by means of two routines that are grounded in linguistic theory: a generalized linking routine (G£T4) and a canonical syntactic realization (CST4).

The Divergence Problem: Formal Classification and Solution In general, translation divergences occur when there is an exception either to the ~£T4 or to the CST4 (or to both) in one language, but not in the other. 7 This premise allows one to define formally a classification of all lexical-semantic divergences that arise during translation (i.e., divergences based on properties associated with lexical 7 Most of the examples in this paper seem to suggest that a divergence is defined in terms of a language-to-language phenomenon: a divergence occurs when a sentence in language L1 translates into a sentence in L2 in a very different form (i.e., differently shaped parse trees or similarly shaped trees with different basic categories). This definition implies that a divergence may arise between two languages L1 and L2, independent of the way the translation is done (i.e., direct, transfer, or interlingual). However, it is also possible to define a divergence from an interlingual point of view, i.e., with respect to an underlying representation (lexical conceptual structure) that has been chosen to describe the source and target language sentences. From this point of view, a divergent mapping may apply even in cases in which the source- and target-language pairs do not exhibit any distinctions on the surface (e.g., the translation of the German sentence Hans kuflt Marie gern as the equivalent Dutch sentence Hans kust Marie graag, both of which literally translate to Hans kisses Mary likingly). In such cases, there are generally two occurrences of a language-to-interlingua divergence: one from the surface structure and one to the surface structure. (The terms language-to-language and language-to-interlingua are taken from Dorr and Voss 1993a.) At first glance, it might seem odd to introduce the notion of a language-to-interlingua divergence for cases that do not exhibit a language-to-language divergence. However, it is clearly the case that language-to-language divergences--a special case of language-to-interlingua divergences--do exist regardless of the translation approach adopted. Thus, we can view divergences more generally as a consequence of the internal mapping between the surface structure and the interlingual representation rather than as an external distinction that shows up on the surface. The result is that the interlingua appears to have been simplified to the extent that it accommodates constructions in one language (without any special information) more readily than it accommodates the corresponding construction in another language. However, as one reviewer points out, this is not an undesirable consequence, since the development of a suitable representation is where the interlingua builder has a choice and should choose the simplest representation format. The appropriate question to ask is whether an approach that addresses the divergence problem from a language-to-interlingua perspective is an improvement over an approach that addresses the problem strictly from a language-to-language point of view. This paper argues that the language-to-interlingua approach is the correct one given that the alternative would be to handle language-to-language divergences by constructing detailed source-to-target transfer rules for each lexical entry in the source and target language. Introducing the notion of language-to-interlingua divergence allows the translation mapping to be defined in terms of a representation that is general enough to carry over to several different language pairs. 605 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4","CLCS: Syntax: Y-MAX Y-~x Q W X-MAX"]},{"title":"IN","paragraphs":["X Z Figure 8 G£T¢ mapping between the CLCS and the syntactic structure. entries that are not based on purely syntactic information, idiomatic usage, aspectual knowledge, discourse knowledge, domain knowledge, or world knowledge).","Before we define and resolve each divergence type, we will first make some revisions to the representations used in Definitions 1 and 4 to simplify the presentation.

The G£T4 and C$T4 are intended to be language independent, whereas the parameters are intended to encode language-specific information about lexical items. Because the interlingual representation preserves relevant lexical-semantic relations, these three types of information are all that are required for providing a systematic solution to the divergence types shown in Figure 1. In particular, the solution given here eliminates the need for transfer rules and relies instead on parameterized mappings that are defined and applied uniformly across all languages. Seven parameters are used to invoke exceptions to the ~£T4 and C$T4 functions in the context of translation divergences: :INT, :EXT, :PROMOTE, :DE-MOTE, ,, :CAT, and :CONFLATED. We will now present a formal description of each divergence type and its associated parameter. 4.1 Thematic Divergence The first divergence type to be formalized is the one for thematic divergence, i.e., the repositioning of arguments with respect to a given head.

There are other ways of realizing this sentence. In particular, a native speaker of Spanish will frequently invert the subject to post-verbal position: [C-MAX [I--MAX ei [V-MAX IV--MAX [V me gusta]] IN--MAX Mafia]i]]].

In both cases, the translation mapping appears to associate a main verb with an adverbial satellite, or vice versa. However, the distinction between these two head switching cases becomes more apparent when we consider the status of the participating lexical tokens more carefully. In the case of soler-usually, the main verb soler is, in some sense, the token that \"triggers\" the head switching operation: its presence forces the adverbial satellite usually to appear in English, even if we were to substitute some other event for ir in Spanish (e.g., correr a la tienda, leer un libro, etc.). By contrast, in the case of like-gern, the triggering element is not the main verb like, since we are able to use like in other contexts that do not require gern (e.g., I like the car ~ Mir gefdllt der Wagen); instead, the triggering element is the adverbial satellite gern: its presence forces the verb like to appear in English even if we were to substitute some other event in place of essen in German (e.g., zum Geschdft laufen, das Buch lesen, etc.).

In fact, one might consider the use of the :CONFLATED marker to be unnecessary, since its presence could be implied by the absence of the * marker. However, the :CONFLATED marker plays an important role in the lexical-semantic representation: it specifies that the \"constant\" term (e.g., the KNIFE-WOUND of the stab RLCS) must obligatorily fill the position and, moreover, that this constant must be a legal LCS primitive of the system. In addition, there is an inherent asymmetry between the :CONFLATED marker and the * marker: whereas the former always occurs in a leaf node position, the latter may occur in any position in the RLCS. Because the notion of conflation is not meaningful in non-leaf node positions, it would be unreasonable to make the assumption that every non-leaf position without the * marker is conflated. The :CONFLATED marker is used to identify truly conflated positions, not just those positions without the * marker. 614 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences 4.6 Categorial Divergence Unlike the previous five divergence types, categorial divergence affects the operation of the C$/~, not the ~£T4. It is characterized by a situation in which CAT(0) is forced to have a different value than would normally be assigned to T(~ ~) by means of the mapping specified in Figure 7. Thus, categorial divergence is formally described as follows: a lexical-semantic type T(~') is related to a syntactic category CAT(~), where CAT(~) ~ CST4(T(~')).

An example of such a case is the English word eat, which maps to essen (for humans) or fressen (for animals). Such cases are considered to be outside of the classes of lexical-semantic divergences considered here (see Footnote 3). However, a simple approach to resolving such cases would be to use featural restrictions during syntactic processing.","22 The solution to lexical divergence is trivial for transfer machine translation systems, since transfer entries map source-language words directly to their target-language equivalents. In general, lexical selection is not seen as a problem in these systems. 616 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences","There is also a structural divergence in this example, since the prepositional phrase into the room must be translated into a noun phrase entrada al cuarto. This divergence compounds the lexical divergence problem, since it is necessary to choose the target-language word a in the absence of a source-language counterpart.","Lexical divergence also shows up in three previously presented examples, (12), (29), and (26), owing to the presence of thematic, categorial, and conflational divergences, respectively: in (12) the word like is chosen for the word gustar (literally, to please); in (29) the word haben (literally, to have) is chosen for the word be; and in (26) the word dar (literally, to give) is chosen for the word stab. 5. Discussion This section discusses certain issues of relevance to the formal classification and resolution of translation divergences. In particular, we will discuss (1) the limits imposed on the range of repositioning possibilities; (2) the justification for distinguishing between promotional and demotional divergences; (3) the notion of full coverage in the context of lexical selection; and (4) the resolution of interacting divergence types. 5.1 Limits on Repositioning Divergences In Section 4.1 we made the claim that the thematic, promotional, and demotional divergences account for the entire range of repositioning possibilities. We will now explore the validity of this claim.","There are two potential types of syntactic relations that exist between a head and a satellite: the first is complementation (i.e., involving the internal argument), and the second is adjunction. 23 Given these two types of relations, there are only a small number of ways syntactic entities may be repositioned. The three CLCS positions that are involved in these relations are X', Z ~, and Q'. If we compute the repositionings combinatorically, there are 33 = 27 configurations (i.e., X ~, Z', and Q~ would map into any of three positions). However, we can eliminate 15 of these (since a CLCS must contain exactly one head), thus leaving only 12 possible configurations. One of these corresponds to the default G£~ mapping (i.e., the logical head, logical argument, and logical modifier map into canonical positions). The remaining 11 configurations can be factored into three cases as follows: 1. X' 4=> X 1.1 Q' ~ Z; Z 1 4=~ Z. 1.2 Z' ~ Q; Q' 4=~ Q. 1.3 Q' <~ Z; Z' ~ Q. 2. Q' 4=¢ X 2.1 X ~ 4=~ Z; Z' ¢¢ Z. 2.2 X ~Z;Z ~<=~Q.","23 We have left out the possibility of an external argument as a participant in the head-satellite relation. Of course, the external argument is a satellite with respect to the head, but it turns out that the external argument, which corresponds to the logical subject in the CLCS, has a special status and does not have the same repositioning potential that internal arguments and syntactic adjuncts have. In particular, the external argument has the unique property that it never participates as the incorporated argument of a conflational verb. Hale and Keyser (1989) provide evidence that this property holds across all languages. Thus, we take the external argument to have a special status (universally) that exempts it from participating in divergences other than thematic divergence. 617 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4"]},{"title":"(a) Case 1.1 CLCS: X~ Y-MAX] Y-MAX 71 X-MAX","paragraphs":["IN x Q (b) Case 1.2"]},{"title":"CLCS: Syntax: Y-MAX I\\ Y-MAX Z /I X-MAX I x (e) Case 2.3 CLCS: Syntax: IN Y-MAX X /I Z~, X-MAX t\\ • Q z","paragraphs":["(d) Case 3.2"]},{"title":"CLCS: Syntax: Y-MAX X-MAX IN Z X Q Figure 10","paragraphs":["Illegal translation mappings for natural language. . 2.3 X' ~ Q; Z' 4~ Z. 2.4 X'~Q;Z'~Q.

Dorr Machine Translation Divergences","Another case that is eliminated is the renaming of a logical head as a syntactic adjunct whose head corresponds to a logical modifier (case 2.3). The idea is simply that modification is a one-way relation. If a logical head has a modifier, the head cannot become an adjunct of that modifier because the modifying relation would be reversed (i.e., the logical head would modify the syntactic head rather than the other way around). In contrast, a logical head of a CLCS can be mapped to an internal argument position in cases in which a logical modifier is mapped to a syntactic head (i.e., the case of promotional divergence presented earlier), since there is no violation of the one-way relation.","A similar argument is used to eliminate the case in which a logical head is mapped to an internal argument whose head corresponds to a logical argument (case 3.2). The idea is that heads and arguments participate in a one-way relation. If a logical head has an argument, the head cannot become an internal argument of that argument because the head-argument relation would be reversed (i.e., the logical head would be an argument of the syntactic head rather than the other way around). In contrast, the logical head of a CLCS can be mapped to an adjunct (i.e., modifier) position in cases in which a logical argument is mapped to a syntactic head (i.e., the case of demotional divergence presented earlier), since these is no violation of the one-way relation.","The argument for the elimination of the last two cases could be viewed as an appeal to a constraint that is analogous to the 0-criterion in syntax. Essentially, this constraint states that all arguments and modifiers must be licensed (see Chomsky 1986a; Abney 1989) in order to appear either in the syntactic structure or in the conceptual structure. In the context of conceptual structure, a logical modifier may license the realization of a logical head in an internal argument position, but not in an adjunct position, since the modifier relation is already satisfied by virtue of the relation between the head and the modifier. Similarly, a logical argument may license the realization of a logical head in a syntactic adjunct position, but not in an internal argument position, since the head-argument relation is already satisfied by virtue of the relation between the head and the argument. Having eliminated the meaningless possibilities, we are left with the promotional and demotional cases presented above. 5.2 Promotional versus Demotional Divergences We will now provide justification for the earlier claim that promotional and demotional divergence should be classified differently, even though they exhibit some of the same properties. It might be argued that these divergences are essentially the same, since both cases involve an association of a main verb with an adverbial satellite or vice versa. In the examples given earlier, the promotional divergence referred to a mapping between the adverbial usually and the main verb soler and demotional divergence referred to a mapping between the adverbial gern and the main verb like. However, as mentioned in Section 4.3, these are taken to be in distinct classes: the difference between these two cases is determined by the \"triggering\" element (i.e., promotion is triggered by a main verb such as soler, whereas demotion is triggered by an adverb such as gern).","Another factor that distinguishes between promotional and demotional divergences is the fact that verbs such as like and verbs such as soler do not have parallel syntactic distributions, nor do they have analogous logical interpretations. The verb like may take a sentential complement that has its own event structure (as in I like to eat), or it may take a nominal complement without an event structure (as in I like the car). In either case, the verb like generally means the same thing (i.e., it describes a state in which an event or a thing is somehow desirable to that person). By contrast, the verb soler is a modal verb that contributes an aspectual component of meaning 619 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 that crucially relies on a verbal complement with an event structure; in a sense,"]},{"title":"soler","paragraphs":["is analogous to the modal"]},{"title":"must","paragraphs":["in English in that it cannot be used in isolation, but requires the presence of a verbal complement in order for it to be interpretable.

Whichever of these proposals is correct, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz considers their proposals in the context of interlingual machine translation. If the exceptional mappings are indeed arbitrary, then one needs to explain how this affects the handling of different languages. Moreover, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz mentions the possibility that the number of exceptional mappings might not be arbitrarily large, but that there might be a fixed number of exceptions, delineated in such a way that only a handful need to be considered at any time for any given language. This is why the formalization described in this paper is a valuable resource: it provides a means for proving that only certain types of exceptions are allowed and that the number of such exceptions is actually quite small. Finally, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz considers keeping Jackendoff's version of the LCS intact and using a single parameterized mapping along the lines proposed in the current framework. 620 Bonnie J.

In cases in which more than one lexical entry matches a current concept, this constraint is used to determine which possibilities should be ruled out (if any).","One of the main advantages to the formalization defined in this paper is that it allows one to judge whether a target-language concept fully covers the concept underlying the source-language sentence and, thus, to make an evaluation of the status of the system. As an illustration of this point, consider the stab-dar example of Section 4.5. The notion of full coverage is manifested through the lexical-selection process. The basic idea is that RLCSs are chosen such that they entirely cover the underlying concept. In terms of the mapping from the source-language sentence to the CLCS, this implies that the RLCSs must compose in such a way as to provide a full cover (i.e., there must be a path from the root to the leaf nodes that includes all the [content] words of the sentence). In terms of the mapping from the CLCS to the target-language sentence, this implies that the CLCS must be decomposed into (potentially overlapping) RLCSs whose \"union\" covers the entire CLCS.","From the English sentence in (26), the RLCSs must be chosen for each word in the sentence such that they provide a coherent CLCS.

Such a scheme is limited in that it has no potential for relating thematic divergence to the rest of the space of divergence possibilities. Moreover, although transfer rules might be deemed suitable for local divergences such as simple subject-object reversal, it is well known that simple transfer rules of this type do not readily accommodate more complicated divergences.","Consider a more complicated case such as the following promotional divergence: R6 (42)"]},{"title":"Promotional divergence:","paragraphs":["E: The baby just fell ~ F: Le b6b6 vient de tomber 'The baby just (verb-past) of fall' Here, the English adverbial"]},{"title":"just","paragraphs":["is translated as the French main verb"]},{"title":"venir,","paragraphs":["which takes the falling event as its complement"]},{"title":"de tomber.","paragraphs":["At first glance, it might seem difficult to construct transfer rules that handle such cases.

A serious flaw concerns the handling of divergences in the context of embedded clauses. (For additional discussion, see Sadler and Thompson 1991.) In particular, if the English sentence in (42) were realized as an embedded complement such as I think that the baby just fell, it would not be possible to generate the French output. The reason for this is that the LFG-MT system is not designed to handle an interaction between a (divergent) matrix clause and a (nondivergent) embedded clause. This sentence is broken down into predicate-argument relations that conform (roughly) to the following logical specification:","(45) think(I,fall(baby)) just(fall(baby)) Because the logical constituent fall(baby) is viewed as an argument of two logical heads, \"think\" and \"just,\" the LFG-MT generator cannot determine how to compose these concepts and produce an output string.","The divergence solution proposed in the LCS framework overcomes this difficulty by imposing the full coverage constraint. In particular, specific relations are set up 623 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 between logical heads and their associated arguments and modifiers so that there could never be any question of how two concepts are composed, even for embedded cases. For the current example, the LCS approach would reduce the logical relations to a single specification for both French and English: (46) think(I, fall(baby, just)) That is, the \"just\" component of meaning is a modifier of the \"falling\" action, regardless of how this constituent is realized on the surface.","The full benefit of this approach is further demonstrated when one considers the extent to which the full coverage constraint carries over to other divergence categories. Consider the following (frequently cited) conflational divergence: (47)"]},{"title":"Conflational divergence:","paragraphs":["E: John swam across the river F: John a travers6 la rivi~re ~ la nage","'John crossed the river by swimming' In this example, the English path component (across) is translated as the French main verb (traverser), and the English main verb (swim) is translated as the French manner component (a la nage). In a system like TAUM (Isabelle 1987), transfer rules impose lexical transformations in order to establish correspondences between source and target structures, i.e., rules of the following form: (48) (X swim (across Y)) 4~ (X traverser Y (a la nage)) This rule maps the path component (across) to the French main verb (traverser), and the English main verb (swim) to the French adverbial (a la nage). 27","The disadvantage to this approach is that it requires a new transfer rule for every adverbial that might potentially participate in the traverser construction (e.g., ~ pied, en courant, en marchant, etc.). The LCS approach, on the other hand, resolves this type of divergence compositionally by relying on the full coverage constraint and the :CON-FLATED marker, analogous to the handling of example (26).

In particular, there have been criticisms (see, for example, Lindop and Tsujii 1991) of systems that perform transfer on relatively shallow analyses (e.g., early METAL [Alonso 1990, Thurmair 1990] and LTAG [AbeillG Schabes, and Joshi 1990]) owing to the fact that such systems are not likely to be able to handle divergence interactions (although they may be able to handle each divergence type in isolation). The solution adopted in the current approach does not appeal to a shallow analysis (i.e., it does not use a set of already-coded canned \"frames\" with predetermined argument structure). Rather, the syntactic structures are derived compositionally on the basis of two pieces of information: the structure of the CLCS (i.e., the language-independent predicate-argument information) and the lexical entries (i.e., the RLCSs and their associated language-dependent information). It would not be possible to handle interacting divergence types in an approach that maps directly from a set of hard-wired source-language frames to a set of hard-wired target-language frames. This is because an argument that occurs in a divergent phrasal construction might itself be a divergent phrasal construction.","Consider the following example:"]},{"title":"(5O) Promotional and thematic divergence:","paragraphs":["S: Leer libros le suele gustar a Juan","'Reading books (him) tends to please (to) John' E: John usually likes reading books This example exhibits a simultaneous occurrence of two types of divergences: the verb soler exhibits a promotional divergence with respect to its internal argument gustar a Juan, which itself exhibits a thematic divergence.

It is the job of the ~£T4 function to determine the appropriate decomposition of the event on the basis of the language-specific requirements of the RLCSs involved in the mapping. In the current example, the LIKINGLY component is, in a sense, an \"inherent\" modifier, since it appears in the RLCS of both like and gustar. In contrast, the HABITUALLY modifier is an independent constituent that corresponds to independent RLCSs for usually and soler. 625 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4","We will now formally analyze how this example is handled.

Also, because the promotional mapping forces X into an internal argument position, additional structure is created so that X retains its status as a head. This head selects an internal argument that, in this case, is W rather than Z because of the interaction with the thematic divergence.","Suppose we were to generate the Spanish sentence for this example.

This head takes an internal argument corresponding to X'"]},{"title":"([State","paragraphs":["BEcirc ...]) that is","29 This seems to indicate that there is some notion of prioritization during the resolution of interacting divergence types. In particular, the head swapping (promotional and demotional) divergences appear to take priority over the \"argument swapping\" cases (thematic). The decision to impose this prioritization is not entirely unprincipled. It would not be possible to apply these two overrides in the opposite order, since a head must be properly positioned (potentially via a promotional override) in order to identify the relative positions for its satellites (potentially via a thematic override). Although the formal ramifications of this ordering have not yet been established, it should be noted that the prioritization fits in naturally in the current framework, given that the syntactic realization process starts by realizing \"outer\" phrases, but then recursively realizes \"inner\" phrases before any attachments are made. 626 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences realized as the verb gustar. Recall that the structural relation between the subordinated verb and its internal argument is not changed by the promotional mapping (see Footnote 13). However, the promotional operation does change the relation between the subordinated verb and its external argument by realizing the argument in an external position relative to the main verb. Normally, this would mean that the CLCS constituent [Thing JOHN] would become an external argument of soler such as in the noninteracting case, John suele leer libros. In the current example, however, the attachment of the external argument is delayed until the recursive application of the ~£T4 on [State BEcirc ...].","At this point, the :INT and :EXT markers trigger the thematic interchange, and the logical subject [Thing JOHN] is realized as the internal argument a Juan. The [Event READ ...] constituent is then taken to be the external argument of gustar, except that this constituent cannot be attached inside of the subordinate phrase owing to the promotional divergence. Instead, the current phrase is completed and the external argument is \"passed up\" to the higher phrase, which then attaches it in an external position relative to the verb soler. The final structure is then generated:","(57) [C-MAX","[I-MAX [C-MAX leer libros] [V-MAX [Vle suele]","IV-MAX [V gustar] [P-MAX a Juan]]]]] Thus, we have shown how the current framework provides a formal means for demonstrating how interacting divergence types are handled. 6. Limitations and Conclusions The current approach has been implemented in a system called UNITRAN (Dorr 1990a, 1990b, 1993b). 3° Many of the problems associated with the direct replacement and transfer approaches of previous systems have been eliminated in this new design. In particular, UNITRAN does not make use of analysis/synthesis rules that are meticulously tailored to each of the source and target languages, nor does it require detailed source-to-target transfer rules. On the other hand, because the system is designed (deliberately) to operate on one sentence at a time, it has a number of inherent limitations. In particular, the lack of a theory of multisententiality makes high quality translation difficult, since it is often the case that a single sentence in one language should be translated as two or more sentences in the other language; currently, UNITRAN does not allow for a mismatch between the number of source- and target-language sentences. 31 Since generation has not been the primary focus of the current research, this and other generation problems have not yet been addressed in this framework. Such problems include cohesion (Granville 1983), selecting propositional and rhetorical goals (McKeown 1985), selecting open-class items from \"deep knowledge\" (Goldman","30 The name UNITRAN stands for UNiversal TRANslator, that is, the system serves as the basis for translation across a variety of languages, not just two languages or a family of languages.","31 In general, systems should be designed so that sentences are realized differently in different languages, depending on the speaker's intended effect. In the words of a reviewer, \"What's a long-winded and boring sentence to an American may be precisely a very fine formal sentence to a German.\" Even for languages as close as French and English, sentence boundaries differ about 10% of the time (see Brown et al. 1991). 627 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 1975; Jacobs 1985; Kittredge, Iordanskaja, and Polgu6re 1988; Nirenburg and Nirenburg 1988; Nirenburg et al. 1992; among others), ordering propositions for producing coherent text (Hovy 1988), resolving anaphora (Derr and McKeown 1984; Sondheimer, Cumming, and Albano 1990; Werner and Nirenburg 1988), and many others. In fact, not all of these issues (e.g., selecting propositional and rhetorical goals) are directly relevant to the task of machine translation, which already has the advantage (at least from the generation point of view) that the source-language sentence and, in the current model, the conceptual analysis underlying this sentence are available at the onset of the generation process.","Instead, the current research focuses on demonstrating the utility of the LCS-based interlingua and the associated parameters for resolving translation divergences while maintaining the systematic relation between the interlingua and the syntax. The tasks involved in achieving this objective have been reduced to what might be considered the standard \"what\" and \"how\" questions of generation: (1)"]},{"title":"lexical selection,","paragraphs":["i.e., the task of deciding what target-language words accurately reflect the meaning of the corresponding source-language words; and (2)"]},{"title":"syntactic realization,","paragraphs":["i.e., the task of determining how target-language words are mapped to their appropriate syntactic structures.

One of the important problems that must be considered with respect to lexical selection is that of overgeneration. 32 In particular, one might ask how the matcher knows whether it should try to choose phrases that restate the source language more succinctly in the target language, or whether it should be allowed to restate the source-language phrases more verbosely in the target language.

In particular, it has been argued convincingly by Farwell, Guthrie, and Wilks (1992) that resources such as the LDOCE are useful for constructing dictionary representations for languages other than English, thus paving the way for scaling up interlingual machine translations so that they have broader coverage. Once this extension is complete, we intend to scale up the UNITRAN system and test the LCS approach to lexical choice on a broader set of phenomena using a larger lexicon.","The current framework provides a systematic classification of machine translation divergences.

Since the characterization of the range of potential divergences is manageably small, the task of accommodating divergences is immensely simplified. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of a full coverage requirement as a tool that allows one to judge whether a particular target-language sentence fully covers the concept that underlies the corresponding source-language sentence. Finally, we have shown, formally, that the current model accommodates interacting divergence types.
