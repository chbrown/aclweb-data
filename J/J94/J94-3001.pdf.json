Introduction","paragraphs":["Ordered sets of context-sensitive rewriting rules have traditionally been used to describe the pronunciation changes that occur when sounds appear in different phonological and morphological contexts. Intuitively, these phenomena ought to be cognitively and computationally simpler than the variations and correspondences that appear in natural language syntax and semantics, yet the formal structure of such rules seems to require a complicated interpreter and an extraordinarily large number of processing steps. In this paper, we show that any such rule defines a"]},{"title":"regular relation","paragraphs":["on strings if its non-contextual part is not allowed to apply to its own output, and thus it can be modeled by a symmetric finite-state transducer. Furthermore, since regular relations are closed under serial composition, a finite set of rules applying to each other's output in an ordered sequence also defines a regular relation. A single finite-state transducer whose behavior simulates the whole set can therefore be constructed by composing the transducers corresponding to the individual rules. This transducer can be incorporated into efficient computational procedures that are far more economical in both recognition and production than any strategies using ordered rules directly. Since orthographic rules have similar formal properties to phonological rules, our results generalize to problems of word recognition in written text.","The mathematical techniques we develop to analyze rewriting rule systems are not limited just to that particular collection of formal devices. They can also be applied to other recently proposed phonological or morphological rule systems. For example, we can show that Koskenniemi's (1983) two-level parallel rule systems also denote regular relations. Section 2 below provides an intuitive grounding for the rest of our discussion by illustrating the correspondence between simple rewriting rules and transducers. Section 3 summarizes the mathematical tools that we use to analyze both rewriting and two-level systems.

More generally, if recognition is carried out by taking the rules of a grammar in reverse order and inverting each of them in turn, later rules in the new sequence act as filters on ambiguities produced by earlier ones.","The existence of a large class of ambiguities that are introduced at one point in the recognition process and eliminated at another has been a major source of difficulty in efficiently reversing the action of linguistically motivated phonological grammars. In a large grammar, the effect of these spurious ambiguities is multiplicative, since the information needed to cut off unproductive paths often does not become available until after they have been pursued for some considerable distance. Indeed, speech understanding systems that use phonological rules do not typically invert them on strings but rather apply them to the lexicon to generate a list of all possible word forms (e.g. Woods et al. 1976; Klatt 1980). Recognition is then accomplished by standard table-332 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems lookup procedures, usually augmented with special devices to handle phonological changes that operate across word boundaries. Another approach to solving this computational problem would be to use the reversed cascade of rules during recognition, but to somehow make the filtering information of particular rules available earlier in the process. However, no general and effective techniques have been proposed for doing this.","The more radical approach that we explore in this paper is to eliminate the cascade altogether, representing the information in the grammar as a whole in a single more unified device, namely, a finite-state transducer. This device is constructed in two phases. The first is to create for each rule in the grammar a transducer that exactly models its behavior. The second is to compose these individual rule transducers into a single machine that models the grammar as a whole.","Johnson (1972) was the first to notice that the noncyclic components of standard phonological formalisms, and particularly the formalism of"]},{"title":"The Sound Pattern of English","paragraphs":["(Chomsky and Halle 1968), were equivalent in power to finite-state devices despite a superficial resemblance to general rewriting systems. Phonologists in the SPE tradition, as well as the structuralists that preceded them, had apparently honored an injunction against rules that rewrite their own output but still allowed the output of a rule to serve as context for a reapplication of that same rule. Johnson realized that this was the key to limiting the power of systems of phonological rules. He also realized that basic •",".","/","...... rewriting rules were subject to many alternahve modes of apphcahon offering different expressive possibilities to the linguist. He showed that phonological grammars under most reasonable modes of application remain within the finite-state paradigm.","We observed independently the basic connections between rewriting-rule grammars and finite-state transducers in the late 1970s and reported them at the 1981 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (Kaplan and Kay 1981). The mathematical analysis in terms of regular relations emerged somewhat later. Aspects of that analysis and its extension to two-level systems were presented at conferences by Kaplan (1984, 1985, 1988), in courses at the 1987 and 1991 Linguistics Institutes, and at colloquia at Stanford University, Brown University, the University of Rochester, and the University of Helsinki.","Our approach differs from Johnson's in two important ways. First, we abstract away from the many details of both notation and machine description that are crucial to Johnson's method of argumentation. Instead, we rely strongly on closure properties in the underlying algebra of regular relations to establish the major result that phonological rewriting systems denote such sets of string-pairs. We then use the correspondence between regular relations and finite-state transducers to develop a constructive relationship between rewriting rules and transducers. This is accomplished by means of a small set of simple operations, each of which implements a simple mathematical fact about regular languages, regular relations, or both. Second, our more abstract perspective provides a general framework within which to treat other phonological formalisms, existing or yet to be devised. For example, two-level morphology (Koskenniemi 1983), which evolved from our early considerations of rewriting rules, relies for its analysis and implementation on the same algebraic techniques. We are also encouraged by initial successes in adapting these techniques to the autosegmental formalism described by Kay (1987). 2. Rewriting Rules and Transducers Supposing for the moment that Rule 2 (N --* n) is optional, Figure 1 shows the transition diagram of a finite-state transducer that models it. A finite-state transducer has 333 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 Figure 1 Rule 2 as optional.","N:n {{[0~~ a:a ... n:n, N:N ... z:z Figure 2 Rule 2 as obligatory. N:n ~ other, n:n two tapes. A transition can be taken if the two symbols separated by the colon in its label are found at the current position on the corresponding tapes, and the current position advances across those tape symbols. A pair of tapes is accepted if a sequence of transitions can be taken starting at the start-state (conventionally labeled 0) and at the beginning of the tapes and leading to a final state (indicated by double circles) at the end of both tapes. In the machine in Figure 1, there is a transition from state 0 to state 0 that translates every phoneme into itself, reflecting the fact that any phoneme can remain unchanged by the optional rule. These are shown schematically in the diagram. This machine will accept a pair of tapes just in case they stand in a certain relation: they must be identical except for possible replacements of N on the first tape with n on the second. In other words, the second tape must be one that could have resulted from applying the optional rule to the string on the first tape.","But the rule is in fact obligatory, and this means that there must be no occurrences of N on the second tape. This condition is imposed by the transducer in Figure 2. In this diagram, the transition label \"other\" abbreviates the set of labels a :a, b:b,.., z:z, the identity pairs formed from all symbols that belong to the alphabet but are not mentioned explicitly in this particular rule. This diagram shows no transition over the pair N:N and the transducer therefore blocks if it sees N on both tapes. This is another abbreviatory convention that is typically used in implementations to reduce transducer storage requirements, and we use it here to simplify the state diagrams we draw. In formal treatments such as the one we present below, the transition function is total and provides for transitions from every state over every pair of symbols. Any transition we do not show in these diagrams in fact terminates at a single nonfinal state, the \"failure\" state, which we also do not show.","Figure 3 is the more complicated transducer that models the obligatory behavior of Rule 1 (N --* m~ . +[labial]). This machine blocks in state 1 if it sees the pair N:m not followed by one of the labials p, b, m. It blocks in state 2 if it encounters the pair N:N followed by a labial on both tapes, thus providing for the situation in which the rule is not applied even though its conditions are satisfied. If it does not block and both tapes are eventually exhausted, it accepts them just in case it is then in one of the final states, 0 or 2, shown as double circles. It rejects the tapes if it ends up in the nonfinal state 1, indicating that the second tape is not a valid translation of the first one.","We have described transducers as acceptors of pairs of tapes that stand in a certain relation. But they can also be interpreted asymmetrically, as functions either from 334 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems other, b:b m:m p:p","b:b m:m P:P N:m N:N Figure 3 Rule 1 as obligatory.","b:b m:m p:p other, n:n b:b m:m p:p N:m N:n Figure 4 Composition of obligatory Rules 1 and 2. more abstract to less abstract strings or the other way around. Either of the tapes can contain an input string, in which case the output will be written on the other. In each transition the machine matches the symbol specified for the input tape and writes the one for the output. When the first tape contains the input, the machine models the generative application of the rule; when the second tape contains the input, it models the inversion of the rule. Thus, compared with the rewriting rules from which they are derived, finite-state transducers have the obvious advantage of formal and computational simplicity. Whereas the exact procedure for inverting rules themselves is not obvious, it is clearly different from the procedure required for generating. The corresponding transducers, on the other hand, have the same straightforward interpretation in both directions.","While finite-state transducers are attractive for their formal simplicity, they have a much more important advantage for our purposes. A pair of transducers connected through a common tape models the composition of the relations that those transducers represent. The pair can be regarded as performing a transduction between the outer tapes, and it turns out that a single finite-state transducer can be constructed that performs exactly this transduction without incorporating any analog of the intermediate tape. In short, the relations accepted by finite-state transducers are closed under serial composition. Figure 4 shows the composition of the m-machine in Figure 3 and the n-machine in Figure 2. This transducer models the cascade in which the output of Rule 1 is the input to Rule 2. 335 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 N m 0-- 0 N Figure 5 Generation of intractable."]},{"title":"i t i Figure 6","paragraphs":["Generation of impractical. -- 1 BLOCK: No Labial t r"]},{"title":",t o l t r","paragraphs":["N p r"]},{"title":"lifo","paragraphs":["m p r N n 2 BLOCK: Labial a a","This machine is constructed so that it encodes all the possible ways in which the m-machine and n-machine could interact through a common tape. The only interesting interactions involve N, and these are summarized in the following table: input m-machine output I","L input n-machine output I N labial follows m m N nonlabial follows N n An N in the input to the m-machine is converted to m before a labial and this m remains unchanged by the n-machine. The only instances of N that reach the n-machine must therefore be followed by nonlabials and these must be converted to n. Accordingly, after converting N to m, the composed machine is in state 1, which it can leave only by a transition over labials. After converting N to n, it enters state 2, from which there is no labial transition. Otherwise, state 2 is equivalent to the initial state.","Figure 5 illustrates the behavior of this machine as a generator applied to the abstract string iNtractable. Starting in state 0, the first transition over the \"other\" arc produces i on the output tape and returns to state 0. Two different transitions are then possible for the N on the input tape. These carry the machine into states 1 and 2 and output the symbols m and n respectively. The next symbol on the input tape is t. Since this is not a labial, no transition is possible from state 1, and that branch of the process therefore blocks. On the other branch, the t matches the \"other\" transition back to state 0 and the machine stays in state 0 for the remainder of the string. Since state 0 336 Ronald M.

Figure 6 is a similar representation for the generation of impractical.","Figures 7 and 8 illustrate this machine operating as a recognizer. As we pointed out earlier, there are two results when the cascade of rules that this machine represents is inverted on the string intractable. As Figure 7 shows, the n can be mapped into n by the n:n transition at state 0 or into N by the transition to state 2. The latter transition is acceptable because the following t is not a labial and thus matches against the \"other\" transition to state 0. When the following symbol is a labial, as in Figure 8, the process blocks. Notice that the string iNput that would have been written on the intermediate tape before the machines were composed is blocked after the second symbol by constraints coming from the m-machine.","Repeated composition reduces the machines corresponding to the rules of a complete phonological grammar to a single transducer that works with only two tapes, one containing the abstract phonological string and the other containing its phonetic realization. General methods for constructing transducers such as these rely on fundamental mathematical notions that we develop in the next section. 3. Mathematical Concepts and Tools Formal languages are sets of strings, mathematical objects constructed from a finite alphabet E by the associative operation of concatenation. Formal language theory has classified string sets, the subsets of E*, in various ways and has developed corre-337 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 spondences between languages, grammatical notations for describing their member strings, and automata for recognizing them. A similar conceptual framework can be established for string relations. These are the collections of ordered tuples of strings, the subsets of ~* x ... x ~*.","We begin by defining an n-way concatenation operation in terms of the familiar concatenation of simple strings. If X = (xl, x2, . . . x,) and Y = (Yl, Y2, . . . yn) are n-tuples of strings, then the concatenation of X and Y, written X. Y or simply XY, is defined by X. Y=# IXlYl,X2Y2,...Xnyn) That is, the n-way concatenation of two string-tuples is the tuple of strings formed by string concatenation of corresponding elements. The length of a string-tuple IX] can be defined in terms of the lengths of its component strings:"]},{"title":"IXl =ai ~ Ixil","paragraphs":["i This has the expected property that IX. Y] = IX] + IY], even if the elements of X or of Y are of different lengths. Just as the empty string c is the identity for simple string concatenation, the n-tuple all of whose elements are e is the identity for n-way concatenation, and the length of such a tuple is zero. 3.1 Regular Relations and Finite-State Transducers With these definitions in hand, it is immediately possible to construct families of string relations that parallel the usual classes of formal languages. Recall, for example, the usual recursive definition of a regular language over an alphabet G (superscript i denotes concatenation repeated i times, according to the usual convention, and we let G~ denote G t3 {e}): . 2. . The empty set and {a} for all a in E ~ are regular languages.

We can use exactly the same scheme to define regular n-relations in terms of n-way concatenation: . 2. . The empty set and {a} for all a in ~ x ... x G~ are regular n-relations. If R1, R2, and R are regular n-relations, then so are R1 • R2 = {xy ] x E Rl,y E R2} (n-way concatenation) R1 U R2 (union)","OO",". R* = U R' (n-way Kleene closure)","i=0 There are no other regular n-relations. 338 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems Other families of relations can also be defined by analogy to the formal language case. For example, a system of context-free rewriting rules can be used to define a context-free n-relation simply by introducing n-tuples as the terminal symbols of the grammar. The standard context-free derivation procedure will produce tree structures with n-tuple leaves, and the relational yield of such a grammar is taken to be the set of n-way concatenations of these leaves. Our analysis of phonological rule systems does not depend on expressive power beyond the capacity of the regular relations, however, and we therefore confine our attention to the mathematical and computational properties of these more limited systems. The relations we refer to as \"regular,\" to emphasize the connection to formal language theory, are often known as \"rational relations\" in the algebraic literature, where they have been extensively studied (e.g. Eilenberg 1974).","The descriptive notations and accepting automata for regular languages can also be generalized to the n-dimensional case. An n-way regular expression is simply a regular expression whose terms are n-tuples of alphabetic symbols or c. For ease of writing we separate the elements of an n-tuple by colons.

The regular-expression notation provides for concatenation, union, and Kleene-closure of these terms. The accepting automata for regular n-relations are the n-way finite-state transducers. As illustrated by the two-dimensional examples given in Section 2, these are an obvious extension of the standard one-tape finite-state machines.","The defining properties of the regular languages, regular expressions, and finite-state machines are the basis for proving the well-known Kleene correspondence theorems showing the equivalence of these three string-set characterizations. These essential properties carry over in the n-way generalizations, and therefore the correspondence theorems also generalize. In particular, simple analogs of the standard inductive proofs show that Every n-way regular expression describes a regular n-relation; Every regular n-relation is described by an n-way regular expression; Every n-tape finite-state transducer accepts a regular n-relation; and Every regular n-relation is accepted by an n-tape finite-state transducer. The strength of our analysis method comes from the equivalence of these different characterizations. While we reason about the regular relations in algebraic and set-theoretic terms, we conveniently describe the sets under discussion by means of regular expressions, and we prove essential properties by constructive operations on the corresponding finite-state transducers. In the end, of course, it is the transducers that satisfy our practical, computational goals.","A nondeterministic (one-tape) finite-state machine is a quintuple (G,"]},{"title":"Q,q,F,","paragraphs":["5), where G is a finite alphabet, Q is a finite set of states, q c Q is the initial state, and F c Q is the set of final states.

The proof in the other direction is more tedious. Suppose R is a same-length regular relation accepted by some transducer T which has transitions of the form u:e or e:v (with u and v not e; 343 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 we know all e:e transitions can be eliminated by the obvious generalization of the one-tape e-removal algorithm). We systematically remove all c-containing transitions in a finite sequence of steps each of which preserves the accepted relation. A path from the start-state to a given nonfinal state will contain some number of u:~ transitions and some number of c:v transitions, and those two numbers will not necessarily be identical. However, for all paths to that state the difference between those numbers will be the same, since the discrepancy must be reversed by each path that leads from that state to a final state. Let us define the imbalance characterizing a state to be the difference in the number of u: c and c: v transitions on paths leading to that state. Since an acyclic path cannot produce an imbalance that differs from zero by more than the number of states in the machine, the absolute value of the imbalance is bounded by the machine size. On each iteration our procedure has the effect of removing all states with the maximum imbalance. First, we note that transitions of the form u :v always connect a pair of states with the same imbalance. Such transitions can be eliminated in favor of an equivalent sequence of transitions c:v and u:c through a new state whose imbalance is one less than the imbalance of the original two states. Now suppose that k > 0 is the maximum imbalance for the machine and that all u:v transitions between states of imbalance k have been eliminated. If q is a k-imbalance state, it will be entered only by u: c transitions from k - 1 states and left only by c: v transitions also to k - 1 states. For all transitions u:~ from a state p to q and all transitions ¢:v from q to r, we construct a new transition u:v from p to r. Then we remove state q from the machine along with all transitions entering or leaving it. These manipulations do not change the accepted relation but do reduce by one the number of k-imbalance states. We repeat this procedure for all k states and then move on to the k - 1 states, continuing until no states remain with a positive imbalance. A symmetric procedure is then used to eliminate all the states whose imbalance is negative. In the end, T will have been transformed to an c-free transducer that still accepts R. []","The same-length regular relations are obviously closed under union, concatenation, composition, inverse, and reverse, in addition to intersection, since all of these operations preserve both regularity and string length. An additional path-language argument shows that they are also closed under relative difference. Let T1 and T2 be e-free acceptors for R1 and R2 and construct an fsm P that accepts the regular pair-symbol language Paths(T1) -Paths(T2). A string-pair belongs to the regular relation Rel(P) if and only if it has an accepting path in T~ but not in T2. Thus Rel(P) is R1 - a2. Being a subset of R1, it is also same-length. 3.4 Summary of Mathematical Tools Let us summarize the results to this point.

Rewriting Rule Formalisms Phonological rewriting rules have four parts. Their general form is -~ ~/,,X p This says that the string ~ is to be replaced by (rewritten as) the string ~b whenever it is preceded by A and followed by p. If either A or p is empty, it is omitted and, if both are empty, the rule is reduced to The contexts, or environments, ,~ and p are usually allowed to be regular expressions over a basic alphabet of segments. This makes it easy to write, say, a vowel-harmony rule that replaces a vowel that is not specified for backness as a back or front vowel according as the vowel in the immediately preceding syllable is back or front. This is because the Kleene closure operator can be used to state that any number of consonants can separate the two vowels. The rule might be formulated as follows: Vi ---+ Bi/BjC * where Bi is the back counterpart of the vowel Vi, and Bj is another (possibly different) back vowel. There is less agreement on the restrictions that should apply to ~ and ~b, the portions that we refer to as the center of the rule. They are usually simple strings and some theorists would restrict them to single segments. However, these restrictions are without interesting mathematical consequences and we shall be open to all versions of the theory if we continue to take it that these can also denote arbitrary regular languages.","It will be important to provide for multiple applications of a given rule, and indeed, this will turn out to be the major source of difficulty in reexpressing rewriting rules in terms of regular relations and finite-state transducers. We have already remarked that our methods work only if the part of the string that is actually rewritten by a rule is excluded from further rewriting by that same rule. The following optional rule shows that this restriction is necessary to guarantee regularity: c --. ab/a __ b If this rule is allowed to rewrite material that it introduced on a previous application, it would map the regular language {ab} into the context-free language {anb n I 1 < n}, which we have already seen is beyond the power of regular relations.","However, we do not forbid material produced in one application of a rule from serving as context for a subsequent application of that rule, as would routinely be the case for a vowel-harmony rule, for example. It is this restriction on interactions between different applications of a given rule that motivates the notation --. ~/;~ p rather than The context refers to a part of the string that the current application of the rule does not change but which, since it may have been changed in a previous application, allows for an interaction between successive applications. 346 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems","The important outstanding question concerning interactions between applications of one and the same rule at different positions in a string has to do with the relative order in which they take place. Consider the obligatory rule a --* b/ab __ ba as applied to the string abababababa At least three different outcomes are possible, namely: (1) abbbabbbaba (2) ababbbabbba (3) abbbbbbbbba Result (1) is obtained if the first application is at the leftmost eligible position in the string; each successive application applies to the output of any preceding one, and further to the right in the string. We call this the left-to-right strategy. The corresponding right-to-left strategy gives rise to (2). Result (3) comes from identifying all possible rule applications in the original string and carrying them out simultaneously. All three strategies have been advocated by phonologists. We shall assume that each rule is marked individually to show which strategy is to be employed for it. We shall concentrate on these three strategies, but other less obvious ones can also be treated by simple rearrangements of our techniques.","Optional rules and most obligatory rules will produce at least one output string, perhaps just a copy of the input if the conditions for application are nowhere satisfied. But certain obligatory rules are anomalous in that they may produce no output at all. The following left-to-right rule is a case in point: -. b/b If a string containing the symbol b is input to this rule, another b will be inserted immediately after it, and that one will serve to trigger the rule again. This process will never terminate, and no finite-length output is ever produced. Strange as they may seem, rules like this are useful as filters to eliminate undesired paths of derivation.","In contrast to obligatory rules, optional rules typically produce many outputs. For example, if the rule above (a --* b/ab __ ba) is marked as optional and left-to-right and is also applied to the string abababababa, the following, in addition to (1), would be among its outputs: (4) abbbabababa (5) ababbbababa The string (4) is similar to (1) except that only the leftmost application of the rule has been carried out. For (5) the application in the middle would not have been possible for the obligatory rule and is possible here only because the necessary context was not destroyed by an application further to the left.","Kenstowicz and Kisseberth (1979), who discuss a number of rule application strategies in great detail, cite a case in which one rule seems to be required in the grammars 347 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 of two languages.

However, we shall see that directionality in rewriting rules is not mirrored by directionality in the transducers. Instead, directionality determines which of the two tapes the left and right contexts must appear on. In a left-to-right rule, the left context of the rule is to be verified against the portion of the string that results from previous applications of that rule, whereas the right context is to be verified against the portion of the string that has not yet been changed but may eventually be modified by applications further to the right.

We also assume that rules are annotated to show whether they are to be taken as obligatory or optional. We have considered only obligatory rules up to now, but optional rules are also commonly used to account for cases of free variation. The mathematical treatment of optional rules will turn out to be a simpler case of what must be done for obligatory rules and, therefore, a natural step in the general development.","As well as providing for various strategies for reapplying a single rule, we also consider the possibility of what we call a"]},{"title":"batch","paragraphs":["rule. This is a set of rules that the application strategies treat as one entity, the individual rules being otherwise unordered relative to one another. This mode of rule application will turn out to be interesting even if it is not an explicit part of any particular phonological formalism because, as we shall see, it constitutes an essential step in the interpretation of rules that use features to refer to underspecified segments. A good example of this is the vowel-harmony rule referred to earlier, namely Vi --~ Bi / BjC* In feature notation, this could be written +syllabic ] [ +back -consonantal ~ [ +back ]/ +syllabic","-consonantal [ +consonantal ]* __ meaning that a segment that is specified as a vowel comes also to be specified as back when the most recent preceding vowel is back; all other features remain unchanged. The grammar will presumably contain another rule that will apply in circumstances when this one does not, namely Vi --+ Fi / FjC* or +syllabic ] [ -back -consonantal --+ [ -back ]/ +syllabic","-consonantal [ +consonantal ]* _, 349 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 except, of course, that the context can be omitted from whichever of the two is placed second in an ordered list of rules. But this is precisely the question: What is the proper order of this pair of rules?","Consider an actual case, namely, vowel harmony in Turkish. Let A represent an abstract vowel with e and a as its front and back realizations, and I another abstract vowel with i and dotless i as its front and back counterparts. The first of these occurs, for example, in the abstract plural suffix lAr, and the second occurs in the possessive suffix Im, meaning 'my.' Both suffixes can be used together, and the harmony is illustrated by the different realizations of the abstract vowels in the forms apartmanlArlm and adreslArlm. These appear as apartmanlamm 'my apartments' and adreslerim 'my addresses.' Using only the simple non-feature notation we started out with, we can describe this variation with the following four rules: A ~ e/eC* A -~ a I --* i/eC* I --+ 1 The proper surface forms for these words are produced if these rules are ordered as we have given them--inserting front vowels first--and if each of them is applied from left to right. However, applying the rules in this way gives the wrong result when we create the dative possessive form of adres instead of the possessive plural. The dative suffix is spelled simply as the abstract vowel A, and the abstract adreslmA should be realized as adresime if harmony is respected. But the rules as given will map adreslmA to adresima instead. This is because the earlier rules apply to the final A at a time before the context required for that vowel has been established. Reordering the rules to fix this problem will cause the previous correct analyses to fail. The proper results in all cases come only if we describe Turkish vowel harmony with rules that proceed left to right through the string as a group, applying at each position whichever one matclies. This is the mode of application for a set of rules collected together as a batch.","The notion of a batch rule apparently has not arisen as a distinctive formal concept in phonological theories. The reason is doubtless that batch rules are unnecessarily prolix and, in particular, they fail to capture generalizations that can almost always be made about the individual rules that make up a batch. Phonologists prefer rules that are based on feature matrices. These rules allow segments to be referred to by specifying which members of a finite set of properties they do or do not have. A feature matrix can specify a segment completely, in which case it is equivalent to the unanalyzable segment names we have been using, or it can leave it underspecified. Feature matrices therefore constitute an abbreviatory convention with the advantage that what is easy to abbreviate will be motivated to just the extent that the features themselves are motivated. An underspecified segment corresponds to a set of fully specified segments, and a rule that contains underspecified segments corresponds to a set of rules that are to be applied in batch mode.","Feature matrices based on a well-motivated set of features allow the phonologist to capture significant generalizations and thus effectively to reduce the components of our batch rules to a single rule in most cases. A significant addition that has been made to the basic machinery of feature-based rules consists of variables written with lowercase Greek letters a, t, 7, etc. and ranging over the values + and -. We can use them, for example, to collapse our vowel-harmony rules into a single one as follows: 350 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems +syllabic 1 [ c~back -consonantal --+ [ c~back ]/ +syllabic","-consonantal [ +consonantal ]* __ Both occurrences of the variable ~ must be instantiated to the same value, either + or -, at each application of the rule. What the rule now says is that a vowel takes its backness from the vowel in the preceding syllable; that is, the most recent preceding vowel that is separated from it by zero or more consonants.","While the explicit use of variables is an important addition to the notation, it was in fact foreshadowed by a property of the initial feature system, namely that features not explicitly mentioned in the center of a rule were assumed to be carried over from the input to the output. Without this convention, an explicit variable would have been required for each of these. Explicit feature variables do indeed increase the abbreviatory power of the notation, but, as we show below, they can be translated systematically into batch rules over unanalyzable segments.","We pay special attention to batch rules, feature matrices, and feature variables because they require some nonobvious extensions to the treatment we provide for ordinary rules with unanalyzable symbols. On the other hand, we have nothing to say about the many other notational devices that phonologists have proposed for collapsing rules. These abbreviatory conventions are either already subsumed by the general regular languages we allow as rule components or can be translated in obvious ways to simply ordered rules or batch rules. 5. Rewriting Rules as Regular Relations We now come to the central problem of proving that an arbitrary rule in our formalism denotes a regular string relation and is thus accepted by an equivalent finite-state transducer. A rule has the general form -~ ~/~ P where G ~b, A, and p are arbitrary regular expressions. The mode of application of the rule is governed by additional parametric specifications, including for example whether the rule applies from left to right or right to left, and whether it is obligatory or optional.","The replacement that such a rule performs is modeled by a relation"]},{"title":"Replace","paragraphs":["initially defined as follows:"]},{"title":"Replace","paragraphs":["= lid(G*)"]},{"title":"Opt(~","paragraphs":["x ~b)]* The final asterisk allows for repetitions of the basic ~ x ~b mapping, and"]},{"title":"Id(~*)","paragraphs":["allows identical corresponding substrings to come between successive applications of the rule.

We do this in a series of approximations. 351 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 5.1 Context Requirements As a first step, we might be tempted simply to add the context restrictions as necessary conditions of the ~b x ~p replacement:"]},{"title":"Replace","paragraphs":["= lid(P,*)"]},{"title":"Opt(Id( A ) ~ x ~ Id(p) )]*","paragraphs":["This relation includes strings where the q~ x ~p replacement occurs only when immediately preceded and followed by identical substrings satisfying A and p, respectively.

As a next approximation, we avoid this confusion by carefully distinguishing and keeping track of these various roles.

Thus, the relation must disregard the markers corresponding to those occurrences inside the identity substrings between rule applications.

The brackets that necessarily follow such prefixes must not prevent the longer instances from also being identified and marked, and right-context brackets also must not interfere with left-context identification. The ignore operators in the expression P-iff-S (~*<,~<, < ~*< )> allow for these possibilities. This disregards slightly too many brackets, however: since an instance of &< followed by an < is also an instance of ~<, it must be followed by another bracket, and so on. The only (finite) strings that belong to this language are those that contain no instances of A at all! To correctly identify and mark left-contexts, the bracket following a &< instance must not be ignored. Thus, the requisite set of strings is the regular language Leftcontext(&, <, >), where the Leflcontext operator is defined as follows: Leflcontext( &, l, r) = P-iff-S(C? At - ~? l, lYe, T) r We parameterize this operator for the left-context pattern and the actual brackets so that it can be used in other definitions below.","The other complication arises in rules intended to insert or delete material in the string, so that either ~ or ~b includes the empty string e. Consider the left-to-right rule a--*e / b Iterated applications of this rule can delete an arbitrary sequence of a's, converting strings of the form baaaa.., a into simply b. The single b at the beginning serves as left-context for applications of the rule to each of the subsequent a's. This presents a problem for the constructions we have developed so far: The Replace relation requires a distinct < marker for each application of the rule. The < that sanctions the deletion of the leftmost a in the string is therefore not available to delete the next one. How-ever, the Leflcontext operator as defined disallows two left-context brackets in a row. Our solution is to insert an explicit character 0 to represent the deleted material. If Leflcontext ignores this character in &, 0 will always be followed by another left bracket and thus another rule application is possible.","The auxiliary symbol 0 is not in ~. or in the set of context brackets. It will substitute for the empty strings that might appear in the center of rules (in ~ or ~b), but it is a genuine symbol in an expanded alphabet which, unlike the normal e, actually appears as a distinct element in character strings. The Prologue relation is extended to freely introduce 0 as well as the brackets in m: Prologue = Intro(m U {0}) We then construct alternative versions of q~ and ~b in which this special symbol replaces the true empty strings. We define","~0 ~ q~ ife¢~ = I.

The regular relation that models the optional application of a rule is formed by composition of these pieces. The order of composition depends on whether the rule is specified as applying iteratively from left to right or from right to left.","As noted in Section 4, the difference is that for left-to-right rules, the left-context expression & can match against the output of a previous (that is, leftward) application of the same rule, but the right-context expression p must match against the as yet unchanged input string. These observations are directly modeled by the order in which the various rule components are combined. For a left-to-right rule, the right context is checked on the input (4) side of the replacement, while the left context is checked on the output (~;) side. The regular relation and corresponding transducer for a left-355 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 to-right optional rule is therefore defined by the following sequence of compositions: Prologue o","Id(Rightcontext(p, <, >)) o Replace o","Id(Leflcontext(A, <, >)) o Prologue -1 Both left- and right-context brackets are freely introduced on input strings, strings in which the right-context bracket is mislocated are rejected, and the replacement takes place only between the now-constrained right-context brackets and the still free left-context markers. This imposes the restriction on left-context markers that they at least appear before replacements, although they may or may not freely appear elsewhere. The left-context checker ensures that left-context markers do in fact appear only in the proper locations on the output. Finally, all brackets are eliminated, yielding strings in the output language.","The context-checking situation is exactly reversed for right-to-left rules: the left-context matches against the unchanged input string while the right-context matches against the output.

That is, we must restrict the relation so that, disregarding for the moment the effect of overlapping applications, every substring of the form A~p in the first element of a pair corresponds to a A~pp in the second element of that pair.

Thus, given a careful implementation of the calculus of regular languages and regular relations, our analysis provides a general method for compiling complicated rule conditions and actions into very simple computational devices. 6. Grammars of Rewriting Rules The individual rules of a grammar are meant to capture independent phonological generalizations. The grammar formalism also specifies how the effects of the different rules are to be combined together to account for any interactions between the generalizations. The simplest method of combination for rewriting rule grammars is for the rules to be arranged in an ordered sequence with the interpretation that the first rule applies to the input lexical string, the second rule applies to the output of the first rule, and so on. As we observed earlier, the typical practice is to place specialized rules with more elaborate context requirements earlier in the sequence so that they will override more general rules appearing later.","The combined effect of having one rule operate on the output of another can be modeled by composing the string relations corresponding to each rule. If the string relations for two rules are regular, we know that their composition is also regular. The following result is then established by induction on the number of rules in the grammar: Theorem If G = (R1,..., Rn) is a grammar defined as a finite ordered sequence of rewriting rules each of which denotes a regular relation, then the set of input-output string-pairs for the grammar as a whole is the regular relation given by R1 o... o Rn. This theorem also has an immediate corollary: Corollary The input-output string pairs of every such rewriting grammar are accepted by a single finite-state transducer. Again, given an implementation of the regular calculus, a grammar transducer can be constructed algorithmically from its rules.","We can also show that certain more complex methods of combination also denote regular relations. Suppose a grammar is specified as a finite sequence of rules but with a further specification that rules in some subsequences are to be treated as a block of mutually exclusive alternatives. That is, only one rule in each such subsequence can be applied in any derivation, but the choice of which one varies freely between derivations. The alternative choices among the rules in a block can be modeled as the union of the regular relations they denote individually, and regular relations are closed under this operation. Thus this kind of grammar also reduces to a finite composition of regular relations.","In a more intricate arrangement, the grammar might specify a block of alternatives made up of rules that are not adjacent in the ordering sequence. For example, suppose the grammar consists of the sequence (R1,R2,R3,R4,R5), where R2 and R4 constitute a block of exclusive alternatives. This cannot be handled by simple union of the block rules, because that would not incorporate the effect of the intervening rule R3. However, this grammar can be interpreted as abbreviating a choice between two 364 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems different sequences, (R1, R2, R3, Rs) and (R1, R3, R4, Rs), and thus denotes the regular relation a I o [(a 2 oa3) U (a 3 oR4) ] oR 5 The union and composition operators can be interleaved in different ways to show that a wide variety of rule combination regimes are encompassed by the regular relations. There may be grammars specifying even more complex rule interactions, and, depending on the formal details, it may be possible to establish their regularity by other techniques; for example, by carefully managing a set of distinguished auxiliary symbols that code inter-rule constraints.","We know, of course, that certain methods for combining regular rules give rise to nonregular mappings. This is true, for example, of unrestricted cyclic application of the rules in a finite ordered sequence. According to a cyclic grammar specification, a given input string is mapped through all the rules in the sequence to produce an output string, and that output string then becomes a new input for a reapplication of all the rules, and the process can be repeated without bound. We can demonstrate that such a grammar is nonregular by considering again the simple optional rule ~--*ab/ab We showed before that this rule does not denote a regular relation if it is allowed to rewrite material that was introduced on a previous application. Under those circumstances it would map the regular language"]},{"title":"{ab}","paragraphs":["into the context-free language"]},{"title":"{ anbn","paragraphs":["I 1 _< n}. But we would get exactly the same result from an unrestricted cyclic grammar whose ordered sequence consists only of this single rule. In effect, cyclic reapplication of the rule also permits it to operate arbitrarily, often on its own output. In the worst case, in fact, we know that the computations of an arbitrary Turing machine can be simulated by a rewriting grammar with unrestricted rule reapplication.","These results seem to create a dilemma for our regularity analysis. Many phonological formalisms based on ordered sets of rewriting rules provide for cyclic rule applications. The underlying notion is that words have a bracketed structure reflecting their morphological composition. For example,"]},{"title":"unenforceable","paragraphs":["has the structure"]},{"title":"[un[[en[force]]able]].","paragraphs":["The idea of the cycle is that the ordered sequence of rules is applied to the innermost bracketed portion of a word first. Then the innermost set of brackets is removed and the procedure is repeated. The cycle continues in this way until no brackets remain.","The cycle has been a major source of controversy ever since it was first proposed by Chomsky and Halle (1968), and many of the phenomena that motivated it can also be given noncyclic descriptions. Even for cases where a nonrecursive, iterative account has not yet emerged, there may be restrictions on the mode of reapplication that limit the formal power of the grammar without reducing its empirical or explanatory coverage. For example, the bracket erasure convention means that new string material becomes accessible to the rules on each cycle. If, either implicitly or explicitly, there is also a finite bound on the amount of old material to which rules in the new cycle can be sensitive, it may be possible to transform the recursive specification to an equivalent iterative one. This is analogous to the contrast between center-embedding context-free grammars and grammars with only right- or left-linear rules; the latter are known to generate only regular languages. Unfortunately, phonological theories are usually not presented in enough formal detail for us to carry out such a mathematical analysis. The regularity of cyclic phonological formalisms will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis, taking their more precise specifications into account. 365 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3","We have shown that every noncyclical rewriting grammar does denote a regular relation. We now consider the opposite question: Is every regular relation denoted by some noncyclic rewriting grammar? We can answer this question in the affirmative: Theorem Every regular relation is the set of input/output strings of some noncyclic rewriting grammar with boundary-context rules. Proof Let R be an arbitrary regular relation and let T = (G, Q, q0, F, 6) be a finite-state transducer that accepts it. Without loss of generality we assume that G and Q are disjoint. We construct a rewriting grammar that simulates the operation of T, deriving a string y from a string x if and only if the pair Ix, Y/is accepted by T. There will be four rules in the grammar that together implement the provisions that T starts in state q0, makes transitions from state to state only as allowed by 6, and accepts a string only if the state it reaches at the end of the string is in F. Let ~, U Q u {#,$} be the alphabet of the grammar, where # is a boundary symbol not in either G or Q and $ is another distinct symbol that will be used in representing the finality of a state. Our rules will introduce states into the string between ordinary tape symbols and remove them to simulate the state-to-state advance of the transducer. The first rule in the grammar sequence is the simple start rule: --* qo/# -- (obligatory, left-to-right) The effect of this rule is to introduce the start-state as a symbol only at the beginning of the input string, as specified in the rule by the boundary symbol #. The string abc is thus rewritten by this rule to qoabc. The following sets of rules are defined to represent the state-to-state transitions and the final states of the transducer: Transitions = {u ~ vqj/qi __ I qi~qj E Q;u~v E G*; and qj E 6(qi~u,v)} Final = {~ --* $/qi # I qi C F} The second rule of the grammar is an obligatory, left-to-right batch rule consisting of all the rules in Transitions U Final. If the transition function carries the transducer from qi to qj over the pair /u, v/, there will be a rule in Transitions that applies to the string ... qiu.., at the position just after the substring beginning with qi and produces • .. qivqj.., as its output. Because 6 is a total function on Q x G* x G~, some subrule will apply at every string position in the left-to-right batch scan. The state-context for the left-most application of this rule is the start-state q0, and subrules corresponding to start-state transitions are selected. This introduces a state-symbol that makes available at the next position only subrules corresponding to transitions at one of the start-state's successors. The batch rule eventually writes a state at the very end of the string. If that state is in F, the corresponding Final subrule will apply to insert $ at the end of the string. If the last state is not in F, $ will not be inserted and the state will remain as the last symbol in the string. Thus, after the batch rule has completed its application, an input string x will have been translated to an output string consisting of intermixed symbols from Q and ~. We can prove by a simple induction that the string of states obtained by ignoring symbols in G U {#, $} corresponds to a sequence of state-to-state moves that the transducer can make on the pair Ix, Y/, where y comes from ignoring $ and all state-symbols in the output string. 366 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems","Two tasks remain: we must filter the output to eliminate any strings whose derivation does not include a Final subrule application, and we must remove all state-symbols and $ to obtain the ultimate output string. If a Final rule did not apply, then the last element in the batch output string is a state, not the special character $. We must formulate a rule that will \"bleed\" the derivation, producing no output at all if its input ends in a state-symbol instead of $. We can achieve this with an anomalous obligatory rule whose output would be infinitely long if its input ever satisfies the conditions for its application. The following rule behaves in this way: e --* $/Q # (obligatory, left-to-right) It has the effect of filtering strings that do not represent transitions to a final state by forcing indefinitely many insertions of $ when no single $ is present. The output of this rule will be all and only the strings that came from a previous application of a Final rule. The last rule of the grammar is a trivial clean-up rule that produces the grammar's final output strings: Q u $ ~ c (obligatory, left-to-right) This completes the proof of the theorem. We have constructed for any regular relation an ordered sequence of four rules (including a batch rule with finitely many subrules) that rewrites a string x to y just in case the pair (x, y) belongs to the relation. []","We remark that there are alternative but perhaps less intuitive proofs of this theorem framed only in terms of simple nonbatch rules. But this result cannot be established without making use of boundary-context rules. Without such rules we can only simulate a proper subclass of the regular relations, those that permit identity prefixes and suffixes of unbounded length to surround any nonidentity correspondences. It is interesting to note that for much the same reason, Ritchie (1992) also made crucial use of two-level boundary-context rules to prove that the relations denoted by Koskenniemi's (1985) two-level grammars are also coextensive with the regular relations. Moreover, putting Ritchie's result together with ours gives the following: Theorem Ordered rewriting grammars with boundaries and two-level constraint grammars with boundaries are equivalent in their expressive power. Although there may be aesthetic or explanatory differences between the two formal systems, empirical coverage by itself cannot be used to choose between them. 7. Two-Level Rule Systems Inspired in part by our early report of the material presented in this paper (Kaplan and Kay 1981), Koskenniemi (1983) proposed an alternative system for recognizing and producing morphological and phonological word-form variants. Under his proposal, individual generalizations are expressed directly in the state-transition diagrams of finite-state transducers, and their mutual interactions emerge from the fact that every input-output string pair must be accepted simultaneously by all these transducers. Thus, he replaced the serial feeding arrangement of the independent generalizations in a rewriting grammar with a parallel method of combination. In eliminating the intermediate strings that pass from one rewriting rule to another, he also reduced to 367 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 just two the number of linguistically meaningful levels of representation. In two-level parlance, these are usually referred to as the lexical and surface strings. 7.1 The Analysis of Parallel Automata The lexical-surface string sets of the individual generalizations in Koskenniemi's system are clearly regular, since they are defined outright as finite-state transducers. But it is not immediately obvious that the string relation defined by a whole two-level grammar is regular. Koskenniemi gave an operational specification, not an algebraic one, of how the separate transducers are to interact. A pair of strings is generated by a two-level grammar if the pair is accepted separately by each of the transducers, and furthermore, the label on the transition taken by one fst at a particular string position is identical to the label of the transition that every other fst takes at that string position. In essence, he prescribed a transition function 6 for a whole-grammar transducer that allows transitions between states in cross-product state sets just in case they are permitted by literal-matching transitions in the individual machines.","This transition function generalizes to a two-tape transducer the construction of a one-tape finite-state machine for the intersection of two regular languages.

If this were treated just like c, we would be able to say very little about the combined relation. However, the effect of Koskenniemi's literal-matching transition function is achieved by treating 0 as an ordinary tape symbol, so that the individual transducers are C-free. The intersection of their same-length relations is therefore regular. The length-changing effect of the whole-grammar transducer is then provided by mapping 0 onto ~.

With this analysis of the two-level system in terms of regularly-closed operations and same-length relations, we have shown that the string relations accepted by parallel two-level automata are in fact regular.

Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems 7.2 Two-Level Rule Notation Koskenniemi (1983) offered an informal grammatical notation to help explicate the intended effect of the individual transducers and make the generalizations encoded in their state-transition diagrams easier to understand and reason about. However, he proposed no method of interpreting or compiling that notation. In later work (e.g. Karttunen, Koskennienni, and Kaplan 1987; Karttunen and Beesley 1992) the mathematical techniques we presented above for the analysis of rewriting systems were used to translate this notation into the equivalent regular relations and corresponding transducers, and thus to create a compiler for a more intuitive and more tractable two-level rule notation. Ritchie (1992) summarizes aspects of this analysis as presented by Kaplan (1988). Ritchie et al. (1992) describe a program that interprets this notation by introducing and manipulating labels assigned to the states of component finite-state machines. Since these labels have no simple set-theoretic significance, such an approach does not illuminate the formal properties of the system and does not make it easy to combine two-level systems with other formal devices.","Ignoring some notational details, a grammar of two-level rules (as opposed to fsts) includes a specification of a set of \"feasible pairs\" of symbols that we denote by 7r.

The relations corresponding to all the individual rules are all subsets of ~r*, and thus are all of the restricted same-length class (since ~r does not contain e paired with an alphabetic symbol).

Thus the composite relation is regular and also belongs to the same-length subclass, so that the result of intersecting it with the same-length regular relations for other rules will be regular. 7.4 Surface Coercion Rules (~) A surface coercion rule of the form"]},{"title":"~-~l__p","paragraphs":["imposes a requirement on the paired substrings that come between all members of the A and p relations.

The resulting relation does not allow strings in which a ¢: ¢ follows c: c, because ¢ is included in the restrictive domain expression. But 4:e follows and precedes every symbol pair, of course, so the result is a relation that simply prohibits all occurrences of c:c. If, however, we revert to using the domain expression without the {~:~} union, we fall 373 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 back into the difficulty we saw with two-context epenthesis rules: the resulting relation properly ensures that nothing other than b can be inserted after c:c, but it leaves open the possibility of c:c followed by no insertion at all.","A third formulation is necessary to model the intended interpretation of one-context epenthesis rules. This is given by the relation 7r*)xyTc* if only the left-context is specified, or 7c*yp~r* if only p appears. These exclude all strings where an instance of the relevant context is followed by paired substrings not in 7, either because the appropriate number of lexical O's were not (freely) introduced or because those 0's correspond to unacceptable surface material. These two prescriptions can be brought together into the single formula ~r*)~pTc* for all one-context rules, since whichever context is missing is treated as the identity pair c:¢. We can bring out the similarity between this formula and the original Coerce relation by observing that this one is equivalent to 7c*,~[Id(Dom(Tc*))o ~]p~r* because Id(DomOr*)) o-¢ and ~ are the same relation.","We now give a general statement of the Coerce relation that models surface coercions whether they are epenthetic or non-epenthetic: Coerce(T, ~, p) =","7r*A[Id(Dom(X) ) o Y]pTr*, where X = T if r has no epenthetic pairs; X = ~-U {c:e} (or perhaps [0:0]*) if T has only epenthetic pairs","and neither )~ nor p contains e:e; X = ~-* if T has only epenthetic pairs and one of ~ or p does","contain e: c. This definition assumes that T is homogeneous in that either all its string-pairs are epenthetic or none of them are, but we must do further analysis to guarantee that this is the case. In the formalism we are considering, ~- is permitted to be an arbitrary same-length relation, not just the single unit-length pair that two-level systems typically provide for. If ~- contains more than one string-pair, the single rule is interpreted as imposing the constraints that would be imposed by a conjunction of rules formed by substituting for T each of its member string-pairs in turn. Without further specification and even if ~- contains infinitely many pairs, this is the interpretation modeled by the Coerce relation, provided that T is homogeneous. To deal with heterogeneous T relations, we separate the epenthetic and nonepenthetic pairs into two distinct and homogeneous subrelations. We partition an arbitrary 7- into the subrelations T ° and ~-° defined as ~-0 = Ia(0*) o ~-","T ~ ~ T -- T O We then recast a rule of the form r ~ )x __ p as the conjunction of the two rules T o ~ A __ p ~-o ~ ~ __ p These rules taken together represent the desired interpretation of the original, and each of them is properly modeled by exactly one variant of the Coerce relation.","We have now dealt with the major complexities that surface coercion rules present. The compound forms of these rules are quite easy to model. A rule of the form T ¢= ,,~1 __ pl; ,~2 __ p2;... ;/~n __ pn 374 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems is interpreted as coercing to the surface side of ~- if any of the context conditions are met. Auxiliary symbols are not needed to model this interpretation, since there is no iteration to introduce overlap difficulties. The relation for this rule is given simply by the intersection of the individual relations: NCoerce( T, A k, pk) k We conclude our discussion of two-level rules with a brief mention of surface prohibitions. Recall that a prohibition rule indicates that a paired substring must not belong to \"r if it comes between instances of ,~ and p and its lexical side is in the domain of T. We can construct a standard surface coercion rule that has exactly this interpretation by using the complement of 7- restricted to ~-'s domain: [Id(Dom@)) o ~] ~ A __ p As desired, the left side is the relation that maps each string in the domain of ~- to all strings other than those to which T maps it. Surface prohibitions are thus reduced to ordinary surface coercions. 7.5 Grammars of Two-Level Rules The relation for a grammar of rules is formed just as for a grammar of parallel automata. The intersection of the relations for all the individual rules is constructed as a same-length inner relation. This is then composed with the 0 introduction and removal relations to form the outer lexical-to-surface map. Rule-based two-level grammars thus denote regular relations, just as the original transducer-based grammars do. Some grammars may make use of boundary-context rules, in which case a special symbol # can appear in contexts to mark the beginning and end of the strings. These can be modeled with exactly the same technique we outlined for rewriting rules: we compose the additional relation [~:#Id (Era0 # E~0 ) ~:#] at the beginning of the four-level cascade and compose its inverse at the end. As we mentioned before, the two-level grammars with boundary-context rules are the ones that Ritchie (1992) showed were complete for the regular relations.","In reasoning about these systems, it is important to keep clearly in mind the distinction between the outer and inner relations. Ritchie (1992), for example, also proved that the \"languages\" generated by two-level grammars with regular contexts are closed under intersection, but this result does not hold if a grammar's language is taken to be its outer relation. Suppose that G1 has the set {a:b,O:c} as its feasible pairs and the vacuous a:b ~ __ as its only rule, and that G2 has the pairs {a:c, 0:b} and rule a:c =~ __. The domain of both outer (0-free) relations is a*. A string a n is mapped by G1 into strings containing n b's with c's freely intermixed and by G2 into strings containing n c's with b's freely intermixed. The range of the intersection of the outer relations for G1 and G2 thus contains strings with the same number of b's and c's but occurring in any order. This set is not regular, since intersecting it with the regular language b'c* produces the context-free language bnc n. The intersection of the two outer relations is therefore also not regular and so cannot be the outer relation of any regular two-level grammar. 375 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3","We have shown how our regular analysis techniques can be applied to two-level systems as well as rewriting grammars, and that grammars in both frameworks denote only regular relations. These results open up many new ways of partitioning the account of linguistic phenomena in order to achieve descriptions that are intuitively more satisfying but without introducing new formal power or computational machinery. Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen (1992), for example, argued that certain French morphological patterns can be better described as the composition of two separate two-level grammars rather than as a single one. As another option, an entire two-level grammar can be embedded in place of a single rule in an ordered rewriting system. As long as care is taken to avoid inappropriate complementations and intersections, all such arrangements will denote regular relations and can be implemented by a uniform finite-state transducer mechanism. 8. Conclusion Our aim in this paper has been to provide the core of a mathematical framework for phonology. We used systems of rewriting rules, particularly as formulated in SPE, to give concreteness to our work and to the paper. However, we continually sought solutions in terms of algebraic abstractions of sufficiently high level to free them from any necessary attachment to that or any other specific theory. If our approach proves useful, it will only be because it is broad enough to encompass new theories and new variations on old ones. If we have chosen our abstractions well, our techniques will extend smoothly and incrementally to new formal systems. Our discussion of two-level rule systems illustrates how we expect such extensions to unfold. These techniques may even extend to phonological systems that make use of matched pairs of brackets. Clearly, context-free mechanisms are sufficient to enforce dependencies between corresponding brackets, but further research may show that accurate phonological description does not exploit the power needed to maintain the balance between particular pairs, and thus that only regular devices are required for the analysis and interpretation of such systems.","An important goal for us was to establish a solid basis for computation in the domain of phonological and orthographic systems. With that in mind, we developed a well-engineered computer implementation of the calculus of regular languages and relations, and this has made possible the construction of practical language processing systems. The common data structures that our programs manipulate are clearly states, transitions, labels, and label pairs--the building blocks of finite automata and transducers. But many of our initial mistakes and failures arose from attempting also to think in terms of these objects. The automata required to implement even the simplest examples are large and involve considerable subtlety for their construction. To view them from the perspective of states and transitions is much like predicting weather patterns by studying the movements of atoms and molecules or inverting a matrix with a Turing machine. The only hope of success in this domain lies in developing an appropriate set of high-level algebraic operators for reasoning about languages and relations and for justifying a corresponding set of operators and automata for computation.","From a practical point of view, the result of the work reported here has been a set of powerful and sometimes quite complex tools for compiling phonological grammars in a variety of formalisms into a single representation, namely a finite-state transducer. This representation has a number of remarkable advantages: (1) The program required to interpret this representation is simple almost to the point of triviality, no matter how intricate the original grammars might have been. (2) That same program can be used to generate surface or textual forms from underlying lexical representations or 376 Ronald M. Kaplan and Martin Kay Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems to analyze text into a lexical string; the only difference is in which of the two symbols on a transition is regarded as the input and which the output. (3) The interpreter is constant even under radical changes in the theory and the formalism that informed the compiler. (4) The compiler consists almost entirely of an implementation of the basic calculus. Given the operators and data types that this makes available, only a very few lines of code make up the compiler for a particular theory.","Reflecting on the way the relation for a rewriting rule is constructed from simpler relations, and on how these are composed to create a single relation for a complete grammar, we come naturally to a consideration of how that relation should comport with the other parts of a larger language-processing system. We can show, for example, that the result of combining together a list of items that have exceptional phonological behavior with a grammar-derived relation for general patterns is still a regular relation with an associated transducer. If E is a relation for a finite list of exceptional input-output pairs and P is the general phonological relation, then the combination is given by E m [Id(Dom(E)) o P] This relation is regular because E is regular (as is any finite list of pairs); it suppresses the general mapping provided by P for the exceptional items, allowing outputs for them to come from E only. As another example, the finite list of formatives in a lexicon L can be combined with a regular phonology (perhaps with exceptions already folded in) by means of the composition Id(L) o P. This relation enshrines not only the phonological regularities of the language but its lexical inventory as well, and its corresponding transducer would perform phonological recognition and lexical lookup in a single sequence of transitions. This is the sort of arrangement that Karttunen et al. (1992) discuss. Finally, we know that many language classes are closed under finite-state transductions or composition with regular relations--the images of context-free languages, for example, are context-free. It might therefore prove advantageous to seek ways of composing phonology and syntax to produce a new system with the same formal properties as syntax alone.
