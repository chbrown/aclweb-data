I shall begin by presenting some background to the field, followed by a survey of the research themes currently under investigation. Next, an overview of the papers in this collection is given, concluding with an explanation of the one-page commentaries that follow each paper. So, what is phonology, and why should computational linguists care about it? 2. Background Phonology is the study of the systems of sounds that are manifested by natural languages, the significant contrasts between sounds that are relevant to meaning. As such, phonology stands at the interface between grammar, broadly construed, and speech. Much of the richness and complexity of phonology derives from the place it occupies between categorical symbolic systems and parametric physical behavior. Several excellent textbooks are available for readers who wish to learn more about phonology.","Now, why should computational linguists care about phonology? First, phonology is an equally valid area of study for a computational linguist as syntax or semantics. Solutions in one area may generalize to other areas, as we see, for example, where strings of segments are parsed using the same machinery that is used for syntactic * University of Edinburgh, Centre for Cognitive Science, 2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9LW, U.K. (~) 1994 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3 parsing (e.g. chart parsing [Church 1987]), or where a formal system developed for semantic representations of tense is applied to the temporal structure of phonology (Bird and Klein 1990), or where complex arrangements of phonological features are represented in the familiar notation of attribute-value matrices (Wiese 1990). Thus, phonology provides a fresh source of applications for the techniques and technologies of computational linguistics.","However, this only demonstrates a flow of information from computational linguistics to phonology. Can we hope for payoffs in the other direction resulting from a wholesale integration of phonology into computational linguistics? It is instructive to consider"]},{"title":"The Sound Pattern of English","paragraphs":["(Chomsky and Halle 1968) in this regard.

A good place to start is the literature on computational phonology itself, since it interprets the theoretical proposals of phonology in a way that is more accessible to computational linguists. The stakes are high, since it would not be surprising if phonology is still to play an important role in bridging natural language technology and speech technology. For even though there is a methodological and sociological divide, there remains an imperative to develop fully integrated language and speech systems and an enduring need for fresh sources of creative ideas to relate the discrete to the continuous.","Undoubtedly, there will always remain sceptics who think that natural language systems that deal just with the written word can afford to ignore phonology. In a limited sense they are correct. However, in the longer term, I am convinced that the interest in multilingual and multimodal systems will require a more enlightened view of phonology. Many languages have genuinely phonological phenomena evident in the orthography, such as Finnish (Koskenniemi 1984). Even in English we find cases where a spelling rule needs to be sensitive to phonological information. For example, the orthographic rule that selects a vs."]},{"title":"an","paragraphs":["breaks down when a following word begins with a"]},{"title":"written","paragraphs":["vowel but a"]},{"title":"spoken","paragraphs":["consonant or vice versa, as in"]},{"title":"a___u_uranium compound","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"an ytterbium compound.","paragraphs":["Although it largely works for English and a handful of other languages, the assumption that phonology can be ignored by natural language systems will collapse for many of the world's languages (e.g. Finnish, Turkish, and Arabic).","One reason why computational phonology has not had a high profile is that work in this area has often been dealt with under the heading of computational morphology. However, much of what passes as finite-state morphology is actually"]},{"title":"morphophonol-","paragraphs":["ogy--the phonological factors that influence the appearance of morphemes----or even phonology proper. Moreover, the central computational device in finite-state morphology, the finite-state transducer, is not used for specifying the distribution of morphemes (i.e. morphotactics), the other main task of morphology. Therefore, that part of finite-state morphology that is expressed in terms of finite-state transducers, namely moriv Steven Bird Introduction to Computational Phonology phophonology and phonology, is largely coextensive with the domain of SPE. Perhaps the appearance of Kaplan and Kay's paper in this collection is symbolic of the recognition that there is a close interplay between computational morphology and phonology.","A second reason that attention to phonology is warranted is that much of phonology is actually not subsumed by computational morphology and speech technology. In general, work in these two fields has focused on SPE-style phonology alone and has not, by and large, connected with current phonological theory or addressed purely phonological concerns. Again, computational phonology should provide usable implementations of more recent models so that they can be incorporated into computational work on morphology and speech.","Finally, one might reasonably ask why a phonologist ought to be interested in computational phonology. At the most obvious level, computational phonology should provide support for developing theories and testing them against data, removing some of the hackwork involved in achieving formal and empirical adequacy. Additionally, computational phonology may be able to provide formal devices that are useful in phonology proper, as in the case of the information-theoretic evaluation metric (Ellison 1993) that is intended to replace the naive symbol-counting version. One can also observe that phonology has its own divide between theoreticians who work on abstract models supported by small collections of data drawn from a wide variety of languages, and investigators working on large scale analyses of individual languages (such as the work of the Summer Institute of Linguistics on the orthographies of approximately 1,100 languages [D. Crozier, personal communication]). To this observer, it seems like there could be more communication of new data from the field phonologist to the theoretical phonologist and, in the reverse direction, communication of new hypotheses and useful theoretical devices that would play an active part in the search for interesting new data. It seems plausible that computational systems that let phonologists experiment with large amounts of data and a variety of theoretical models have an important part to play in bridging the gap between the 'theory people' and the 'data people.'"]},{"title":"3.

Recent work on integrating phonology with speech synthesis includes Hertz (1990), Coleman (1992), and Dirksen (1992), and there is also a large literature on the phonology of intonation as it relates to synthesis (e.g. Anderson, Pierrehumbert, and Liberman 1984; Ladd 1987).","This concludes the discussion of the various current research themes in computational phonology.

Commentaries The commentaries were conceived as a way of involving more people in the special issue, and of identifying, for each paper, the noteworthy achievements and remaining areas of contention. I felt that this would add interest and perspective to the collection and would enable outsiders to gain a deeper insight into the workings of the field. Two commentators were selected for each paper who have an established reputation for work in the same area of specialization as the paper in question, and who, in some cases, hold contrary views to those being advanced by the authors. Acknowledgments I am deeply indebted to Julia Hirschberg who gave me her full support as I undertook the editorial tasks involved in preparing this collection. She also took sole editorial responsibility for my contribution with Ewan Klein. I am also thankful to the members of SIGPHON, the CL Editorial Board, and many others for the painstaking reviewing they willingly undertook, and to the authors and commentators for their enthusiastic participation in this project and for their comments on this introduction.","References","Albro, D.
