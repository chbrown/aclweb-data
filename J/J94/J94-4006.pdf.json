Introduction","paragraphs":["There are several types of ambiguity in natural languages, including lexical ambiguity, syntactic (or structural) ambiguity, quantifier scope ambiguity, and anaphora (or ambiguity of reference). Each type of ambiguity must be resolved for a natural language understanding program to be effective. Since syntax often limits the possible meanings of a sentence (and the words in the sentence), natural language processing programs often analyze the structure of a sentence before attempting to determine its meaning. However, additional knowledge sources must often be used in understanding, including selectional restrictions, world knowledge, and contextual information. The use of world knowledge and contextual information often requires inference and hence access to the representations of the sentence and possibly its components. But at the same time, because of ambiguity, a program might not be able to enumerate all of the possible representations for a sentence and its components, since just listing all possible structural analyses for syntactically ambiguous sentences can be impractical, and each structural analysis of a sentence typically produces at least one additional meaning.","In this paper, we will focus on the problem of efficiently maintaining syntactic ambiguity while determining the logical representation for a sentence. In particular, we describe an approach that combines shared-packed parse forests with semantic construction routines. This approach allows a program attempting to eliminate ambiguity from a sentence to apply higher level knowledge sources to the logical representations of desired constituents in the parse forest (e.g., it could eliminate alternative parses for a noun phrase (NP) whose representation does not match objects in a world model)."]},{"title":"2. Methods of Handling Syntactic Ambiguity","paragraphs":["Tree structures, called parse trees, are often used to represent the structural properties of a sentence. Because language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is common for a particular sentence to have more than one parse tree. For example, the sentence, Every man saw the boy with his binoculars, has two potential parses. In one parse, the prepositional phrase (PP) with his binoculars is attached to the verb phrase (VP). In the other, it is attached to the object (NP). These two structures give rise to very different meanings for the sentence. In the first case, every man is using the binoculars to see the boy; whereas in the second, the boy has the binoculars.","One way to enable a natural language program to process the meanings of syntactically ambiguous sentences is to incorporate semantic construction routines into a * School of Electrical Engineering, 1285 Electrical Engineering Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1285, USA. Q 1994 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 parser that produces each structural analysis for a sentence, one parse tree at a time, and maps each tree to a separate logical representation. The program must then at-tempt to determine which meaning for the sentence is the intended one. One problem with this approach is that the number of parse trees produced for some ambiguous sentences is quite large. For example, a parser analyzing sentences with multiple PPs can produce a prohibitively large number of possible parses for the sentence. As the number of PPs in a sentence increases, the number of possible parse trees and their corresponding representations grows as the Catalan numbers, C,, = [2n~ 1 (Church \\ n ,' n+l and Patil 1982). For example, a sentence with one object and four post-object PPs (i.e., n = 5) has 42 parses. Since the number of parses for a sentence with multiple PPs grows faster than exponentially (Knuth 1975), the time to list all possible trees and their corresponding meanings can be prohibitive. A one-parse-tree-at-a-time approach that uses no mechanism for storing subresults from a parse (e.g., a chart or parse forest) is inefficient because it cannot reuse the results of the semantic and contextual tests made on a subtree of a rejected parse during the evaluation of an alternative parse tree. The need for efficiency dictates the need for another approach to manage the ambiguity of a sentence.","The efficiency of this approach can be improved by resolving each indeterminacy in the parse as soon as it arises to prevent backtracking (Briscoe 1987). However, this requires that enough information be available at that point in the parse to select among the alternatives. In many cases, this requirement cannot be met; words occurring later in the sentence or possibly in subsequent sentences may be needed to resolve the ambiguity. A slightly different alternative is to work with the highest preference choice only (Alshawi 1990; Briscoe and Carroll 1993). Although this approach is efficient, it provides only the most likely parse (independently of context), not necessarily the correct parse.","An alternative scheme for coping with syntactic ambiguity is to change the grammar rules so that they provide a single parse tree for a syntactically ambiguous sentence and then wait for the semantic routines to pinpoint the parse. To illustrate this strategy, consider a common way to write a rule for an NP with noun modifiers: NP --+ DET N1 N1 --+ NOUN N1 --+ N1 N1 This grammar generates a very large number of possible structures for NPs like the computer science school book. However, it also eliminates from consideration impossible noun modifier structures by not allowing crossover between modifiers. For example, the grammar would never allow a structure such that computer modifies school, which modifies book, and science modifies book. On the other hand, an alternative rule can be used to generate a single structural analysis for the sentence, as shown below: NP --+ DET NOUN* NOUN This rule ignores the structure of noun modifiers of a head noun, placing them all at the same level in the parse tree. Without a structure to limit the possible modifier relations, a semantic routine might incorrectly allow a noun modifier to modify any of the nouns that follow it. To work correctly, the semantic routines would have to encode information already contained in the first set of rules in order to prevent impossible modifications.","Another possibility is to use a least commitment grammar that provides only one of the possible modifier structures for an NP.

D-theory parsers build structures that contain only those relations that are common to all consistent trees such that the choice between alternatives can be handled by higher level knowledge sources. However, D-theory is a purely syntactic theory, which does not construct a semantic interpretation, and in many cases it creates the same underspecified syntactic analysis for sentences that require different types of interpretations. For example, compare I sailed the ship in the ocean with Every man saw the boy with his binoculars. These sentences have very different interpretive characteristics. In the first, the syntactic underspecification is matched by a semantic underspecification; attaching the PP to the NP or VP does not alter the truth value of the sentence. However, the second sentence has two distinct interpretations depending on the resolution of the attachment ambiguity. Hence, for D-theory to be useful in a system that does semantic interpretation, it would need to be coupled with a semantic interpreter that recognizes the difference between these two examples.","The approach taken in this paper is to combine an all-path parsing algorithm (Chester 1980; Earley 1970; Kay 1980; Seo and Simmons 1989; Tomita 1985) with routines for generating logical representations in order to create a shared-packed parse forest annotated with the logical representations for the constituents in the forest (i.e., an annotated shared-packed parse forest). Before discussing the benefits of this approach, we describe the properties of a shared-packed parse forest (Seo and Simmons 1989; Tomita 1985, 1987).","A shared-packed parse forest is a data structure that stores all parses of a sentence in a compact form. Consider the packed parse forest produced by an implementation of Tomita's parser (Tomita 1985) for the sentence Every man saw the boy with his binoculars shown in Figure 1. The forest stores both terminal and non-terminal nodes. Non-terminal nodes contain lists of node numbers of the children that make up a parse 651 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 of that constituent. The start symbol for the grammar is S-MAJ, which in the above example consists of a non-terminal node for an S and a final punctuation terminal node. Because a non-terminal node may have descendents with multiple parses, there can be more than one parse tree for the constituent. This results from the fact that the parser packs forest nodes together when they share a common state vertex and have the same features. For example, in Figure 1, the VP with the index of 20 has two parses, one consisting of nodes with indices 6, 9, and 19, and the other with indices 6 and 22. Early in the parse, node 20 had only one set of children (6 9 19). Later, after node 22 was created, the parser added (6 22) to the list of children for the VP node. This node packing occurs when the parser is preparing to reduce the phrase consisting of the subtrees 6 and 22 using a VP rule. When the new constituent in the parse stack has the same state vertex on its left and right as the item already stored in the forest, the alternative parse is added to the list of possible children for the already stored constituent. Note that nodes which never participate in a sentence parse can appear in the forest (e.g., nodes 10 and 11). These useless nodes can be easily pruned after parsing is complete by marking all nodes that participate in a parse beginning with the start symbol, S-MAJ, and freeing those that are unmarked.","Seo and Simmons (1989) have introduced syntactic graphs, which are constructed from shared-packed parse forests, to represent ambiguous parses for a sentence. The syntactic graph encodes the modifier links between a head word and its modifiers. An advantage of this approach is that words which participate in multiple parses (by modifying different words in different ways) have multiple arcs entering the node. For example, if a preposition (as head of a PP) can modify either a noun or a verb, there would be two arcs entering the node for the preposition, one from the noun and one from the verb. Hence, the point of ambiguity can be pinpointed to the attachment decision. They claim that a parse forest does not give the same direct access to internal ambiguity because ambiguous points can be detected only by traversing the forest. Certainly, one cannot immediately detect that the ambiguity for the sentence resides with the PP attachment by examining the forest shown in Figure 1. However, by adding links between each of the nodes in the forest and its parent node and then pruning the nodes that do not participate in a legal parse for the sentence, the forest does give a better view of this ambiguity (see Figure 2). Nodes with more than one parent participate in multiple parses for a sentence. In the example forest of Figure 2, there are two different NPs that contain"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"boy,","paragraphs":["and the PP+ constituent in node 17 is a member of either an NP or a VP.

The deletion process removes node 20 from the up pointers of node 20's children (i.e., nodes 7, 8, and 17) and deletes parses containing node 20 from node 20's parent node, 18. Once the deletion is complete, the forest is no longer ambiguous, as shown in Figure 3.","Rather than transforming the parse forest to a parse graph to represent the syntactic structure for ambiguous sentences, we prefer to store pointers to parent nodes and utilize the shared-packed parse forest to store logical representations.

It provides a direct method for focusing on the points of ambiguity in a sentence when parent links are included for each node. It is able to reuse the semantic decisions made for a subtree of a rejected parse tree. When a node in the forest is limited to a single parse, it is 653 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 limited for all parses of the sentence containing that node (unlike one-parse-tree-at-a-time methods).","Because of these benefits, we have designed a program to generate a shared-packed parse forest annotated with the logical form developed by Harper (1990, 1992). We augmented a Tomita-style LR parser with the necessary routines for constructing the logical form representation. Tomita's parser is a bottom-up LR(k)-based parser that constructs a forest of all possible parses while using a graph-structured stack and breadth-first search to handle non-determinism in the parse. In the next section, we describe three methods for interfacing our logical form routines with Tomita's parser. The conclusions we draw can also be applied to more efficient parsers (Earley 1970; Schabes 1991) that produce other logical representations (e.g., Alshawi and Crouch 1992; Hirst 1987; Weischedel 1989) in more compact forests (Nederhof 1993)."]},{"title":"3. Combining Logical Form with Forests: A Case Study","paragraphs":["Previously, our logical form routines were interfaced with a one-parse-tree-at-a-time, top-down ATN parser (Harper 1990, 1992). This made it relatively easy to create compositional logical form routines and interface them with the parser. These routines were developed to construct and store the logical forms for each major type of constituent. Some routines created logical representations for the basic constituents like nouns and verbs, whereas routines for more complex constituents, like VPs, NPs, and sentences, combined the logical representations of several constituents into a larger representation. Function calls for constructing the logical forms were then added to the arcs in the grammar networks and were executed whenever the arc was successfully traversed (after constituent and feature tests succeeded). Since one parse tree was built at a time, the logical form for each tree was constructed and stored before another tree was produced by the parser's search mechanism; hence, none of the complex logical form routines had to combine more than a single representation for each of its constituents. The logical representations were easy to create in this approach, but the parser was impractical because it generated a single parse tree at a time.","In the Tomita parser, the grammar rules consist of production rules containing a left-hand side, a right-hand side, and a set of actions. These actions include feature tests that must succeed for the reduce operation to proceed and routines for storing feature values and for constructing and storing the logical form with a node in the forest. For example, the following rule is used to parse a sentence consisting of an NP and a VP:","(S --* (NP VP) ((== #$NP (get-the person of #$VP)) (=! #$PHRASE 'statement) (logical-form 'sentence :np #$NP :vp #$VP))) ; Subject-verb agreement test ; Set the MOOD of the sentence ; Create the logical form The left-hand side of this rule is S, and the right-hand side is a list consisting of an NP and a VP. For the rule to succeed during parsing, the right-hand side of the rule must match, and the subject-verb agreement test must return true. If it does, a parse node is created with a list of children consisting of #$NP and #$VP, the node numbers of the two constituents that make up the S. Additionally, the feature information and logical forms for the constituent are stored in the node created for the forest. To simplify the forests in examples, we omit the feature information stored on nodes and simply indicate the number of logical forms stored for a node, not the actual representation. 654 Mary P. Harper Storing Logical Form in a Shared-Packed Forest","Unlike the ATN parser used by Harper (1990, 1992), the Tomita parser is a bottom-up, all-path parsing algorithm that creates a parse forest by packing parse nodes together to save space and time. Because nodes with two alternative parses often produce two different semantic representations, our logical form construction routines must be able to store and retrieve multiple logical forms for ambiguous constituents in the forest. This requirement introduces two problems. First, packed nodes in a forest represent multiple parses, which produce multiple representations; hence, our routines for constructing logical forms for sentences (and other complex constituents) may have to combine multiple representations for each of their constituents. Second, the annotated shared-packed parse forest cannot store every representation of a highly ambiguous sentence without using a prohibitively large amount of space. Any approach that uses a parse forest to store logical representations for the constituents of a sentence will have to address these problems. We will describe three methods for interfacing the LR parser with logical form routines and illustrate the differences between these approaches by using the parse of the sentence, Fred saw frogs in cars with Bill.","The first and simplest method is to prevent two nodes from being packed together (except for the start symbol), if they have different logical forms, as shown in Figure 4. Notice that there are five parses for the S-MAJ at node 36 (i.e., (20 35), (24 35), (26 35), (32 35), and (34 35)) and five logical forms. All other nodes have a single parse and a single logical form. This approach is similar to the method employed by the ATN to generate the logical forms for a sentence and is equivalent to mapping an individual parse tree to a logical representation. This method is easy to implement, but it does not take advantage of the shared-packed parse forest for compactly storing the logical forms. And because different structural variations typically map to different logical representations, the number of nodes in the forest can be exponential (or worse) for some ambiguities.","The second approach is to store the logical representation directly in the shared-packed parse forest, as shown in Figure 5. The syntactic ambiguity in the structure of a child node must affect the ambiguity of the logical representation of ancestor nodes. If a parent node consists of two constituents, one with three logical forms and another with two, the construction routines must be able to store the six logical forms for that constituent. This requires that the logical form routines be constructed to combine the logical forms for constituents with more than a single representation. Node packing provides an additional challenge. When a new node is packed with an already existing node in the forest, the logical representation for the new structure must be stored for that constituent. Also, all of the ancestors of a newly packed node must update their lists of logical representations to reflect the addition of the new parse, since packing of a node can occur after many of its ancestors are already members of the forest. In Figure 5, when the second parse was added to node 21, a second logical form also had to be added to the logical form list for that node and to the logical form lists of each of its previously stored ancestors (i.e., 19, 20, and 22) for the forest to be complete.","In contrast to the first approach, this method does not increase the number of nodes in the parse forest; however, an exponential number of logical representations can be created for sentences in some ambiguous grammars. Some space savings can be achieved by using pointers to the representations of a child node when creating the representations of a parent node, because many of the nodes (and corresponding logical forms) in a parse forest are shared by multiple parses. However, for multiple logical representations to share the logical representation of a child node, that representation cannot be affected by the process of constructing the logical form for the parent node, an assumption that does not always hold (e.g., Harper 1990, 1992). If the assumption does not hold, the logical form of a shared node would require copying 655 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 36 ((S-MAJ62 S-MAJ) (DOWN (20 35) (24 35) (26 35) (32 35) (34 35)) (UP T)) ; Store five representations for S-MAJ which combine single representations given the node pairs. 35 ((.7 FINALPUNC .)

If all logical representations are copied and modified as they are combined into higher logical representations, the parse forest could grow quite large.

Figure 6. Keyword parameters are used to make the procedure calls more meaningful. Once the parse forest is complete, the logical form for any node can be created by evaluating the stored procedure call. If the node has multiple parses, then multiple logical forms will be created by the routines automatically. Hence, the logical form routines used in this approach must be able to combine properly the multiple logical forms for its constituents (just as in the second approach). All of the logical forms for the sentence can be produced by evaluating the logical form routine stored with the S-MAJ, resulting in a potentially large number of representations. However, since the procedure calls stored with any of the nodes in the forest can be evaluated as needed, the program is able to generate and examine only the representations of 658 Mary P. Harper Storing Logical Form in a Shared-Packed Forest the constituents associated with points of ambiguity. This feature can be used by a semantic processing module to determine which of the NPs in the forest make sense given the world model. For example, in Figure 6, the head nouns in nodes 6 and 9 have pointers to five different NPs, whose logical forms can be created and tested against the model. This approach is somewhat reminiscent of the"]},{"title":"freeze","paragraphs":["predicate in logic programming, which specifies that some logic clauses should be solved only after others have already been solved. In our system, however, the order of evaluation can be dynamic and context dependent.","The previously described methods for generating logical form were each implemented and evaluated. Figure 7 compares the memory size of the forests in bytes along with the number of nodes generated in the forest (shown in parentheses) for each of the three methods. The ambiguity in all cases resulted from PP attachment. The number of nodes and the size of the forest when no logical representation is constructed have also been included as a baseline. The third method is superior to the other two methods for the following reasons: the forest contains the same number of nodes as the original forest without logical form; the size of the forest augmented with logical form is much closer to the size of the original forest; and the logical forms for any of the nodes in the forest can still be accessed by executing the function call(s) stored in that node, providing a flexible tool for higher level processing. 4. Conclusion We have modified an all-path context-free grammar parser to generate a shared-packed parse forest that provides useful information on the points of ambiguity in a sentence. This forest was also augmented with function calls to construct logical representations for the constituents of the forest, providing a compact data structure that contains multiple sentence parses and access to their corresponding logical representations. Once constructed, this annotated shared-packed parse forest can be utilized by a higher level module to provide logical representations for pieces of the sentence or for the entire sentence. In case of ambiguity, representations for the ambiguous constituents of the sentence can be constructed and tested for validity against a world model, and the annotated forest can then be pruned incrementally.
