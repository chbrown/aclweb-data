The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages• That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will' appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law• Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.

A European chapter was established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
