Mark Ellison*","paragraphs":["University of Edinburgh When phonological rules are regarded as declarative descriptions, it is possible to construct a model of phonology in which rules and representations are no longer distinguished and such procedural devices as rule-ordering are absent. In this paper we present a finite-state model of phonology in which automata are the descriptions and tapes (or strings) are the objects being described. This provides the formal semantics for an autosegmental phonology without structure-changing rules. Logical operations on the phonological domain--such as conjunction, disjunction, and negation--make sense since the phonological domain consists of descriptions rather than objects. These operations as applied to automata are the straightforward operations of intersection, union, and complement. If the arrow in a rewrite rule is viewed as logical implication, then a phonological rule can also be represented as an automaton, albeit a less restrictive automaton than would be required for a lexical representation. The model is then compared with the transducer models for autosegmental phonology of Kay (1987), Kornai (1991), and Wiebe (1992). We conclude that the declarative approach to phonology presents an attractive way of extending finite-state techniques to autosegmental phonology while remaining within the confines of regular grammar. 1. Introduction The decade since the publication of Koskenniemi's dissertation (1983) and since the development of the KIMMO system (Karttunen 1983) has witnessed a spectacular flurry of activity as the linguistic and computational consequences of this work have been fleshed out. A considerable body of literature has grown up around TWO-LEVEL MOR-PHOLOGY, along with texts 1 and implementations. 2 The existence of a rule compiler (Koskenniemi 1985) has made it possible for the linguist to work at a conveniently abstract level, and analyses of several languages now exemplify the approach. Today, two-level morphology encompasses much of traditional segmental generative phonology of the SPE variety (Chomsky and Halle 1968). 3","Although further development and application of this model is set to continue for some time, there is now a clear need to integrate it more closely with computational * University of Edinburgh, Centre for Cognitive Science, 2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9LW, Scotland, U.K. E-mail: {steven,marke}@cogsci.ed.ac.uk 1 (Antworth 1990; Ritchie, Russell, Black, and Pulman 1992; Sproat 1992) 2 (Bear 1986; Antworth 1990; Schiller and Steffens 1991; Pulman and Hepple 1993) 3 Two caveats are necessary here. SPE rules must be restricted so as not to apply to their own output (Johnson 1972) and there is no guarantee that the transducer encoding an SPE rule can be expressed using the two-level rule notation (Ritchie 1992). (~) 1994 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 grammar frameworks on the one hand and modern nonlinear phonology on the other. The primary goal of this article is to show how the central tenets of autosegmental phonology translate into an implemented finite state model.","The model is named ONE-LEVEL PHONOLOGY for two reasons. First, the model is monostratal, in that there is only one level of linguistic description. Second, the name is intended to contrast with models employing two levels (such as the FST model mentioned above) or three levels (Goldsmith 1991; Touretzky and Wheeler 1990), or an unbounded number of levels (Chomsky and Halle 1968). The one-level model represents the outgrowth of three independent strands of research: (i) the finite-state modeling of phonology, (ii) the declarative approach to phonology, 4 and (iii) the automatic learning of phonological generalizations (Ellison 1992, 1993).","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of autosegmental phonology and the temporal semantics of Bird and Klein (1990). Then we define state-labeled automata (Section 3.1), show their equivalence to finite state automata (Section 3.2), define the operations of concatenation, union, intersection, and complement (Section 3.3), and further define state-labeled transducers (Section 3.4). The central proposals of the paper are contained in Section 4. We show how autosegmental association can be interpreted in terms of the synchronization of two automata, where each automaton specifies an autosegmental tier. We now give a brief foretaste of this procedure. Suppose that we have the autosegmental diagram in (1), encoding high (hi) and round (rnd) autosegments. . +hi -hi"]},{"title":"I/I","paragraphs":["-rnd +rnd This diagram is encoded as the following expression, where each numeral indicates the number of association lines incident with its corresponding autosegment. +hi:l -hi:2 -rnd: 2 +rnd: 1 From this encoding, we can write down the following regular expression. Although such expressions will be opaque at this early stage of the exposition, it suffices to note here that each line of the expression represents a tier and the tiers are combined using the intersection operation (m). Moreover, the ls act as synchronization marks between the operands of the intersection operation.","(+hi, 0)* (+hi, 1) (+hi, 0)* (-hi, 0)* (-hi, 1)(-hi, 0)* (-hi, 1)(-hi, 0)* m (-rnd, 0)* (-rnd, 1) (-rnd, 0)* (-rnd, 1) (-rnd, 0)* (+rnd, 0)* (+rnd, 1) (+rnd, 0)* The final step is to compute the intersection and project the first element of each tuple (ignoring the ls and 0s). This produces the expression: (+hi A -rnd) + (-hi N -rnd) + (-hi n +rnd) +. 4 Wheeler 1981; Bird 1990; Coleman 1991; Scobbie 1991; Broe 1993; Russell 1993; Mastroianni 1993. 56 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology Given plausible interpretations of the high and round features, this last expression simplifies to i+a+o +, which describes an automaton tape (or a string) divided into three nonempty intervals, the first containing [i], the second containing [a], and the third containing [o]. This, we shall claim, is the intended interpretation of (1).","After a detailed discussion of this procedure, the remainder of Section 4 is given over to generalizing the procedure to an arbitrary number of autosegmental charts (Section 4.4), an evaluation of the encoding with respect to Kornai's desiderata (Section 4.5), and a presentation of the encoding of autosegmental rules (Section 4.6).","Finally, Section 5 compares our proposals with those of Kay (1987), Kornai (1991), and Wiebe (1992). While our model has regular grammar power and is fully implemented, these three models go beyond regular grammar power and to our knowledge have never been implemented. 2. Background It has long been recognized that the SPE model lacks explanatory adequacy, a fact noted in SPE itself (Chomsky and Halle 1968, pp. 400ff). For example, it is unable to explain why a final devoicing rule like that in (2a) is commonplace in the languages of the world, whereas the rule in (2b) is unattested (Kaye 1989, p. 61).","2. (a) (b) (c) (d) [-sonorant] --* [-voice] / --# [-sonorant] --+ [+nasal] / --# [] --* [anasal] / [anasal] --# [] ~ [around] / [anasal]- # Similarly, the nasal harmony rule in (2c) occurs frequently, while the generalization expressed in (2d) is as unlikely as (2b). Both SPE and the two-level model are unable to express the fact that some rules are commonplace while others are highly unnatural.","Perhaps the SPE model could be rescued from these problems with additional stipulations. However, a more fundamental problem for the model was raised by the following tone language data (Leben 1973; Goldsmith 1976). At first blush, Mende vowels appear to manifest five tone patterns, namely high (ko), low (kph), falling (mbfi), rising (mb~) and rise-fall (mbS). The SPE model would predict 25 tonal patterns for two-syllable morphemes, but instead we find only 5. These are high-high, low-low, high-low, low-high, and low-falling. Similarly, for three-syllable morphemes we get 5 patterns, not 125. Leben noticed that the one-, two-, and three-syllable morphemes could be put into correspondence as shown in (3), from Leben (1978).",".

We display several examples of his notation in (4). Here, the H indicates high tone, while L indicates low tone.

Only the synchronization varies. In diagrams like the ones in (4), units such as H and L are termed AUTONOMOUS SEGMENTS, or AUTOSEGMENTS, and a linear sequence of autosegments is called a TIER. The synchronization markers are called ASSOCIATION LINES. A pair of tiers linked by some association lines is called a CHART. A chart is called WELL-FORMED if the following conditions hold (Goldsmith 1976, p. 27). 5. Well-Formedness Condition: (a) (b) All vowels are associated with at least one tone; all tones are associated with at least one vowel. Association lines do not cross. The reader can ascertain that the above charts are well-formed according to (5). However, (5) is insufficiently restrictive on its own, and a further stipulation is required.",", Association Convention: Only the rightmost member of a tier can be associated to more than one member of another tier. 58 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology","When (5) and (6) are combined, we achieve the effect of one-to-one left-to-right association, where multiple association (or SPREADING) occurs only at the right-hand end. Observe also that the charts in (4) do not contain adjacent identical tones. For example, there is no HH tone melody. This is expressed by a principle attributable to Leben (1973).",". Obligatory Contour Principle: At the melodic level of the grammar, any two adjacent [autosegments] must be distinct. Thus HHL is not a possible melodic pattern; it automatically simplifies to HL.","Although nonlinear models like autosegmental phonology represent a major advance on the linear model of SPE in the area of explanatory adequacy, it has sometimes been pointed out (e.g., Bird and Ladd 199l) that the formal explicitness of the SPE model has not been matched by these more recent proposals. Before we can begin to compute with autosegmental representations and rules, they need to be given a formal semantics. Our starting point here is the temporal semantics of Bird and Klein (1990), based on Sagey's (1988) model, which has gained widespread acceptance in autosegmental phonology. Under this temporal semantics, phonological properties are attached to intervals that are related using precedence (an asymmetric, transitive relation) and overlap (a reflexive, symmetric relation).","Bird (1990) showed how a phonological description language can be modeled by such event structures, where the precedence relation models the linear ordering of tiers and the overlap relation models association lines. In this paper, we shall provide an automaton-based semantics for precedence and overlap, thus arriving at a computational semantics for the autosegmental notation. 3. State-Labeled Automata In this section we give definitions for a new device called a state-labeled finite automaton, and then we define various useful operations on these automata. (Some readers may prefer to skip Section 3 on a first reading.) 3.1 Definitions Definition 1 A STATE-LABELED NONDETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATON (SFA) is a septuple (V~ ~, ~, 6~ S, F, e) where V is a finite set, the set of STATES, ~. is a finite set, the ALPHABET,","C V x ~, is the LABELING RELATION (states are labeled with subsets of the alphabet), 5 6 c V x V is the TRANSITION RELATION, S C V is the set of START STATES, and F c V is the set of FINAL STATES. e is a Boolean flag that is true iff the null string A is accepted, and false otherwise. 5 Without loss of generality we have chosen to label states with segments (subsets of ~), rather than with strings (subsets of G*). 59 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 Before describing the execution of an SFA, we need to define COMPATIBILITY. Definition 2 We say that a state v is COMPATIBLE with an input cr E G if (v, c~ / E )~. At each step in the execution of an SFA, a subset of the states is active while the remainder are inactive. An SFA begins operation with those start states active that are compatible with the first symbol in the input string. If, at a certain step in processing, a subset T of states is active, then at the next step, the subset T t of states reachable from T and compatible with the next input become active. This operation is formalized below, following the approach taken by Partee et al. (1990). First we define a SITUATION to be the processing status of an SFA. Definition 3 A SITUATION of an SFA, A, is a triple (x,"]},{"title":"T,y I","paragraphs":["where T c V is the set of currently active states, and x and y are the portions of the input string to the left and right of the reading head, respectively.

The second condition concerns the transition relation, requiring that the new situation must be reachable from the previous situation. The third condition is a check that ¢ is in the label set of each currently active state. We define t-~ to be the transitive closure of ~-a. Now we can specify the conditions under which an SFA accepts a string, where A is the empty string. Definition 5 Let A ="]},{"title":"(V,G,A,6, S,F,e)","paragraphs":["be an SFA and let w E G*.

If no string can cause an SFA to have more than one active state at any processing step, then we say that the SFA is DETERMINISTIC. In order to signify that an SFA accepts the empty string A (i.e., if e is true), we shall include a special state, labeled with a distinguished symbol 0, which is marked both initial and final. 60 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology 3.2 Relationship to FSAs The equivalence of SFAs and arc-labeled finite-state automata (FSAs) follows from the equivalence of Mealy and Moore machines. 6 Although SFAs are no more expressive than FSAs, there are good linguistic reasons for wishing to use them. The primary difference between the two devices lies in the relative ease with which particular generalizations can be expressed. As an illustration, we shall consider the automaton that prohibits two adjacent occurrences of any given symbol in a string, a constraint known in autosegmental phonology as the Obligatory Contour Principle. Here is the FSA version, using the graphical conventions for representing FSAs adopted by Hopcroft and Ullman (1979). Bullet marks a state, circled states are final, and states with incoming arrow heads are initial. d a -- The notation we use for state-labeled automata is different. Because states carry labels, there is no need to use the contentless bullet symbol to mark a state. Instead, the label itself marks the state. Initial and final states are indicated by arrowheads and circles, as for FSAs. Arcs are unlabeled.","The SFA that does not admit adjacent occurrences of any symbol in the alphabet is: Notice that the number of labels required by the SFA is considerably smaller (5 labels) than the number required in the FSA (12 labels), while the number of transitions is the same for both. On the other hand, the SFA has an extra state, labelled with 0 to show that the automaton accepts the null string (see the final clause of Definition 1).","The difference between the two devices becomes even clearer when we consider the representations for a* (zero or more as) and a + (one or more as). First, here are a* and a + expressed as FSAs."]},{"title":"4c a","paragraphs":["a* : a + : >'e a ~\" Observe that the specification of the Kleene star requires one state, while Kleene plus requires two. If we use SFAs instead, we find the reverse: Kleene star requires two 6 See Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p. 44) for a discussion of this equivalence. An FSA is a Mealy machine that ignores its input, while an SFA is a Moore machine that ignores its input. 61 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 states, while Kleene plus only requires one. a*: >(~ >~ a+: ~~-~ As we shall see in Section 4, the semantics of phonological representations requires frequent use of the Kleene plus and little use of the Kleene star. The intuition behind this is simple. Recall from Section 2 that phonological entities such as distinctive features are considered to be descriptions of phonetic events that may extend over an interval of time. As we saw in the case of tone, the defining feature of an autosegment may be spread across several segments. Crucially, however, an autosegment must be present at at least one point, and so it makes sense to view phonological entities--such as segments and autosegments--in terms of the Kleene plus rather than the Kleene star.","It might be reasoned that our interval interpretation of segments is better pictured with arc-labeled devices. After all, the states resemble points while the arcs resemble extended intervals. Furthermore, it may be tempting to use a single arc between two temporally distant points to show the spreading of an autosegment coarticulated with two consecutive autosegments on another tier. For example, (8) shows a labial autosegment, L, bridging two instants also bridged by a nasal segment, N, and stop, S. . >\"o- N>o S > However, this representation is flawed: the semantics assigned to coterminous paths contradicts the standard interpretation of FSAs. The automaton pictured above would normally be interpreted as either a nasal followed by a stop or by a single labial articulation. Crucially, it could not be interpreted as necessarily both a nasal followed by a stop and a labial articulation.","While viewing states as instants of time and arcs as intervals offers some iconicity, it is also misleading. It is just as natural--and more in keeping with the logical foundations presented in Section 2--to employ the states for temporally extended intervals, and the arcs for the relationship of immediate precedence. 3.3 Basic Operations In this section we define the operations of concatenation, union, intersection, and complement on SFAs. These operations correspond naturally to the operations on the languages accepted by the automata, as indicated in the following table. operation concatenation union intersection complement Kleene plus Kleene star automata languages AB AUB A[TB"]},{"title":"-d","paragraphs":["A + A*"]},{"title":"(ab]a L(A), b E L(B)} U L(A) n r(B) L(A) L(A) + L(A)*","paragraphs":["62 Steven Bird and T.

A complete automaton is one that has a transition from every state for each element of G. The final step is to mark all final states nonfinal, and all nonfinal states final. So if S is the set of states and F is the set of final states, then S\\F is the set of final states in the complement. 3.4 Transducers In the previous three sections, we defined state-labeled automata and some operations that can be used to combine them. We also saw that these automata are equivalent 64 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology to traditional, arcqabeled automata. Just as we can define arc-labeled automata called finite-state transducers (FSTs), we can define state-labeled transducers (SFFs).","An (epsilon free) state-labeled transducer is just an SFA with a special alphabet. Instead of labeling each state with a subset of a single alphabet, we label them with subsets of the product of two alphabets. The strings accepted are sequences of pairs consisting of one letter from each alphabet. A transducer can be used as a translator: it takes as input one half of the label on a state, and simultaneously writes as output the other half. All output strings generated by a path from initial to final states are translations of the input string recognized by the same path. Since the SFT is also an SFA, intersection is defined for SFTs.","The reader may wonder whether there is any distinction between one-level phonology and two-level phonology if SFAs and SFTs are formally identical. There is an important distinction to be drawn, however. First, most two-level models employ FSTs"]},{"title":"with epsilons,","paragraphs":["which are more powerful devices than FSAs. Second, in the one-level model, representations and rules are interpreted as automata. In contrast, the two-level model employs strings for representations and automata for rules. Finally, in one-level phonology surface forms and generalizations about them are stated directly in a hierarchical lexicon akin to that of head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987), rather than being mediated through a transducer (Bird and Klein, in press). 4. Association and Synchronization In this section we present the automaton-based semantics for autosegmental phonology. 4.1 The Representation of Autosegments and Tiers Recall that an autosegment denotes a possibly extended interval.

Section 3.1). If an autosegment alternates with zero, we do not employ ¢ for the zero alternant but permit surrounding autosegments to extend to 'fill in the gap.' 65 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1","Here, it is clear that N is behaving like a variable. If N is instantiated, then the entire interval must remain homogeneous. So the representation of this N is not (9a) but (9b). 9. (a) (b)","Some autosegments, however, appear to lack this homogeneity property. For example, the Turkish word pe~eleri contains several front vowels. An analysis of such words that employs the principles of vowel harmony posits a +front autosegment that is associated with every vowel of the word. Observe that this autosegment is heterogeneous, as it includes in its temporal extent both e and i. Accordingly, its interpretation will follow the scheme of (9a) above. Briefly continuing in this vein, we can conceive of a range of different kinds of segment, using varying numbers of states and varying numbers of labels per state. Four options are described below:","Simple Segments. These capture the ordinary kind of segment and consist of a single state labeled with a singleton set. In general, when we employ a symbol like b it will be interpreted as a simple segment.","Homogeneous Segments. These represent slots (like N) and members of templates (like CVCCVC), and consist of more than one state. Each state is labeled with a singleton set. An example of a homogeneous segment is found in (9b).","Heterogeneous Segments. These represent spreading autosegments, like +high (and b in Section 5.4).

Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology 4.2 The Interpretation of Association In Section 2 we presented an interpretation of association based on temporal overlap.

The clue is that a pair of intervals overlap if and only if they share a point in common (Bird and Klein 1990, p• 36)• Note that in each of the above diagrams, the third interval contains an instance of both A and B, and the existence of this interval was both a necessary and sufficient requirement for the association line to have its overlap interpretation. So we need an automaton for each autosegment that captures the two required properties: (i) denotation of an extended period, and (ii) existence of a special point. The \"automaton\" required for the autosegment A is given in (12). 12. This automaton accepts any string of one or more As, and requires that there is some A that is coincident with an autosegment somewhere else. The line extending from the middle state informally indicates that this state is simultaneous with a state in another automaton. Now we must create a similar automaton for the autosegment B. Recall from Section 4.1 that we need to construct tiers for A and B by concatenating the autosegments to the left and right (elided in (11))• Finally, the automata are put together as shown below:","• •• ~- + •.. o.• -}- + •.. 9 Note that in using such diagrams we are attempting to isolate the effects of two automata: those cells containing both A and B should be understood as containing A N B. 67 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 This unusual kind of automaton represents a halfway house between autosegmental diagrams and SFAs; we shall call it a SYNCHRONIZED SFA. Such automata have a simple interpretation: both component automata run in parallel, but the second state of the A automaton is active iff the second state of the B automaton is simultaneously active.

Unfortunately, this is the best that we can hope for; Wiebe (1992) has shown that a compositional linear encoding does not exist. 4.6 Phonological Rules Phonologists typically encode their descriptive generalizations in terms of RULES. Often these rules are interpreted as processes that manipulate representations. In the one-level approach they are interpreted as a logical implication between two descriptions, which simplifies to a single description given the Boolean operations presented in Section 3.3.","As our first example, consider the phenomenon of homorganic nasal assimilation, whereby nasals agree in place of articulation with the following consonant.

So, in evaluating (25) we intersect the two tiers of the structural change part of the rule, and then delete the second index of each tuple. The complement of this automaton is then intersected with the structural description part of the rule and the first index of each tuple is then deleted. The final step is to add the e* wildcards and form the complement again. The result is an automaton that rejects any nonhomorganic NC clusters.","A more complex example of a phonological rule, this time concerning vowel harmony, will now be discussed. Since the advent of autosegmental phonology, vowel harmony has been analyzed as the spreading of autosegments from left to right. Here we show how such a rule can be translated into a regular constraint on surface forms.","Turkish exhibits two orthogonal types of vowel harmony: one requiring that consecutive vowels agree in fronting, the other requiring that consecutive vowels agree in rounding unless the second vowel is low. As the rounding harmony is the more complex of the two, we will take it as our example. To avoid the complications of fronting harmony, we will only consider examples involving back vowels. 74 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology","Turkish has eight vowels. Four of them (a e i i) are unrounded, and four (o 6 u ii) are rounded. Turkish is an agglutinating language, and the vowels in many affixes depend on the final vowel in the root of the word.

A vowel on this tier may denote not only a vowel but also consonants interspersed within this vowel as well. Whereas a segmental a corresponds to an automaton with a single state having a singleton label (this is what we have called a SIMPLE segment; see Section 4.1), an a on the vowel tier corresponds to a single state automaton whose state accepts not only a but any consonant as well (a HETEROGENEOUS segment).","Given that the vowel tier uses this kind of heterogeneous representation, we can combine the charts of our rule into the regular expression in (28)."]},{"title":"28 rndl \"°* \"°°* rndll \"°°* J J /.* e:0* V:0 +hi:l e:0* e:0:0* V:0:I +hi:l:0 e:0:0* sc sd","paragraphs":["Using the procedure of Section 4.6, we can translate this into a regular expression that 15 More precisely, the accusative case is used only for definite objects. 75 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 implements rounding harmony as a constraint on surface forms.

Rather than deleting an element in a particular context, we set up an alternation with zero, following Bloomfield (1926). See Bird and Klein (in press) and Bird (in press) for detailed examples of this approach to deletion.","This concludes our discussion of the automaton-based semantics for autosegmental representations and rules. In the next section we review some other attempts to treat autosegmental phonology using finite-state techniques. 5. Other Finite-State Approaches to Nonlinear Phonology 5.1 Kay (1987) The earliest treatment of autosegmental phonology in a finite-state setting is attributable to Kay (1987). It is tailored to the framework of nonconcatenative morphology developed by McCarthy (1981) in which consonants and vowels are segregated onto different tiers, as shown for the Arabic verb stem kattab in (29).","16 Applied to a destructive autosegmental rule, the interpretation determines the restriction imposed on surface forms by the rule, were it the last rule in a derivation. 76 Steven Bird and T.

Together, they mean 'caused to write.' The challenge posed by Arabic morphology is to come up with a simple account of the interleaving of the morphemes, relating the forms a, CVCCVC, and ktb to the stem kattab.","Kay's solution, which we sketch here, involves the use of a kind of transducer that reads four-tuples (rather than pairs like a normal FST). This transducer scans four strings, one for each of the three tiers in (29) and one for the corresponding surface form. In this way, Kay has identified tiers with tapes. The association relation is encoded in the way the transducer scans these four tapes.","Kay specifies a transducer by providing a set of FRAMES. In effect, each frame specifies an association between a CV-tier slot and a melodic unit, such as a k or an a. This melodic unit appears on the current surface tape cell. Each frame is a four-tuple whose components correspond to (i) the consonantal root, (ii) the CV-tier, (iii) the vocalic melody, and (iv) the surface tape. A simple frame is the following: k : C :c: k This frame specifies that when a k is being read from the consonantal tape and a C is being read from the CV tape, then there is an empty transition on the vocalism tape and the surface tape must have a k. There is a similar frame for each consonant. A frame for the vowel a is c:V:a:a.","More work is necessary in order to capture the idea of autosegmental spreading. Kay modifies the transducer model so that tape symbols can be inspected without the reading head being advanced. Three notational devices manipulate the way this revised model behaves. Square brackets around one of the components of a frame causes the corresponding tape cell to be scanned without advancing the read head. Braces around a frame component behave in the same way, but only if they are scanning the final symbol on a tape. (This is required to prevent the spreading of i, which will not be discussed here.) Finally, the symbol G is used instead of C for geminate consonants. We shall see how these devices operate using a worked example, in which the surface form kattab is derived from the three lexical forms of diagram (29).","Display (30) gives the initial configuration.

Of course, the transducer also works for recognition. We could specify a surface tape and leave one or more of the lexical tapes unspecified.","Kay's system is ingenious and we have not been able to demonstrate all of its capabilities in this small space. Nevertheless, we believe it suffers from a number of problems. The first concerns the form katab (form I) and the (corresponding) reflexive form ktatab (form VIII) with an infixed t. Indeed, more than half of the forms that Kay cites have infixes, although these are not explicitly analyzed in the model. Two conservative extensions to the model that encompass this infixation are (i) to insert infixes into the CV tape directly (so form VIII is CtVCVC) or (ii) to introduce another CV tape symbol A (for affix), which directs the transducer to read from a fifth tape.","A second set of problems concerns the appropriateness of Kay's model for nonlinear phonology more generally. First, notational devices like G move the frame 'language' away from what it is supposed to represent, namely autosegmental structures. No longer is gemination represented by association (perhaps derived by a spreading rule), but by a special marking on the skeleton. Second, the model builds in the assumption that each morpheme appears on a separate autosegmental tier. However, most applications of autosegmental phonology employ morphemes with phonological information arrayed on more than one tier (e.g., Clements and Ford 1979). Similarly, the modeling of subsegmental feature geometry of the kind advocated by Clements (1985) and others also involves a single morpheme having material on several tiers. Third, the model breaks down in the area of MORPHEMIC SEGREGATION. Since there is no principled upper bound on the number of morphemes that may be overlaid in the way McCarthy advocates for Arabic, there is similarly no principled upper bound on the number of tapes Kay's transducer would require. The assumption that each morpheme defines its own set of tiers, implicit in early work (McCarthy 1981) but explicit in more recent work (McCarthy 1989), is incompatible with a fixed upper bound on the number of tapes. Finally, using Kay's model for recognition would lead to much nondeterminism in positing G symbols, brackets, and braces. For example, in processing kattab the lexical tapes kttb, CVCCVC, and aa could be generated. The model generates all possible violations of the Obligatory Contour Principle. 79 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 5.2 Kornai (1991) Kornai (1991) has developed a linear encoding of autosegmental representations that allows the two-level transducer model to be applied to autosegmental phonology. We shall present Kornai's central innovation and describe a few of its strengths and weaknesses.","As we saw in Section 4.5, Kornai presents four criteria under which an autosegmental encoding should be judged.

Finally, it should be compositional, in the sense that the concatenation of the encodings of A1 and A2 ought to be the same as the encoding of the concatenation of A1 and A2. Kornai demonstrates that an optimal encoding under these criteria does not exist, and he sets about defining an encoding that is claimed to be near-optimal.","We shall only cover one of the codes he considers, namely, the TRIPLE CODE. This code represents two tiers of autosegments and a chart between them as a linear description. There are four keywords in the code that are interpreted as instructions to a device that is scanning two tiers (left to right) and drawing association lines between certain pairs of segments. These keywords are as follows:","0 : leave the current segments unassociated and advance the read head on each tier;","1 : draw an association line between the current segments on each tier and advance the read heads on each tier;","t : override the advance instruction on the bottom tier, i.e., only advance the read head on the top tier; and","b : only advance the read head on the bottom tier; retain the same segment on the top tier.","Each 0 or 1 is flanked by a statement of the current segments on the two tiers. A number flanked by two segments forms the TRIPLE that gives the code its name.","Where this code could give a number of different representations of the same autosegmental structure, Kornai (1991) restricts the encoding to operating in the same manner as the association convention of Goldsmith (1976). Association, or the lack of association, is marked left-to-right in a one-to-one fashion until one tier is devoid of new autosegments. From that point, only one tier advances until all remaining autosegments are represented in the linearization.","As examples, let us encode two charts, the first completely devoid of associations.

Here, we have filled empty tiers with a \"place holder' segment, and then used the triple code. 82 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology The encoding of (39) is Clk.V0t.t.Clt.t.Clt.V0b.t.Clb. Observe that the t is met in the second triple of the right-hand side of (38) and it must be 'stored' until the fourth triple in the output. In a form like tada.hraj, two consonants must be stored in this way, leading again to an explosion of state information. 19 If the template consisted of n CV syllables, and the consonant tier consisted of n consonants, then the association mechanism would need to store at least L(n - 1)/2J autosegments. This is, in principle, unbounded, and so the association mechanism for coded autosegmental representations is not finite state.","In general there is no limit on the amount of information that needs to be pre-served as state information in the transducer. Consequently, using the triple code, certain phonological processes cannot be modeled using a finite state transducer. In-deed, this is true of any linear code (Wiebe 1992). It is true that adding each individual association--that is, finding the next position to associate, making the association and shuffling the lower tier along--can be performed by a finite-state transducer. But no principled bound on the length of the derivation can be made, and the quantity of memory required is an increasing function of the length of the derivation. Consequently, the step from unassociated to associated form cannot be made by a single FST.","This type of problem with manipulating coded representations is not limited to Arabic morphology. In fact, the problem arises whenever there is an autosegment that has a restricted set of 'landing sites' (such as the consonants or the high vowels), a very common occurrence. Another example is that of accent systems: Kornai and K~lman (1988, p. 185), citing Goldsmith (1982), state the Basic Tone Melody Association rule for Ci-Ruri, a Bantu language of Tanzania, as follows:","40. Basic Tone Melody Association Rule: Associate the accented element of the Basic Tone Melody to the accented element of a word. In general, the accented element of a word may be an unbounded distance from the start and end of a word. Goldsmith (1982, p. 53) gives the following example: 41. na a kamir* e I milked L H* L As before, performing the association using the triple code requires a multiplication in state information, which in the general case cannot be bounded. True, this example only requires the automaton to store H; but Goldsmith (1982, p. 55) gives examples where there are two stresses in the word, and, therefore, the association automaton needs to store more tones (see Wiebe 1992, pp. 109-110 for the details).","Next, consider the problem\" of generalizing from one chart to an arbitrary number","19 Wiebe (1992, p. 112) points out that the final consonant does not need to be stored, as it is already associated with the final C position. 83 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 of charts.

However, this comes in for the same criticism leveled at Kay's system above, namely that there is no principled upper bound on the number of tiers due to such considerations as complex feature geometry and morphemic segregation. 5.3 Wiebe {1992) Wiebe (1992) has recently devised an encoding of autosegmental diagrams that over-comes many of the problems of Kornai's triple code.

The multi-linear code for (29) is displayed in (42).","20 Here the dots separating the triples have been omitted to enable more convenient location of association lines.","21 The encoding procedure would not terminate for Pulleyblank's example (18). This is because the first application of the encoding would take the three-tiered structure and produce another (more complicated) three-tiered structure. In fact, this is just a special case of a more general problem, for the encoding fails for any tier structure containing a cycle, such as the one proposed by Clements (1991). 84 Steven Bird and T.

These numerals can be stacked up; the first line specifies that a has two associations on chart 1. A given tier can participate in two charts; the second line of (42) has Cs associated on chart 2 and Vs associated on chart 1. Wiebe shows how the multi-linear code satisfies the criteria for computability, invertibility, iconicity, and compositionality.","Wiebe's encoding has some similarities to our revised encoding presented in Section 4.5. Here is our encoding of (29):","43. tier 1 a:2:0:0 tier2 C:0:1:0 V:I:0:0 C:0:1:0 C:0:1:0 V:I:0:0 C:0:1:0 tier3 k:0:l:0 t:0:2:0 b:0:l:0 Suppose that a:p:q:r is an arbitrary 4-tuple of the kind in (43). We use position in the tuple to specify which chart an association line is in, and use numerals to specify the number of association lines. However, Wiebe uses numerals to specify the chart and repetitions to specify the number of lines. There is a mapping between terms like all in Wiebe's encoding and a:2:0:0 in our encoding: f(a:p:q:r)=alP2q3 r If we apply f to each term in (43), the result is as follows.","all","C2VIC2C2VIC2 k2t22b2 Now it should be clear that there is an isomorphism between the two encodings.","Wiebe goes on to show how his encodings can be processed by new devices called MULTI-TAPE SFAs and SFTs, 22 where each tape corresponds to a row in the multi-linear code. The devices are used for checking well-formedness constraints and applying (possibly destructive) autosegmental rules. Wiebe also demonstrates that these devices are more powerful than FSTs without epsilon transitions, claiming that they can recognize some (strictly) context-sensitive languages. He argues that this extra computational power is crucially required for processing autosegmental analyses with feature- or structure-modifying rules.","The read heads can scan n-tuples separated by arbitrary distances, and each head reads one co-ordinate of the n-tuple under it .... It is precisely this ability to scan different parts of an input word at the same time that is so important in modelling autosegmental rules. Association lines can associate segments in any part of one tier to segments in any part of the facing tier. In order for any computational 22 Wiebe borrows the terms SFA and SFT from an earlier version of this paper (Bird and Ellison 1992). 85 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1 device to efficiently process autosegmental representations, it must be able to scan two"]},{"title":"associated","paragraphs":["segments from"]},{"title":"widely separated","paragraphs":["parts of the representation at the same time (Wiebe 1992, pp. 95-96,"]},{"title":"emphasis added).","paragraphs":["While this is a reasonable statement regarding any model like Kornai's, it does not apply to our one-level model since the notion 'widely separated' is meaningless in this context. Two terms in a multi-linear code are widely separated if they differ significantly as to their distance from the left- or right-hand end of the encoding. Thus, the longer and more slanted the line that associates the autosegments, the greater their separation. Although this is true of the ink on a page, our semantics pays no attention to the angle and length of association lines. If a pair of autosegments is associated then they are ipso facto proximate. The temporal extent of autosegments expands or shrinks to accommodate these temporal constraints imposed by association lines. The intensional character of our approach gives rise to a flexibility of interpretation that obviates the need for more powerful devices of the kind advocated by Wiebe.","Now that we have reviewed some details of other finite-state approaches to autosegmental phonology, we present a one-level analysis of an aspect of Arabic verb morphology. 5.4 A One-Level Analysis As an alternative to either the elaboration of the transducer or the reduction of the nonlinear representation to a code, we present a partial analysis of the Arabic verb in terms of SEAs. 23 Rather than trying to generate one representation from another, we construct a description of the individual Arabic word by taking the intersection of the SFAs describing each of the morphemes. The forms we analyze here, like those given in McCarthy (1981), do not include inflections and also assume that the following suffix is consonant-initial} 4 We shall derive the stem kattab from three morphemes, specifying the form, the root, and the voice/mood.","The form I SFA (44) generalizes over all verbs: it accepts/generates all correct verbs of this form, as well as a number of nonsense verbs, and factors out information specific to the individual words. 44. C:1 V:0 C:1 V:0 C:1 The indices mark associations that will link this tier to the root.","Another tier is the consonantal tier. It contains heterogeneous autosegments corresponding to consonants. These symbols are heterogeneous because they allow not only the corresponding consonant, but also any of the vowels. So the f autosegment on the consonant-tier denotes any sequence of the segments f, a, i, or u. The two uses of f are disambiguated by reference to the tiers on which they occur. Under this definition, autosegments on the consonant tier can spread over vowels to the next consonantal position.","The root SFA generalizes over all stems constructed from the same root.

These have not been discussed at length here, because they do not seek to implement autosegmental phonology.","24 Biliteral roots in forms I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, and XIV, triliteral roots in forms IX and XI, and quadriliteral roots in form QIV reorder the consonant-vowel sequence in the final syllable of the root if followed by a vowel-initial inflection. Where possible, the Arabic verb stem will metathesize or delete short vowels to create a geminate with root consonants (McCarthy 1981, pp. 197f). 86 Steven Bird and T. Mark Ellison One-Level Phonology 45. .:0\" f:l (.:0\" ~:1) + 1:1 The wildcards are necessary for affix consonants, such as the n- prefix of form VII or the -t- infix of form VIII.","It might be argued that fixing the associations (by the indices) in the specification of the morpheme is redundant--that the associations should be supplied by rule. However, 3 of the 15 triliteral forms of the Arabic verb, namely forms II, V and XII, violate the association convention, multiply associating central autosegments rather than peripheral ones. For these forms there seems little choice but to lexically specify the associations or else introduce an ad hoc, morphologically triggered, rule (McCarthy 1981, p. 392, rule 24). In our notation, we can specify these forms as:","46. II C:1 V:0 C:1 C:1 V:0 C:1 V t:l V:0 C:1 V:0 C:1 C:1 V:0 C:1 XII C:1 C:1 V:0 w:0 C:1 V:0 C:1 The intersections of the three forms in (46) with the root automaton (45) are:","47.

On a vowel plane, where each autosegment is heterogeneous, accepting a vowel and any of the consonants, this aspect may be expressed by the single autosegment a, which corresponds to the automaton in (48). 48.","Forming the intersection of this SFA with the intersections of roots and forms shown in (47) gives the following forms.","49.

While it may not cover all possible generalizations about Arabic verbal structure, the important point here is that it captures generalizations that are always surface-true of the phonology of the separate morphemes that come together to build up the verb. 5.5 Automata versus Linearizations We have seen that Kornai (1991) finds it necessary to choose between the imposition of restrictions on autosegmental phonology and the loss of finite stateness in the transduction relationship. As it turns out, the one-level approach does not suffer from this problem. In this section we explain why. 87 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1","Note that the natural processes by which finite-state automata are combined, and therefore by which regular languages are manipulated, are not themselves regular. To see why this is so, suppose we have two regular expressions describing the first form and the root of the Arabic verb to write:","50. CVCVC k (e* t) + e* b The intersection is the following regular expression: 51. kVtVb The associations fixing the incidence of k with the first consonant slot, t with the third, and b with the final, are made by the intersection operation. The question arises as to how we can construct the associations if the same operation for Kornai's system is not regular. The operation we have applied here--intersection---cannot be performed by a regular transducer. This does not invalidate our claim to regularity. What is regular in our theory is each individual description and generalization about phonological data. That is, the descriptions we use are all regular descriptions of phonological objects.","What is not regular in one-level phonology is the relationship between different formats of the same description. There is no finite-state transducer that will form the product of two regular expressions. Multilevel analyses necessarily seek to capture relationships between different descriptions, and like the product operation, these relationships often cannot be captured by finite-state transducers. 6. Conclusions The starting point of this paper was the distinction between descriptions and objects. Multidimensional phonological structures were taken to be descriptions of classes of phonetic objects, following Wheeler (1981), Bird and Klein (1990), Pierrehumbert (1990), Bird (1990), and Coleman (1992). Multiple tiers could be put together not by a clever encoding but by the simple operation of intersection, which corresponds to logical conjunction. Furthermore, this move of intensionalizing phonology enabled us to provide a straightforward formal basis for adding logical negation and disjunction to our representations.","One important consequence of this work is that there are now good prospects for the incorporation of nonlinear phonology into constraint-based grammar formalisms such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987). Such a move gives rise to a novel view of the relationship between phonology and the other modules of grammar, as some initial investigation has already demonstrated (Bird 1992; Bird and Klein in press). Mak-ing surface generalizations the only goal of analysis makes the machine learning of analyses simpler (Ellison forthcoming). The automaton semantics for autosegmental representations and rules gives us a mechanical way of comparing the empirical claims made by a range of autosegmental and segmental accounts of natural language phenomena. Finally, to the extent that phonologists are becoming increasingly committed to a declarative, constraint-based view of their domain, we believe that the model proposed here is well suited to their computational needs.
