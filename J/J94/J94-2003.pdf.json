This is syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kita. Our results are based on a survey of native speakers of their interpretation of short discourses, consisting of minimal pairs, varied by one of the above factors. We demonstrate that these syntactic cues do indeed affect the interpretation of ZEROS, but that having previously been the TOPIC and being realized as a ZERO also contributes to the salience of a discourse entity. We propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and show that CENTERING provides constraints on when a ZERO can be interpreted as the ZERO TOPIC. 1. Introduction 1.1 Centering in Japanese Discourse Recently there has been an increasing amount of work in computational linguistics involving the interpretation of anaphoric elements in Japanese (Yoshimoto 1988; Kuno 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Nakagawa 1992). These accounts are intended as components of computational systems for machine translation between Japanese and English or for natural language processing in Japanese alone. This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational account of the discourse process called CENTERING (Sidner 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished), (2) to apply this account to discourse processing * University of Pennsylvania, Computer Science Department, Philadelphia PA 19104.

The first viewpoint focuses on an inferential process driven by the underlying semantics and relations in the domain (Hobbs 1985a; Hobbs et al. 1987; Hobbs and Martin 1987). A polar focus is to concentrate on the role of syntactic information such as what was previously the topic or subject (Hobbs 1976b; Kameyama 1985; Yoshimoto 1988). We will argue for an intermediate position with respect to the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese. Our position is that the interpretation of zeros is an inferential process, but that syntactic information provides constraints on this inferential process (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981). We will argue that syntactic cues and semantic interpretation are mutually constraining (Prince 1981b, 1985; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988).","The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions such as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, o, and OBJECT2, ni. In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's EMPATHY, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described. This can be syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kita.","In addition to the argument that a purely inference-based account does not consider limits on processing time, another argument against a purely inference-based account is provided by the minimal pair below. Here, the only difference is whether Ziroo is the subject or the object in the second utterance. Note that the interpretation of zeros is indicated in parentheses:"]},{"title":"Example 1","paragraphs":["a. Taroo ga b. C.","kooen o sanpositeimasita.

Japanese Discourse means Ziroo asked Taroo the score of yesterday's game, while 2c means Taroo asked Ziroo the score of yesterday's game. On the other hand, some purely syntactic accounts require that antecedents for zeros be realized as the grammatical TOPIC, and thus cannot explain the above example because Taroo is never explicitly marked as the topic (Yoshimoto 1988).","In the literature, ZEROS are known as zero pronouns. We adopt the assumption of earlier work that the interpretation of zeros in Japanese is analogous to the interpretation of overt pronouns in other languages (Kuroda 1965; Martin 1976; Kameyama 1985). Japanese also has overt pronouns, but the use of the overt pronoun is rare in normal speech, and is limited even in written text. This is mainly because overt pronouns like kare ('he') and kanozyo ('she') were introduced into Japanese in order to translate gender-insistent pronouns in foreign languages (Martin 1976). In this paper, we only consider zeros in subcategorized-for argument positions. Since Japanese doesn't have subject or object verb agreement, there is no syntactic indication that a zero is present in an utterance other than information from subcategorization)","First, in Section 1.2 we describe the methodology that we applied in this investigation. In Section 2, we present the theory of centering and some illustrative examples. Then, in Section 3, we discuss particular aspects of Japanese discourse context, namely grammatical TOPIC and speaker's EMPATHY. We will show how these can easily be incorporated into a centering account of Japanese discourse processing, and give a number of examples to illustrate the predictions of the theory. We also discuss the way in which a discourse center is instantiated in Section 4.","In Section 5 we propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and use the centering model to formalize constraints on when a zero may be interpreted as a ZERO TOPIC. Our account makes a distinction between two notions of TOPIC--grammatical topic and zero topic. The grammatical topic is the wa-marked entity, which is by default predicted to be the most salient discourse entity in the following discourse. However, there are cases in which it may not be, depending on whether ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT applies. This analysis provides support for Shibatani's claim that the interpretation of the topic marker, wa, depends on the discourse context (Shibatani 1990). ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT actually predicts ambiguities in Japanese discourse interpretation and provides a mechanism for deriving interpretations that previous accounts claim would be unavailable.","We delay the review of related research to Section 6 when we can contrast it with our account. The two major previous accounts are those of Kuno (Kuno 1972, 1976b, 1987, 1989) and Kameyama (Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988). Finally, in Section 7, we summarize our results and suggest topics for future research."]},{"title":"1.2 Methodology","paragraphs":["Most of the examples in this paper are constructed as four utterance discourses that fit one of a number of structural paradigms. In all of the paradigms, a discourse entity is","1 When zero pronouns should be stipulated is still a research issue. For example, Hasegawa (1984) described a zero pronoun as a phonetically null element in an argument position. However, as shown in the following example, Terazu, Yamanasi, and Inada (1980) assumed that zero pronouns are not limited in their distribution and stipulated them in adjunct positions as well (Iida 1993).

The manipulations of context occur with the third and the fourth utterances. In each case the zero in the third utterance cospecifies the entity already established as the center in the second utterance. The fourth utterance consists of a potentially ambiguous sentence containing two zeros. The variations in context are as shown below:","Third Utterance Fourth Utterance SUBJECT OBJECT(2) SUBJECT OBJECT(2) EXAMPLES zero NP(o or ni) zero zero 5 zero NP(o or ni) zero zero, empathy 36 NP(ga) zero zero zero 32, 34 NP(wa) zero zero zero 4, 33 NP(ga) zero zero zero, empathy 35","Thus we are manipulating factors such as whether a discourse entity is realized in subject or object position in the third utterance, whether a discourse entity realized in subject position is ga-marked or wa-marked in the third utterance, and whether a discourse entity realized in the fourth utterance in object position is marked as the locus of speaker's EMPATHY.","We collected a group of about 35 native speakers by solicitation on the InterNet to provide judgments for most of the examples given in this paper. These native speakers were readers of the newsgroups sci.lang.japanese and comp.research.japan. They were thus typically well-educated, bilingual engineers. Whenever an example was tested in this way, we provide the number of informants who chose each possible interpretation to the right of the example. Some examples that are included for expository reasons were not tested.","Participation in our survey was completely voluntary, and the data were collected over three surveys. Thus the numbers of subjects varied from one survey to another, and this is reflected in the numbers accompanying our examples. This data collection was carried out on written examples using electronic mail in a situation in which the informants could take as long as they wanted to decide which interpretation they preferred. The instructions sent with the surveys are given in Appendix A.","This paradigm clearly cannot provide information on which interpretation a subject might arrive at first and then perhaps change based on other pragmatic factors, and thus it contrasts with reaction time studies. However, the judgments given should be stable and should reflect the fact that our informants were able to use all the information in the discourse. It is a useful paradigm given that we are exploring the correlation of syntactic cues and discourse interpretation. It has been claimed that syntactic cues are only used in automatic processing and can be overridden by deeper processing. However, Hudson's results suggest that subjects may judge a discourse sequence to be nonsensical when it is incoherent according to centering (Hudson-D'Zmura 1988). Di Eugenio claims that discourse sequences in Italian that are not discourse-coherent according to centering theory produce a garden-path effect (Di Eugenio 1990). The methods we used allow us to explore the results of these interactions, and yet it 196 Marilyn Walker et al. Japanese Discourse would be beneficial for these results to be expanded upon by careful psychological experimentation.","For most of the examples reported here, we asked subjects to choose one preferred interpretation instead of allowing them to rank interpretations. The motivation for doing this was to force differences to come out for slight preferences, with the theory being that other variations would come out across subjects. In a few cases we allowed subjects to indicate no preference; these examples will be clearly indicated.","In addition, we used the same gender for multiple discourse entities to prevent any tendency for judgments to be influenced by gender stereotypes.

Centering Theory","paragraphs":["Within a theory of discourse, CENTERING is a computational model of the process by which conversants coordinate attention in discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished). Centering has its computational foundations in the work of Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1979; Grosz and Sidner 1986) and was further developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, unpublished) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981). Centering is intended to reflect aspects of ATYENTIONAL STATE in a tripartite view of discourse structure that also includes INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE and LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, discourses can be segmented based on intentional structure, and a discourse segment exhibits both local and global coherence. Global coherence depends on how each segment relates to the overall purpose of the discourse; local coherence depends on aspects such as the syntactic structure of the utterances in that segment, the choice of referring expressions, and the use of ellipses. CENTERING models local coherence and is formalized as a system of constraints and rules. Our analysis uses an adaptation of the Centering algorithm that was developed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard, based on these constraints and rules (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989).","The purpose of centering as part of a computational model of discourse interpretation is to model ATTENTIONAL STATE in discourse in order to control inference (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981). 3 Our approach to modeling attentional state is to explore aspects of the correlation between syntax and discourse function. This assumes that there are language conventions about discourse salience and that conversants attempt to maintain a sense of shared context. 2 While native speakers understandably found some of these examples \"stilted\" or \"awkward,\" they were still able to give their judgments based on the information that was provided in the discourses. 3 Recent work in situation theory proposes to control computation with a similar notion of background information in terms of constants of the situation that thus are not explicitly realized in an utterance (Nakashima 1990). The situation-theoretic work does not as yet distinguish shared knowledge that determines discourse salience and derives from the discourse context and the way utterances are expressed (Clark and Haviland 1977; Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981b) from shared knowledge that is part of general background knowledge such as cultural assumptions (Prince 1978a; Joshi 1982) or shared knowledge that might derive from the task context (Grosz 1977). 197 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2","Section 2.1 presents the centering rules and constraints. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 illustrate the theory and the definitions with a number of examples. Section 2.4 discusses the centering algorithm for the resolution of zeros in Japanese. 2.1 Rules and Constraints The centering model is very simple. Each utterance in a discourse segment has two structures associated with it. First, each utterance in a discourse has associated with it a set of discourse entities called FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf. Centers are semantic entities that are part of the discourse model. Second, there is a special member of this set called the BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER, Cb. The Cb is the discourse entity that the utterance most centrally concerns, what has been elsewhere called the 'theme' (Reinhart 1981; Horn 1986). The Cb entity links the current utterance to the previous discourse.","The set of FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf, is ranked according to discourse salience. We will discuss factors that determine the ranking below. The highest-ranked member of the set of forward-looking centers is referred to as the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp. 4 The PREFERRED CENTER represents a prediction about the Cb of the following utterance. Sometimes the Cp will be what the previous segment of discourse was about, the Cb, but this is not necessarily the case. This distinction between looking back to the previous discourse with the Cb and projecting preferences for interpretation in subsequent discourse with the Cp is a key aspect of centering theory.","In addition to the structures for centers, Cb and Cf, the theory of centering specifies a set of rules and constraints. Constraints are meant to hold strictly whereas rules may sometimes be violated.","• CONSTRAINTS For each utterance Ui in a discourse segment UI~... ~ Um: . 2. . There is precisely one backward-looking center Cb. Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(Ui), must be realized in Ui. The center, Cb(Ui), is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Ui-D that is realized in Ui. 5","Constraint (1) says that there is one central discourse entity that the utterance is about, and that is the Cb. The second constraint depends on the definition of realizes. An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished). Thus the relation REALIZE describes zeros, explicitly realized discourse entities, and those implicitly realized centers that are entities inferable from the discourse situation (Prince 1978a, 1981b).","A specialization of the relation REALIZE is the relation DIRECTLY REALIZE. A center is directly realized if it corresponds to a phrase in an utterance. We restrict our focus to entities realized by noun phrases; however, it is clear that propositions can be centers, so we assume that the account given here can be extended to propositional entities as well (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Prince 1986, 1978b; Ward 1985). 4 The notion of PREFERRED CENTER corresponds to Sidner's notion of EXPECTED FOCUS (Sidner 1983). 5 This could possibly be rephrased as: Assume the Cp(Ui-1 is the Cb(Ui) unless there is evidence to the contrary (Carter 1987). 198 Marilyn Walker et al. Japanese Discourse","As we discuss further in Section 3, zeros refer to entities that are already in the discourse context. The fact that the current utterance REALIZES one or more zeros follows from information specified in the subcategorization frame of the verb. These arguments must be interpreted and thus acquire a degree of discourse salience that nonsubcategorized-for discourse entities lack.","Constraint (3) stipulates that the ranking of the forward centers, Cf, determines from among the elements that are realized in the next utterance, which of them will be the Cb for that utterance. If the PREFERRED CENTER, Cp(Ui), is realized in Ui+l, it is predicted to be the Cb(Ui+l). We will use the following forward center ranking for Japanese: 6 (GRAMMATICAL OR ZERO) TOPIC > EMPATHY > SUBJECT > OBJECT2 > OBJECT > OTHERS","Backward-looking centers, Cbs, are often deleted or pronominalized and some transitions between discourse segments are more coherent than others. According to the theory of centering, coherence is measured by the hearer's inference load when interpreting a discourse sequence (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished). For instance, discourse segments that continue centering the same entity are more coherent than those that repeatedly shift from one center to another. These observations are encapsulated in two rules: . 2. RULES For each Ui in a discourse segment U1,..., Urn: If some element of Cf(Ui-l) is realized as a pronoun in Ui, then so is Cb(Ui). Transition states are ordered. CONTINUE is preferred to RETAIN is preferred to SMOOTH-SHIFT is preferred to ROUGH-SHIFT. 7","Rule (1) captures the intuition that pronominalization is one way to indicate discourse salience. It follows from Rule (1) that if there are multiple pronouns in an utterance, one of these must be the Cb. In addition, if there is only one pronoun, then that pronoun must be the Cb. For Japanese, we extend this rule directly to zeros, assuming that zeros in Japanese correspond to destressed pronouns in English.","Rule (2) states that modeling attentional state depends on analyzing adjacent utterances according to a set of transitions that measure the coherence of the discourse segment in which the utterance occurs. Measuring coherence is based on an estimate of the hearer's inference load, but this measure must always be relative since there is no grammar of discourse. Thus methods for exploring these issues must use comparative measures of how some discourses are easier to process than others. Centering theory models this by stipulating that some transitions are preferred over others.","The typology of transitions from one utterance, Ui, to the next is based on two factors: whether the backward-looking center, Cb, is the same from Ui-1 to Ui, and whether this discourse entity is the same as the preferred center, Cp, of Ui. 8 6 This ranking is consistent with Kuno's Empathy Hierarchies and with Kameyama's Expected Center Order (Kuno 1987; Kameyama 1985, 1988). This will be discussed in Section 6. We do not include discourse entities for verb phrases or other propositional entities in this ranking since we have not studied their contribution (but see Sidner 1979, 1981 and Carter 1987). 7 Smooth-shift was called shifting-1 by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987). 8 It is possible that restricting the relation between the Cb(Ui) and the Cb(Ui_l) to be coreference (equality) may be too strong. Future work should examine the role of shifts to functionally dependent entities or entities related by partially ordered set (POSET) relations to the previous Cb. 199 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui-1) OR Cb(Ui-1) = [?1 Cb(Ui) # Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui) CONTINUE SMOOTH-SHIFT Cb(Ui) Cp(Ui) RETAIN ROUGH-SHIFT Figure 1 Centering transition states, rule 2.","KEY","BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER = Cb PREFERRED CENTER = Cp Uninstantiated Cb = [?] . 2. Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui_l), or there is no Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui)","If both (1) and (2) hold then we are in a CONTINUE transition. The CONTINUE transition corresponds to cases where the speaker has been talking about a particular entity and indicates an intention to continue talking about that entity. 9 If (1) holds but (2) doesn't hold then we are in a RETAIN transition. RETAIN corresponds to a situation where the speaker is intending to SHIFT onto a new entity in the next utterance and is signalling this by realizing the current center in a lower ranked position on the Cf (examples follow below).","If (1) doesn't hold then we are in one of the SHIFT states depending on whether or not (2) holds. This definition of transition states is summarized in Figure 1 (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). We will use the notation of Cb(Ui-1) = [?] for cases where there is no Cb(Ui-1). Section 4 will discuss center instantiation.","The combination of the constraints, rules, and transition states makes a set of testable predictions about which interpretations hearers will prefer because they require less processing. For example, maximally coherent segments are those that require less processing time. A sequence of a CONTINUE followed by another CONTINUE should only require the hearer to keep track of one main discourse entity, which is currently both the Cb and the Cp. A single pronoun in an utterance is the current Cb (by Rule 1) and can be interpreted to cospecify the discourse entity realized by Cp(Ui-1) in one step (Constraint 3).","The ordering of the Cf is the main determinant of which transition state holds between adjacent utterances. This means that the predictions of the theory are largely determined by the ranking of the items on the Cf. But there are many factors that can contribute to the salience of a discourse entity; among them are factors that we will not examine here such as lexical semantics, intonation, word-order, and tense. 1° In this 9 A prediction made by the preference for CONTINUE is that intersentential antecedents for pronouns will be preferred over intrasentential candidates. This preference is one that distinguishes Centering for pronoun interpretation from the proposal made by Hobbs (1976a, 1976b). However, this preference needs to be constrained further by the fact that sortal filters may rule out the Cp of the previous utterance as the current Cb. In this case the data suggest that perhaps intrasentential candidates should be preferred (Walker 1989). Carter explored this in his extension of Sidner's theory of local focusing (Carter 1987).","10 See Hudson-D'Zmura (1988) for an examination of the role of lexical semantics in centering. 200 Marilyn Walker et al. Japanese Discourse paper we explore the influence of various syntactic factors, which we discuss in detail in Section 3. We will also examine the relative contribution of pronominalization and postposition marking in Section 5. We postulate that the Cf ordering will vary from language to language depending on the means the language provides for expressing discourse function. However much of this variation can be captured in the ranking of the Cf due to the modularity of the theory.","In Sections 2.2 and 2.3 we will present some simple examples to motivate these definitions. In Section 2.4 we will present a slightly modified version of the centering algorithm (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). In the following discussion we assume that the centering rules and constraints and the notion of centering transition states have some cognitive reality (Brennan submitted; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-D'Zmura and Tanenhaus, 1995). However, we make no claims about the cognitive reality of the centering algorithm that we discuss in Section 2.4. 2.2 The Distinction between Continue and Retain This theory predicts preferences in the interpretation of utterances whose meaning depends on parameters from the discourse context. Thus if there are still multiple possibilities for interpretation after the application of all constraints and rules, the ordering on transitions applies, and CONTINUE interpretations are preferred (Rule 2). Indeed, many cases of the preference for one interpretation over another follow directly from the distinction between the transition states of CONTINUE and RETAIN. Let us look at a simple example. In the discourse segment in 3, the zero in the second sentence is understood as referring to Taroo, and not to Hanako. Remember that the interpretation of zeros is indicated with parentheses.","Example 3 a. Taroo wa b.","Hanako o eiga ni sasoimasita. Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako OBJ movie to invited Taroo invited Hanako to the movie. Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, HANAKO] 0 itiniti-zyuu nani mo te ni tukimasendesita. SUBJ all-day anything even hand to attached-not (Taroo) could not do anything all day. Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO]","In example 3, the Cf from 3a contains the discourse entity for Taroo as the first element and for Hanako as the second element. When the unexpressed argument is interpreted in 3b, the information from this Cf is used. Because the zero subject may REALIZE either Taroo or Hanako, both Constraint 3 and Rule 1 would be obeyed with either interpretation. 11 However by interpreting the zero as Taroo, Taroo is the Cb, and it is possible to get a preferred CONTINUE interpretation Taroo could not do anything all day. In this interpretation, Taroo is both the Cb(3b) and the Cp(3b). 11 The hypothesis that wa in 3a instantiates Taroo as the Cb will be discussed in Section 4. 201 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 2.3 The Distinction between Smooth-Shift and Rough-Shift In example 4, we illustrate the difference between the transition states of ROUGH-SHIFT and SMOOTH-SHIFT. Remember that ROUGH-SHIFT is claimed to be less coherent than SMOOTH-SHIFT (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). In both cases the speaker has shifted the center to a different discourse entity. However, in the SMOOTH-SHIFT transition state, the speaker has indicated an intention to continue talking about the recently shifted-to entity by realizing that entity in a highly ranked Cf position such as subject, whereas no such indication is available with the ROUGH-SHIFT transition. The numbers shown to the right of an interpretation correspond to how many native speakers preferred that interpretation.","Example 4","a. Taroo ga kooen de hon o yondeimasita.

At this point it is clear that some kind of SHIFT is forced by the application of constraint 3. The two candidates are a SMOOTH-SHIFT and a ROUGH-SHIFT. The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds to the reading Ziroo invited Taroo to a movie whereas the ROUGH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds to the Taroo invited Ziroo reading. The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation is more highly ranked, thus considered more coherent and so is the preferred interpretation (Z = 10.93, p < .001)."]},{"title":"2.4 The Centering Algorithm","paragraphs":["The CENTERING ALGORITHM that was proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard incorporates the centering rules and constraints in addition to contra-indexing constraints on coreference (Reinhart 1976; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Iida 1993). These contra-indexing constraints specify that in a sentence such as He likes him, that he and him cannot co-specify the same discourse entity. The algorithm applies centering theory to the problem of resolving anaphoric reference. Application of the algorithm requires three basic steps. . 2. . GENERATE possible Cb-Cf combinations FILTER by constraints, e.g. contra-indexing,• sortal predicates, centering rules and constraints RANK by transition orderings","In order to apply this algorithm to Japanese, possible Cb-Cf combinations (GENERATE step 1) must be constructed from the surface string and information from the subcategorization frame of the verb. First the verb subcategorization is examined, and if there are more entities than appear in the surface string, zeros are postulated as forward centers. These zeros are then treated just like pronouns in English by the rest of the algorithm. We use a different ranking for the Cf for Japanese than for English, but this has no effect on the actual algorithm itself since the Cf ranking is a declarative parameter.","The steps of the algorithm given above can be interleaved to improve computational efficiency. A simple implementation is to:","• Never propose a Cf that violates linguistic constraints on contra-indexing. (In other words, apply the contra-indexing filter as early as possible to avoid Cb-Cf combinations that will be eliminated by that filter,)","• If there are pronouns in an utterance, only propose pronouns as possible Cbs.

Centering in Japanese","paragraphs":["The theory of centering is a formal specification that is intended to model attentional state and is defined by the rules and constraints given in Section 2.1. Attentional state in turn constrains the discourse participant's interpretation process; one aspect of attentional state is the notion of discourse salience. In the centering model, the ordering of the forward centers is an approximation of discourse salience. This in turn is the main determinant of discourse interpretation processes such as the resolution of zeros in Japanese. A crucial question then is what discourse factors must be considered to determine the ordering of the forward centers, Cf, in Japanese discourse.","Being a subject has been shown to be an important factor for English; this is reflected in a Cf ordering by grammatical function (Prince 1981b; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Brennan submitted).

An interpretation algorithm can also use pronominalization as an indicator of what the speaker believes is salient (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished).

Hanako is the most highly ranked entity from 24b that is realized in 24c, and therefore must be the Cb. The preferred interpretation is therefore she invited him to a movie (Z = 5.25, p < .001). This corresponds to Cfl, the more highly ranked CONTINUE transition, in which Hanako is the preferred center, Cp. This interpretation can be found with minimal processing by trying the Cp(24b), Hanako, as the Cb(24c), by interpreting the subject zero as Hanako. This gives a CONTINUE transition. Then contraindexing constraints mean that Hanako cannot fill both argument positions, so the object position is interpreted as Taroo. This interpretation is found with minimal processing by interleaving the steps of the Centering algorithm proposed in Brennan et al. (1987).","Note that nothing special needs to be said about the fact that EMPATHY is the discourse factor that made Hanako the Cp in 24b and thus predicted that Hanako would be the Cb at 24c (pace Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). The preference in the interpretation follows from the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN and the ranking of Cf. Thus, the centering framework is easily adapted to handle this language-specific feature. 3.3 Topic and Empathy In general the assignment of the EMPATHY relationship is pragmatic. It is determined by the speaker's relation to the discourse participants in the discourse. In 24, for example, the EMPATHY relationship between the speaker and Hanako and between the speaker and Taroo is clear: the use of the empathy verb in the second sentence indicates that the speaker is closer to Hanako than to Taroo.","However, besides cases where the speaker clearly expresses who s/he empathizes with, it is also possible for the context to provide some information about the speaker's proximity relationship with discourse participants in the given discourse, so that the hearer can determine the EMPATHY relation that the speaker has in mind. In this paper, we only consider cases where EMPATHY is syntactically marked by the use of empathy-loaded verbs.","Kuno's notion of EMPATHY is more general. For instance, Kuno's EMPATHY HIERAR-CHY consists of different scales for EMPATHY that include notions such as TOPIC and SPEAKER (Kuno 1987). Kuno's Topic Empathy Hierarchy suggests that the discourse entity realized as the TOPIC will often coincide with the EMPATHY LOCUS: Topic Empathy Hierarchy: Discourse-Topic > Discourse-Nontopic Given an event or state that involves A and B such that A is coreferential with the topic of the present discourse and B is not, it is easier for the speaker to empathize with A than with B.","In support of Kuno's claim, we have found that when no empathy relation is clearly indicated and no topic has been clearly established that it is difficult for a 211 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 hearer to determine the empathy relation that the speaker intends. Previous Cbs and current Cps can be high on the empathy scale, and yet the discourse entity realized as the grammatical TOPIC does not necessarily coincide with the discourse entity realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS.

That is, the possible interpretation in these examples shows that the NP my wife, which is realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS, is not as salient as the TOPIC. 19","So why is it easier to empathize with a discourse entity that has been the topic as Kuno demonstrates? It seems important to keep the notions of TOPIC and EMPATHY separate, but in Section 5.1 we will demonstrate an effect where the topic entity is interpreted as the empathy locus. We claim that the ranking of the Cf and the potential for a CONTINUE interpretation determines whether this effect will hold. In other words, the tendency for the topic entity to be interpreted as the empathy locus follows from more general discourse processing factors, such as a hearer preferring CONTINUE transitions within a given local stretch of discourse. 3.4 Summary To summarize, we have outlined the roles of discourse markers such as those for TOPIC and EMPATHY by which Japanese grammaticizes some aspects of discourse function, and we have argued that TOPIC and EMPATHY markers can only be used on entities that are already in the discourse context.","One factor that hasn't been discussed is the role of pronominalization, but many researchers have argued that discourse entities realized by pronouns are more salient than other discourse entities (Clark and Haviland 1977; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished; Kuno 1976b, 1987). We take zeros in Japanese to be analogous to pronouns in English in this respect. Since pronominalization can apply at any position in the ranking of the Cf, the role of its contribution is particularly interesting when it is in conflict with some other factor such as grammatical function or topic marking. This will be discussed further in Section 5. 4. Initial Center Instantiation INITIAL CENTER INSTANTIATION is a process by which a discourse entity introduced in a segment-initial utterance becomes the Cb. In our framework, this happens as a side effect of the Centering Algorithm. Typically, when an interpretation is found for the second utterance in a discourse segment, the Cb becomes instantiated. 2° The Cb of an initial utterance Ui is treated as a variable that is then unified with whatever Cb is assigned to the subsequent utterance Ui+l.","Typically, a discourse entity is introduced as a ga-marked subject, and then is referred to by a zero in a subsequent utterance (Clancy and Downing 1987). Consider example 29.","18 The zero may be interpreted as indirectly referring to the speaker. This interpretation is always possible when the verb kureru is used: the use of kureru implies that the speaker is closer to the beneficiary argument (i.e. the 0-marked NP in these examples), and the favor given to this person is understood as a benefit to the speaker as well.","19 Although it seems as though empathy isn't higher than subject, the conflating factor is that topic marking establishes a Cb, whereas in 28 no Cb has been established. This is explained in detail in Section 4.","20 In Walker, Iida, and Cote (1990) we called this Center Establishment. Henceforth we will refer to this process as Center Instantiation in order to avoid confusion with Kameyama's term center establishment, which is a different mechanism in her theory (Kameyama 1985). 213 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2","Example 29 a.

[ Cb: TAROO ] Cf: [TAROO] CONTINUE","Using Taroo as the subject in example 29a is not enough to establish this discourse segment as being about Taroo. It is the use of the zero in example 29b that serves to instantiate Taroo as the Cb. By our definition of CONTINUE, 29b is a continue transition, because Cb(29b) = Cp(29b) and there was no Cb in 29a. However, Kuno argues that referring to a discourse entity with a zero is equivalent to marking it as the grammatical topic with wa (Kuno 1972). Our interpretation of this argument is that the use of wa in a discourse-initial utterance instantiates the wa-marked entity as the Cb in one utterance. This claim is supported by the contrast with the GA-WA alternation in examples 30 and 31, where there is a shift in interpretation depending on whether Taroo is marked with wa in the first sentence. 21","Example 30 a.

We explain the contrast by assuming that the TOPIC instantiates the Cb when it is first introduced in a discourse-initial utterance, as in example 31a. Then the only way to get a CONTINUE interpretation for 31b is for Taroo to be the Cb at 31b.","Furthermore, we can detect no differences in the interpretation of the final utterance between three utterance sequences in which an entity is introduced by wa, and four utterance sequences in which an entity is first introduced by ga and then realized by a zero in the second utterance. This provides further support for the claim that the status of discourse entities realized as grammatical topics and those realized as zero subjects is equivalent. 4.1 Summary In sum, we have argued that the use of wa in a discourse-initial utterance instantiates the wa-marked entity as the Cb. Cb instantiation can equivalently be done with a two-utterance sequence in which the entity is first introduced as a subject, ga-marked, and then established as the Cb in the following utterance with a zero referring to that entity. In addition, the fact that the Cb is uninstantiated in discourse initial utterances has the effect that the Cf ranking in a discourse initial utterance is not a strong constraint, as it is once a Cb is established. 5.

It seems that inference from world knowledge and domain information alone is unlikely to predict which interpretations hearers will prefer. Inferential processes and discourse structure are mutually constraining (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Nadathur and Joshi 1983; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988). 5.2 Summary We proposed a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT and showed that ZTA is conditioned by the rules and constraints of centering theory: (1) ZTA only applies to discourse entities that were previously the Cb; (2) ZTA is constrained to cases where the only transition available otherwise would be a RETAIN.","ZTA arises from the interaction between preferences for CONTINUE transitions (Rule 2) and the fact that Cbs are often zeros (Rule 1). The interaction of these two factors leads to the speculation that when the Cb is realized by a pronoun in a lower ranked Cf position, which gives rise to a RETAIN transition state, that this type of transition is inherently ambiguous. Since different factors contribute to the salience of discourse entities, such as 'subjecthood' and 'pronominalization' (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished), conflicting defaults can arise when these are in conflict with one another. This may be especially true in Japanese since another factor that should contribute to Cf ranking, word order, is not present whenever zeros are involved.","These examples highlight the relation between centering and global coherence in discourse. A RETAIN is proposed as a way for a speaker to mark a coordinated transition to a new topic; it predicts a shift (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). However, the way in which centering SHIFT transitions are related to larger structures in discourse has not been specified. If a 221 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 shift functions as a boundary between segments (Walker 1993b), then the hearer's application of ZTA means that the hearer is assuming that the next utterance will be part of the same discourse segment. In contrast, a hearer's assumption that the current centering transition is a RETAIN means that the hearer assumes that the next utterance will begin a new discourse segment.","The relationship between segmentation and hearer's preferences for ZTA or RETAIN interpretations may be affected by other discourse factors. Among these factors, intonation may indicate whether the current utterance should be taken as initiating a new segment and predicting a SHIFT, or continuing the previous one (Silverman 1987; Cahn, 1992; Swerts and Geluykens 1992; Walker and Prince 1994). Another factor may be the inferred relationship that holds between adjacent utterances such as whether it is possible to interpret (d) as Ziroo's reason for having done (c) (Hobbs 1985b). However this is clearly not the only factor, or even necessarily the dominant one, as we have demonstrated. Future research must provide additional constraints on when ZTA is applicable. 6. Related Research Other researchers working on the interpretation of anaphors have focused on the role of inference from world knowledge (Hobbs 1985b, 1979). While it is important to elucidate the information needed for inference and the type of inferential process involved in discourse interpretation, it is clear from our examples that syntactic realization has a strong effect on the interpretive process and provides processing constraints on inferential processes. We have focused on the interaction between syntax and inference.","Our treatment of Japanese discourse phenomena builds on earlier work by Kuno (Kuno 1972, 1973, 1987, 1989). Our Cf ranking is consistent with Kuno's Empathy and Topic Hierarchies and we incorporate a number of Kuno's observations on the function of the grammatical topic marker wa and the role of zeros. We have also incorporated Kuno's notion of EMPATHY by using EMPATHY in the Cf ranking (Kuno 1976a; Kuno and Kaburaki 1977).","In recent work, Kuno proposes an algorithmic account of the interpretation of zeros. He claims that there are two types of zero pronouns, PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS and REAL-ZERO-PRONOUNS (Kuno 1989). REAL-ZERO-PRONOUNS are supposed to have a wa-marked NP or a presentational NP as an antecedent (Yoshimoto 1988). PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS are actually examples of deletion, and must follow the same order and the same syntactic function as their source NPs. They must obey constraints on deletion such as Kuno's Pecking Order of Deletion Principle: Delete less important information first and more important information last. According to Kuno, the position just to the left of the verb is the default focus position in Japanese, unless the verb itself is the focus. Therefore, since the verb in example 37b is the information focus, the zeros are assumed to be PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUNS.","Example 37","a.

Ziroo dislikes (Hanako). *Ziroo dislikes (Taroo).","The Taroo dislikes Ziroo interpretation would be an example of ZTA. However, we would predict that the Ziroo dislikes Hanako interpretation would be dispreferred, but this does not seem to be the case. Kuno's analysis treats the zero in the second reading of example 39b as a PSEUDO-ZERO-PRONOUN, which means that it must be interpreted as Hanako since Hanako was the object of the previous utterance.","The interpretation of 39b that we would predict as possible would be the Ziroo dislikes Taroo (RETAIN), which native speakers rarely get. However, Kuno's analysis does not block this reading either; the zero in 39b could also be a REAL-ZERO-PRONOUN, with Taroo as its antecedent. Kuno says that this interpretation is dispreferred because of a preference for parallel interpretation (Grober, Beardsley, and Caramazza 1978; Sidner 1979; Kameyama 1988; Kuno 1989). We have claimed here and elsewhere (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990) that the preference for parallelism is an epiphenomenon of the ordering of the Cf and the preference for CONTINUE interpretations.","Our account cannot explain the contrast between examples 38 and 39. It seems that what is at issue here is the fact that a set of discourse entities plus an open proposition such as X likes Y is what is discourse-old in these examples and not just a discourse entity (Prince 1981a, 1986, 1992). Our conclusion is that these enumerated lists and question-answer discourse segments may need an account of discourse center that is broader than that needed for discourse entities realized as NPS. Ktmo's constraints on 223 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 deletion must also be integrated to fully explain when entities or propositions in the discourse may be unexpressed.","Our analysis also builds on an earlier analysis put forth by Kameyama (Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988). Although Kameyama uses the centering terminology, her account is not based on the constraints and rules of centering theory as developed here and presented in (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987). Kameyama proposed that the interpretation of zeros in Japanese depends on a default preference hierarchy of syntactic properties to be shared between the antecedent and the zero (Grober, Beardsley, and Caramazza 1978). Kameyama's account of zero interpretation consists roughly of a PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT, henceforth PS, and an EXPECTED CENTER ORDER, henceforth ECO, which may be paraphrased as follows: PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT: Two zero-pronouns in adjacent utterances, which co-specify the same Cb-encoding discourse entity, should share one of the following properties (in descending order of preference): 1) both IDENT and SUBJECT, 2) IDENT alone, 3) SUBJECT-alone, 4) both NONIDENT and NONSUBJECT, 5) NONSUBJECT alone, or 6) NONIDENT alone. EXPECTED CENTER ORDER RULE: In a sentence that contains a center-establishing zero, if it is to have a full NP as its antecedent, the default preference order among its potential antecedent NPs is: Topic > Ident > Subject > Object(2) > Others.","As noted earlier, we use a modified version of Kameyama's EXPECTED CENTER ORDER as the ordering of the Cf, but Kameyama's treatment differs from ours in a number of respects.","First, Kameyama used the property IDENT to describe something similar to Kuno's notion of EMPATHY, and has an added assumption of a SUBJECT IDENT default, i.e. subjects are considered to be EMPATHY loci by default. This means that her theory also includes a neutralization device for cases where this default is not in effect (Kameyama 1988). In contrast, our theory explains examples covered by the SUBJECT IDENT default by including EMPATHY in the ranking of the Cf list and by the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN, as illustrated in example 24.","We have also expanded Kameyama's treatment of TOPIC. We have elucidated the interaction of topic with subject and empathy markers and supported our claim that the topic marker wa functions similarly to pronominalization in instantiating the Cb. In addition, ZTA and the distinction that we make between grammatical and zero topic is new to our account.","Furthermore, since Center Instantiation is a side effect of the application of the centering algorithm, we treat 40c and 41c with the same mechanism. In Kameyama's analysis, the PS constraint applies to example 40, while the ECO applies in example 41."]},{"title":"Example 40","paragraphs":["a. Hanako wa b.","repooto o kakimasita.

PS applies in the case of example 40c because the previous utterance has a zero, but it doesn't apply in the case of example 41b. PS would seem to predict that the zero pronoun in 40c should not be interpreted as Hanako, since the zero carries the properties [SuBJ, IDENT] in 40b and [NONSUBJ, NONIDENT] in 40c. In other words, none of the required properties of SUBJ, IDENT, NONSUBJ, NONIDENT, which 'should' be shared according to the PS constraint, are shared. But in fact 40c is perfectly acceptable under the intended reading of Taroo severely criticized Hanako, and 41b is likewise acceptable under the reading Taroo did Hanako a favor of reading a book.","Also, as pointed out in Kuno (1989), Kameyama's theory makes no predictions about the interpretation of some of the zeros in examples such as 5, repeated here for convenience as example 42.","Example 42 a.

Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we have attempted to elucidate the interaction of syntactic realization and discourse salience in Japanese using the discourse-processing framework of CENTERING. In our theory discourse salience is operationalized by the ranking of the forward centers for an utterance. We explored speakers' options for indicating salience in Japanese discourse, especially the interaction of discourse markers for TOPIC and EMPATHY. We then posited a ranking and used it to explain some facts about the interpretation of zeros in Japanese.","While there is clearly a correlation between syntax and discourse function, we show that discourse context plays an important role. We proposed a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT (ZTA), which distinguishes grammatical and zero topic. We showed that centering allows us to formalize constraints on when ZTA can apply. However, future work must determine additional constraints on when ZTA applies, and which language families support ZTA. 226 Marilyn Walker et al. Japanese Discourse","The preferred interpretation of zeros and the discourse factors that are responsible for each interpretation are summarized below. Remember that in each case the zero in the third utterance was established as the Cb by the previous two utterances: Third Utterance Fourth Utterance Discourse Factor Example SUBJECT OBJECT(2) SUBJECT OBJECT(2) zero(i) NP(j) zero(i) zero(j) Continue/Retain 5 zero(i) NP(j) NP(ga)(i) zero(j) NP(wa)(i) zero(j) NP(ga)(i) zero(j) zero(j) zero(i),empathy zero(j) zero(i) zero(j) zero(i) empathy, Continue/Retain 36 zero(i) ZTA 32, 34","33 zero(j) zero(i)","WA-effect ZTA ZTA and empathy zero(j),empathy 35","This analysis suggests that centering may be a universal of context-dependent processing of language, although so far this theory has only been applied to English, German, Turkish, Japanese, and Italian (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Di Eugenio 1990; Cote 1992; Rambow 1993; Nakatani 1993; Hofhnan 1995; Turan 1995). We proposed that the centering component of a theory of discourse interpretation can be constructed in a language-independent fashion, up to the declaration of a language-specific value for one parameter of the theory, i.e., Cf ranking (as in Section 2). This parameter is language-dependent because different languages offer different means of expressing discourse function. We conjecture that ZTA may apply in any free-word order language with zeros.","Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b), and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992, 1993a; Cote 1995). It is also important to examine the interaction of zeros with overt pronouns and with deictics and the interaction of pronominalization with accenting (Terken 1995). In addition, the semantic theory underlying centering must be further developed (Roberts 1995). Finally, centering transitions are currently defined by an equality relation between discourse entities, but POSET relations and functional dependencies often link entities in discourse (Prince 1978b, 1981a; Ward 1985; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished). The predictions made here should also be tested on a large corpus of naturally occurring Japanese discourse (Hurewitz and Linson 1995)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Aravind Joshi and Ellen Prince for their insight, useful discussions, and support for making it possible to have the workshop on Centering Theory in Naturally-Occurring Discourse at the Institute for Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania.
