We demonstrate that the main use of such data, machine learning, can tolerate data with low reliability as long as any disagreement among human coders looks like random noise. When the disagreement introduces patterns, however, the machine learner can pick these up just like it picks up the real patterns in the data, making the performance figures lookbetter than they really are. For the range of reliability measures that the field currently accepts, disagreement can appreciably inflate performance figures, and even a measure of 0.8 does not guarantee that what looks like good performance really is. Although this is a commonsense result, it has implications for how we work. At the very least, computational linguists should lookfor any patterns in the disagreement among coders and assess what impact they will have. 1. Introduction In computational linguistics, 0.8 is often regarded as some kind of magical reliability cut-off guaranteeing the quality of hand-coded data (e.g., Reithinger and Kipp 1998; Shriberg et al.1998; Galley et al.2004), with 0.67 to 0.8 tolerable—although it is as often honored in the breech as in the observance.The argument for the meaning of 0.8 arises originally from Krippendorff (1980, page 147), in a comment about practice in the field of content analysis.He states that correlations found between two variables using their hand-coded values “tend to be insignificant” when the hand-codings have a reliability below 0.8. He uses a specific reliability statistic, α, for his measurements, but Carletta (1996) implicitly assumes kappa-like metrics are similar enough in practice for the rule of thumb to apply to them as well.A detailed discussion on the differences and similarities of these, and other, measures is provided by Krippendorff (2004); in this article we will use Cohen’s κ (1960) to investigate the value of the 0.8 reliability cut-off for computational linguistics.","Modern computational linguists use data in a completely different way from 1970s content analysts.Rather than correlating two variables, we use hand-coded data as ∗ University of Twente, Human Media Interaction, Room ZI2067, PO Box 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands, D.Reidsma@utwente.nl. ∗∗ University of Edinburgh, Human Communication Research Centre, J.Carletta@ed.ac.uk.

More data will yield more signal and the learner will ignore the noise.However, as Craggs and McGee Wood (2005) suggest, this also makes systematic disagreement dangerous, because it provides an unwanted pattern for the learner to detect.We demonstrate that machine learning can tolerate data with a low reliability measurement as long as the disagreement looks like random noise, and that when it does not, data can have a reliability measure commonly held to be acceptable but produce misleading results. 2. Method To explain what is wrong with using 0.8 as a cut-off, we need to think about how data is used for classification tasks.Consider Figure 1, which shows a relation between some features A and a class label B.Learning labels from a set of features is a common task in computational linguistics; for instance, in Shriberg et al.(1998), which assumes a pre-existing dialogue act segmentation, the labels are dialogue act types, and they are learned from automatically derived prosodic features.In this way of using data, only one of the variables—the output dialogue act label—is hand-coded.In the figure, the real relationship between prosody and dialogue act label is shown on the left; R relates the prosodic features A to the output act B. Figure 1 Hand-coded target labels are used to train classifiers to automatically predict those labels from features. 320 Reidsma and Carletta Reliability Measurement without Limits","In theory, there is one correct label for any given act.However, in practice human coders disagree, choosing different labels for the same act (sometimes even with divergences that make one question whether there is one correct answer).The data actually available for analysis is shown in the middle of the figure.Here, the automatic features, A, are the same as before, but there are multiple, possibly differing labels for the same act, Bobs, coming from different human annotators.Finally, on the right the figure shows the classifier.It takes the same prosodic features A and uses them to predict a dialogue act label Bpred on new data, using the relationship learned from the observed data, RML.Projects vary in how they choose data from which to build the classifier when coders disagree, but whatever they do is colored by the observations they have available to them.We often think of reliability assessment as telling us how much disagreement there is among the human coders, but the real issue is how their individual interpretations of the coding scheme make RML differ from R.","There is a problem that arises for anyone using this methodology.Without the “real” data, it is impossible to judge how well the learned relationship reflects the real one.Classification performance for Bpred can only be calculated with respect to the “observed” data Bobs.In this article, we surmount this problem by simulating the real world so that we can measure the differences between this “observed” performance and the “real” performance.Our simulation uses a Bayesian network (Pearl 1988) to create an initial, “real” data set with 3,000 samples of features (A) and their corresponding target labels (B).For simplicity, we use a single five-valued feature and five possible labels. The relative label frequencies vary between 17% and 25%.This gives us a small amount of variation around what is essentially equally distributed data.We corrupt the labels (B) to simulate the “hand-coded” observed data (Bobs) corresponding to the output of a human coder, and then train a neural network constructed using the WEKA toolkit (Witten and Frank 2005) on 2,000 samples from Bobs.Finally, we calculate the neural network’s performance twice, using as test data either the remaining 1,000 samples from Bobs or the initial, “real” versions of those same 1,000 samples.","There are three ways in which we need to vary our simulation in order to be systematic.The first is in the strength of the relationship between the features the machine learner takes as input and the target labels, which we achieve simply by changing the probabilities in the Bayesian network that creates the data set.In the simulation, we vary the strength of the relationship in eight graded steps.1","Thesecondisintheamount of disagreement we introduce when we create the observed data (Bobs).We create 200 different versions of the hand-coded data that cover a range of values from κ = 0to 1 We use Cramer’s phi to measure the strength of a relationship.Cramer’s phi is defined as φc = √","χ2 (N) ∗ dfsmaller with N the number of samples and dfsmaller the smallest degree of freedom of the two involved variables, and is a measure of association for nominal variables with more than two values.It can be “considered like a correlation coefficient” (Aron and Aron 2003) that takes data set size into account and can easily be derived for a Bayesian network from the priors and the conditional probability tables.We varied the strength of the network between φc = 0.06 and φc = 0.45.Following Cohen (1988), for a five-way distinction Aron and Aron (page 527) would consider 0.06 to represent a small real relationship—that is, one with not much effect—and 0.3, a large one. Thus we describe 0.06 as “weak,” 0.45 as “very strong,” and intermediate points as “moderate” and “strong.” It is an open question what strengths of relationships actually occur in computational linguistics data, although there may be no point in learning a relationship that’s too strong. 321 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 3 Figure 2 Machine-learning performance obtained on annotations with noise-like disagreements for (a) weak (φc = 0.06), (b) moderate (φc = 0.20), (c) strong (φc = 0.32), and (d) very strong (φc = 0.45) relationships between the features and labels. κ = 1, by introducing a varying amount of observation errors in the simulated coding process.2","The third is in the type of disagreement with which we degrade the real data to create the observed data (Bobs), representing the types of coding errors the human annotators make.Again for simplicity, we describe the effects of both random errors and the overuse of a single coding label. 3. The Case ofNoise Figure 2 shows how a neural network performs when coders make random mistakes in their coding task, that is, for noise-like disagreement, for the cases of (a) weak, (b) moderate, (c) strong, and (d) very strong relationships between the features (A)and labels (B).Here, the y axis shows “accuracy,” or the percentage of samples in the test 2 To calculate κ for a specific simulated coding we generate two copies of additional “real” data that has not been used for training or testing, apply the same simulated human annotator to one copy, and a second annotator who makes the same number of “mistakes” to the other copy.This mimics the common practice of having one annotator code the data, with a second annotator coding enough to test the reliability. 322 Reidsma and Carletta Reliability Measurement without Limits data for which the network chooses the correct label.The x axis varies the amount of coder errors in the data to correspond to different κ values, with the two black lines marking the values of κ = 0.67 and κ = 0.8.","Look first at the series depicted as a line.It shows accuracy measured by using the “observed” version of the test data, which is how testing is normally done.For each relationship strength, as κ increases, so does accuracy.In all cases, at κ = 0 (that is, when the coders fail to agree beyond what one would expect if they were all choosing their labels randomly) accuracy is at 20%, which is what one would expect if the classifier were choosing randomly as well.For any given κ value, the stronger the underlying relationship, the more benefit the neural network can derive from the data.Now look at the other of the two series, depicted as small squares.It shows accuracy measured by using the “real” version of the data.Interestingly, the “real” performance, that is, the power of the learned model to predict reality, is higher than performance as measured against the observed data.This is because for some samples, the classifier’s predictions are correct, but because the observations contain errors, the test data actually gets them wrong.The stronger the relationship in the real data, the more marked this effect becomes.The neural network is able to disregard noise-like coding errors at very low κ values simply because the errors contain no patterns for it to learn. 4. The Case ofOverusing a Label Now consider the case where instead of random coding errors, the coder over-uses the least frequent one of the five labels for B.Figure 3 shows the results for this kind of coding error.Remember that in the graphs, the series depicted as a line shows the observed performance of the classifier—that is, performance as it is usually measured. The two black lines again mark the κ values of interest (κ = 0.67 and κ = 0.8).","The graphs show an entirely different effect from the one obtained for noise-like coding errors: For lower values of κ, the observed performance is spuriously high.This makes perfect sense—κ is low when the pattern of label overuse is strong, and the neural network picks it up.When the observed data is used to test performance, some of the samples match not because the classifier gets the label right, but because it overuses the same label as the human coder.For data with a very strong correlation between the input features A and the output labels B, the turning point below which performance is spuriously high occurs at around κ = 0.55 (Figure 3d), a value the community holds to be pretty low but which is not unknown in published work.However, when the underlying relationship to be learned is moderate or strong (Figures 3b and 3c), the spuriously high results already occur for κ values commonly held to be tolerable.With a weak relationship, the turning point can occur at κ>0.8 (Figure 3a). 5. Discussion Our simulation highlights a danger for current practice in computational linguistics, among other fields.Overuse of a label is a realistic type of error for human annotators to make.For instance, imagine a coding scheme for dialogue acts that distinguishes backchannel utterances from utterances which indicate agreement.In data containing many utterances where the speech consists of “Yeah,” individual coders can easily have a marked bias for either one of these two categories.Clearly, in actual coding, not all disagreement will be of one type, but will contain a mix of different systematic and noise-like errors.In addition, the underlying relationships that our systems attempt to 323 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 3 Figure 3 Machine-learning performance obtained on annotations that suffered from over-coding for (a) weak (φc = 0.06), (b) moderate (φc = 0.20), (c) strong (φc = 0.32), and (d) very strong (φc = 0.45) relationships between the features and labels. learn vary in strength.This makes discerning the degree of danger more difficult, but does not change the substance of our argument.","Although the graphs we show are for a specific simulation, the general pattern we describe is robust.In particular, using α in place of κ does not markedly change the results; neither does increasing or decreasing the data set size.Our simulations and results are presented for a machine-learning context.However, that does not mean that other types of data use are immune to the problems we describe here.Other statistical uses of data will be affected in their own ways by the difference between structural and noise-like disagreement. 6. Implications At the moment, much of the effort we devote to reliability measurement as a community is used to establish one or more overall reliability statistics for our data sets and to argue about which reliability statistic is most appropriate.Methodological discussions focus on questions such as how to force annotated data structures into the mathematical form necessary to calculate κ, or what effects certain aspects of the annotation have on the values of some metric rather than on possible uses of the resulting data (Marcu, Amorrortu, 324 Reidsma and Carletta Reliability Measurement without Limits and Romera 1999; Di Eugenio and Glass 2004; Artstein and Poesio 2005).Computational linguists are of course aware that no overall reliability measure can give a complete story, but often fail to spend time analyzing coder disagreements further.Unfortunately, our results suggest that current practice is insufficient, at least where the data is destined to be input for a machine-learning process and quite possibly for other data uses as well.This complements observations of Artstein and Poesio: Besides the fact that many different ways of calculating reliability metrics lead to different values, which makes comparing them to a threshold difficult (Artstein and Poesio in press), the very idea of having any such single threshold in the first place turns out to be impossible to hold.Instead of worrying about exactly how much disagreement there is in a data set and how to measure it, we should be looking at the form the disagreement takes. A headline measurement, no matter how it is expressed, will not show the difference between noise-like and systematic disagreement, but this difference can be critical for establishing whether or not a data set is fit for the purpose for which it is intended.","To tease out what sort of disagreement a data set contains, Krippendorff suggests calculating odd-man-out and per-class reliability to find out which class distinctions are problematic (1980, page 150).Bayerl and Paul (2007) discuss methods for determining which factors (schema changes, coding team changes, etc.) were involved in causing poor annotation quality.Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara (1999) suggest looking at the marginals and how they differ between coders to find indications of whether disagreements are caused by systematic bias (as opposed to being random) and in which classes they occur.Although clearly useful techniques, none of these diagnostics is specifically designed to address the needs of machine learners which are designed to recognize patterns.Overusing a label is just one simple example of a type of systematic disagreement that adds unwanted patterns that a machine learner can find.Any spurious pattern could be a problem.For this reason, we should be looking specifically for patterns in the disagreement itself.","Our suggestion for one possible diagnostic technique is based on the following observation: If the disagreements between two coders contain no pattern, any test for association or correlation, when performed on only the disagreed items, should show no relation between the labels assigned by the two coders.For certain patterns in the disagreement, however, a correlation would show up.(To see this, consider the case where one coder tends to label rhetorical questions as yes/no-questions and the other coder assigns both labels correctly: If this happens often enough, tests for association would come up with a relation between the labels for the two coders for the disagreed items.) If the test shows a correlation, the disagreements add patterns for the machine learner to find.Unfortunately, the converse does not necessarily hold: It is possible that not all patterns that could be picked up by a machine learner will show up in correlations between disagreed items, for example because the amount of multiplyannotated data is too small.The computational linguistics community therefore needs to develop additional diagnostics for patterns in the coder disagreements.","It should go without saying that analysts will benefit from keeping how they intend to use the data firmly in mind at all times.As Krippendorff (2004, page 429) recommends, one should test reliability for the “distinctions that matter” and perform “suitable experiments of the effects of unreliable data on the conclusions.” Patterns found for an overall coding scheme will not always affect every possible data use.For instance, we often build classifiers not for complete coding schemes, but for some subset of the labels or some “class map” that transforms the scheme into a smaller set of classes. In these cases, what is important is disagreement for the subset or transformation, not the entire scheme.Similarly, where classifier performance is reported per class, the 325 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 3 reliability for that particular label will be the most important.Finally, different machine-learning algorithms may react differently to different kinds of patterns in the data and to combinations of patterns in different relative strengths.In complicated cases, perhaps the safest way to assess whether or not there is a problem with systematic disagreement is to run a simulation like the one we have reported but with the kind and scale of disagreement suspected of the data, and to use that to estimate the possible effects of unreliable data on the performance of machine-learning algorithms.
