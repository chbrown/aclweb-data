Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
