The editors write in their introduction: \"The success of these workshops was in some measure a reflection of the growing popularity of corpus-based methods in the NLP community. But first and foremost, it was due to the fact that the workshops attracted so many high-quality papers. The importance of this material for the field is such that it deserves to be made more readily available than harder-to-find or out-of-print workshop proceedings.\" The contents of the volume are as follows:","\"Implementation and evaluation of a German HMM for POS disambiguation\" by Helmut Feldweg","\"Improvements in part-of-speech tagging with an application to German\" by Helmut Schmid","\"Unsupervised learning of disambiguation rules for part-of-speech tagging\" by Eric Brill and Mihai Pop","\"Tagging French without lexical probabilities ---Combining linguistic knowledge and statistical learning\" by Evelyne Tzoukermann, Dragomir Radev, and William Gale","\"Example-based sense tagging of running Chinese text\" by Xiang Tong, Chang-ning Huang, and Cheng-ming Guo","\"Disambiguating noun groupings with respect to WordNet senses\" by Philip Resnik","\"A comparison of corpus-based techniques"]},{"title":"for","paragraphs":["restoring accents in Spanish and French text\" by David Yarowsky","\"Beyond word N-grams\" by Fernando Pereira, Yoram Singer, and Naftali Tishby","\"Statistical augmentation of a Chinese machine-readable dictionary\" by Pascale Fung and Dekai Wu","\"Text chunking using transformation-based learning\" by Lance Ramshaw and Mitchell P.

It is therefore different from more de-tailed introductory texts in this area, which assume both a background in engineering / signal processing and a more sophisticated mathematical knowledge. Part of the motivation for writing this section of the book is to make many of the techniques and algorithms that are discussed in the engineering literature on speech analysis more accessible to both students and researchers of phonetics and speech science whose training is not usually in a scientific discipline. We have therefore tried to keep equations to a minimum and to assume, as far as possible, no more than a very basic understanding of algebra and trigonometry. In this part of the book we cover fundamental aspects of time and frequency domain processing of speech signals, digital techniques for combining (in digital formant synthesis) and separating (in linear predictive coding) the contributions of the source and filter to the acoustic speech signal, and techniques for the probabilistic classification of acoustic speech data that form the basis of more advanced work in automatic speech recognition.\"--From the preface (abridged) Syntactic Theory: A Formal Introduction Ivan A.

This book focuses on the development of precisely formulated grammars whose empirical predictions can be directly tested. There is considerable emphasis on prediction and evaluation of grammatical hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntactic hypotheses with matters of semantic analysis. Problem solving is also emphasized; the extensive problem sets draw from a variety of languages other than English. Special at-tention is paid to the nature of lexical entries and the organization of the lexicon in terms of type hierarchies and constraint in-heritance. The theoretical perspective of the book is presented in the context of current models of language processing, which provide motivation for a constraint-based, lexicalist grammatical architecture, whose value has already been demonstrated in computer language processing applications.'--From the publisher's announcement Word-Order Based Grammar Eva Koktova Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter (Trends in linguistics: studies and monographs, edited by Wemer Winter, volume 121), 1999, xv+389 pp; hardbound, ISBN 3-11-061252-0, DM 198.00 \"In this book, I propose, in outline, a new theory of grammar, which I call Word-Order Based Grammar.","\"In my theory, word order is the primary grammatical principle.
