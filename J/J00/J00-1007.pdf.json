The paper should begin with an iriformative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the edltor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced.pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the L TEX style files. The submission of an article to CL for .refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a \"work for hire,\" by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion. Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to: Julia Hirschberg, CL Editor AT&T Labs-Research, Room A257 180 Park Avenue Florham Park, NJ 07932-0971 (+1 973) 360-8330; acl@research.att.com. Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, discussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LTEX source, postscript or plain text) are welcome and should be submitted to: Pierre Isabelle, CL Squibs and Discussions Editor • Xerox Research Centre Europe 6, chemin de Maupertuis 38240 Meylan, France +33 4 76 61 51 98; Pierre.Isabelle@xrce.xerox.com Book Section: Anyone interested in reviewing a book, or in suggesting a book for review, should contact the Book Review Editor; publishers mayalso submit copies of books for review directly to: Gra'eme Hirst, CL Book Review Editor University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Toronto, CANADA M5S .3G4 (+1 416) 978-8747; gh@cs.toronto.edu Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing Cdmputational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation , Computational Phonology, MulRmedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
