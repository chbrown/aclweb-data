NYU, as part of its work on the domain model, has developed a procedure that can identify a component in the model from any of the noun phrases that can name that component (Ksiezyk and Grishman, submitted for publication). After further development, these procedures will be integrated into a comprehensive noun phrase semantic analyzer. 4.5.3. TIME ANALYSIS (SDC) SDC has started to develop a module to process time information. Sources of time information include verb tense, adverbial time expressions, prepositional phrases, co-ordinate and subordinate conjunctions. These are all mapped into a small set of predicates expressing a partial time ordering among the states and events in the message. 4.6. DOMAIN MODEL (NYU) The domain model captures the detailed information about the general class of equipment, and about the specific pieces of equipment involved in the messages; this information is needed in order to fully understand the messages. The model integrates part/whole information, type/instance links, and functional information about the various components (Ksiezyk and Grishman, submitted for publication).","The knowledge base performs several functions: • It provides the domain-specific constraints needed for the semantics to select the correct arguments for a predicate, so that modifiers are correctly attached to noun phrases. • It enables noun phrase semantics to identify the correct referent for a phrase. • It provides the prototype information structures which are instantiated in order to record the information in a particular message. • It provides the information on equipment structure and function used by the discourse rules in establishing probable causal links between the sentences. And finally, associated with the components in the knowledge base are procedures for graphically displaying the","status of the equipment as the message is interpreted.","These functions are performed by a large network of frames implemented using the Symbolics Zetalisp flavors system. 4.7. DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (NYU) The semantic analyzer generates separate semantic representations for the individual sentences of the message. For many applications it is important to establish the (normally implicit) intersentential relationships between the sentences. This is performed by a set of inference rules that (using the domain model) identify plausible causal and enabling relationships among the sentences. These relationships, once established, can serve to resolve some semantic ambiguities. They can also supplement the time information extracted during semantic analysis and thus clarify temporal relations among the sentences. 4.8. DIAGNOSTICS (NYU) The diagnostic procedures are intended to localize the cause of failure of the analysis and provide meaningful feedback when some domain-specific constraint has been violated. We are initially concentrating on violations of local (selectional) constraints, and have built a small component for diagnosing such violations and suggesting acceptable sentence forms; later work will study more global discourse constraints.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION CL AND AI BIBLIOGRAPHY Kuwait University is currently compiling an extensive bibliography in the areas of Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. The bibliography is meant to be of value particularly to universities and research centers that, like KU, are planning to start research and teaching in these areas. It will assist them to base their planning on state-of-the-art information in the field and to be aware of available resources.","The bibliography will include information on books, journals, publisl3ed papers, technical reports, educational tools, and systems.","We would appreciate information on any of the above categories, particularly on technical reports, tools for research, and systems. Information on systems should include: purpose of system, name(s) of designer(s), technical features, limitations, programming language, hardware requirements, and availability for educational institutions.","The bibliography will be published at the end of 1987. It may also be available on line through the European Academic Network.","Please direct correspondence to:","Ali Farghaly","Kuwait University","English Department","P.O. Box 23558, Safat 13096","Kuwait ANNOUNCEMENTS COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE Academic Press has announced this new journal, which commenced publication in March 1986. The purpose of the journal is to publish reports of original research related to quantitative descriptions of the recognition, understanding, production, and coding of speech by humans and/or machines.","The speech sciences have a long history, but it is only fairly recently that experirnentation with complex models of speech processes has become feasible. At present such research is carded out somewhat separately by practitioners of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, Linguistics, Phonetics, and Psychology. Appropriate areas of investigation include the use of constructive mathematical analyses, computer simulation, algorithms for pattern analysis, syntactic and linguistic structures, the establishment of models of human performance, and the use of computers in measurements.","The journal will aim to provide a focus for this work and to encourage an interdisciplinary approach to problems in the speech sciences. Thus, contributions from all of the related disciplines will be welcomed in the form of reports of theoretical or experimental studies, tutorials, and brief correspondence pertaining to models of speech communication and their implementation, or fundamental research leading to the improvement of such models.
