The book presents a detailed description of various technologies developed during the period of the SLT project, with an emphasis on language and linguistic processing. It includes four parts: language processing and corpora, linguistic coverage, speech processing, and evaluation and conclusions.","The SLT used a multiengine machine translation architecture. The main machine translation engine is a complex, unification grammar–based system intended to perform deep analysis and to produce high-quality output. The authors claim that the handcoded grammars used in SLT are linguistically motivated and generic in nature. Therefore, the grammar coverage is broad, and it is feasible to use these methods in serious applications. However, the translation task was evaluated only in the domain of air travel reservations. The authors also worked on methods to convert grammars generated for English to corresponding grammars for French and Swedish, as well as the possibility of writing a single large grammar for two closely related languages. The grammar-based subsystem is responsible for structural translation via the quasi-logical form transfer method.","Another translation engine used in SLT is a simple word-to-word system, intended for shallow processing, speed, robustness, and broad coverage. The word-to-word translation component simply uses rules to associate a source language phrase of one or more words with a target language phase of zero or more words. Source language words may be tagged with part-of-speech labels. This technique was intended to fill in the gaps (i.e., to translate utterances that are not covered by the grammars, including utterances that are grammatically incorrect, such as speech recognition errors or disfluencies in spontaneous speech).","The speech recognition technology used in SLT was a state-of-the-art hidden Markov model–based approach, with some interesting new techniques, such as discrete-mixture models, which run two to three times faster than continuous-density models with similar recognition performance. The speech recognition system was developed for multilingual speech and is capable of decoding a word string in any of a given set of languages. Both acoustic modeling and language modeling issues for a multilingual recognition system are addressed. Text-to-speech translation is an inevitable part of a speech-to-speech translation system. However, text-to-speech technology is not considered in this book, and prosody translation and prosody transfer are described only briefly.","A series of empirical evaluation experiments is thoroughly described and the results analyzed in chapter 20. Although all evaluations are subjective, several fine scales are used for quality judgment. Furthermore, the main system performance is compared when variations are generated either by replacing selected components or changing the values of the critical parameters. One interesting study discussed in this chapter is on “pipeline synergy,” which is based on the intuition that “utterances that are hard to hear are also hard to understand and translate.” The authors show that assuming that error rates for the individual components are independent can lead to serious overestimates of the system error rate. This chapter is worthwhile for readers who are interested in performance evaluation of speech-to-speech translation systems.","In general, this book is a useful resource for those who are interested in knowing how to build a speech-to-speech translation system, especially for those who are interested in grammar-based language processing approaches.—Yuqing Gao, IBM T.
