{"sections":[{"title":"Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation","paragraphs":["Yael Karov* Weizmann Institute Shimon Edelman t MIT We describe a method for automatic word sense disambiguation using a text corpus and a machine-readable dictionary (MRD). The method is based on word similarity and context similarity measures. Words are considered similar if they appear in similar contexts; contexts are similar if they contain similar words. The circularity of this definition is resolved by an iterative, converging process, in which the system learns from the corpus a set of typical usages for each of the senses of the polysemous word listed in the MRD. A new instance of a polysemous word is assigned the sense associated with the typical usage most similar to its context. Experiments show that this method can learn even from very sparse training data, achieving over 92% correct disambiguation performance. 1. Introduction Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of assigning a sense to an ambiguous word, using its context. We assume that different senses of a word correspond to different entries in its dictionary definition. For example, suit has two senses listed in a dictionary: 'an action in court,' and 'suit of clothes.' Given the sentence The union's lawyers are reviewing the suit, we would like the system to decide automatically that suit is used there in its court-related sense (we assume that the part of speech of the polysemous word is known).","In recent years, text corpora have been the main source of information for learning automatic WSD (see, for example, Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1992]). A typical corpus-based algorithm constructs a training set from all contexts of a polysemous word W in the corpus, and uses it to learn a classifier that maps instances of W (each supplied with its context) into the senses. Because learning requires that the examples in the training set be partitioned into the different senses, and because sense information is not available in the corpus explicitly, this approach depends critically on manual sense tagging--a laborious and time-consuming process that has to be repeated for every word, in every language, and, more likely than not, for every topic of discourse or source of information.","The need for tagged examples creates a problem referred to in previous works as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: training a disambiguator for W requires that the examples in the corpus be partitioned into senses, which, in turn, requires a fully operational disambiguator. The method we propose circumvents this problem by automatically tagging the training set examples for W using other examples, that do not contain W, but do contain related words extracted from its dictionary definition. For instance, in the training set for suit, we would use, in addition to the contexts of suit, * Dept. of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel t Center for Biological & Computational Learning, MIT E25-201, Cambridge, MA 02142. Present address: School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer BN1 9QH, UK (~) 1998 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 all the contexts of court and of clothes in the corpus, because court and clothes appear in the machine-readable dictionary (MRD) entry of suit that defines its two senses. Note that, unlike the contexts of suit, which may discuss either court action or clothing, the contexts of court are not likely to be especially related to clothing, and, similarly, those of clothes will normally have little to do with lawsuits. We will use this observation to tag the original contexts of suit.","Another problem that affects the corpus-based WSD methods is the sparseness of data: these methods typically rely on the statistics of co-occurrences of words, while many of the possible co-occurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer 1993). We address this problem in several ways. First, instead of tallying word statistics from the examples for each sense (which may be unreliable when the examples are few), we collect sentence-level statistics, representing each sentence by the set of features it contains (for more on features, see Section 4.2). Second, we define a similarity measure on the feature space, which allows us to pool the statistics of similar features. Third, in addition to the examples of the polysemous word 142 in the corpus, we learn also from the examples of all the words in the dictionary definition of W. In our experiments, this resulted in a training set that could be up to 20 times larger than the set of original examples.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the approach we have developed. In Section 3, we report the results of tests we have conducted on the Treebank-2 corpus. Section 4 concludes with a discussion of related methods and a summary. Proofs and other details of our scheme can be found in the appendix."]},{"title":"2. Similarity-based Disambiguation","paragraphs":["Our aim is to have the system learn to disambiguate the appearances of a polysemous word W (noun, verb, or adjective) with senses Sl .... , sk, using as examples the appearances of W in an untagged corpus. To avoid the need to tag the training examples manually, we augment the training set by additional sense-related examples, which we call a feedback set. The feedback set for sense si of word W is the union of all contexts that contain some noun found in the entry of si(W) in an MRD. 1 Words in the intersection of any two sense entries, as well as examples in the intersection of two feedback sets, are discarded during initialization; we also use a stop list to discard from the MRD definition high-frequency words, such as that, which do not contribute to the disambiguation process. The feedback sets can be augmented, in turn, by original training-set sentences that are closely related (in a sense defined below) to one of the feedback-set sentences; these additional examples can then attract other original examples.","The feedback sets constitute a rich source of data that are known to be sorted by sense. Specifically, the feedback set of si is known to be more closely related to si than to the other senses of the same word. We rely on this observation to tag automatically the examples of W, as follows. Each original sentence containing W is assigned the sense of its most similar sentence in the feedback sets. Two sentences are considered to be similar insofar as they contain similar words (they do not have to share any word); words are considered to be similar if they appear in similar sentences. The circularity of this definition is resolved by an iterative, converging process, described below. 1 By MRD we mean a machine-readable dictionary, or a thesaurus, or any combination of such knowledge sources. 42 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation 2.1 Terminology A context, or example, of the target word W is any sentence that contains W and (optionally) the two adjacent sentences in the corpus. The features of a sentence 8 are its nouns, verbs, and the adjectives of W and of any noun that appears both in $ and in W's MRD definition(s), all used after stemming (it is also possible to use other types of features, such as word n-grams or syntactic information; see Section 4.2). As the number of features in the training data can be very large, we automatically assign each relevant feature a weight indicating the extent to which it is indicative of the sense (see Section A.3 in the appendix). Features that appear less than two times in the training set, and features whose weight falls under a certain threshold, are excluded. A sentence is represented by the set of the remaining relevant features it contains. 2.2 Computation of Similarity Our method hinges on the possibility of computing similarity between the original contexts of W and the sentences in the feedback sets. We concentrate on similarities in the way sentences use W, not on similarities in the meaning of the sentences. Thus, similar words tend to appear in similar contexts, and their textual proximity to the ambiguous word W is indicative of the sense of W. Note that contextually similar words do not have to be synonyms, or to belong to the same lexical category. For example, we consider the words"]},{"title":"doctor","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"health","paragraphs":["to be similar because they frequently share contexts, although they are far removed from each other in a typical semantic hierarchy such as the WordNet (Miller et al. 1993).

The algorithm for updating the similarity matrices in-volves an auxiliary relation between words and sentences, which we call affinity, introduced to simplify the symmetric iterative treatment of similarity between words and sentences. A word W is assumed to have a certain affinity to every sentence. Affinity (a real number between 0 and 1) reflects the contextual relationships between W and the words of the sentence. If W belongs to a sentence S, its affinity to S is 1; if W is totally unrelated to S, the affinity is close to 0 (this is the most common case); if W is contextually similar to the words of S, its affinity to S is between 0 and 1. In a symmetric manner, a sentence S has some affinity to every word, reflecting the similarity of S to sentences involving that word.","We say that a word belongs to a sentence, denoted as W E S, if it is textually contained there; in this case, sentence is said to include the word: S 9 W. Affinity is then defined as follows: affn(W, S) = max simn(W, Wi) (1)","WiCS aff,(S, W) = max simn(S,"]},{"title":"Sj)","paragraphs":["(2) 8j~w where n denotes the iteration number, and the similarity values are defined by the word and sentence similarity matrices, WSMn and SSMn .3 The initial representation of a sentence, as the set of words that it directly contains, is now augmented by a 3 At first glance it may seem that the mean rather than the maximal similarity of W to the words of a sentence should determine the affinity between the two. However, any definition of affinity that takes into account more words than just the one with the maximal similarity to W, may result in a word being directly contained in the sentence, but having an affinity to it that is smaller than 1. 44 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation similarity-based representation; the sentence contains more information or features than the words directly contained in it. Every word has some affinity to the sentence, and the sentence can be represented by a vector indicating the affinity of each word to it. Similarly, every word can be represented by the affinity of every sentence to it. Note that affinity is asymmetric: aft(S, 14;) ~ aft(W, S), because 14; may be similar to one of the words in S, which, however, is not one of the topic words of S; it is not an important word in S. In this case, aft(W, S) is high, because 14; is similar to a word in S, but aft(S, 14;) is low, because S is not a representative example of the usage of the word 14;. 2.2.2 The Similarity Formulae. We define the similarity of 14;1 to 14;2 to be the average affinity of sentences that include 14;1 to 14;2. The similarity of a sentence $1 to another sentence 82 is a weighted average of the affinity of the words in $1 to $2:","simn+l(Sb $2) = ~ weight(W, $1). affn(W, $2) (3) WE$1","simn+l(14;1, 14;2) = ~ weight(S, 14;1). affn(S, 14;2) (4) $3W1 where the weights sum to 1. 4 These values are used to update the corresponding entries of the word and sentence similarity matrices, WSM and SSM. 2.2.3 The Importance of Iteration. Initially, only identical words are considered similar, so that aft(W, S) = 1 if 14; E S; the affinity is zero otherwise. Thus, in the first iteration, the similarity between 81 and $2 depends on the number of words from $1 that appear in $2, divided by the length of $2 (note that each word may carry different weight). In the subsequent iterations, each word 14; c $1 contributes to the similarity of 81 to $2 a value between 0 and 1, indicating its affinity to $2, instead of voting either 0 (if 14; E $2) or 1 (if 14; ~ 82). Analogously, sentences contribute values to word similarity.","One may view the iterations as successively capturing parameterized \"genealogical\" relationships. Let words that share contexts be called direct relatives; then words that share neighbors (have similar co-occurrence patterns) are once-removed relatives. These two family relationships are captured by the first iteration, and also by most traditional similarity measures, which are based on co-occurrences. The second iteration then brings together twice-removed relatives. The third iteration captures higher similarity relationships, and so on. Note that the level of relationship here is a gradually consolidated real-valued quantity, and is dictated by the amount and the quality of the evidence gleaned from the corpus; it is not an all-or-none \"relatedness\" tag, as in genealogy.","The following simple example demonstrates the difference between our similarity measure and pure co-occurrence-based similarity measures, which cannot capture 4 The weight of a word estimates its expected contribution to the disambiguation task and is a product of several factors: the frequency of the word in the corpus; its frequency in the training set relative to that in the entire corpus; the textual distance from the target word; and its part of speech (more details on word weights appear in Section A.3 of the appendix). All the sentences that include a given word are assigned identical weights, 45 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 higher-order relationships. Consider the set of three sentence fragments: sl eat banana s2 taste banana s3 eat apple In this \"corpus,\" the contextual similarity of taste and apple, according to the co-occurrence-based methods, is 0, because the contexts of these two words are disjoint. In comparison, our iterative algorithm will capture some contextual similarity: • Initialization. Every word is similar to itself only.","• First iteration. The sentences eat banana and eat apple have contextual similarity of 0.5, because of the common word eat. Furthermore, the sentences eat banana and taste banana have contextual similarity 0.5:","-- banana is learned to be similar to apple because of their common usage (eat banana and eat apple);","-- taste is similar to eat because of their common usage (taste banana and eat banana);","-- taste and apple are not similar (yet).","• Second iteration. The sentence taste banana has now some similarity to eat apple, because in the previous iteration taste was similar to eat and banana was similar to apple. The word taste is now similar to apple because the taste sentence (taste banana) is similar to the apple sentence (eat apple). Yet, banana is more similar to apple than taste, because the similarity value of banana and apple further increases in the second iteration.","This simple example demonstrates the transitivity of our similarity measure, which allows it to extract high-order contextual relationships. In more complex situations, the transitivity-dependent spread of similarity is slower, because each word is represented by many more sentences.","The most important properties of the similarity computation algorithm are convergence (see Section A.2 in the appendix), and utility in supporting disambiguation (described in Section 3); three other properties are as follows. First, word similarity computed according to the above algorithm is asymmetric. For example, drug is more similar to traffic than traffic is to drug, because traffic is mentioned more frequently in drug contexts than drug is mentioned in contexts of traffic (which has many other usages). Likewise, sentence similarity is asymmetric: if 81 is fully contained in $2, then sire(S1, $2) = 1, whereas sim($2, $1) < 1. Second, words with a small count in the training set will have unreliable similarity values. These, however, are multiplied by a very low weight when used in sentence similarity evaluation, because the frequency in the training set is taken into account in computing the word weights. Third, in the computation of sim(W1, W2) for a very frequent W2, the set of its sentences is very large, potentially inflating the affinity of W1 to the sentences that contain W2. We counter this tendency by multiplying sire(W1, W2) by a weight that is reciprocally related to the global frequency of W2 (this weight has been left out of Equation 4, to keep the notation there simple). 46 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation 2.3 Using Similarity to Tag the Training Set Following convergence, each sentence in the training set is assigned the sense of its most similar sentence in one of the feedback sets of sense"]},{"title":"si,","paragraphs":["using the final sentence similarity matrix. Note that some sentences in the training set belong also to one of the feedback sets, because they contain words from the MRD definition of the target word. Those sentences are automatically assigned the sense of the feedback set to which they belong, since they are most similar to themselves. Note also that an original training-set sentence S can be attracted to a sentence .T from a feedback set, even if S and .T do not share any word, because of the transitivity of the similarity measure. 2.4 Learning the typical uses of each sense We partition the examples of each sense into typical use sets, by grouping all the sentences that were attracted to the same feedback-set sentence. That sentence, and all the original sentences attracted to it, form a class of examples for a typical usage. Feedback-set examples that did not attract any original sentences are discarded. If the number of resulting classes is too high, further clustering can be carried out on the basis of the distance metric defined by 1 - sim(x, y), where sire(x, y) are values taken from the final sentence similarity matrix.","A typical usage of a sense is represented by the affinity information generalized from its examples. For each word 14;, and each cluster C of examples of the same usage, we define:","aff(W, C) = max aff(W, S) (5) SEC","= max max sim(W, Wi) (6) SEC WiCS For each cluster we construct its affinity vector, whose ith component indicates the affinity of word i to the cluster. It suffices to generalize the affinity information (rather than similarity), because new examples are judged on the basis of their similarity to each cluster: in the computation of sire(S1, $2) (Equation 3), the only information concerning $2 is its affinity values. 2.5 Testing New Examples Given a new sentence S containing a target word W, we determine its sense by computing the similarity of S to each of the previously obtained clusters"]},{"title":"Ck,","paragraphs":["and returning the sense si of the most similar cluster:"]},{"title":"sim(Snew, Ck)","paragraphs":["= ~ weight(W,"]},{"title":"Snew)\"","paragraphs":["aff(W,"]},{"title":"Ck)","paragraphs":["(7) W E S.ew sim(Snew, si) ="]},{"title":"max sim(Snew, C)","paragraphs":["(8) Ccsi 3.

Thus, a data set for testing a disambiguation algorithm can be obtained by starting with two collections of sentences, one containing a word X, and the other a word y, and inserting y instead of every appearance of ,-Y in the first collection. The algorithm is then tested on the union of the two collections, in which X is now a \"polysemous\" word. The performance of the algorithm is judged by its ability to separate the sentences that originally contained ,~' from those that originally contained 32; any mistakes can be used to supervise the tuning of the algorithm. 5 3.1 Test data The final algorithm was tested on a total of 500 examples of four polysemous words:"]},{"title":"drug, sentence, suit,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"player","paragraphs":["(see Table 2; although we confined the tests to nouns, the algorithm is applicable to any part of speech).

The asterisk marks the plot for the 'narcotic' sense. 4.1 Flexible Sense Distinctions The possibility of strict definition of each sense of a polysemous word, and the possibility of unambiguous assignment of a given sense in a given situation are, in themselves, nontrivial issues in philosophy (Quine 1960) and linguistics (Weinreich 1980; Cruse 1986). Different dictionaries often disagree on the definitions; the split into senses may also depend on the task at hand. Thus, it is important to maintain the possibility of flexible distinction of the different senses, e.g., by letting this distinction be determined by an external knowledge source such as a thesaurus or a dictionary. Although this requirement may seem trivial, most corpus-based methods do not, in fact, allow such flexibility. For example, defining the senses by the possible translations of the word (Dagan, Itai and Schwall 1991; Brown et al. 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992), by the Roget's categories (Yarowsky 1992), or by clustering (Schi~tze 1992), yields a grouping that does not always conform to the desired sense distinctions.","In comparison to these approaches, our reliance on the MRD for the definition of senses in the initialization of the learning process guarantees the required flexibility in setting the sense distinctions. Specifically, the user of our system may choose a certain dictionary definition, a combination of definitions from several dictionaries, or manually listed seed words for every sense that needs to be defined. Whereas pure MRD-based methods allow the same flexibility, their potential so far has not been fully tapped, because definitions alone do not contain enough information for disambiguation. 4.2 Sentence Features Different polysemous words may benefit from different types of features of the context sentences. Polysemous words for which distinct senses tend to appear in different topics can be disambiguated using single words as the context features, as we did here. Disambiguation of other polysemous words may require taking the sentence structure into account, using n-grams or syntactic constructs as features. This additional information can be incorporated into our method, by (1) extracting features such as nouns, !52 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation verbs, adjectives of the target word, bigrams, trigrams, and subject-verb or verb-object pairs, (2) discarding features with a low weight (cf. Section A.3 of the appendix), and (3) using the remaining features instead of single words (i.e., by representing a sentence by the set of significant features it contains, and a feature by the set of sentences in which it appears). 4.3 Using WordNet The initialization of the word similarity matrix using WordNet, a hand-crafted semantic network arranged in a hierarchical structure (Miller et al. 1993), may seem to be advantageous over simply setting it to the identity matrix, as we have done. To compare these two approaches, we tried to set the initial (dis)similarity between two words to the WordNet path length between their nodes (Lee, Kim, and Lee 1993), and then learn the similarity values iteratively. This, however, led to worse performance than the simple identity-matrix initialization.","There are several possible reasons for the poor performance of WordNet in this comparison. First, WordNet is not designed to capture contextual similarity. For example, in WordNet,"]},{"title":"hospital","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"doctor","paragraphs":["have no common ancestor, and hence their similarity is 0, while"]},{"title":"doctor","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"lawyer","paragraphs":["are quite similar, because both designate professionals, humans, and living things. Note that, contextually,"]},{"title":"doctor","paragraphs":["should be more similar to"]},{"title":"hospital","paragraphs":["than to"]},{"title":"lawyer.","paragraphs":["Second, we found that the WordNet similarity values dominated the contextual similarity computed in the iterative process, preventing the transitive effects of contextual similarity from taking over. Third, the tree distance in itself does not always correspond to the intuitive notion of similarity, because different concepts appear at different levels of abstraction and have a different number of nested subconcepts. For example, a certain distance between two nodes may result from (1) the nodes being semantically close, but separated by a large distance, stemming from a high level of detail in the related synsets, or from (2) the nodes being semantically far from each other. 6 4.4 Ignoring Irrelevant Examples The feedback sets we use in training the system may contain noise, in the form of irrelevant examples that are collected along with the relevant and useful ones.

Brown et al. (1991) and Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) used the translations of ambiguous words in a bilingual corpus as sense tags. This does not obviate the need for manual work, as producing bilingual corpora requires manual translation work. Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) used a bilingual lexicon and a monolingual corpus to save the need for translating the corpus. 6 Resnik (1995) recently suggested that this particular difficulty can be overcome by a different measure that takes into account the informativeness of the most specific common ancestor of the two words. 53 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 The problem remains, however, that the word translations do not necessarily overlap with the desired sense distinctions.","Sch/.itze (1992) clustered the examples in the training set and manually assigned each cluster a sense by observing 10-20 members of the cluster. Each sense was usually represented by several clusters. Although this approach significantly decreased the need for manual intervention, about a hundred examples had still to be tagged manually for each word. Moreover, the resulting clusters did not necessarily correspond to the desired sense distinctions.","Yarowsky (1992) learned discriminators for each"]},{"title":"Roget's","paragraphs":["category, saving the need to separate the training set into senses. However, using such hand-crafted categories usually leads to a coverage problem for specific domains or for domains other than the one for which the list of categories has been prepared.","Using MRD's (Amsler 1984) for word sense disambiguation was popularized by Lesk (1986); several researchers subsequently continued and improved this line of work (Krovetz and Croft 1989; Guthrie et al. 1991; V~ronis and Ide 1990). Unlike the information in a corpus, the information in the MRD definitions is presorted into senses. However, as noted above, the MRD definitions alone do not contain enough information to allow reliable disambiguation. Recently, Yarowsky (1995) combined an MRD and a corpus in a bootstrapping process. In that work, the definition words were used as initial sense indicators, automatically tagging the target word examples containing them. These tagged examples were then used as seed examples in the bootstrapping process. In comparison, we suggest to further combine the corpus and the MRD by using"]},{"title":"all","paragraphs":["the corpus examples of the MRD definition words, instead of those words alone. This yields much more sense-presorted training information. 4.5.2 The Problem of Sparse Data. Most previous works define word similarity based on co-occurrence information, and hence face a severe problem of sparse data. Many of the possible co-occurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer 1993). Our algorithm addresses this problem in two ways. First, we replace the all-or-none indicator of co-occurrence by a graded measure of contextual similarity. Our measure of similarity is transitive, allowing two words to be considered similar even if they neither appear in the same sentence, nor share neighbor words. Second, we extend the training set by adding examples of related words. The performance of our system compares favorably to that of systems trained on sets larger by a factor of 100 (the results described in Section 3 were obtained following learning from several dozen examples, in comparison to thousands of examples in other automatic methods).","Traditionally, the problem of sparse data is approached by estimating the probability of unobserved co-occurrences using the actual co-occurrences in the training set. This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies 7 (Church and Mercer 1993) or by class-based methods (Brown et al. 1991; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hirschman 1986; Resnik 1992; Brill et al. 1990; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993). In comparison to these approaches, we use similarity information throughout training, and not merely for estimating co-occurrence statistics. This allows the system to learn successfully from very sparse data. 7 Smoothing is a technique widely used in applications, such as statistical pattern recognition and probabilistic language modeling, that require a probability density to be estimated from data. For sparse data, this estimation problem is severely underconstrained, and, thus, ill-posed; smoothing regularizes the problem by adopting a prior constraint that assumes that the probability density does not change too fast in between the examples. 54 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation 4.6 Summary We have described an approach to WSD that combines a corpus and an MRD to generate an extensive data set for learning similarity-based disambiguation. Our system combines the advantages of corpus-based approaches (large number of examples) with those of the MRD-based approaches (data presorted by senses), by using the MRD definitions to direct the extraction of training information (in the form of feedback sets) from the corpus.","In our system, a word is represented by the set of sentences in which it appears. Accordingly, words are considered similar if they appear in similar sentences, and sentences are considered similar if they contain similar words. Applying this definition iteratively yields a transitive measure of similarity under which two sentences may be considered similar even if they do not share any word, and two words may be considered similar even if they do not share neighbor words. Our experiments show that the resulting alternative to raw co-occurrence-based similarity leads to better performance on very sparse data. Appendix A.1 Stopping Conditions of the Iterative Algorithm Let fi be the increase in the similarity value in iteration i: f~(X,y) = simi(X, y)- simi_l(X, 32) (9) where X, y can be either words or sentences. For each item X, the algorithm stops updating its similarity values to other items (that is, updating its row in the similarity matrix) in the first iteration that satisfies maxyfi(X, 3;) _< ¢, where c > 0 is a preset threshold.","According to this stopping condition, the algorithm terminates after at most iterations (otherwise, in !, iterations with eachfi > c, we obtain sim(,V, 3;) > ¢- ~ = 1, in contradiction to upper bound of 1 on the similarity values; see Section A.2 below).","We found that the best results are obtained within three iterations. After that, the disambiguation results tend not to change significantly, although the similarity values may continue to increase. Intuitively, the transitive exploration of similarities is exhausted after three iterations. A.2 Proofs In the following, X, 3; can be either words or sentences. Theorem 1 Similarity is bounded: simn (X, 3;) _< 1 Proof By induction on the number of iteration. At the first iteration, sim0(X, 3;) _< 1, by initialization. Assume that the claim holds for n, and prove for n + 1:","simn+l (X, Y) = E weight(K, X)maxsimn(Xj, Yk) YkEY ~CX < ~ weight(,~, X) • 1 (by the induction hypothesis) -- 1 55 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 Theorem 2 Similarity is reflexive: VX, sim(X, X) = 1 Proof By induction on the number of iteration, sim0(X, X) = 1, by initialization.

By theorem 1, simn+l(X, X) _< 1, so simn+l(X, X) = 1. Theorem 3 Similarity sim, (X, 3;) is a nondecreasing function of the number of iteration n. Proof By induction on the number of iteration. Consider the case of n = 1: siml(X, Y) > sim0(X, 3;) (if sim0(X, y) = 1, then X = 3;, and siml(X, 3;) = 1 as well; else sim0(X, 3;) = 0 and siml(X, 3;) >_ 0 ~- sim0(X, 3;)). Now, assume that the claim holds for n, and prove for n + 1: simn+l (X, Y) - siren(X, Y)=","= ~ weight(K, X). maxsim,(Xj, Yk) YkEY X/~X","- E weight(Xj, A'). maxsim,_l(Xj, Yt) NkEY x/ex","> ~ weight(Xj, X).

As a consequence, we may conclude that the iterative estimation of similarity converges. 56 Karov and Edelman Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation A.3 Word weights In our algorithm, the weight of a word estimates its expected contribution to the disambiguation task, and the extent to which the word is indicative in sentence similarity. The weights do not change with iterations. They are used to reduce the number of features to a manageable size, and to exclude words that are expected to be given unreliable similarity values.

The contribution of this factor is reciprocally related to the normalized distance: the weight of context words that appear in the same sentence as the target word is taken to be 1.0; the weight of words that appear in the adjacent sentences is 0.5. The total weight of a word is the product of the above factors, each normalized by","factor(Wi, S)","the sum of factors of the words in the sentence: weight(Wi, $) = z_,~'wjcs factor(W j, S)' 8 Because this estimate is unreliable for words with low frequencies in each sense set, Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) suggested to interpolate between probabilities computed within the subcorpus and probabilities computed over the entire corpus. In our case, the denominator is the frequency in the general corpus instead of the frequency in the sense examples, so it is more reliable. 57 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 where factor(., .) is the weight before normalization. The use of weights contributed about 5% to the disambiguation performance. A.4 Other uses of context similarity The similarity measure developed in the present paper can be used for tasks other than word sense disambiguation. Here, we illustrate a possible application to automatic construction of a thesaurus.","Following the training phase for a word X, we have a word similarity matrix for the words in the contexts of :Y. Using this matrix, we construct for each sense si of ,-Y a set of related words, R: ° 2. . Initialize R to the set of words appearing in the MRD definition of si; Extend R recursively: for each word in R added in the previous step, add its k nearest neighbors, using the similarity matrix. Stop when no new words (or too few new words) are added. Upon termination, output for each sense si the set of its contextually similar words R.
