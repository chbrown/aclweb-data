Some figure of merit is needed by which to compare the likelihood of constituents, and the choice of this figure has a substantial impact on the efficiency of the parser. While several parsers described in the literature have used such techniques, there is little published data on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their relative merits. We propose and evaluate several figures of merit for best-first parsing, and we identify an easily computable figure of merit that provides excellent performance on various measures and two different grammars. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Chart parsing is a commonly used algorithm for parsing natural language texts. The chart is a data structure that contains all of the constituents for which subtrees have been found, that is, constituents for which a derivation has been found and which may therefore appear in some complete parse of the sentence. The agenda is a structure that stores a list of constituents for which a derivation has been found but which have not yet been combined with other constituents. Initially, the agenda contains the terminal symbols from the sentence to be parsed. A constituent is removed from the agenda and added to the chart, and the system considers how this constituent can be used to extend its current structural hypothesis by combining with other constituents in the chart according to the grammar rules. (We will often refer to these expansions of rules as \"edges\".) In general this can lead to the creation of new, more encompassing constituents, which themselves are then added to the agenda. When one constituent has been processed, a new one is chosen to be removed from the agenda, and so on. Traditionally, the agenda is represented as a stack, so that the last item added to the agenda is the next one removed. Chart parsing is described extensively in the literature; for one such discussion see 'Section 1.4 of Charniak (1993).","Best-first probabilistic chart parsing is a variation of chart parsing that attempts to find the most likely parses first, by adding constituents to the chart in order of the likelihood that they will appear in a correct parse, rather than simply popping constituents off of a stack. Some probabilistic figure of merit is assigned to the constituents on the agenda, and the constituent maximizing this value is the next to be added to the chart.","In this paper we consider probabilities primarily based on probabilistic context-free grammars, though in principle, other, more complicated schemes could be used.","The purpose of this work is to compare how well several figures of merit select * Computer Science Department, Box 1910, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.

In this paper, we examine the performance of several proposed figures of merit that approximate it in one way or another, using two different grammars. We identify a figure of merit that gives superior results on all of our performance measures and on both grammars.","Section 2 of this paper describes the method we used to determine the effectiveness of figures of merit, that is, to compare how well they choose constituents to be moved from the agenda to the chart. Section 2.1 explains the experiment, Section 2.2 describes the measures we used to compare the performance of the figures of merit, and Section 2.3 describes a model we used to represent the performance of a traditional parser using a simple stack as an agenda.","In Section 3, we describe and compare three simple and easily computable figures of merit based on inside probability. Sections 3.1 through 3.3 describe each figure in detail, and Section 3.4 presents the results of an experiment comparing these three figures. Sections 4 and 5 have a similar structure to Section 3, with Section 4 evaluating two figures of merit using statistics on the left-side context of the constituent, and 276 Caraballo and Charniak Figures of Merit Section 5 evaluating three additional figures of merit using statistics on the context on both sides of the constituent. Section 6 contains a table summarizing the results from Sections 3, 4, and 5.","In Section 7, we use another grammar in the experiment, to verify that our results are not an artifact of the grammar used for parsing. Section 8 describes previous work in this area, and Section 9 presents our conclusions and recommendations.","There are also three appendices to this paper. Appendix A gives our method for computing inside probability estimates while maintaining parser speed. Appendix B explains how we obtained our boundary statistics used in Section 5. Appendix C presents data comparing the parsing accuracy obtained by each of our parsers as the number of edges they create increases. 2. Comparing Figures of Merit 2.1 The Experiment We used as our first grammar a probabilistic context-free grammar learned from the Brown corpus (see Francis and Ku~era [1982] for a description of the Brown Corpus, and Carroll and Charniak [1992a, 1992b], and Charniak and Carroll [1994] for grammar and training details). This grammar contains about 5,000 rules using 32 terminal and nonterminal symbols. We parsed 500 sentences of length 3 to 30 (including punctuation) from the Penn Treebank"]},{"title":"Wall Street Journal","paragraphs":["corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) using a best-first parsing method and various estimates for"]},{"title":"P(N~i,k I","paragraphs":["t0,,~) as the figure of merit.","For each figure of merit, we compared the performance of best-first parsing using that figure of merit to exhaustive parsing. By exhaustive parsing, we mean continuing to parse until there are no more constituents available to be added to the chart. We parse exhaustively to determine the total probability of a sentence, that is, the sum of the probabilities of all parses found for that sentence.","We then computed several quantities for best-first parsing with each figure of merit at the point where the best-first parsing method has found parses contributing at least 95% of the probability mass of the sentence. The 95% figure is simply a convenience; see Appendix C for a discussion of speed versus accuracy. 2.2 Measures Used We compared the figures of merit using the following measures: . . . %E: The percentage of edges, or rule expansions, in the exhaustive parse that have been used by the best-first parse to get 95% of the probability mass. Edge creation is a good measure of CFG parser effort, since it is independent of platform and implementation. %non-0 E: The percentage of nonzero-length edges used by the best-first parse to get 95%. Zero-length edges are required by our parser as a bookkeeping measure, and, as such, virtually cannot be eliminated. We anticipated that removing them from consideration would highlight the \"true\" differences in the figures of merit. %popped: The percentage of constituents in the exhaustive parse that were used by the best-first parse to get 95% of the probability mass. This measure was included to confirm that a figure of merit that is efficient in terms of edge creation is also efficient in terms of constituent creation. 277 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 t o ... t n-I ... t j_ Figure 2 fl includes only words within the constituent.",". CPU time: The total CPU time (in seconds) needed to get 95% of the probability mass for all of the 500 sentences.","The statistics converged to their final values quickly. The edge-count percentages were generally within .01 of their final values after processing only 200 sentences, so the results were quite stable by the end of our 500-sentence test corpus.","We gathered statistics for each sentence length from 3 to 30. Sentence length was limited to a maximum of 30 because of the huge number of edges that are generated in doing a full parse of long sentences; using this grammar, sentences in this length range have produced up to 130,000 edges. 2.3 The \"Stack\" Model As a basis for comparison, we measured the CPU time for a non-best-first version of the parser to completely parse all 500 sentences. The CPU time needed by this version of the parser was 4,882 seconds. For a best-first version of the parser to be useful, it must be able to find the most probable parse (or a reasonably good parse, depending on the application) in less than this amount of time. Here, for the best-first parsers, we will use for convenience the time needed to get 95% of the sentence's total probability mass. 3. Simple Figures of Merit 3.1 Straight fl It seems reasonable to base a figure of merit on the inside probability fl of the constituent. Inside probability is defined as the probability of the words or tags in the constituent given that the constituent is dominated by a particular nonterminal symbol; see Figure 2. This seems to be a reasonable basis for comparing constituent probabilities, and has the additional advantage that it is easy to compute during chart parsing. Appendix A gives details of our on-line computation of ft.","The inside probability of the constituent N~, k is defined as: --= p(tj,k"]},{"title":"IN')","paragraphs":["where N i represents the ith nonterminal symbol. 278 Caraballo and Charniak Figures of Merit i"]},{"title":"Nj, k ~0~i\" ' 9tJ \"\" tk_ tk~~n_ 1 Figure 3","paragraphs":["c~ includes the entire context of the constituent.

This graph shows that the contextual information gained from using OL L in the prefix estimate is almost completely included in just the previous tag, as illustrated by the left boundary trigram estimate. Adding right contextual information in the boundary trigram estimate gives us the best performance on this measure of any of our figures of merit.","We can consider the left boundary trigram estimate to be an approximation of the prefix estimate, where the effect of the left context is approximated by the effect of the single tag to the left. Similarly, the boundary trigram estimate is an approximation to an estimate involving the full context, i.e., an estimate involving the outside probability c~. However, the parser cannot compute the outside probability of a constituent during a parse, and so in order to use context on both sides of the constituent, we need to use something like our boundary statistics.

The boundary statistics were counted directly from the training data as well. The treebank grammar is much larger and more ambiguous than our original grammar, containing about 16,000 rules and 78 terminal and nonterminal symbols, and it was impractical to parse sentences to exhaustion using our existing hardware, so the figures based on 95% of the probability mass could not be computed. We were able to use this grammar to compare the number of edges needed to find the first parse using the trigram and boundary trigram estimates. 291 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 1.0-0.8. 0.6, 0.40.2-","oS","oJ",",J","I","/","/ i I i i i I I I i I i","I","i","I","i","i II S","i .t s s s s~ s s s s s J i s s s S s I i","0.0","I","....

Previous Work In an earlier version of this paper (Caraballo and Charniak 1996), we presented the results for several of these models using our original grammar. The treebank grammar was introduced in Charniak (1996), and the parser in. that paper is a best-first parser using the boundary trigram figure of merit. The literature shows many implementations of best-first parsing, but none of the previous work shares our goal of explicitly comparing figures of merit. Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced statistical agenda-based parsing techniques. Chitrao and Grishman implemented a best-first probabilistic parser and noted the parser's tendency to prefer shorter constituents. They proposed a heuristic solution of penalizing shorter constituents by a fixed amount per word. Miller and Fox (1994) compare the performance of parsers using three different types of grammars, and show that a probabilistic context-free grammar using inside probability (unnormalized) as a figure of merit outperforms both a context-free grammar and a context-dependent grammar. Kochman and Kupin (1991) propose a figure of merit closely related to our prefix estimate. They do not actually incorporate this figure into a best-first parser. 292","paragraphs":["Caraballo and Charniak Figures of Merit","Magerman and Marcus (1991) use the geometric mean to compute a figure of merit that is independent of constituent length. Magerman and Weir (1992) use a similar model with a different parsing algorithm. 9. Conclusions We have presented and evaluated several figures of merit for best-first parsing. The best performer according to all of our measures was the parser using the boundary trigram estimate as a figure of merit, and this result holds for two different grammars. This figure has the additional advantage that it can be easily incorporated into existing best-first parsers using a figure of merit based on inside probability. (As mentioned earlier, the efficient online computation of fl is described in Appendix A.) We strongly recommend this figure of merit as the basis for best-first statistical parsers.","The measurements presented here almost certainly underestimate the true benefits of this model. We restricted sentence length to a maximum of 30 words, in order to keep the number of edges in the exhaustive parse to a practical size; however, since the percentage of edges needed by the best-first parse decreases with increasing sentence length, we assume that the improvement would be even more dramatic for sentences longer than 30 words. Appendix A: Efficient On-Line Computation of fl We compute estimates of the inside probability fl for each proposed constituent in-crementally as new constituents are added to the chart. Initially, fl is set to 1 for each terminal symbol, since our input is given as a stream of tags, which are our terminals. When a new proposed constituent is added to the agenda, its fl estimate is set to its current inside probability according to the constituents already in the chart. However, as more constituents are added to the chart, we may find a new way to build up a proposed constituent, i.e., additional evidence for that proposed constituent, so we need to update the fl for the proposed constituent (and also for affected constituents already in the chart, since these may in turn affect other proposed constituents).","These updates can be quite expensive in terms of CPU time. However, many of the updates are quite small, and do not affect the relative ordering of the proposed constituents on the agenda. Instead of propagating every change to fl, then, we only want to propagate those changes that we expect to have an effect on this ordering. What we have done is to have each constituent store not only its fl value, but also an increment. Increases to the inside probability are added not to fl itself, but to this increment, until the increment exceeds some threshold. Experimentally we have found that we can avoid propagating increments until they exceed 1% of the current value of fl with very little effect on the parser's selection of constituents from the agenda.","This thresholding on the propagation of fl allows us to update the fl values on line while still keeping the performance of the parser as O(n 3) empirically.

We computed unlabeled precision and recall only, since our grammar uses a different set of nonterminals from those used in the test data.","Precision is defined as the percentage of the constituents proposed by our parser that are actually correct according to the treebank. For each edge count, we measured the precision of the best parse of each sentence found within that number of edges. Figure 15 is a graph of the average precision for the fl figures of merit from Section 3, plotted against edge counts.","The fluctuations at the low edge counts are due to the small amount of data at this level. At a low edge count, very few sentences have actually been parsed, and since these sentences tend to be short and simple, the parses are likely to be correct. The sentences that could not be parsed do not contribute to the measurement of precision. As more sentences are parsed, precision settles at about 47%, the highest precision attainable by our particular test grammar, and remains there as edge counts increase. 294 Caraballo and Charniak Figures of Merit :[ ¢ d: 0.6-0.5-","0.4 I .........","I",".........","I0000 20000 30~)00","# Edges","\"stack\" ...... straight beta ..... normalized beta .... trigrzxn estimate Figure 15 Precision of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the fl estimates. 0.6","-- 0.4"]},{"title":"]","paragraphs":["0.2 0.0 ii /I / / ,, / / i"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["t i •","..-°"]},{"title":"i,","paragraphs":["I"]},{"title":"/,","paragraphs":["t I"]},{"title":"i,","paragraphs":["I !, !'","t","i","I","i","l","2000 4000 6000 8000 # Edges","\"stuck\" ...... straight beta ..... normalized beta .... tngram estimate Figure 16 Recall of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the fl estimates. 295 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 0.6. _-- 0.4. 0.20.0 / I / i , ; t"]},{"title":"!, , !","paragraphs":["/"]},{"title":"/, .f,,f--: .................","paragraphs":["..... normalized beta ...... normalizedalphaL be~ .... ~igramestlmate --q--prefix estimate Figure 17 Recall of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the C~Lfl estimates. 0.0- -- 0.40.20.0 II i i"]},{"title":"!/ t !i , 'i/: !l ,","paragraphs":["!! / !ii,"]},{"title":"Y S!!'; \"-'\"","paragraphs":["# Edges .... tri~ara ~tlmate ------ prefix estimate ...... left boundary trigram ..... botmdary ~igram ..... boundary stats only Figure 18 Recall of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the boundary estimates. 296 CarabaUo and Charniak Figures of Merit This level of precision is independent of the figure of merit used, so measurement of precision does not help evaluate our figures of merit.","A much more useful measure is recall.
