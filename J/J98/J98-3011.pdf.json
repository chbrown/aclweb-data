Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed: others are likely to be added.
