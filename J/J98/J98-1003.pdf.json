Chang* National Tsing Hua University This paper describes a heuristic approach capable of automatically clustering senses in a machine-readable dictionary (MRD). Including these clusters in the MRD-based lexical database offers several positive benefits for word sense disambiguation (WSD). First, the clusters can be used as a coarser sense division, so unnecessarily fine sense distinction can be avoided. The clustered entries in the MRD can also be used as materials for supervised training to develop a WSD system. Furthermore, if the algorithm is run on several MRDs, the clusters also provide a means of linking different senses across multiple MRDs to create an integrated lexical database. An implementation of the method for clustering definition sentences in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) is described. To this end, the topical word lists and topical cross-references in the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) are used. Nearly half of the senses in the LDOCE can be linked precisely to a relevant LLOCE topic using a simple heuristic. With the definitions of senses linked to the same topic viewed as a document, topical clustering of the MRD senses bears a striking resemblance to retrieval of relevant documents for a given query in information retrieval (IR) research. Relatively well-established IR techniques of weighting terms and ranking document relevancy are applied to find the topical clusters that are most relevant to the definition of each MRD sense. Finally, we describe an implemented version of the algorithms for the LDOCE and the LLOCE and assess the performance of the proposed approach in a series of experiments and evaluations. 1. Introduction Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been found useful in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including information retrieval (Krovetz and Croft 1992; McRoy 1992), machine translation (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994), and speech synthesis (Yarowsky 1992). WSD has received increasing attention in recent literature on computational linguistics (Lesk 1986; Schi.itze 1992; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1992, 1995; Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Chang et al. 1996). Given a polysemous word in running text, the task of WSD involves examining contextual information to determine the intended sense from a set of predetermined candidates. It is a nontrivial task to divide the senses of a word and determine this set, for word sense is an abstract concept frequently based on subjective and subtle distinctions in topic, register, dialect, collocation, part of speech, and valency (McRoy 1992). Various approaches to word sense division have been proposed in the literature on WSD, including (1) sense numbers in every-day dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie 1992), (2) automatic or hand-crafted clusters of dictionary senses (Dolan 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk * Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan, ROC. E-mail: dr818314@cs.nthu.edu.tw; jschang@cs.nthu.edu.tw. (~ 1998 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 1995), (3) thesaurus categories (Yarowsky 1992; Chen and Chang 1994), (4) translation in another language (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994), (5) automatically induced clusters with sublexical representation (Schiitze 1992), and (6) hand-crafted lexicons (McRoy 1992).","This paper is motivated by the observation that directly using dictionary senses for sense division offers several advantages.

A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses, useful for WSD. Furthermore, indicative words and concepts for each sense are directly available in numbered definitions and examples. Lesk (1986) describes the first MRD-based WSD method that relies on the extent of overlap between words in a dictionary definition and words in the local context of the word to be disambiguated. The author reports that WSD performance ranges from 50% to 70% and his method works well for senses strongly associated with specific collocations, such as"]},{"title":"ice-cream cone","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"pine cone.","paragraphs":["Unfortunately, using MRDs as the knowledge source for sense division and disambiguation leads to some problems. Zernik (1992) notes that the dictionary dichotomy of senses is inadequate for WSD, because it is defined along grammatical, not semantic, lines. Furthermore, as pointed out in Dolan (1994), the sense division in an MRD is frequently too fine-grained for the purpose of WSD. A WSD system based on dictionary senses often faces unnecessary and difficult \"forced-choices.\" Dolan proposes a heuristic algorithm for forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in the LDOCE to eliminate distinctions that are unnecessarily fine for WSD. Regrettably, the proposed algorithm was only described in a few examples and was not developed further. Lacking an automatic method, recent WSD works (Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk 1995; Yarowsky 1995) still resort to human intervention to identify and group closely related senses in an MRD.","Using thesaurus categories directly as a coarse sense division may seem to be a viable alternative (Yarowsky 1995).

Section 6 compares the proposed method with other approaches in the computational linguistics literature. Finally, conclusions are made and directions for further research are pointed out in Section 7. 2. Word Senses in Machine-Readable Dictionaries and Thesauri In this section, we look at two knowledge sources of word sense division, which are currently widely available, namely, the dictionary and the thesaurus. A good-sized dictionary usually has a large vocabulary and broad coverage of word senses, both of which are useful for WSD. However, a dictionary's division of senses for a given word is often too fine for the task of WSD. On the other hand, a thesaurus organizes word senses into a fixed set of coarse semantic categories, making it more appropriate for WSD. However, thesauri tend to have a smaller vocabulary and a narrower coverage of word senses. To get the best of both worlds of dictionary and thesaurus, we propose to cluster MRD definitions to yield a broad-coverage sense division with the granularity of a thesaurus. Therefore, a short description of MRDs and thesauri is in order. 2.1 Fine-Grained Senses in an MRD Interest in MRD-based research has increased over the years; in particular, the LDOCE and"]},{"title":"Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary","paragraphs":["(W7) (1967) have drawn much attention. Much of the MRD-based research has focused on the analysis and exploitation of the sense definitions in MRDs (Amsler 1984a, 1984b, 1987; Alshawi 1987; Alshawi, Boguraev, and Carter 1989; Vossen, Meijs, and denBroeder 1989). In these works, the definitions are analyzed using either a parser (Montemagni and Vanderwende 1992) or a pattern matcher (Ahlswede and Evens 1988) into semantic relations. These relations are then used for various tasks, ranging from the interpretation of a noun sequence (Vanderwende 1994) or a prepositional phrase (Ravin 1990), to resolving structural ambiguity (Jenson and Binot 1987), to merging dictionary senses for WSD (Dolan 1994). Besides the definition itself, there is an abundance of information listed in a dictionary entry, including part of speech, subcategory, examples, collocations, and typical arguments, which is potentially useful for WSD. In this regard, the LDOCE is particularly appropriate since it uses a reduced, controlled vocabulary of some 2,000 words to define over 60,000 word senses representing a comprehensive vocabulary and broad coverage of word senses.","It is arguable that the dictionary division of senses for a given word is too fine-grained, thus inadequate for WSD. For instance, it might not always be necessary or easy to distinguish between two LDOCE senses bank.l.n.1"]},{"title":"(river bank)","paragraphs":["and bank.l.n.5"]},{"title":"(sandbank)","paragraphs":["shown in Table 1.

As described in the introduction, Lesk (1986) shows that defining words are especially effective for disambiguating senses strongly associated 80 Chen and Chang Topical Clustering Table 14 Analysis of failure by error types.

Wilks et al. (1990) call the defining words in the LDOCE definition semantic primitives (SP) and suggest that a semantic network constructed on the strength of co-occurrence of SPs in definitions can be useful for a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from WSD, to machine translation, to message understanding. Along the same lines, Luk (1995) terms SP the definition-based concept (DBC) and proposes using DBC co-occurrence (DBCC) trained on a large corpus to disambiguate word senses. However, the effectiveness of SPs or DBCs to represent a word sense and its indicative context is hampered by ambiguity and data sparseness. For instance, earth, one of the SPs in bank.l.n.2 is ambiguous (either as the planet Earth or soil) thus possibly leading to problems in WSD. Although these SPs are drawn from a small, controlled vocabulary in most MRDs, nevertheless, it is difficult to find SPs of a polysemous sense overlapping the SPs of its context. For instance, consider the problem of disambiguating the word bank in the context of an LDOCE example, He sat down and rested on a mossy bank in the woods.","When working on the level of the SPs of an individual MRD sense, we are hard pressed to find a match between the SPs of the intended sense: SP(bank.l.n.2) = {earth, heap, field, garden, make, border, division} and the SPs of its context: SP(sit) SP(rest) SP(moss) SP(wood.l.n.1) SP(wood.l.n.2) = {rest, position, upper, body, upright, support, bottom, chair, seat}, = {take, rest}, = {small,flat, green, yellow,flowerless, plants, grow, thick,furry, wet,","soil, surface}, = {material, trunk, branch, tree, cut, dry,form, burn, paper,furniture}, = {place, tree, grow, small,forest}.","The clusters of MRD senses produced by TopSense give us an advantage in this respect.

The authors indicate that for the heuristics to yield optimum results, the degree of overlap in the examples should be weighted twice as heavily as all other factors. However, they do not elaborate on how the comparisons are done, or on how effective the program is.","Dolan (1994) describes a heuristic approach to forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in an MRD.

In this study, we have evaluated our method using all senses for 20 words that have been studied in WSD literature. This evaluation provides an overall picture of the expected success rate of the method when applied to all word senses in the MRD. Direct comparison of methods is often difficult, but it is clear that, as compared to other methods discussed above, our algorithm is very simple, requires minimal preprocessing, and does not rely on information idiosyncratic to the MRD, such as the LDOCE subject code or grammar code. Thus, the algorithm described in this paper can be readily applied to other MRDs besides LDOCE. Although our algorithm makes use of defining words in various semantic relations with the sense, those relations need not be explicitly computed through an elaborated parsing and extraction process.","Finally, it is interesting to compare our method with some aspects of the program for induction of sense division of Sch/.itze (1992). As mentioned in the introduction, the program uses distributional similarity of lexical co-occurrence to partition word instances into clusters that are likely to be related to sense division. Drawing on the work of latent semantic indexing in IR research, words and contexts are represented as vectors in a multidimensional space. Regression techniques of singular value decom-position are used to reduce the representation to a lower dimensional space.

Conclusions and Future Work This paper presents the issues of WSD using machine-readable dictionaries. It describes simple but effective algorithms for disambiguating and clustering dictionary senses to create a sense division for WSD. The proposed algorithms are effective for specific linguistic reasons. Although word sense is an abstract concept that relies on the subjective and subtle distinction of many factors, coarse word sense division can be attributed primarily to the subject and topic. This is evident from the observation that very topical genus and differentiae show up in dictionary definitions in rather rigid patterns. Therefore, an MRD coupled with a thesaurus organized according to subjects and topics is very effective for acquisition of sense division for WSD. 84 Chen and Chang Topical Clustering","In a broader context, this paper presents an approach to automatic construction of semantic lexicons through integration of lexicographic resources such as MRDs and thesauri.
