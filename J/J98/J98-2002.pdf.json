In order to assist with efficiency, the proposed method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention to those partitions that are present as \"cuts\" in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating a \"tree cut model\" of the thesaurus tree. An efficient algorithm is given, which provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data of a case slot, in the sense of MDL. Case frame patterns obtained by the method were used to resolve PP-attachment ambiguity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable with existing methods. 1. Introduction We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns, subcategorization patterns) from large corpora. A satisfactory solution to this problem would have a great impact on various tasks in natural language processing, including the structural disambiguation problem in parsing. The acquired knowledge would also be helpful for building a lexicon, as it would provide lexicographers with word usage descriptions.","In our view, the problem of acquiring case frame patterns involves the following two issues: (a) acquiring patterns of individual case frame slots; and (b) learning dependencies that may exist between different slots. In this paper, we confine ourselves to the former issue, and refer the interested reader to Li and Abe (1996), which deals with the latter issue.","The case frame (case slot) pattern acquisition process consists of two phases: extraction of case frame instances from corpus data, and generalization of those instances to case frame patterns. The generalization step is needed in order to represent the input case frame instances more compactly as well as to judge the (degree of) acceptability of unseen case frame instances. For the extraction problem, there have been various methods proposed to date, which are quite adequate (Hindle and Rooth 1991; Grishman and Sterling 1992; Manning 1992; Utsuro, Matsumoto, and Nagao 1992; Brent 1993; Smadja 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Briscoe and Carroll 1997). The generalization problem, in contrast, is a more challenging one and has not been solved completely. A number of methods for generalizing values of a case frame slot for a verb have been * C&C Media Res. Labs., NEC Corporation, 4-1-1 Miyazaki Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki 216, Japan. E-mail: { |ihang,abe }@ccm.cl.nec.co.jp @ 1998 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 proposed. Some of these methods make use of prior knowledge in the form of an existing thesaurus (Resnik 1993a, 1993b; Framis 1994; Almuallim et al. 1994; Tanaka 1996; Utsuro and Matsumoto 1997), while others do not rely on any prior knowledge (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Tanaka 1994). In this paper, we propose a new generalization method, belonging to the first of these two categories, which is both theoretically well-motivated and computationally efficient.","Specifically, we formalize the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot for a given verb as that of estimating a conditional probability distribution over a partition of words, and propose a new generalization method based on the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL): a principle of data compression and statistical estimation from information theory. 1 In order to assist with efficiency, our method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention on those partitions that are present as \"cuts\" in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating a \"tree cut model\" of the thesaurus tree. We then give an efficient algorithm that provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data of a case slot, in the sense of MDL. In order to test the effectiveness of our method, we conducted PP-attachment disambiguation experiments using the case frame patterns obtained by our method. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves upon or is at least comparable to existing methods.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we formalize the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot as that of estimating a conditional distribution. In Section 3, we describe our MDL-based generalization method. In Section 4, we present our experimental results. We then give some concluding remarks in Section 5. 2.

More specifically, conditional probabilities of words are smoothed by taking the weighted average of those of similar words using the similarity measure as the weights. The advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on any prior knowledge, but it appears difficult to find a smoothing method that is both efficient and theoretically sound.

It is also possible to extend our model so that each word probabilistically belongs to several different classes, which would allow us to resolve both structural and word-sense ambiguities at the time of disambiguation. 2 Employing probabilistic membership, however, would make the estimation process significantly more computationally demanding. We therefore leave this issue as a future topic, and employ a simple heuristic of equally distributing each word occurrence in the data to all of its potential word senses in our experiments. Since our learning method based on MDL is robust against noise, this should not significantly degrade performance. 2.3 The Tree Cut Model Since the number of partitions for a given set of nouns is extremely large, the problem of selecting the best model from among all possible class-based models is most likely intractable. In this paper, we reduce the number of possible partitions to consider by using a thesaurus as prior knowledge, following a basic idea of Resnik's (1992).","In particular, we restrict our attention to those partitions that exist within the thesaurus in the form of a cut. By thesaurus, we mean a tree in which each leaf node stands for a noun, while each internal node represents a noun class, and domination stands for set inclusion (see Figure 3). A cut in a tree is any set of nodes in the tree that defines a partition of the leaf nodes, viewing each node as representing the set of all leaf nodes it dominates. For example, in the thesaurus of Figure 3, there are five cuts: [ANIMAL], [BIRD, INSECT], [BIRD, bug, bee, insect], [swallow, crow, eagle, bird, INSECT], and [swallow, crow, eagle, bird, bug, bee, insect]. The class of tree cut models of a fixed thesaurus tree is then obtained by restricting the partition P in the definition of a class-based model to be those partitions that are present as a cut in that thesaurus tree.","Formally, a tree cut model M can be represented by a pair consisting of a tree cut lP and a probability parameter vector 0 of the same length, that is: V = (r, e) (5) where lP and 0 are: r = [C1, C2 .....

For any class in the tree cut, the probability is distributed uniformly to all nouns dominated by it. For example, since there are four nouns that fall under the class BIRD, and swallow is one of them, the probability of swallow is thus given by Pt~(swallow I flY, argl) = 0.8/4 = 0.2. Note that the probabilities assigned to the nouns under BIRD are smoothed, even if the nouns have different observed frequencies. We have thus formalized the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot as that of estimating a model from the class of tree cut models for some fixed thesaurus tree; namely, selecting a model that best explains the data from among the class of tree cut models. 3. Generalization Method Based On MDL The question now becomes what strategy (criterion) we should employ to select the best tree-cut model. We adopt the Minimum Description Length principle (Rissanen 1978,","paragraphs":["222 Li and Abe Generalizing Case Frames 0.45 0.4 0,35 0,3 0.25 0.2 O,lS 0.1 0,05 0 swallow crow eagle bi'rd Figure 6 A tree cut model with [BIRD, INSECT]. \"Prob.\" -- Table 2 Number of parameters and KL distance from the empirical distribution for the five tree cut models.

In contrast, a model nearer the leaves of the thesaurus tree, such as that in Figure 4, is more complex, but tends to have a better fit to the data. Table 2 shows the number of free parameters and the KL distance from the empirical distribution of the data (namely, the word-based distribution estimated by MLE) shown in Figure 2 for each of the five tree cut models. 5 In the table, one can see that there is a trade-off between the simplicity of a model and the goodness of fit to the data.","In the MDL framework, the model description length is an indicator of model 3 Estimation strategies related to MDL have been independently proposed and studied by various authors (Solomonoff 1964; Wallace and Boulton 1968; Schwarz 1978; Wallace and Freeman 1992). 4 We refer the interested reader to Quinlan and Rivest (1989) for an introduction to the MDL principle. 5 The KL distance (alsO known as KL-divergence or relative entropy), which is widely used in information theory and statistics, is a measure of distance between two distributions (e.g., Cover and Thomas 1991). It is always normegative and is zero if and only if the two distributions are identical, but is asymmetric and hence not a metric (the usual notion of distance). 223 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 complexity, while the data description length indicates goodness of fit to the data. The MDL principle stipulates that the model that minimizes the sum total of the description lengths should be the best model (both for data compression and statistical estimation).","In the remainder of this section, we will describe how we apply MDL to our current problem. We will then discuss the rationale behind using MDL in our present context. 3.1 Calculating Description Length We first show how the description length for a model is calculated. We use S to denote a sample (or set of data), which is a multiset of examples, each of which is an occurrence of a noun at a given slot r of a given verb v (i.e., duplication is allowed).

But since the number of cuts in a thesaurus tree is exponential in the size of the tree (for example, it is easy to verify that for a complete b-ary tree of depth d it is of the order o(2ba-1)), it is impractical to do so.

Here we will give an intuitive explanation of why the proposition holds, and give the formal proof in Appendix A. The MLE of each node (class) is obtained simply by dividing the frequency of nouns within that class by the total sample size. Thus, the parameter estimation for each subtree can be done independently from the estimation of the parameters outside the subtree. The data description length for a subtree thus depends solely on the tree cut within that subtree, and its calculation can be performed independently for each subtree. As for the parameter description length for a subtree, it depends only on the number of classes in the tree cut within that subtree, and hence can be computed independently as well. The formal proof proceeds by mathematical induction, which verifies that the optimal model in any (sub)tree is either the model 227 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 consisting of the root of the tree or the model obtained by appending the optimal submodels for its child subtrees. 7 3.3 Estimation, Generalization, and MDL When a discrete model (a partition F of the set of nouns W\" in our present context) is fixed, and the estimation problem involves only the estimation of probability parameters, the classic maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is known to be satisfactory. In particular, the estimation of a word-based model is one such problem, since the partition is fixed and the size of the partition equals [.M[. Furthermore, for a fixed discrete model, it is known that MLE coincides with MDL: Given data S = {xi : i = 1 ..... m}, MLE estimates parameter P, which maximizes the likelihood with respect to the data; that is: m","= arg mpax H P(xi). (13) i=1 It is easy to see that P also satisfies: m","= arg nun ~ - log P(xi). (14) i=1 This is nothing but the MDL estimate in this case,"]},{"title":"since ~i~1 -log","paragraphs":["P(xi) is the data description length.","When the estimation problem involves model selection, i.e., the choice of a tree cut in the present context, MDUs behavior significantly deviates from that of MLE. This is because MDL insists on minimizing the sum total of the data description length and the model description length, while MLE is still equivalent to minimizing the data description length only. So, for our problem of estimating a tree cut model, MDL tends to select a model that is reasonably simple yet fits the data quite well, whereas the model selected by MLE will be a word-based model (or a tree cut model equivalent to the word-based modelS), as it will always manage to fit the data.","In statistical terms, the superiority of MDL as an estimation method is related to the fact we noted earlier that even though MLE can provide the best fit to the given data, the estimation accuracy of the parameters is poor, when applied on a sample of modest size, as there are too many parameters to estimate. MLE is likely to estimate most parameters to be zero, and thus suffers from the data sparseness problem. Note in Table 4, that MDL avoids this problem by taking into account the model complexity as well as the fit to the data.","MDL stipulates that the model with the minimum description length should be selected both for data compression and estimation. This intimate connection between estimation and data compression can also be thought of as that between estimation and generalization, since in order to compress information, generalization is necessary. In our current problem, this corresponds to the generalization of individual nouns present in case frame instances in the data as classes of nouns present in a given thesaurus. For example, given the thesaurus in Figure 3 and frequency data in Figure 1, we would 7 The process of finding the MDL model tends to be computationally demanding and is often intractable. When the model class under consideration is restricted to tree structures, however, dynamic programming is often applicable and the MDL model can be efficiently found. For example, Rissanen (1995) has devised an algorithm for learning decision trees. 8 Consider, for example, the case when the co-occurrence data is given as f(swallow) = 2,f(crow) = 2,f(eagle) = 2,f(bird) = 2 for the problem in Section 2. 228 Li and Abe Generalizing Case Frames like our system to judge that the class BIRD and the noun"]},{"title":"bee","paragraphs":["can be the subject slot of the verb"]},{"title":"fly.","paragraphs":["The problem of deciding whether to stop generalizing at BIRD and"]},{"title":"bee,","paragraphs":["or generalizing further to ANIMAL has been addressed by a number of authors (Webster and Marcus 1989; Velardi, Pazienza, and Fasolo 1991; Nomiyama 1992). Minimization of the total description length provides a disciplined criterion to do this.","A remarkable fact about MDL is that theoretical findings have indeed verified that MDL, as an estimation strategy, is near optimal in terms of the rate of convergence of its estimated models to the true model as data size increases. When the true model is included in the class of models considered, the models selected by MDL converge to the true model at the rate of O/~C:~9~_i~!~ where k* is the number of parameters in 2.1Sl J' the true model, and [S] the data"]},{"title":"size,","paragraphs":["which is near optimal (Barron and Cover 1991; Yamanishi 1992).","Thus, in the current problem, MDL provides (a) a way of smoothing probability parameters to solve the data sparseness problem, and at the same time, (b) a way of generalizing nouns in the data to noun classes of an appropriate level, both as a corollary to the near optimal estimation of the distribution of the given data. 3.4 The Bayesian Interpretation of MDL and the Choice of Encoding Scheme There is a Bayesian interpretation of MDL: MDL is essentially equivalent to the \"posterior mode\" in the Bayesian terminology (Rissanen 1989). Given data S and a number of models, the Bayesian estimator (posterior mode) selects a model M that maximizes the posterior probability: = argn~x(P(M)."]},{"title":"P(S","paragraphs":["I M)) (15) where"]},{"title":"P(M)","paragraphs":["denotes the prior probability of the model M and"]},{"title":"P(S [ M)","paragraphs":["the probability of observing the data S given M.

(Note that if we assign uniform prior probability"]},{"title":"P(M)","paragraphs":["to all models M, then (15) becomes equivalent to (13), giving the maximum-likelihood estimate.)","Recall, that in our definition of parameter description length, we assign a shorter parameter description length to a model with a smaller number of parameters k, which admits the above interpretation. As for the model description length (for tree cuts) we assigned an equal code length to each tree cut, which translates to placing no bias on any cut. We could have employed a different coding scheme assigning shorter code lengths to cuts nearer the root. We chose not to do so partly because, for sufficiently large sample sizes, the parameter description length starts dominating the model description length anyway.","Another important property of the definition of description length is that it affects not only the effective prior probabilities on the models, but also the procedure for computing the model minimizing the measure. Indeed, our definition of model description length was chosen to be compatible with the dynamic programming technique, namely, its calculation is performable locally for each subtree. For a different choice of coding scheme, it is possible that a simple and efficient MDL algorithm like 229 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 Find-MDL may not exist. We believe that our choice of model description length is derived from a natural encoding scheme with reasonable interpretation as Bayesian prior, and at the same time allows an efficient algorithm for finding a model with the minimum description length. 3.5 The Uniform Distribution Assumption and the Level of Generalization The uniform distribution assumption made in (4), namely that all nouns belonging to a class contained in the tree cut model are assigned the same probability, seems to be rather stringent. If one were to insist that the model be exactly accurate, then it would seem that the true model would be the word-based model resulting from no generalization at all. If we allow approximations, however, it is likely that some reasonable tree cut model with the uniform probability assumption will be a good approximation of the true distribution; in fact, a best model for a given data size. As we remarked earlier, as MDL balances between the fit to the data and the simplicity of the model, one can expect that the model selected by MDL will be a reasonable compromise.","Nonetheless, it is still a shortcoming of our model that it contains an oversimplified assumption, and the problem is especially pressing when rare words are involved. Rare words may not be observed at a slot of interest in the data simply because they are rare, and not because they are unfit for that particular slot. 9 To see how rare is too rare for our method, consider the following example.","Suppose that the class BIRD contains 10 words,"]},{"title":"bird, swallow, crow, eagle, parrot, waxwing,","paragraphs":["etc. Consider co-occurrence data having 8 occurrences of"]},{"title":"bird,","paragraphs":["2 occurrences of"]},{"title":"swallow,","paragraphs":["1 occurrence of"]},{"title":"crow,","paragraphs":["1 occurrence of"]},{"title":"eagle,","paragraphs":["and 0 occurrence of all other words, as part of, say, 100 data obtained for the subject slot of verb"]},{"title":"fly.","paragraphs":["For this data set, our method would select the model that generalizes"]},{"title":"bird, swallow,","paragraphs":["etc. to the class BIRD, since the sum of the data and parameter description lengths for the BIRD subtree is 76.57 + 3.32 = 79.89 if generalized, and 53.73 + 33.22 = 86.95 if not generalized.

This is outside the scope of the present paper, and we simply refer the interested reader to one possible approach (Abe and Li 1996). 230 Li and Abe Generalizing Case Frames Table 6 Example input data (for the direct object slot of eat). eat arg2 food 3 eat arg2 lobster 1 eat arg2 seed 1 eat arg2 heart 2 eat arg2 liver 1 eat arg2 plant 1 eat arg2 sandwich 2 eat arg2 crab 1 eat arg2 elephant 1 eat arg2 meal 2 eat arg2 rope 1 eat arg2 seafood 1 eat arg2 amount 2 eat arg2 horse 1 eat arg2 mushroom 1 eat arg2 night 2 eat arg2 bug 1 eat arg2 ketchup 1 eat arg2 lunch 2 eat arg2 bowl 1 eat arg2 sawdust 1 eat arg2 snack 2 eat arg2 month 1 eat arg2 egg 1 eat arg2 jam 2 eat arg2 effect 1 eat arg2 sprout 1 eat arg2 diet 1 eat arg2 debt 1 eat arg2 nail 1 eat arg2 pizza 1 eat arg2 oyster 1 applied our method to generalize the slot_values. Table 6 shows some example triple data for the direct object slot of the verb eat.","There were some extraction errors present in the data, but we chose not to remove them, because in general there will always be extraction errors and realistic evaluation should leave them in.","When generalizing, we used the noun taxonomy of WordNet (version 1.4) (Miller 1995) as our thesaurus. The noun taxonomy of WordNet has a structure of directed acyclic graph (DAG), and its nodes stand for a word sense (a concept) and often contain several words having the same word sense. WordNet thus deviates from our notion of thesaurus--a tree in which each leaf node stands for a noun, each internal node stands for the class of nouns below it, and a noun is uniquely represented by a leaf node--so we took a few measures to deal with this.","First, we modified our algorithm FInd-MDL so that it can be applied to a DAG; now, Find-MDL effectively copies each subgraph having multiple parents (and its associated data) so that the DAG is transformed to a tree structure. Note that with this modification it is no longer guaranteed that the output model is optimal. Next, we dealt heuristically with the issue of word-sense ambiguity by equally dividing the observed frequency of a noun between all the nodes containing that noun. Finally, when an internal node contained nouns actually occurring in the data, we assigned the .frequencies of all the nodes below it to that internal node, and excised the whole subtree (subgraph) below it. The last of these measures, in effect, defines the \"starting cut\" of the thesaurus from which to begin generalizing. Since (word senses of) nouns that occur in natural language tend to concentrate in the middle of a taxonomy, the starting cut given by this method usually falls around the middle of the thesaurus. 1°","Figure 9 shows the starting cut and the resulting cut in WordNet for the direct object slot of eat with respect to the data in Table 6, where /.../ denotes a node in WordNet. The starting cut consists of nodes/plant.../,/food/,etc, which are the high-est nodes containing values of the direct object slot of eat. Since/food/has significantly higher frequencies than its neighbors/solid/and/fluid/, the generalization stops there according to MDL. In contrast, the nodes under/life_form.../have relatively small differences in their frequencies, and thus they are generalized to the node/life_form.../.

(The computation time for loading the WordNet was excluded since it need be done only once.) Even though the noun taxonomy of WordNet is a large thesaurus containing approximately 50,000 nodes, our method still manages to efficiently generalize case slots using it. The table also shows the average number of levels generalized for each slot, namely, the average number of links between a node in the starting cut and its ancestor node in the resulting cut. (For example, the number of levels generalized for/plant..-/ is one in Figure 9.) One can see that a significant amount of generalization is performed by our method--the resulting tree cut is about 5 levels higher than the starting cut, on the average. 4.2 Experiment 2: PP-Attachment Disambiguation Case frame patterns obtained by our method can be used in various tasks in natural language processing. In this paper, we test its effectiveness in a structural (PP-attachment) disambiguation experiment. Disambiguation Methods. It has been empirically verified that the use of lexical semantic knowledge is effective in structural disambiguation, such as the PP-attachment problem (Hobbs and Bear 1990; Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990).

Since both MDL and SA have pros and cons, it would be desirable to develop a methodology that combines the merits of the two methods (cf. Abe and Li [1996]). MDL and LA. LA makes its disambiguation decision completely ignoring noun2. As Resnik (1993b) pointed out, if we hope to improve disambiguation performance by increasing training data, we need a richer model such as those used in MDL and SA. We found that 8.8% of the quadruples in our entire test data were such that they shared the same verb, prep, noun1 but had different noun2, and their PP-attachment sites go both ways in the same data, i.e., both to verb and to noun1. Clearly, for these examples, the PP-attachment site cannot be reliably determined without knowing noun2. Table 15 shows some of these examples. (We adopted the attachment sites given in the Penn Tree Bank, without correcting apparently wrong judgements.) MDL and TEL. We chose TEL as an example of the quadruple approach. This method was designed specifically for the purpose of resolving PP-attachment ambiguities, and seems to perform slightly better than ours.","As we remarked earlier, however, the input data required by our method (triples) could be generated automatically from unparsed corpora making use of existing heuristic rules (Brent 1993; Smadja 1993), although for the experiments we report here we used a parsed corpus. Thus it would seem to be easier to obtain more data in the future for MDL and other methods based on unsupervised learning. Also note that our method of generalizing values of a case slot can be used for purposes other than disambiguation. 5. Conclusions We proposed a new method of generalizing case frames. Our approach of applying MDL to estimate a tree cut model in an existing thesaurus is not limited to just the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot. It is potentially useful in other natural language processing tasks, such as the problem of estimating n-gram models (Brown et al. 1992) or the problem of semantic tagging (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 1997). We believe that our method has the following merits: (1) it is theoretically sound; (2) it is computationally efficient; (3) it is robust against noise. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of our method is better than, or at least comparable to, existing methods. One of the disadvantages of our method is that its performance 239 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 depends on the structure of the particular thesaurus used. This, however, is a problem commonly shared by any generalization method that uses a thesaurus as prior knowledge.
