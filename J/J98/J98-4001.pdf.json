In the dialogue of Figure 1, the Apprentice (participant \"A\") initiates the first subdialogue for two reasons: (i) because he believes that removing the belt of the air compressor plays a role in replacing its pump and belt and (ii) because he wants to enlist the Expert's help in removing the belt. Reason (ii) underlies the subdialogue itself, while reason (i) is reflected in the relationship of the subdialogue to the preceding discourse• The Expert must recognize both of these reasons to respond effectively to the Apprentice. For example, suppose that the Expert believes that the Apprentice's belief in (i) is incorrect; that is, she believes that the proposed subtask does not play a role in performing the overall task. The Expert should then communicate that information to the Apprentice (Pollack 1986b). If we were to design a system 1 In some sense, all dialogues are task oriented. The task simply varies from the physical (e.g., removing a pump) to the more intellectual (e.g., satisfying a knowledge precondition). 526 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model (1) NM: It looks like we need to do some maintenance on node39. (2) NP: Right.","How shall we proceed? (4) NM: Well, first we need to divert the traffic to another node. (5) NP: Okay. (6) Then we can replace node39 with a higher capacity switch. (7) NM: Right.

Figure 3 Sample knowledge precondition subdialogues. (Adapted from Lochbaurn, Grosz, and Sidner [1990].) to play the role of the Expert in this scenario and that system were not designed to recognize the relationship of an embedded subdialogue to the previous discourse, then it would not attribute reason (i) to the Apprentice. It thus would not recognize that the Apprentice mistakenly believes that the proposed subtask contributes to the overall task. As a result, the system would fail to recognize that it should inform the Apprentice of his mistaken belief.","Correction subdialogues provide an even more striking example of the importance of recognizing discourse structure. An agent initiates a correction subdialogue when it requires help addressing some problem. For example, the dialogue in Figure 2 is concerned with modifying a KL-ONE network (Brachman and Schmolze 1985). The User produces utterance (3) of the dialogue because she is unable to perform the next act that she intends, namely adding a new concept to the displayed portion of the network. As with the subtask example, the System must recognize this intention to respond appropriately. In particular, it must recognize that the User is not continuing to perform the subtasks involved in modifying the KL-ONE network, but rather is addressing a problem that prevents her from continuing with them. For the System to recognize the User's intention, it must recognize that the User has initiated a new segment of the discourse and also recognize the relationship of that new segment to the preceding discourse.","If the System does not recognize that the User has initiated a new discourse segment with utterance (3), then it will not interpret the User's subsequent utterances in the proper context. For example, it will take the User's utterance in (4) to be a request that the System perform an act in support of further modifying the network, rather than in support of correcting the problem. If the System does not believe that the act of raising up a displayed subnetwork is part of modifying a network, then it will conclude that the User has mistaken beliefs about how to proceed with the mod-527 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 ification. In its response, the System may then choose to correct the User's perceived misconception, rather than to perform the act requested of it.","Even if the System does recognize the initiation of a new discourse segment with utterance (3), i.e., it recognizes that the User is talking about something new, if it does not recognize the relationship of the new segment to the preceding discourse, then it may also respond inappropriately. For example, if the System does not recognize that the act the User cannot perform, i.e., \"fitting a new ic below it,\" is part of modifying the network, then the System may respond without taking that larger context into account. In particular, the System might clear the screen to give the User more room to create the new concept. Such a response would be counterproductive to the User, however, who needs to see the employee concept to create a new instantiation of it.","The last sample dialogue contains a third type of subdialogue, a knowledge precondition subdialogue. Whereas an agent initiates a correction subdialogue when it is physically unable to perform an action, it initiates a knowledge precondition subdialogue when it is \"mentally\" unable to perform it, i.e., when it lacks the proper knowledge. The dialogue in Figure 3 contains two types of knowledge precondition subdialogues. The first type is concerned with determining a means of performing an act, while the second type is concerned with identifying a parameter of an act. As with the other types of subdialogues discussed above, an agent may respond inappropriately if it does not recognize the relationship of these subdialogues to the preceding discourse. For example, prior to the second subdialogue in Figure 3, agents NM (the Network Manager) and NP (the Network Presenter) have agreed to maintain node39 of a local computer network, in part by diverting traffic from node39 to some other node. To perform the divert traffic act, however, the agents must identify that other node. Agent NM initiates the second subdialogue for this purpose. If agent NP does not recognize the context in which the node is to be identified, i.e., for the purpose of diverting network traffic, then it may respond with a description that will not serve that purpose. For example, it may respond with a description like \"the node with the lightest traffic,\" rather than with a name like \"node41.\"","Thus, although the sample dialogues include a variety of subdialogue types, the type of processing required to participate in the dialogues is the same. In each case, an agent must recognize both the purpose of an embedded subdialogue and the relationship of that purpose to the purposes associated with the preceding discourse. These purposes and their interrelationships form the intentional structure of the discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In this paper, we present a computational model for recognizing intentional structure and utilizing it in discourse processing. Our model is based on the collaborative planning framework of SharedPlans (Grosz and Sidner 1990; Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner 1990; Grosz and Kraus 1993, 1996).","In the first part of this paper, we describe the SharedPlan model in general. In Section 2, we summarize its concepts and definitions and then in Section 3 discuss the model of discourse processing that it imposes, Contrasting it with more traditional approaches to planning and plan recognition. In the second part of the paper, we turn to Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure. We first describe their theory and then show how SharedPlans may be used to model its intentional component. Next, we demonstrate how the process for reasoning with SharedPlans presented in Section 3 may be mapped to the problem of recognizing and reasoning with intentional structure. In this paper, we focus on the, theory of using SharedPlans to model intentional structure; however, the theory has also been implemented in a working system (Lochbaum 1994). In the third part of the paper we evaluate our approach against previous ones. We first return to Grosz and Sidner's theory and evaluate our model against the constraints that it imposes. We then compare our approach to discourse 528 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model processing with previous plan-based approaches (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987; Lambert and Carberry 1991; Ramshaw 1991) and show that our approach is aimed at recognizing and reasoning with a different type of intention. Whereas our approach is concerned with discourse-level intentions, previous approaches have been concerned with utterance-level intentions. 2. The SharedPlan Definitions Grosz and Sidner (1990) originally proposed SharedPlans as a more appropriate model of plans for discourse than the single-agent plans based on AI planning formalisms such as STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson 1971). SharedPlans differ from these other types of plans in providing a model of collaborative, multiagent plans. Collaborative plans better characterize the nature of discourse. As Grosz and Sidner put it (1990, 418): Discourses are fundamentally examples of collaborative behavior. The participants in a discourse work together to satisfy various of their individual and joint needs. Thus, to be sufficient to underlie discourse theory, a theory of actions, plans, and plan recognition must deal adequately with collaboration. Models of single-agent plans are not sufficient for this purpose. As Grosz and Sidner and others (Searle 1990; Bratman 1992; Grosz and Kraus 1996) have shown, collaboration cannot be modeled by simply combining the plans of individual agents.","SharedPlans are also distinguished from other planning formalisms in taking plans to be complex mental attitudes rather than abstract data structures. As Pollack noted (1990, 77): There are plans and there are plans. There are the plans that an agent \"knows\": essentially recipes for performing particular actions or for achieving particular goal states. And there are the plans that an agent adopts and that subsequently guide his action. Whereas data-structure approaches to planning and plan recognition are focused on the first type of plan, mental phenomenon approaches are focused on the second. 2 To distinguish these two types of \"plans,\" we adopt Pollack's terminology and use the term"]},{"title":"recipe","paragraphs":["for the first type.

Similarly, an agent can know a way of hijacking a plane without actually having a particular plane, or gun, in mind.

Reasoning with SharedPlans In more traditional plan-based approaches to natural language processing (e.g., the work of Cohen and Perrault [1979], Allen and Perrault [1980], Sidner [1985], Carberry [1987], Litman and Allen [1987], Lambert and Carberry [1991]), reasoning about plans is focused on reasoning about actions. In these models, actions are represented using operators derived from STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson 1971) and NOAH (Sacerdoti 1977). Such operators include: a header, specifying the action and its parameters; a precondition list, specifying the conditions that must be true for the action to be performed; 8 a body, specifying how the action is to be performed; and an effects list, specifying the conditions that will hold after the action is performed. Under these models, reasoning about plans involves reasoning according to rules that derive from the components of the plan operators. For example, Allen (1983) introduces a precondition-action rule stating that if agent G wants to achieve proposition P and P is a precondition of an act ACT, then G may want to perform ACT. This rule is used for plan recognition. The corresponding rule for plan construction states that if agent G wants to execute ACT, then G may want to ensure that precondition P is satisfied. Heuristics, derived from both planning and natural language principles, are used to guide the application of the rules to recognize (or construct) the best possible plan accounting for an agent's observations (or desired effects). 8 The preconditions may also be supplemented by a list of applicability conditions, specifying the conditions under which it is reasonable to pursue the action, and a list of constraints specifying restrictions on instantiations of the operator's parameters (Litman and Allen 1987; Carberry 1987). 535 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4","Problem-solving Plan-Pl: {_agent1 and _agent2 build a plan for _agent1 to do _action} '","Action: Build-Plan(_agentl, -agent2, _action)","AppCond: want (_agent 1,_action)","Constr: plan- for (_plan,_action) action-in-plan-for (Aaction,-action)","Prec: selected (_agent 1,_action,_plan) know(_agent2,want (_agent 1,_action)) knowref( _agent 1, _prop,prec-of( _prop, _plan)) knowref(_agent2,_prop,prec-of(_prop,_plan)) knowref( _agent 1, ._l action ,need- do ( _agent 1, _lact ion, _action) ) knowref( _agent 2, _l action, need- do ( _agent 1, _laction, _act ion ) ) 1. for all actions _laction in _plan","Instantiate-Vars (_agent 1,-agent2,Aaction) 2. for all actions _laction in _plan","Build-Plan (_agent 1,-agent2,_.laction) have-plan (_agent 1, _plan, _action) have-plan(_agentl,_plan,_action) Body: Effects: Goal: Figure 9 Lambert and Carberry's (1991, 49) Build-Plan operator.","In these more traditional approaches, the inference rules are typically expressed in terms of the beliefs and goals of the speaker and hearer. Allen's (1983, 126) precondition-action rule, for example, is represented as: SBAW(P) Di SBAW(ACT) -- if P is a precondition of action ACT where SBAW(P) represents that the inferring agent S believes that agent A wants P. As Pollack (1986b, 1990) has noted, however, these mental attitudes are typically transparent to the reasoning process. The system reasons about the action operators themselves--in this case whether P is a precondition of ACT--and essentially ignores tile mental attitudes in the rules; they are simply carried forward from antecedent to consequent. Pollack has dubbed these approaches data-structure approaches because of their focus on the action operators themselves, rather than on the mental attitudes ti'lat are required for planning and plan recognition.","In more recent work, the action operators have come to incorporate many more requirements on the agents' mental states. For example, Lambert and Carberry's operator for the action of building a plan is given in Figure 9. The Build-Plan operator is used to represent the process by which two agents build a plan for one of them to perform an action. The preconditions of the operator specify requirements on the agents' mental states, e.g., that the agents know the referents of the subactions that one of them needs to perform to accomplish the overall action. The main difference between this type of approach and the SharedPlan approach discussed in this paper is in the focus of the representation.' The representation in Figure 9 specifies requirements on performing an action, some of which are requirements on mental states. The SharedPlan definition in Figure 5 specifies requirements on mental states, some of which refer to actions and their decompositions. One might thus think of the representation in Figure 9 as being \"inside-out\" from that in Figure 5. Because the focus of the representation in Figure 9 remains on the action and its decomposition, we continue to refer to these types of approaches as data-structure approaches. We reserve tlhe term mental phenomenon approach for those approaches, such as SharedPlans 536 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model and Pollack's individual plans (Pollack 1986b, 1990; Grosz and Kraus 1996), that take mental states to be primary. We will return to the implications of representations such as those in Figure 9 in Section 8.2.","The process of reasoning with SharedPlans differs significantly from the process of reasoning with plan operators. Under the SharedPlan approach, agents engaged in discourse are taken to be collaborating on performing some action or on achieving some state of affairs. Each agent brings to their collaboration different beliefs about ways in which to achieve their goal and the actions necessary for doing so. Each agent may have incomplete or incorrect beliefs. In addition, their beliefs about each other's beliefs and capabilities to act may be incorrect. The participants use the discourse to communicate their individual beliefs and to establish mutual ones. Under the SharedPlan approach, the utterances of a discourse are thus understood as contributing information toward establishing the beliefs and intentions that are required for successful collaboration. These beliefs and intentions are summarized by the full SharedPlan definition in Figure 5 and form the basis for the discourse participants' utterances.","Until the agents have established all of the requirements of a full SharedPlan, they will have a partial SharedPlan. The agents' partial SharedPlan evolves over the course of the agents' discourse as they communicate about the actions they will perform, the effects of those actions as they perform them, and the need to revise their plans when things do not proceed as expected. The agents' partial SharedPlan is thus always in a state of flux. At any given point in the agents' discourse, however, it represents the current state of the agents' collaboration. It thus indicates those beliefs and intentions that have been established at that point in the discourse, as well as those that remain to be established over the course of the remaining discourse. The agents' partial SharedPlan thus serves to delineate the information that the agents must consider in interpreting each other's utterances and in determining what they themselves should do or say next. For the agents' utterances to be coherent, they must advance the agents' partial SharedPlan towards completion by helping to establish the \"missing\" beliefs and intentions.","The concept of plan augmentation thus provides the basis for our model of discourse processing. Under this approach, discourse participants' utterances are understood as augmenting the partial SharedPlan that represents the state of their collaboration. Figure 10 provides a high-level specification of this process? It is based on the assumption that agents G1 and G2 are collaborating on an act o~ and models Gl's reasoning in that regard. It thus stipulates how Gl's beliefs about the agents' partial SharedPlan are augmented over the course of the agents' discourse. ~°","It is important to emphasize here that SharedPlans are complex structures that are distributed in nature. The full SharedPlan for a group activity does not, typically, reside in any single agent's mind, nor is there any notion of a group mind in which the SharedPlan resides. Rather, the beliefs and intentions that form a SharedPlan are distributed among the individual minds of the participating agents. Each agent has individual beliefs about its capabilities to act, as well as individual intentions to do so. In addition, agents have commitments towards other agents' abilities to act (represented by intentions that, Int.Th) and mutual beliefs about others' capabilities and 9 The details of this process differ significantly from that described in a previous paper (Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner 1990).","10 For expository purposes, we will take G1 to be male and G2 to be female.

In Section 6 we will provide algorithms for further modeling two of the steps in this process, while in Section 10, we will discuss the use of SharedPlans in generation. The main focus of this paper, however, is on modeling the intentional structure of discourse. In the next section, we thus provide a model of that structure. We then show how the model of utterance interpretation presented in Figure 10 can be mapped to the problem of recognizing intentional structure and utilizing it in discourse processing. 4. Grosz and Sidner's Theory of Discourse Structure According to Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory, discourse structure is comprised of three interrelated components: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state. The linguistic structure is a structure that is imposed on the utterances themselves; it consists of discourse segments and embedding relationships among them. The linguistic structure of the sample dialogues in Section 1 is indicated by the bold rule grouping utterances into segments.","The intentional structure of discourse consists of the purposes of the discourse segments and their interrelationships. Discourse segment purposes or DSPs are intentions that lead to the initiation of a discourse segment. DSPs are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they, like certain utterance-level intentions described by Grice (1969), are intended to be recognized. There are two types of relationships that can hold between DSPs, dominance and satisfaction-precedence. One DSP dominates another if the second provides part of the satisfaction of the first. That is, the establishment of the state of affairs represented by the second DSP contributes to the establishment of the state of affairs represented by the first. This relationship is reflected by a corresponding embedding relationship in the linguistic structure. One DSP satisfaction-precedes another if the first must be satisfied before the second.

With each new discourse segment, a new focus space is pushed onto the stack (possibly after other focus spaces are first popped off), and the objects, properties, and :relations that become salient during the segment are entered into it, as is the segment's DSP. One of the primary roles of the focus space stack is to constrain the range of DSPs to which a new DSP can be related; a new DSP can only be dominated by a DSP in some space on the stack. Once a segment's DSP is satisfied, the segment's focus space :is popped from the stack. 5. A SharedPlan Model of Intentional Structure Figure 11 illustrates the role of SharedPlans in modeling intentional structure. As indicated in the figure, we take each segment of a discourse to have an associated SharedPlan. The purpose of the segment is taken to be an intention that (Int.Th) the discourse participants form that plan. This intention is held by the agent who initiates the segment. Following Grosz and Sidner (1986), we will refer to that agent as the ICP for initiating conversational participant; the other participant is the OCP. DSPs are thus represented as intentions of the form Int.Th(ICP, FSP({ICP, OCP}, fl)) in our model.","Relationships between DSPs derive from relationships between the corresponding SharedPlans. For example, a satisfaction-precedence relationship between DSPs corresponds to a temporal dependency between SharedPlans) 2 When one DSP satisfaction-12 Thanks to Christine Nakatani for initially suggesting this correspondence. 540 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model precedes another, the SharedPlan used to model the first must be completed before the SharedPlan used to model the second. Dominance relationships between DSPs depend upon subsidiary relationships between the corresponding SharedPlans. In Section 3, we used the term subsidiary SharedPlan to indicate a subordinate relationship between SharedPlans. More generally, one plan is subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan establishes one of the beliefs or intentions required for the agents to have the second plan. One plan is thus subsidiary to another if the completion of the first plan contributes to the completion of the second.","The utterances of a discourse are understood in terms of their contribution to the SharedPlans associated with the segments of the discourse. Those segments that have been completed at the time of processing an utterance have a full SharedPlan associated with them (e.g., segment (2) in Figure 11), while those that have not have a partial SharedPlan (e.g., segments (1) and (3) in Figure 11)."]},{"title":"5.1 Dialogue Analyses","paragraphs":["We now return to the dialogues in Section 1 to illustrate the use of SharedPlans in modeling intentional structure.

Both of the agents participate in the act of replacing the pump and belt of the air compressor, though each agent brings different skills to the task. The Expert provides the expertise, while the Apprentice provides the manual dexterity.

However, because an agent must have a recipe in mind before it can be concerned with identifying the parameters of the acts in that recipe, the SharedPlan in DSP7 must be completed before the SharedPlan in DSPs. 16 DSP7 thus satisfaction-precedes DSP8. 6. Reasoning with Intentional Structure Intentional structure plays a central role in discourse processing. For each utterance of a discourse, an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, completes the current segment, or contributes to it (Grosz and Sidner 1986). If the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, the agent must recognize the DSP of that segment, as well as its relationship to the other DSPs underlying the discourse and currently in focus. If the utterance completes the current segment, the agent must come to believe that the DSP of that segment has been satisfied. If the utterance contributes to the current segment, the agent must determine the effect of the utterance on the segment's DSP.","We now show how the SharedPlan reasoning presented in Section 3 may be mapped to the problem of recognizing and reasoning with intentional structure. Step (2) of the augmentation process in Figure 10 is divided into three cases based upon the way in which an utterance affects the SharedPlans underlying a discourse. An utterance may indicate the initiation of a subsidiary SharedPlan (Case (2a)), the completion","16 There are several means by which an agent can determine a recipe for an act c~. If an agent chooses a recipe for c~ from some type of manual (e.g., a cookbook), then the agent will have a complete recipe for c~ before identifying the parameters of c~'s constituent acts. On the other hand, when being told a recipe for c~ by another agent, the ignorant agent may interrupt and ask about a parameter of a constituent act before knowing all of the constituent acts. In this case, the agent may have only a partial recipe for c~ before identifying the parameters of the acts in that partial recipe. Thus, if fli is an act in c~'s recipe, a discourse segment concerned with identifying a parameter of fli could be linguistically embedded within a segment concerned with obtaining a recipe for c~. This case poses interesting questions for future research regarding the relationship between the two segments' DSPs. 543 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 Assume: PSP({G1,G2 },c~),","The purpose of the current discourse segment, DSc, is thus","DSP¢ =Int.Th (ICP, FSP ({ G1, G2 }, a)) G1 is the agent being modeled, S is a stack of SharedPlans used to represent G~'s beliefs as to which portion of the intentional structure is currently in focus.

We use a stack of SharedPlans S to model this context. The stack corresponds to that portion of the intentional structure that is currently in focus. It thus mirrors the attentional state component of discourse structure and contains PSPs corresponding to discourse segments that have not yet been completed. Because the augmentation process depends most heavily upon the SharedPlans that are used to represent DSPs, it simply makes use of the SharedPlans themselves, rather than the full intentions. The full intentions are easily recoverable from the stack representation.","Case (2a) in Figure 13 models the recognition of new discourse segments and their purposes. If G1 believes that G2's utterance indicates the initiation of a new SharedPlan, then G1 will take G2 to be initiating a new discourse segment with her utteranceJ 7 Gt first ascribes this intention to G2 (Step (2ai)) and then tries to explain it given the 17 As discussed in Section 7.3, the DSP of the new segment may be only abstractly specified at this point. 544 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model current discourse context (Step (2aii)). Whereas at the utterance level, a hearer must explain why a speaker said what he did (Sidner and Israel 1981), at the discourse level, an OCP must explain why an ICP engages in a new discourse segment at a particular juncture in the discourse. The latter explanation depends upon the relationship of the new segment's DSP to the other DSPs underlying the discourse. In Step (2aii) of the augmentation process, G1 must thus determine whether the new SharedPlan would contribute to the agents' SharedPlan for o~ or to some other plan on the stack S. If the new SharedPlan does not contribute to any of the plans on the stack, then it is taken as an interruption. If it does not contribute to the agents' SharedPlan for o~, but to another plan on the stack, one for 7 say, then G1 must also determine whether the plans that are above 7 on the stack have been completed.","Case (2b) in Figure 13 models the recognition of a segment's completion. If G1 believes that G2's utterance signals the completion of the current segment, then G1 must reason whether he too believes the segment to be complete. For that to be the case, G1 must believe that all of the beliefs and intentions required of an FSP have been established over the course of the segment. The completion of a segment may be signaled in either the linguistic structure or the intentional structure. For example, in the linguistic structure, cue phrases such as \"but anyway\" may indicate the satisfaction of a DSP (as well as a pop of the focus space stack). In the intentional structure, the completion of a segment may be signaled by the initiation of a new SharedPlan, as described above.","Case (2c) models the recognition of an utterance's contribution to the current discourse segment. When a speaker produces an utterance within a segment, a hearer must determine why the speaker said what he did. Step (2c) models the hearer's reasoning by trying to ascribe appropriate beliefs to the speaker. These beliefs are ascribed based on the hearer's beliefs about the state of the agents' SharedPlans and the steps necessary to complete them. 6.1 Modeling the Plan Augmentation Process Figure 13 contains a high-level specification of the process of reasoning with intentional structure. It provides a framework in which to develop further mechanisms for modeling the various steps of this process. In this section, we present two such mechanisms. The first mechanism presents a method for recognizing the initiation of a new discourse segment (Step (2a) in Figure 13); the second describes an algorithm for reasoning about the contribution of an utterance to the current segment (Step (2c)). These two mechanisms are central to the augmentation process, but are not complete; they each model just one aspect of their respective steps of the process. The complete specification of these steps, as well as that of the augmentation process in general, requires further research, as is discussed in Section 10. 6.1.1 Case (2a): Initiating a New Discourse Segment. Step (2ai) of the augmentation process involves recognizing agent G2's intention that G1 and G2 form a full SharedPlan for an act ft. This intention may be recognized using a conversational default rule, CDRA, shown in Figure 14. TM The antecedent of this rule consists of two parts: (la) G1 must believe that G2 communicated her desire for the performance of act fl to G1, and (lb) G1 must believe that G2 believes they can together perform ft. The second condition precludes the case where G2 is stating her desire to perform the act herself 18 This rule extends Grosz and Sidner's (1990) original conversational default rule, CDR1. 545 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 (la)"]},{"title":"BEL(Gi, [communicates(G2, Gi, Desires(G2, occurs(fl)),","paragraphs":["T)A (lb)"]},{"title":"BEL(G~, (BR~)CBAG({Gi, G2}, f~, R~),","paragraphs":["T)], T) (2)"]},{"title":"BEL(Gi, Int.Th(G~, ESP({G1, G:}, fl)), T) Figure","paragraphs":["14 Conversational default rule"]},{"title":"CDRA.","paragraphs":["de f~lt or for G1 to perform the act.

A comparison of our representation and algorithms with Kautz's can be found elsewhere (Lochbaum 1991, 1994). In short, Kautz's work is based on assumptions that are inappropriate for collaborative discourse. In particular, Kautz assumes a model of keyhole recognition (Cohen, Perrault, and Allen 1982) in which one agent is observing another agent without that second agent's knowledge. In such a situation, only actual event occurrences performed by a single agent are reasoned about; Kautz's representation and algorithms include no means for reasoning about hypothetical, partially specified, or multiagent actions. In addition, in keyhole recognition, no assumptions can be made about the interdependence of observed actions. Because the agent is not aware that it is being observed, it does not structure its actions to facilitate the recognition of its motives.

As a result, Kautz's algorithms can only check for constraint satisfaction locally. In our algorithm, that would correspond to checking the satisfiability of a recipe's constraints before adding it to an rgraph, but not afterwards. By checking the satisfiability of the constraint set that results from combining the recipe's constraints with the rgraph's constraints, the rgraph construction algorithm is able to detect unsatisfiability earlier than an algorithm that checks constraints only locally. 549 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4","E: Replace the pump and belt please.","~,AA~ OK, I found belt in the back. a Is that where it should be?","• ..

Second, NP will update his beliefs about the dominating plan in DSP6 based on the knowledge gained during the subdialogue.

In particular, NP should respond to NM with a description that will 559 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 enable both of the agents to identify the node for the purposes of diverting network traffic. The rgraph in Figure 29 and the constraints of the recipe in Figure 31 provide the necessary context for modeling NP's behavior. Because NP knows that the agents are trying to divert network traffic as part of maintaining node39, as represented by the rgraph in Figure 29, he should first choose a node that is appropriate for that circumstance. For example, he might choose a node that is spatially close to node39, rather than one that, while lightly loaded, is more distant. After selecting the node, NP should then choose a means of identifying it for NM. For example, he might present her with a diagram of the network and then tell her how to identify the particular node on the diagram; NP's response in utterances (10) and (11) takes this form. It would not be appropriate, however, for NP to respond to NM with some internal node name, or with a description like \"the node with the lightest traffic,\" unless he believed that NM could identify the node on the basis of that description. The constraints of the recipe in Figure 31 model this requirement. They represent that the description communicated by an agent should be one that will allow the other agent to identify the object in question for the purpose of the act to be performed. 7. Comparison with Grosz and Sidner's Theory Grosz and Sidner (1990) have argued that a theory of DSP recognition depends upon an underlying theory of collaborative plans. Although SharedPlans provide that latter theory, the connection between SharedPlans and DSPs was never specified. In this paper, we have presented a SharedPlan model for recognizing DSPs and their interrelationships. We now show that this model satisfies the requirements set out by Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory of discourse structure. We first discuss the process by which intentional structure is recognized. Next, we discuss the way in which intentional structure interacts with the attentional state component of discourse structure. And finally, we discuss the contextual use of intentional structure in interpretation. 7.1 Recognizing Intentional Structure 7.1.1 Recognizing Discourse Segments and their Purposes. In their paper on discourse structure, Grosz and Sidner give several examples of the types of intentions that could serve as DSPs (Grosz and Sidner 1986, 179): 1. Intend that some 2. Intend that some 3. Intend that some 4. Intend that some 5. Intend that some agent intend to perform some physical task. agent believe some fact. agent believe that one fact supports another. agent intend to identify an object. agent know some property of an object. Intentions such as these, as well as segment beginnings and endings, might be recognized on the basis of linguistic markers, utterance-level intentions, or knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).","In our model, DSPs take the form"]},{"title":"Int.Th(ICP, FSP({ICP, OCP},fl)).","paragraphs":["This type of DSP addresses several problems with the above examples--problems that motivated Grosz and Sidner's (1990) subsequent work on SharedPlans--namely the case of one agent intending another to do something and the so-called master/slave assumption. We recognize DSPs using the conversational default rule, CDRA. This rule provides a means of recognizing the initiation of new segments and their purposes based on the 560 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model propositional content of utterances. Although this use of CDRA is admittedly limited-- it requires an ICP to communicate the act that it desires to collaborate on at the outset of a segment--other sources of information, such as those cited above, could also be incorporated into the model to aid in the recognition of new segments and their corresponding SharedPlans.","SharedPlans can also be used in recognizing the completion of discourse segments. Case (2b) of the augmentation process in Figure 13 outlines the required reasoning. A discourse segment is complete when all of the beliefs and intentions required to complete its corresponding SharedPlan have been established. This use of SharedPlans also appears at first glance to be of limited use---the mental attitudes required of a full SharedPlan may not all be explicitly established over the course of a dialogue or subdialogue. However, the OCP may be able to infer the completion of a SharedPlan, and thus the corresponding segment, in combination with information from other sources. For example, suppose an OCP has some reason to expect the end of a segment based on a linguistic signal such as an intonational feature (e.g., as described by Grosz and Hirschberg [1992]). If additionally the OCP is able to ascribe the various mental attitudes \"missing\" from the SharedPlan that corresponds to that segment, then the OCP has further evidence for the segment boundary. These mental attitudes may be ascribed on the basis of those of the OCP's beliefs that are in accord with the mental attitudes comprising the SharedPlan (Pollack 1986a; Grosz and Sidner 1990). 7.1.2 Recognizing Relationships between Discourse Segments. Once an OCP recognizes the initiation of a new discourse segment, it must determine the relationship of that segment's DSP to the other DSPs underlying the discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In our model, relationships between SharedPlans provide the basis for determining the corresponding relationships between DSPs. An OCP must determine how the SharedPlan used to model a segment's DSP is related to the other SharedPlans underlying the discourse. The information that an OCP considers in determining this relationship is delineated by the beliefs and intentions that are required to complete each of the other plans. In this way, our model provides a more detailed account of the relationships that can hold between DSPs than did Grosz and Sidner's original formulation.","One DSP dominates another if the second provides part of the satisfaction of the first. In our model, subsidiary relationships between SharedPlans provide a means of determining dominance relationships between DSPs. If one plan is subsidiary to another, then the DSP that is modeled using the first plan is dominated by that modeled using the second. One DSP satisfaction-precedes another if the first must be satisfied before the second. This relationship corresponds to a temporal dependency between SharedPlans. When one SharedPlan must be completed before another, the DSP that is modeled using the first satisfaction-precedes that modeled using the second. 7.2 Relationship to Attentional State The attentional state component of discourse structure is an abstraction of the discourse participants' focus of attention; it is modeled using a stack of focus spaces, one for each segment. Each focus space contains its segment's DSP, as well as those objects, properties, and relations that become salient over the course of the segment. One of the primary roles of the focus space stack is to constrain the range of DSPs to which a new DSP can be related; a new DSP can only be dominated by a DSP in some space on the stack.","In our model, a segment's focus space contains a DSP of the form"]},{"title":"Int.Th(ICP, FSP ({ICP, OCP}, fl)). The","paragraphs":["operations on the focus space stack depend upon subsidiary rela-561 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 tionships between SharedPlans in the same way that Grosz and Sidner (1986) describe the operations as depending upon DSP relationships. As each SharedPlan corresponding to a discourse segment is completed, the segment's focus space is popped from the stack. Only those SharedPlans in some space on the stack are candidates for subsidiary relationships. The use of the SharedPlan stack S in the augmentation process of Figure 13 reflects the operations of the focus space stack. 7.3 The Contextual Role of Intentional Structure An utterance of a discourse can either begin a new segment of the discourse, complete the current segment, or contribute to it (Grosz and Sidner 1986). Each of these possibilities is modeled by a separate case within the augmentation process given in Figure 13. The initiation and completion of discourse segments was discussed in Section 7.1. Our discussion here is thus restricted to the case of an utterance's contributing to a discourse segment.","Under Grosz and Sidner's theory, each utterance of a discourse segment contributes some information towards achieving the purpose of that segment. In our model, each utterance is understood in terms of the information it contributes towards completing the corresponding SharedPlan. The FSP definition in Figure 5 constrains the range of information that an utterance of a segment can contribute towards the segment's SharedPlan. Hence, if an utterance cannot be understood as contributing information to the current SharedPlan, then it cannot be part of the current discourse segment. That is, the utterance must begin a new segment of the discourse or complete the current segment, but it cannot contribute to it. In this way, our model provides a more detailed account of the role that intentional structure plays as context in interpreting utterances than did Grosz and Sidner's original formulation.","Because each utterance of a discourse segment contributes some information towards the purpose of that segment, the segment's DSP may not be completely determined until the last utterance of the segment. However, as Grosz and Sidner (1986) have argued, the OCP must be able to recognize initially at least a generalization of the DSP so that the proper moves of attentional state can be made. Although CDRA provides a limited method of recognizing new segments and their purposes, it does conform to this aspect of Grosz and Sidner's theory. In particular, the initial purpose of a segment, as recognized by CDRA, is quite generally specified; it consists only of the intention that the agents form a SharedPlan. However, as the utterances of a discourse segment provide information about the details of that plan, the segment's purpose becomes more completely determined. In particular, the purpose comes to include the mental attitudes required of a full SharedPlan and established by the dialogue. Additionally, although the objective of the agents' plan may only be abstractly specified when it is initially recognized, it too may be further refined by the utterances of the segment. 8. Comparison with Previous Plan-Based Approaches Early work on plan recognition in discourse (Allen and Perrault 1980; Cohen, Perrault, and Allen 1982) focused on the problem of reasoning about single utterances. 25 Subsequent work (Sidner and Israel 1981; Sidner 1983, 1985; Carberry 1987) extended the earlier approaches to recognize speaker's intentions across multiple utterances. All of","25 More recent work in the area of single utterance reasoning includes that of Cohen and Levesque (1990) and Perrault (1990). Their work provides a detailed mental state model of speech act processing and is thus focused at a different level of granularity than the work discussed in this paper. 562 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model (1) User: Show me the generic concept called \"employee\".

Figure 32 A sample correction subdialogue (Sidner 1983; Litman 1985). these approaches were based on a data-structure view of plans and were designed to recognize utterance-level intentions. More recent work (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987; Lambert and Carberry 1991; Ramshaw 1991) has been concerned with the problems introduced by discourses containing subdialogues. However, the more recent work has followed in the tradition of the previous work and as a result continues to produce an utterance-to-utterance-based analysis of discourse, rather than one based on discourse structure. We now review these approaches and show that they are aimed at recognizing a different type of intention than that discussed in this paper. 8.1 The Approach of Litman and Allen To model clarification and correction subdialogues, Litman and Allen propose the use of two types of plans: discourse plans and domain plans (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987). Domain plans represent knowledge about a task, while discourse plans represent conversational relationships between utterances and plans. For example, an agent may use an utterance to"]},{"title":"introduce, continue,","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"clarify","paragraphs":["a plan.","In Litman and Allen's model, the process of understanding an utterance entails recognizing a discourse plan from the utterance and then relating that discourse plan to some domain plan; the link between plans is captured by the constraints of the discourse plan. For example, under Litman and Allen's analysis, utterance (3) of the dialogue in Figure 32 (repeated from Figures 2 and 19) is recognized as an instance of the CORRECT-PLAN discourse plan; with the utterance, the User is correcting a domain plan to add data to a network.","Litman and Allen use a stack of plans to model attentional aspects of discourse. The plan stack after processing utterance (3) is shown in Figure 33. The CORRECT-PLAN discourse plan on top of the stack indicates that the user and system are correcting a problem with the step labeled D1 in PLAN2 (the DISPLAY act of the ADD-DATA domain plan) by inserting a new step into PLAN2 (?newstep) before the step labeled F1 (the FIT step).","The plan stack after processing the User's subsequent utterance in (4) is shown in Figure 34. The IDENTIFY-PARAMETER discourse plan indicates that utterance (4) is being used to identify the ?newstep parameter of the CORRECT-PLAN discourse plan.","The boxes in Figures 33 and 34 do not correspond to discourse segments, but rather to individual utterances. PLAN5 in Figure 34 was introduced by utterance (4) in the dialogue, PLAN4 by utterance (3). The two utterances are linked together by the parameter M1, corresponding to the MOVE act in PLAN2. Although this analysis serves as a method of relating the two utterances, it provides only an utterance-to-utterance-based model of discourse processing.

Under Litman and Allen's analysis, however, utterance (3) is used to correct a problem and utterance (4) is used to identify a parameter in a discourse plan. This type of analysis cannot capture the contribution of a subdialogue to the overall discourse in which it is embedded. Each utterance is simply linked to one that precedes it, irrespective of how the utterances aggregate into segments.","In contrast to Litman and Allen's approach, our approach accurately reflects the compositional structure of discourse; utterances are understood in the context of discourse segments, and segments in the context of the discourse as a whole. 26 Our analysis of the dialogue in Figure 32 was discussed in Section 6.2.2 and is summarized by Figure 23. Under our analysis, utterance (3) introduces a new discourse segment, the purpose of which is to satisfy a constraint that there be enough free space on the screen to add a new concept. This new segment is recognized and explained based on the ability requirements of SharedPlans. Utterance (4) of the dialogue is understood in the context of this new discourse segment. In particular, the act of moving the generic concept up is understood as a means of satisfying the constraint.","In more recent work, Litman.and Allen have augmented their model with a notion of \"discourse intentions.\" \"Discourse intentions are purposes of the speaker, expressed in terms of both the task plans of the speaker (the domain plans) and the plans recursively generated by these plans (the discourse plans)\" (Litman and Allen, 1990, 376). For example, the discourse intention underlying utterance (4) can be glossed as:","User intends that System intends that System identify the ?newstep parameter","of the CORRECT-PLAN discourse plan. Because Litman and Allen's discourse and domain plans are recognized on the basis of a single utterance, their discourse intentions are actually utterance-level intentions, and not the type of discourse-level intentions discussed in this paper."]},{"title":"8.2 Other Approaches","paragraphs":["Lambert and Carberry (1991) have revised Litman and Allen's dichotomy of plans into a trichotomy of"]},{"title":"discourse, problem-solving,","paragraphs":["and domain plans. Their discourse plans represent means of achieving communicative goals, while their problem-solving plans represent means of constructing domain plans. The Build-Plan operator in Figure 9 is an example of a problem-solving plan; it is used to represent the process by which two agents build a plan for one of them to do an action. The body of the operator requires that the agents (i) Build-Plans for the subacts of that action and (ii) Instantiate-Var(iable)s of those subacts.","In Lambert and Carberry's model, the process of understanding an utterance entails recognizing a tripartite structure of plans. Beginning from the surface-level form of an utterance, their system recognizes plans on the discourse level until a plan at that level can be linked to one on the problem-solving level; plans on the problem-solving level are then recognized until one can be linked to a plan on the domain level; further plans may then be recognized on that level.","26 Although there may be several possible segmentations of a discourse, just as there may be several possible parses of a sentence, there is general agreement that utterances do cluster into segments. The point here is that our analysis reflects this segmentation, whereas Litman and Allen's is utterance-to-utterance based and thus does not. 565 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4","As a model of subdialogue understanding, Lambert and Carberry's approach suffers from problems similar to that of Litman and Allen's. In particular, Lambert and Carberry's analysis is still utterance-to-utterance based; subdialogues are not recognized as separate units, nor is a subdialogue's contribution to the discourse in which it is embedded recognized. This is also true of Lambert and Carberry's (1992) more recent work on modeling negotiation subdialogues. Although Lambert and Carberry emphasize the importance of recognizing the initiation of negotiation subdialogues, and work through an example involving an embedded negotiation subdialogue, they do not indicate how these subdialogues are actually recognized as such. The only possibility hinted at in the text (i.e., that the discourse act Address-Believability accounts for them) results in a discourse segmentation that does not accurately reflect the purposes underlying their sample dialogue.","Figures 35 and 36 contain the sample dialogue used by Lambert and Carberry (1992). In Figure 35, the dialogue is segmented as suggested by Lambert and Carberry's analysis, while in Figure 36 it is segmented to more accurately reflect the purposes underlying the discourse. The subdialogues marked (b) and (d) in Figure 36 are both initiated by $1 and are each concerned with a different aspect of the accuracy of S2's utterance in (6). Segments (b) and (d) are thus siblings both dominated by segment (a) in Figure 36. Under Lambert and Carberry's analysis, however, these two subdialogues are not recognized as separate units. That they should be can be seen by the coherent discourses that remain if either is removed from the dialogue.","In addition, although the process of plan construction provides an important context for interpreting utterances, trying to formalize this mental activity under a data-structure approach results in a model that conflates recipes and plans (Pollack 1990). For example, each of Lambert and Carberry's domain act operators requires as a precondition that the agent have a plan to use that operator to perform the act. That requirement, however, results in the paradoxical situation whereby a recipe for an act o~ requires having a plan for o~ that uses that recipe. As another example, the Build-Plan operator in Figure 9 requires as a precondition that each agent know the referents of the subactions that one of the agents needs to perform to accomplish o~. However, considering that determining how to perform an act is part of constructing a plan to perform that act, it is odd that a recipe for building a plan for o~ requires knowing the subactions of o~ as a precondition of its use. The fact that these inconsistencies do not seem to pose a problem for Lambert and Carberry's model is testament to its data-structure nature; the plan chaining behavior of their reasoner on the various types of operators is such that no circularities arise.","Ramshaw (1991) has augmented Litman and Allen's two types of plans with a different third type, exploration plans. This type of plan is added to distinguish those domain plans an agent has adopted from those it is simply considering adopting. In this model, understanding an utterance entails recognizing a discourse plan from the utterance and then relating that plan to a plan on either the exploration level or the domain level, as determined by the form of the utterance and the plan structures built from previous utterances. Like the previous approaches, however, Ramshaw's model is still utterance-to-utterance based. The three-level structure he manipulates on the basis of each user query does not account in any way for the structure of discourse. 9. Conclusion In this paper, we have developed a computational model for recognizing the intentional structure of a discourse and using that structure in discourse processing. SharedPlans are used both to represent the components of intentional structure, i.e., discourse 566 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model (5) S 1: What is Dr. Smith teaching?

The previous approaches address the problem of recognizing the propositional content of an utterance from its surface form, but provide only an utterance-to-utterance-based analysis of discourse. In contrast, we begin from propositional content and present a model of discourse processing that derives from discourse structure. 10. Future Directions There are three main areas in which the research presented in this paper could be extended. The first involves the augmentation process, the second its use in modeling intentional structure, and the third its use in building collaborative agents. 567 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 10.1 The Augmentation Process The augmentation process given in Figures 10 and 13 provides a novel framework h}r utterance interpretation based on discourse structure. This framework outlines the required steps of the interpretation process and provides constraints on the types of algorithms that may be used to model them. The rules and algorithms presented in Section 6.1 provide a means of modeling the central steps involved in the interpretation process, but are only a beginning. Further research is required to develop algorithms to model the remaining steps. For example, Case (2c) of the augmentation process models the process by which an agent recognizes the contribution of an utterance to the SharedPlan currently in focus. In elaborating this case, we concentrated on just one type of utterance. In particular, we focused on utterances that communicate information about a single action and reasoned only about that action, and not the other information communicated by the utterance. The augmentation process could thus be extended to include reasoning about other types of utterances, as well as to include reasoning about the information contained in those utterances. For example, Balkanski (1993) has shown that multi-action utterances convey a wealth of information about a speaker's beliefs and intentions. That information should also be taken into account in interpreting the agent's utterances.","Step (3b) of the augmentation process deals with the situation in which an agent does not understand, or disagrees with, its collaborative partner's utterances. The recognition of this case is modeled by the failure of the rgraph construction algorithm. This failure indicates that the algorithm was unable to produce an explanation for an act and thus that further communication and replanning are necessary. Our implementation of the algorithm (Lochbaum 1994) models one possible behavior of the agent in such circumstances. In particular, the implementation outputs the recipe it was trying to use to explain the act, along with an explanation for its failure. This information can be viewed as a starting point from which the agents may engage in a negotiation process. The details of that negotiation process are the subject of future research.","As we alluded to earlier in the paper, the process of constructing a SharedPlan may also be used to aid in the generation of utterances. Figure 37 provides a high-level specification of this process. It is based on the assumption that agents G1 and G2 are collaborating on an act a and indicates how the requirements of collaboration constrain the range of information that G1 must consider in formulating his utterances. These requirements are maintained in Gl'S agenda. 27 As indicated in Step (4) of Figure 37, Gl'S agenda indicates those beliefs and intentions that are required for the agents to have a full SharedPlan for a, but that are absent from their current partial SharedPlan.","On the basis of his agenda, G1 chooses an item to which to direct his attention, decides what he wants to say about that item, and then does so (Step (5b) of the process in Figure 37). The question of how the information on Gl'S agenda is organized is the subject of future research. We have not specified the process by which an agent chooses what to communicate from among the possible options, or how it then does so.","Once Gi has communicated some particular information to G2, he waits for her response. If G2 indicates her agreement with G1, either explicitly or implicitly, G1 then updates his beliefs about the agents' PSP to reflect the information he communicated (Step (6)).","The augmentation process given in Figure 37 provides a specification of the generation process at a much higher level of detail than previous work in generation. It 27 We follow Grosz and Kraus's (1993) terminology in our use of this term. 568 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model Assume:"]},{"title":"PSP({Gi, G2}, c~),","paragraphs":["G, is the agent being modeled.

Figure 37 The SharedPlan augmentation process--generation. is concerned with participating in an extended discourse, while most work in generation has been concerned with generating short, isolated monologues. Moore and Paris (1993), however, have begun to look at the problem of participating in longer discourses and in particular at the problem of responding to follow-up questions. They have argued that while previous work in generation (e.g., the work of McKe-own [1985], McCoy [1989], Paris [1988], and Hovy [1991]) has been concerned with"]},{"title":"what","paragraphs":["information to communicate and"]},{"title":"how,","paragraphs":["responding to follow-up questions also requires maintaining a record of"]},{"title":"why","paragraphs":["the information is being communicated. Without i such a representation, the system cannot respond effectively when a hearer does not understand or accept its utterances. It remains to be determined how the process in Figure 37 meshes with previous work in generation. Our suspicion, however, is that as with interpretation, the augmentation process provides a model of discourse-level intentions, while work such as Moore and Paris's (1993) is really providing a model of utterance-level intentions. Both types of information are necessary for generating extended discourses, but serve different purposes. 10.2 Modeling Intentional Structure In our model, SharedPlans and relationships among them provide the basis for computing intentional structure.

It is possible to explain this type of DSP in terms of the Int.To requirement of the FSP definition (Clause (2a) in Figure 5). According to that requirement, each of the single-agent acts in the agents' recipe must be intended by one of the two collaborating agents. This requirement might lead one of the agents, say G1, to engage in a subdialogue to convince the other agent, G2, to adopt such an intention.

The work presented in this paper also contributes to that aspect of SharedPlans. The SharedPlan definitions delineate the information about which collaborating agents must communicate, whether they communicate in a natural language or an artificial one. The model of discourse processing developed in this paper provides a means of processing the agents' communications regardless of the form in which they occur. Rich and Sidner's (1998) work on COLLA-GEN demonstrates the use of the model with an artificial discourse language (Sidner 1994)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was done as part of my dissertation research at Harvard University, and was supported by a Bellcore graduate fellowship and by U S WEST Advanced Technologies.
