Introduction This paper presents a logical formalization of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi, Levy and Takahashi 1975). TAG deals with lexicalized trees and two operations are available: substitution and adjunction. A set of (elementary) trees is associated to each lexical item. TAG is a tree-rewriting system: the derivation process consists in applying operations to trees in order to obtain a (derived) tree whose sequence of leaves is a sentence. Adjunction increases the expressive power of the formalism in such a way that noncontext-free languages can be represented although the parse process is done in polynomial time. Adjunction is generally presented as an insertion of one tree inside another, surrounding the subtree at the adjunction node. This seems to contradict standard logic, but we show (in Section 4) that some logical formalisms, namely a fragment of the Lambek calculus (LC, first introduced by Lambek [1958]), can handle adjunction.","We represent objects and operations of the TAG formalism in four steps: first trees (initial or derived) and the way they are constituted, then the operations (substitution and adjunction), and finally the elementary trees, i.e., the grammar.

The sequent calculus is a restriction of the standard sequent calculus for LC: there are identity axioms (A t- A) and rules for introducing connectives (® at left-hand side, o-- at right-hand side). In LC, / is usually used for o-- and • for ®. We use this notation throughout the paper to relate our formalization to noncommutative linear logic, o-- is the left implication, @ is a noncommutative \"and\" connective. We prove that this restricted calculus is closed under two rules that mimic the grammatical operations. Trees (initial or derived) are then obtained as the closure of the calculus under these two rules. In fact, trees are represented as (provable) sequents in an almost classical way. The right-hand side is the variable labeling the mother node of the tree. The left-hand side is a sequence of formulas of the following kinds: A for some leaf A of the tree, A o-- B1 ® ... ®"]},{"title":"Bn","paragraphs":["where A is the label of some internal node and"]},{"title":"Bi","paragraphs":["are the labels of its daughters, A o- A whenever A is a node where an adjunction can take place. This latter kind of formula can be grammatically interpreted as if such an A was split up into two nodes with the same label linked by some \"soft\" relation. The set of elementary trees of a TAG grammar ~' is then represented as a subset M of the sequents in the closure of the calculus under the two previous rules. We then prove the equivalence between the language generated in TAG by such a grammar G' and the closure under substitution and adjunction of the logical representation M. Note that our interpretation of adjunction is very close to the use of quasi trees described in Vijay-Shanker, (1992).","Besides this equivalence property, we relate parse trees to logical proofs, and to their geometric representation, proofnets. We briefly present proofnets, and the correspondence between proofs and proofnets, and give examples of parse trees viewed as proofnets. This enables a new point of view on the parse process. This process can be interpreted as an assembling of blocks (proofnets corresponding to elementary trees of the grammar), and also as a circulation of information through links relating nodes of the proofnets.","The remainder of the paper is organized in four parts. Section 2 describes the TAG formalism. We recall the terminology and show how substitution and adjunction operate on trees. Section 3 gives a survey of Lambek calculus viewed as a fragment of a noncommutative linear logic. We propose in Section 4 a logical formulation of TAG in a fragment of LC, and prove the correspondence between the two. Section 5 is devoted to the representation of proofs as proofnets; in this final section, we also study implications of this point of view. The proofs of propositions and theorems given in Section 4 are delayed to the appendix for the sake of clarity. 2. Tree Adjoining Grammars The Tree Adjoining Grammar formalism is a tree-generating formalism introduced in Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (1975), linguistically motivated (see, for example, AbeillO et al. [1990] and Kroch and Joshi [1985]), and with formal properties studied in Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) and Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994a, 1994b). A TAG is defined by two finite sets of trees composed by means of the substitution and adjunction operations. I 1 Originally, there was no need for a substitution operation, as initial trees were always rooted at S, thus • labeling a sentence. In the Lexicalized-TAG formalism, this constraint disappears in favor of the substitution operation. Throughout the paper, we will use TAG to refer to the Lexicalized-TAG formalism. 210 Abrusci, Fouquer6, and Vauzeilles Tree Adjoining Grammars Definition A TAG G is a 5-tuple"]},{"title":"(VN, Vv, S,I,A)","paragraphs":["where • VN is a finite set of nonterminal symbols,"]},{"title":"• VT","paragraphs":["is a finite set of terminal symbols, • S is a distinguished nonterminal symbol the start symbol, • I is a set of initial trees, • A is a set of auxiliary trees.","An elementary tree is either an initial tree or an auxiliary tree. Initial as well as auxiliary trees are trees with at least one leaf labeled by a terminal node (the grammar is a so-called lexicalized one).

Each nonterminal node is marked as adjoinable or nonadjoinable (in this case, the node is marked"]},{"title":"NA).","paragraphs":["Each internal node must obviously be labeled by a nonterminal node. 2 A derived tree is either an initial tree or a tree obtained from derived trees by means of the two available operations.","We add two constraints on TAG grammars: a node X cannot have a unique daugh-","X ter labeled X, i.e., -I cannot be part of a tree.

However, our logical representation makes use of a trick based on such trees: we replace nodes marked adjoinable by such partial trees (there is no mark at all in our logical representation). We also suppose that the type of each tree is unambiguous: an initial tree has no leaf with the same label as the root node, an auxiliary tree has only one leaf with the same label as the root node.","To conform with the literature, we will use a' to refer to an initial tree, fl to refer to an auxiliary tree, and \"7 to refer to some derived tree.

The third proof (Figure 6) interprets the Lambek grammar in a derivation style, we only need one implication o- and the connective times ®. The proofs use cuts: they can be withdrawn using the cut elimination theorem, but we think the cuts help in understanding the process.

We hope this will help readers to understand the overall framework. 4. The Calculus ,,4 (A Fragment of LC) The formalization of TAG in LC relies mainly on a logical presentation of the two operations substitution and adjunction, together with a correspondence between proofs and trees. As already shown in the previous section, the substitution operation is nothing but the application of the cut rule restricted to atomic formulas, which we call the atomic cut rule. Interpreting the adjunction operation is really the main difficulty. The adjunction results from two atomic cut rules between the sequent corresponding to the adjunction tree and two suitable sequents corresponding to two subparts of the 213 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2","A e A (axiom) PeA F1,A, F2 e B (cut) F1,F, F2 e B PeA AeB (r-®) F, AeA®B F1,A,B, F2 e C rl,A, r2ec AeB (l-o-)"]},{"title":"~:Ao-B,A, F2eC","paragraphs":["P, Be A (r-o--) FeAo-B"]},{"title":"F1,A, F2eC Ae B (l--o)","paragraphs":["P1,A,B --o A, F2 e c B,FeA (r- -o) Fe B-oA Figure 3 Language and sequent calculus for the Lambek calculus.

In this section, we clarify the calculus A used to interpret TAG: it includes a cut rule and an adjunction rule that mimic the grammatical operations. As pointed out previously, these two rules are correct with respect to logic. We give the basic properties satisfied by this calculus A. In order to represent TAG in LC, we first construct the set ~ of subtrees of depth I of trees appearing in a TAG grammar G'. The TAG grammar G r is then a subset of the closure T(~) of the set ~ under substitution (indicated by subst) and the declaration of nodes where adjunction is not available (indicated by NA). The interpretation of elements of G as provable sequents of A is straightforward. This leads to a calculus A(~) where the operations are restricted with respect to ~. The TAG grammar ~r is then in correspondence with a subset M(~ ~) of A(G) and we prove the equivalence between the language CL(G') generated by G' and the set of sequents CL(M(~')) obtained by closure on M(G') by the cut and adjunction rules (we use M instead of M(G') whenever there is no ambiguity). Proofs of propositions are delayed to the appendix.

Basically, a sequent I ~ F- a (in the previous language) is the logical equivalent of a tree with root a, and there is exactly one formula in I ~ for each leaf, for each subtree (of depth 1), for each adjunction node, and nothing else. SeqO (respectively, Tree()) associates a sequent (respectively, a tree) to each tree (respectivel3¢ each sequent), and we prove the two are converse. The last three propositions are properties concerning the logical counterpart of a TAG grammar. The last one is in fact the most important: the closure under (logical) adjunction and substitution of the set of sequents corresponding to a set of elementary trees is exactly the set of sequents corresponding to the closure under (grammatical) adjunction and substitution of this set of elementary trees.

The language accepted by M(~ ~) is then the set of sequences of words in the same order as they appear in the previous sequents. 5. TAG Analysis Using Noncommutative Proofnets A proof in sequent calculus contains many useless properties in its contexts. Girard (1987) has defined, in a purely geometric way, a class of graphs of formulas, called 219 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2 proofnets: for each proof of a sequent t- F in the one-sided sequent calculus for multiplicative linear logic, there is a corresponding proofnet whose conclusions are exactly the formulas in F, and for each proofnet, there is at least one corresponding proof of the sequent t- F in the one-sided sequent calculus for multiplicative linear logic (where P is a sequence of all the conclusions of the proofnet). Similarly, Abrusci (1991) defined in a purely geometric way a class of graphs, called noncommutative proofnets, relative to multiplicative noncommutative linear logic. Roorda (1992) also described proofnets for Lambek calculus. Other criteria exist by now for characterizing proofnets for commutative or noncommutative, intuitionistic or nonintuitionistic linear logic. We present here Abrusci's criteria. 5.1 Noncommutative Proofnets Proofnets are defined on one-sided sequent calculi. Presentations of the one-sided sequent calculus, and of proofnets are given in the appendix. Let us recall that ~ is the \"or\" connective associated to ® (the \"and\" connective), such that A --o B = A±~gB. To every proof 7r of a sequent F- F in the one-sided sequent calculus for multiplicative noncommutative linear logic, we can associate (by induction on the construction of the proof zr) a noncommutative proofnet with conclusions P, i.e., an oriented planar graph 7r' of occurrencies of formulas such that: • The conclusions of 7r' are exactly the formulas in F.","• ~r' is a noncommutative proof structure, i.e., it is constructed by means of the following links3: -- Axiom-link (two conclusions, no premise) -- Cut-link (two premises, no conclusion) @-link (two premises, one conclusion)"]},{"title":"Av-7","paragraphs":["A A ±"]},{"title":"I i","paragraphs":["A B"]},{"title":"V","paragraphs":["A®B A B"]},{"title":"V","paragraphs":["-- ~?-link (two premises, one conclusion) A ~ B and every occurrence of formula is a premise of at most one link and is a conclusion of exactly one link.

A trip is a sequence of nodes, going from one node to another according to the graph and to a switch for each Q-link and each =?-link, in a bideterministic way: the traversal of nodes is done according to Figure 8. Every assignment for 7r' is total: two integer variables are associated to each label (one for each \"side\" of the variable). Constraints are imposed on variables with respect to how trips are done throughout the net. The assignment is total if the set of constraints has a solution. 3 The W-link is graphically distinguished from the @-link.

The aim of this section is to show the strong connection between the structure of proofs of sequents and a standard TAG derived structure. Moreover, it emphasizes the interest of a proofnet approach as the syntax (and parsing process) is concretely designed as a logical manipulation of logical structures. In the next section, we develop this approach and show how lexical rules can be integrated into it. Finally, we briefly mention that this can also give a logical formalization of D-trees (Vijay-Shanker 1992).","The first example requires only substitution, i.e., the cut rule in the logical point of view. We first give the sequents (provable in .4) associated to the lexical items. Their meanings are straightforward, e.g., \"John and Mary are noun phrases (NP)\" or \"saw requires a complement NP to obtain a verb phrase (VP) and a subject NP to obtain a sentence (S).\" Note that VP is an adjunction node so the sequent associated to the item saw includes the formula VP o-- VP. The next example uses this specification.

The two sequent proofs given in Figure 9 are the only two possibilities for this sentence in the fragment A(G). This pinpoints the fact that the order in which the cuts are done is not significant with respect to the derived structure. Proofnets allow the expression of this equivalence. Hence the two proofs have the same associated proofnet, given in Figure 10. For the sake of clarity, the cut rules are bold lines, and subnets associated to lexical items are circled. Obviously, if we delete the two cut lines, we are left with three proofnets referring to (provable) sequents. The proofnet in Figure 10 still contains some superfluous information, namely, nodes that cannot be targeted by the only available operations in A(G)--the cut rule and the adjunction rule on a propositional variable. In fact, we only need to keep nodes (i) that refer to conclusions of the proofnet that are propositional variables or negation of propositional variables (a cut can be done on such a literal), and (ii) that belong to subgraphs of the following form (corresponding to the existence of a formula A o- A in the left part of a sequent, i.e., its negation A @ A ± in the one-sided associated sequent): \"7 F-- A A ±"]},{"title":"V","paragraphs":["ANA ± We can then simplify the graph and replace the internal logical machinery by black boxes (shown in the figures as solid black circles). The conclusions of each basic proofnet are labeled: outputs (i.e., conclusions that are propositional variables) are drawn as closed half circles, inputs (i.e., conclusions that are the negation of propositional variables) are drawn as open half circles. Plain lines link black boxes to black boxes or conclusions, and subgraphs corresponding to adjunction points are drawn as dashed lines. The previous proofnet is then redrawn as in Figure 11. We obviously find the derived tree (neglecting some minor differences). The logical proofnet can then be seen as an \"explanation\" of the structure of the tree, that is to say the operations available on the tree are the result of some focus of what can be done on the proofnet. On the one hand, the use of black boxes is necessary to clarify the structure of the analysis; on the other hang this hides proof details that can be useful for some linguistic operations (as is the case for adjunction with respect to the classical structure of a derived tree). We show in the next subsection another application of such a (logical) refinement.","The last example discussed in this section is the analysis of the sentence John saw Mary today.

Among these, we find rules for passivization, interrogative forms or wh-sentences. We focus here on one example (namely who) to show to what extent the previous paradigm can be used also to logically interpret these lexical rules. We expect this will help in understanding the underlying mechanisms. The formulation we propose is the simplest one. This is also closely related to the approach used in categorial grammars (the raising rule is simply the introduction of an implication; see also Joshi and Kulick [1995] for such a relation and the way who can be defined). Figures 15, 16, and 17 present proofnets and simplified proofnets for the two noun adjuncts who John meets and who meets John. The analysis of complete sentences includ-ing these adjuncts is then similar to the process developed in the previous section. The corresponding (provable) sequents are given below. The basic lexical descriptions are the following (we have deleted the adjunction declarations for sake of clarity; the (logical) adjunction rule has to be slightly extended in order to take care of these new structures): John NP o- John, John t- NP meets S o-- NP ® VP, NP, VP o-- V ® NP, V o-- meets, meets, NP k S who N o-- N ® who @ (S o-- NP), N, who, S o-- NP t- N Let M(~) denote the set of the three previous sequents.

In other words, we should consider the construction of the language in two steps. The first step is the construction of the lexicon (a TAG grammar) from a basic set of descriptions using complex rules. The second step is the closure of the TAG grammar with the cut and adjunction rules. This point of view needs to be further developed but could be a first approach to a complete integration of lexicon and grammar. 225 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 2 NP John meets VP NP~ VP_ meets i NP John Figure 17 Simplified proofs for who John meets and who meets John. 6. Conclusion The use of logic as a framework to describe natural language is not a new idea. Works on Lambek calculus and logic programming are famous examples. However, linguistic formalisms have fundamentally evolved in the past two decades. Though theoretical research has been done on unification and attribute-value structures, operations on syntactic trees have been investigated mainly by comparing different solutions (Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1994a, 1994b). In this paper, we consider another way to look at these operations. We focus on the adjunction operation available in Tree Adjoining Grammars, as it seems to be the simplest way to augment the expressive power of a formalism. We prove that noncommutative intuitionistic linear logic is a good framework and we define a fragment equivalent to TAG. We show, furthermore, to what extent geometric representations of proofs (proofnets) may be useful in understanding how black boxes (i.e., relations between nodes in a syntactic tree) help simplify a parse but also hide interesting mechanisms. There is still a lot to do in this direction. For one thing, generalized categorial grammars also have to be logically investigated, the objective being to relate GCG operations to logical operations (completed if necessary). The preceding discussions also show the relationship between our point of view and the idea of quasi trees developed by Vijay-Shanker (1992). He proposes to consider partial descriptions of trees, i.e., adjunction nodes represented by means of loose relations whose meaning is a domination relation. In this case, the adjunction operation is identified by a pair of substitution operations. The strong relation with what precedes is clean However, in order to take into account exactly this presentation, the axiom of identity A t- A, where A is a propositional variable, must be added to the calculus ,4(G) given in Section 4. In this way, adjunction nodes can be deleted from sequents. In this new calculus, the following rule is satisfied:","AF-A F, Ao--A, At-B F, A t- B (adjunction) 226 Abrusci, Fouquer6, and Vauzeilles Tree Adjoining Grammars Hence, we obtain the following equivalence:"]},{"title":"Proposition","paragraphs":["A parse tree is"]},{"title":"correct","paragraphs":["iff the two nodes in a domination relation have the same label","iff there is a proof whose conclusions that are propositional variables are the words of the sentence in the same order, and without any formula of the form A o- A."]},{"title":"Appendix A.1 A Brief Description of Noncommutative Linear Logic","paragraphs":["Linear logic was introduced by Girard (1987) as a \"resource conscious logic.\" In other words, though classical logic deals with static descriptions, linear logic considers propositions as finite resources. Hence, while \"A\" and \"A"]},{"title":"and A\"","paragraphs":["are equivalent in classical logic, this is (generally) not the case in linear logic. The easiest technical way to investigate this difference is to consider the Gentzen sequent calculus for these logics. A sequent is of the form F F- A where F and A stand for sequences of formulas well-formed with respect to the language of the logic. It expresses the fact that the (multiplicafive) disjunction of formulas in A is a consequence of the (multiplicative) conjunction of formulas in F. Remember that a sequent calculus is a set of rules specifying the provable sequents, given a set of axioms. A proof of a sequent is then the successive application of sequent rules beginning with axioms, i.e., a tree with the proved sequent as the root of the tree (at the bottom) and whose leaves are axioms (on top). Besides axioms and rules introducing connectives at the right or left part of a sequent, we find structural rules that govern the structure of a sequent. In classical logic, the set of structural rules consists in weakening, contraction, and exchange (see Figure 18 where A, B are formulas, F, F', A, A ~ are sequences of formulas). Weaken-ing and contraction allow the arbitrary copying of formulas: having a formula A as a hypothesis or conclusion is equivalent to having it twice (or more). This point of view contradicts the notion of resource, hence these two structural rules are omitted in linear logic. However special connectives, namely the"]},{"title":"exponentials of-course","paragraphs":["\"!\" and"]},{"title":"why-not","paragraphs":["\"?\" have these properties. The exchange rule is responsible for commutativity of the comma (in the right side and in the left side): the order of hypotheses or conclusions does not matter. This rule is no longer valid in the noncommutative version of linear logic.","However, and this is already true in linear logic, the logical interpretation of \"and\" and \"or\" is not as simple as it is in classical logic. We need to distinguish two \"and\" (® meaning 'times' and & meaning 'with') and two \"or\" (~ meaning 'par' and ® meaning 'plus'), hence inducing four constants: 1, T, 3_, 0 (respective neutral elements for the previous connectives). In fact, connectives are related in such a way that they form two groups: the mulfiplicafive group (®, ~, 1, ±) and the additive group (&, ®, T, 0). Hereafter, we use only the multiplicafive group. There are obviously fundamental reasons for this proliferation but these explanations are outside the scope of this paper. Negation and implication are however of special interest. In (commutative) linear logic, there is only one negation • ± and one (linear) implication -o. In the noncommutafive case, negation and implication have to be split: there is pre- ±. and post- negation .± and pre- o- and post- implication --o. These two implications have to be related with two operations in Lambek calculus: -o with \\ and o-- with/.
