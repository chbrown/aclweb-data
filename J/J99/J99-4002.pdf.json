Examination of the full range of rules proposed shows that Carpenter's (1991) postulated upper bound on the length of list-valued attributes such as SUBCAT in the lexicon cannot be maintained, leading to unrestricted generative capacity in constraint-based formalisms utilizing HPSG-style lexical rules. We argue that it is preferable to subdivide such rules into a class of semiproductive lexically governed genuinely lexical rules, and a class of fully productive unary syntactic rules.","We develop a restricted approach to lexical rules in a typed default feature structure (TDFS) framework (Lascarides et al. 1995; Lascarides and Copestake 1999), which has enough expressivity to state, for example, rules of verb diathesis alternation, but which does not allow arbitrary manipulation of list-valued features. An interpretation of such lexical rules within a probabilistic version of a TDFS-based linguistic (lexical and grammatical) theory allows us to capture the semiproductive nature of genuinely lexical rules, steering an intermediate course between fully generative or purely abbreviatory rules.","We illustrate the utility of this approach with a treatment of dative constructions within a linguistic framework that borrows insights from the constraint-based theories: HPSG, UCG, (Zeevat, Klein, and Calder 1987) and construction grammar (Goldberg 1995). We end by outlin-ing how our approach to lexical rules allows for a treatment of passive and recursive affixation, which are generally assumed to require unrestricted list manipulation operations. 1. Introduction In lexicalist approaches to grammar, lexical rules are a crucial component of the overall theory and more and more generalizations have come to be stated within them. For example, in the development of HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987, 1994) from GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985) several syntactic metarules concerning the location of empty categories in unbounded dependency constructions are restated as lexical rules. One example is the Subject Extraction rule, which licenses subject extractions from sentential complements. Inflectional morphological rules, such as Plural Formation, and rules of verb alternation, such as Passive, are also stated as lexical rules by Pollard and Sag. Recently, Bouma and van Noord (1994) have proposed a lexical rule of Adjunct Introduction, which can recursively add adverbial categories to the SUBCAT list of a verbal category. There are three main problems with the treatment of lexical, or what might be better termed unary, rules as a homogeneous class. * Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QG, UK.

E-mail: aac@csli.stanford.edu (~) 1999 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","Firstly, Carpenter (1991) demonstrates that if lexical rules are able to perform arbitrary manipulations (deletion, addition, and permutation) of potentially unbounded lists, any recursively enumerable language can be generated, even if the nonderived lexicon and grammar only generate context-free languages. However, once we are committed to treating rules such as Passive and Adjunct Introduction in a homogeneous way, restrictions that prevent lexical rules from increasing generative capacity, such as constraining the use of category variables, bounding the length of the suB-CAT list, or limiting recursive application, cannot be imposed. Subdividing lexical and unary syntactic rules allows such restrictions to be naturally maintained in the lexicon.","Secondly, within theories like HPSG, which utilize constraint logics over (typed) feature structures ((T)FSs) as the lexical and grammatical representation language, the formal status of lexical rules is unclear. They do not have a straightforward interpretation as logical constraints and are normally treated as metalevel conditional generalizations concerning the set of admissible lexical entries. This leads to immediate disadvantages, such as nondeclarativity, potential nontermination in application, and the need for the grammar writer to specify what stays unchanged as well as what changes in a derived entry. Our approach to lexical rules improves this situation by formalizing them in terms of default unification utilizing existing operations in the typed default feature structure (TDFS) representation language (Lascarides et al. 1995; Lascarides and Copestake 1999).","Thirdly, most lexical, though not unary, rules are semiproductive. In HPSG, lexical rules are interpreted as generative rules encoding putatively exceptionless conditional generalizations concerning the existence of derived lexical entries. Exceptions and irregularities must be marked explicitly in lexical entries. While this approach is defensible for rules of inflectional morphology, generalizations about unbounded dependency constructions and adjunct introduction, it is less plausible when we come to consider morphological rules of derivation or most verb diathesis alternations. These latter are semiproductive; that is, subject to blocking (preemption by synonymy or by lexical form), to arbitrary lexical gaps, and to varying degrees of conventionalization (see Jackendoff [1997a] for a recent discussion). It is technically possible to reinterpret (some) lexical rules as (lexical) redundancy rules using constraint-based techniques (e.g., Sanfilippo 1993). However, this approach reduces lexical rules to a purely abbreviatory device even more thoroughly than Jackendoff's (1975) original proposal. We will argue in Section 7 that the pure redundancy rule interpretation is not optimal, even for semiproductive lexical rules, as such rules are utilized in the production and interpretation of nonce usages and neologisms.","Throughout the paper, we assume a linguistic framework based on typed feature structures like HPSG, but allowing for defeasible specification in typed default feature structures (e.g., Lascarides et al. 1995). We distinguish between lexical rules and other unary rules and present an account of lexical rules compatible with this framework and, potentially, with other constraint-based (T)FS frameworks. We argue that this account satisfactorily addresses the issues of generative power, formal interpretation, and semiproductivity. In Section 2 we discuss the use and interpretation of HPSG-style lexical rules in more detail. In Section 3 we present the TDFS framework for lexical and grammatical representation, which extends monotonic theories of lexical organization with default inheritance and defeasible specification. In Section 4, we formalize lexical rules in terms of default unification and demonstrate that this leads to a more restricted operation fully defined in terms of the nonmonotonic conditional logic of TDFSs. In Section 5 we show that, despite this restricted capacity, a linguistically insightful account of English dative constructions can be formulated, which treats them as (mostly) deri, ed by lexical rule. This draws on insights from Dowty's (1989) theory 488 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules base PHON: [] 3RDSNG : [] SYN: fLOC: [SUBCAT: []]] ~-~ SEM CONT : [] ] Figure 1 HPSG Third Singular Verb Formation lexical rule. 3rdsng PHON: f3rdsng( [].

In Section 6 we argue that the dative alternation is a semiproductive process in English not fully reducible to an abbreviatory convention, and provide an account of lexical rule application within a probabilistic version of the TDFS framework that captures the variable acceptability of different verbs in the dative construction. Thus, we modify and extend the analysis of dative in Lascarides et al. (1995) by providing a more adequate and restrictive formalization of this type of semiproductive lexical rule. In Section 7 we consider the extent to which our approach to lexical rules will generalize to other types of putatively lexical processes. 2. Lexical Rules in HPSG Lexical rules in HPSG are interpreted as conditional relationships between lexical entries represented as constraints on TFSs (e.g., Pollard and Sag 1994, p. 395, n. 1). Since lexical entries themselves are FS descriptions, not FSs per se, this interpretation makes lexical rules metalevel statements in an informally defined language. For example, the lexical rule for Third Singular Verb Formation (Pollard and Sag 1987, 210-213) is given in Figure 1. In this notation, coindexation must be interpreted as a copying operator and not as a specification of reentrancy within a single TFS description, and the description language must be extended with a conditional implication operator relating FSs. A linguistic infelicity of this notation is that it requires explicit specification of what is unchanged under lexical rule application as well as of the changes to the derived entry. The informal interpretation of such a rule is that for lexical entries that unify with the antecedent description, a derived entry can be created by copying elements as specified into the consequent description. However, in the HPSG literature, these explicit copying statements are often left unstated, with the notation being interpreted to mean that features that are omitted have their values copied over, giving the notation shown in Figure 2.","A number of modifications of this original proposal within the HPSG framework have been proposed. Copestake and Briscoe (1992) and Copestake (1992) represent lexical rules as TFSs containing 1 and 0 attributes representing input and output descriptions of the lexical rule, respectively. This enables lexical rules to be encoded in a type hierarchy and for relationships between rules to be expressed via type inheritance. The interpretation of lexical rules is analogous to that of grammar rules (e.g., Shieber 1992), and such rules can be thought of as equivalent to unary grammar rules. 489 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 3rdsng-lr IN:"]},{"title":"[base] [ 3rdsn~: ]","paragraphs":["OUT : | PHOI~ :f3rdsng( [], [])","[ 3RDSNG: [] Figure 3 Reformulated Third Singular Verb Formation lexical rule. Calcagno (1995) develops an algorithm for improving the notation for lexical rules by eliminating the need to specify what is copied from input to output. Meurers (1995) also develops a similar algorithm but, although he augments the description language to allow lexical rules to be written in this abbreviated notation, he interprets the result as a relational constraint on lexical entries. 1 Thus, in Meurers' notation, the rule in Figure 1 would be written without coindexation as a TFS using IN/OUT attributes as in Figure 3, and appropriate coindexation would be algorithmically generated from both the rule specification and the type system to recover an expanded rule effectively equivalent to that in Figure 1 (though the entire values of SYN and SEM would be carried over). In Meurers' formulation the coindexation generated is interpreted as genuine reentrancy since the lexicon is defined utilizing \"junk slot\" encoding (Ait-Kaci 1984) of the set of possible words, as shown below: word --* L1 V .-- V Ln V [] STORE : < [OUT : []] > This constraint states that a word must be subsumed by one of the basic descriptions or by a description derived via one or more lexical rule applications (i.e., any description tagged [] ). This latter step integrates the interpretation of lexical rules into the underlying constraint logic of TFS descriptions by structure sharing information between descriptions of basic and derived lexical entries.","In view of the unrestricted generative power of conventional HPSG-style lexical rules (Carpenter 1991), naive generative application of recursive or cyclic rules can lead to nontermination during parsing. Bouma and van Noord (1994) and Johnson and Dorre (1995) propose techniques for delayed evaluation of lexical rules so that they apply \"on demand\" at parse time. Meurers and Minnen (1997) present a computational framework for efficient application of Meurers' (1995) formalization of lexical rules. In their covariation approach, a finite-state machine for the application of lexical rules is derived by computing possible \"follow\" relations between the set of rules. Next, pruned finite-state machines are associated with classes of actual lexical entries representing the restricted set of rules that can apply to those entries. Finally, entries themselves are extended with information common to all their derived variants. These techniques achieve most of the advantages of lexicon expansion in the face of recursive rules and cyclic rule interactions that preclude a full off-line expansion.","Since their inception, the productivity of some types of lexical rule has been an issue (e.g., Jackendoff 1975). Given the interpretations discussed above, lexical rules predict that derived entries will exist without exception for any basic entry subsumed by a lexical rule input description. Pollard and Sag (1987, 210f.) treat the blocking of regular rules of morphological affixation by making the application of affixation 1 Riehemann (1993) was the first to propose this interpretation of lexical rules, though she chose to represent them directly in the type inheritance hierarchy. 490 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules functions sensitive to specification of irregular affixes in base entries.

This conception of lexical rules has been utilized in a constraint-based framework by Sanfilippo (1993) who adds a list-valued attribute to the input description of a lexical rule that encodes the name of the lexical rule, so that the rule input specification will only unify with lexical entries that also specify the rule name as a member of this list-valued attribute. We illustrate this approach in slightly modified form with respect to the causative-inchoative verb alternation in Figure 4. 2 The effect is that a verb will explicitly specify the alternations that apply to it, as values for the feature ALTS, out of a set of alternations that are possible for its type, and that lexical rules may only be applied when the lexical sign has the appropriate value for that alternation instantiated.","In Sanfilippo's approach, a constraint-based encoding of categorial grammar (e.g., Zeevat, Klein, and Calder 1987) is combined with Dowty's proto thematic role theory and proto-roles are interpreted as predicates holding between event and participant variables in a neo-Davidsonian semantic representation.

The generative power of lexical rules places no limit on possible variations in derived words. A more restricted lexical rule formalism would encourage finer-grained distinctions between rule classes and development of substantive criteria for characterizing a rule as lexical (as opposed to unary syntactic). It would also allow an interpretation of lexical rules more consonant with constraint-based frameworks. Neither the interpretation of lexical rules as fully generative nor as purely abbreviatory is adequate. Although many lexical rules are subject to exceptions, gaps, and variable degrees of conventionalization, most are semiproductive because they play a role in the production and interpretation of nonce usage, errors, and neologisms. 3. The Typed Default Feature Structure Formalism Our alternative approach to lexical rules assumes the use of typed default feature structures as the basic data structure. The TDFS formalism extends typed feature structure formalisms, such as those described in Carpenter (1992) or King (1994), by allowing for structures that include default information. These are combined by typed (persistent) default unification. In most previous accounts (see, for example, Bouma [1992], Carpenter [1993], Copestake [1993], and Russell et al. [1993]), default unification is an asymmetric operation that combines two ordinary (T)FSs, one of which is treated 492 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules as default and one nondefault, to produce a normal TFS. In contrast, TDFSs mark default information explicitly within each structure, and are combined with a symmetric operation, which retains the information about the defeasibility of particular pieces of information. There are two advantages of the TDFS framework over previous approaches that are important for our treatment of lexical rules: . . Unlike asymmetric default unification, the unification operation on TDFSs is order-independent. Thus inheritance hierarchies may be defined in which some inherited information may be overridden by more specific information, without the results being dependent on evaluation order. Structures can be represented as having persistent defaults: in particular, parts of the semantics of lexical signs can be marked as defeasible, in a way that allows the information to be overridden either by sentential or discourse context.","Lascarides et al. (1995) provide an initial formalization of the TDFS framework, Lascarides and Copestake (1999: henceforth L&C) describe the version of default unification assumed in the informal outline of the TDFS formalism that follows."]},{"title":"3.1 Asymmetric Default Unification","paragraphs":["In L&C, a symmetric unification operation on TDFSs is defined in terms of an asymmetric default unification operation, so we begin by describing the latter operation. We will also use a variant of this operation in our formalization of lexical rules in Section 4. Carpenter (1993) gives an elegant definition of asymmetric default unification of untyped feature structures in terms of maximal incorporation of information. Because of conflicts in defaults, this may give rise to multiple extensions. There are two alternative approaches to this: the operation can either return all extensions as a disjunction or return their generalization. This gives unification-based analogues of credulous and skeptical default logics.

Any FS can be described in terms of the set of atomic FSs that are strictly more general than itself. Carpenter's definition of default unification can thus be understood in terms of incorporation of maximal subsets of the set of atomic FSs into which the default FS can be decomposed. 3.2 Well-formedness Constraints < < Because Rs and ~c are ultimately defined in terms of monotonic subsumption, we can create variant definitions corresponding to variant notions of subsumption. This is particularly relevant when we come to consider typed rather than untyped FSs. We can consider the subsumption ordering on well-formed typed feature structures, where well-formed TFSs are a subset of TFSs in general. There are a variety of proposals for well-formedness conditions for typed FSs: here we assume conditions on appropriate features based on Carpenter (1992). We will not give these in detail here, but briefly, we assume that every type, t, has a set of appropriate features associated with it, AppFeat(t). For a TFS F to be well-formed, every node, q, in the structure must have an associated type, t, and the features labeling the edges that come out of the node q directly must be equal to AppFeat(t). For example, if the type ne-list has the appropriate features HD and TL, and has no subtypes, then the FS [SYN: intrans] will not unify with an FS of type ne-list.","So, assume ~t indicates the partial order in the collection of well-formed TFSs, and ~t indicates the corresponding greatest lower bound, and so on.

This is done by making a TDFS be a dual structure, of which the first component is a standard TFS indicating nondefault information and the second is a structure known as a tail. A tail is a set 494 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules of pairs, each consisting of an atomic FS and a type that indicates specificity. Atomic FSs associated with more specific types in the tail will be preferred over those associated with more general types in the case of conflict. As L&C discuss in detail, if we want to maintain associativity of default unification (in order to guarantee order-independence) we must maintain some of the unification \"history.\" The tail does this and may thus include conflicting elements that were introduced by different TDFSs.

Firstly, the organization of the lexicon can be extended naturally to allow for default inheritance networks of constraints. Default inheritance has been widely exploited in lexical descriptions both within and outside the TFS framework (e.g., Daelemans, de Smedt, and Gazdar 1992). However, the TDFS approach extends formalized and implemented proposals for default inheritance, such as DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1989, 1996) or any version based on asymmetric unification, in that the lexicon now consists of a set of TDFSs, as opposed to a set of (T)FSs; that is, it permits default specification to persist \"beyond the lexicon\" for exploitation during syntactic, semantic, or discourse level operations. This is the most significant property of the TDFS framework for our use of lexical rules, so we will give a simple example of its potential utility.","Figure 6 gives a possible lexical entry for climb that exploits persistent default specification to capture the defeasible nature of aspects of the meaning of this verb. In this sense and pattern of realizations, climb can combine with a locative PP specifying the goal and/or directional path of movement. By default, the directional path is specified to be upwards. The preposition heading the PP may strengthen, override, or leave default this specification, as illustrated in (3). (3) a. John climbed up the shaft b. John climbed along the shaft c. John climbed around the shaft d. John climbed through the shaft e. John climbed down the shaft In addition, lexical rules that create an intransitive form of the verb by removing the requirement for the PP arguments must leave the default direction specification unmodified, and in all cases the lexically specified default remains defeasible during discourse processing in a context with which it is inconsistent, as illustrated in (4).","(4) a.

John climbed through the shaft entering from the first inspection hatch and exiting via the second. 3 Note, however, that although L&C conjecture that DefFS is worst-case exponential, Malouf (1999) has developed an algorithm that is efficient even for cases where the tail is large in proportion to the indefeasible structure and where complex reentrancies are involved. Malouf's results so far suggest that practical complexity varies from linear to quadratic, and that, overall, recoding a monotonic system to use defaults can improve performance, chiefly because it reduces the complexity of the type hierarchy. 497 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 I transitive- -verb PHON: chPmPb | ....

Copestake and Briscoe (1995) argue at some length for this position, and Lascarides and Copestake (1995) and Lascarides et al. (1995) show how lexical defaults interact appropriately with nonmonotonic discourse reasoning within the formal framework of DICE (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993). 4. Lexical Rules in the TDFS Formalism Lexical rules differ from (default) inheritance in several ways. Firstly, a lexical rule relates lexical entries whose types are unordered, and secondly, such rules often apply recursively. Nevertheless, there are similarities between default unification and the process of creating a new lexical entry, conditionally, given the presence of another entry satisfying certain properties. In particular, asymmetric default unification presents itself as a way of implementing the requirement that information should carry over from input to output description in a lexical rule, provided that it is consistent with the output type and any further constraints specified in the rule. Furthermore, if we wish to express lexical rules in terms of the TDFS formalism outlined in Section 3, it makes sense to explore the utility of the nonmonotonic component developed.","Asymmetric default unification can provide the foundation for the carrying over of consistent information between input and output descriptions in lexical rules. For example, the second formulation of the rule of Third Singular Verb Formation (without coindexation) given in Section 2 can be reinterpreted as an application of asymmetric default unification, as illustrated in Figure 7 (an explicit encoding of function application has been introduced for clarity). Under this new interpretation of the notation (and assuming for the moment that the structures have empty tails), if the input description subsumes a lexical structure, then the result is given by asymmetrically default unifying the lexical structure with the output description. The effect is that information in the input that is inconsistent with the output description is lost, whether because it conflicts with a path specification or because the path itself is inconsistent with the output type. On the other hand, conflicting or new information in the output specification survives. The typed variant of Carpenter's definition of asymmetric default unification that was presented in Section 3.2 will support this approach to lexical rules. 4.1 The Definition of a TDFS Lexical Rule All lexical rules are of the following form, where"]},{"title":"Ia/Ta","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Ib/Tb","paragraphs":["are TDFSs:"]},{"title":"Z,/T, IdTb","paragraphs":["498 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules Applied to:"]},{"title":"r 3rdsg ]","paragraphs":["3RDSNG[A~GS:<T.[]> ] FUNCTION •"]},{"title":"f3rdsng [base ]","paragraphs":["~+ PHON:"]},{"title":"base ]","paragraphs":["PHON r FUNCTION : ] 3RDSN:G[ ARGS : <"]},{"title":"walk","paragraphs":["> ] SYN LOC:SUBCAT : < NP > is equivalent to:"]},{"title":"r 3rdsg ] F base 1","paragraphs":["FUNCTION :","FUNCTION f3rdsng /PHON: [ARGS:<walk>] PHON :","] [ARGS : < T.[] > ] ~t |3RDSNG:","L 3RDSNG : [] L SYN LOC SUBCAT : < NP >"]},{"title":"3rdsg","paragraphs":["[ FUNCTION:"]},{"title":"f3rdsng ] = PHON: ARGS:<walk,[]>","paragraphs":["] 3RDSNG, [] SYN LOC SUBCAT : < NP >"]},{"title":"Figure","paragraphs":["7 Reinterpreted Third Singular Verb Formation lexical rule.","The interpretation of the rule is as follows: Given a lexeme, 11/I\"1, where I1 u Ia, then","the result of applying the lexical rule is a TDFS, Io/To, such that:","<","1.

This is intended to apply to a range of semantic subclasses and the specific semantic class should be retained after application of the lexical rule: for example, if the input is a movement verb then the result should also be a movement verb. If semantic subclasses cross-classify with types such as trans-verb and intrans-verb, this could be implemented using multiple inheritance: i.e., the type intrans-movt-verb would inherit from intrans-verb and movt-verb, and the type trans-caus-movt-verb would inherit from trans-caus-verb and movt-verb as shown in Figure 8. Assume we apply the rule in (5) to a lexeme of type intrans-movt-verb. If the asymmetric default unification operation used in the definition of lexical rules did not consider the supertypes of this type, the application of the rule would give an output of type trans-verb, because the value of the type on the input is incompatible with trans-verb. However, if we take account of all the supertypes of the type that are compatible with the output, the result is the desired one: trans-caus-movt-verb. This is illustrated in Figure 9. 4.3 Reversibility and Backformation Given the arguments in Lascarides et al. (1995) about the desirability of the symmetric form of default unification on the grounds of order-independence, it may seem surpris-ing to suggest that an order-dependent operation be the basis for the formalization of lexical rules. But it is clear that lexical rule application must be order-dependent, for example to distinguish truthfulness from *truthnessful. However, bidirectionality and reversibility are required in order to model both analysis and generation, and also to deal with backformafion. In fact, although conventional HPSG-style lexical rules appear to be straightforwardly interpretable as bidirectional, there is no guarantee that any given input can be recovered from knowledge of the rule and of its output, unless all the information in the input is copied over to the output. The most that can be said is that by reversing the rule a result will be obtained that is unifiable with the original input. Of course, lexical rules could be written in such a way that all information about the input can be recovered, by copying all the information over (for example to a DTR-style attribute in the output).","Reversibility of TDFS lexical rules is defined somewhat differently. Given a rule FS1 ~ FS2, and an input I that results in output O, we can recover 11 defined as the unification of FS1 with F, the most general FS such that F FS2 ~- O.

Thus I _U 11, that is, we can guarantee that the result of the \"reverse\" application subsumes or is equal to the input (which is actually a stronger result than we obtain for conventional lexical rules).

The cost of the fully monotonic version of lexical rules is that the complete history of rule application has to be accessible, either explicitly, as with Riehemann's approach, or implicitly (e.g., via junk slots). However, our current approach does mean that some potential applications of lexical rules are precluded, which we discuss further in Section 7.","In contrast with Meurer's notation, it is not possible to straightforwardly compile out our lexical rules into equivalent rules that do not use defaults, even when TFSs rather than TDFSs are considered. Consider the abstract example shown in Figure 10. To state this using conventional lexical rules would be extremely complex, since it would require a whole series of rules to deal with the possible values of F, each with negative conditions to prevent them applying incorrectly. Contrast this to Meurer's approach, where all inputs would give a result where F had the value a. Essentially the difference is that whereas our approach can be paraphrased as \"transfer all information for a feature F that does not conflict with information on the output,\" Meurer's deftnition can be paraphrased \"transfer all values for a feature F unless any information is stated about F.\" The example shown in Figure 9 illustrates one case for which our approach leads to desirable results. Another example arises when inflection is implemented using lexical rules, as with the example of the Third Singular Verb Formation rule (Figure 7). With conventional lexical rules it is impossible to carry over information about the type of the input to the output (unless the rule is totally monotonic in operation, in which case it is equivalent to the use of simple subsumption-based inheritance). Therefore lexical types cannot persist after inflectional rules are applied, unless the rule is split so that one subrule applies to each type (see, for example, Copestake [1992] for further discussion). This class of problems is avoided with our current approach.","In other respects, this version of lexical rules is intermediate in expressivity between simple inheritance and conventional lexical rules. It is more powerful than simple inheritance, because the \"input\" and \"output\" types of lexical rules do not have to be in a fixed inheritance hierarchy, and recursive application of rules is possible. Consider for example, an alternative encoding, using simple inheritance, of the Causative-Inchoative rule shown in Figure 9. This requires that a type caus-or-inch-502 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules verb exists that has intrans-verb and trans-caus-verb as subtypes. However, in order to encode further alternations, these types themselves have to have subtypes corresponding to each rule. For example, if the goal PP in John galloped the horse to the barn / The horse galloped to the barn is encoded as an argument, then intrans-verb and trans-caus-verb both have to have subtypes for the goal PP and this configuration has to be replicated for all subtypes of intrans-verb, such as intrans-movt-verb. This quickly leads to highly complex type hierarchies, since the configuration of the types encodes \"reachability,\" as well as inheritance. Furthermore, encoding lexical rules by inheritance does not allow for any notion of semiproductivity of a rule. Individual exceptions to a rule can be encoded, for example, if run is encoded as an intrans-verb and not specified to be of the higher type caus-or-inch-verb, then causative forms of run will not be generated. But this leaves it as an accident that, at least for this class of movement verbs, it is generally the causative rather than the inchoative form that is impossible or marked. We will discuss how we can exploit the asymmetry of TDFS lexical rules to allow for semiproductivity in Section 6.","Our approach to lexical rules is, on the other hand, less powerful than conventional HPSG-style lexical rules because it is not possible to arbitrarily \"rearrange\" material between the input and the output structures: a value that is present on a particular path in the input can either be unified with a value on the same path in the output structure, or be overridden, but it cannot be moved to a new position within the output feature structure. This approach therefore shares some of the restrictions of simple inheritance with respect to encoding potentially recursive operations, and we discuss the implications of this further in Section 7.","It is clear that the notion of lexical rules that we have presented encodes something like \"type reachability\" rules for lexical types. This is an inherently more restricted notion than that of HPSG-style lexical rules, which can also encode arbitrary operations on list-valued features. A consequence of this more restricted notion is that lexical rules cannot be used to rearrange the order of list-valued features and cannot be applied recursively in a manner that makes such lists unbounded. In fact, since lexical rules simply relate lexical types predefined in the lexicon, they cannot increase the generative capacity of the overall system in which they are embedded. 4","In Section 5, nevertheless, we show that an insightful account of one rule that would be encoded via SUBCAT list manipulations can be stated in this more restrictive framework. In Section 7 we consider the extent to which our approach can capture other putative lexical rules and argue for a clearer distinction between lexical rules and (unary) syntactic rules. 5 5. Dative Constructions Lascarides, Copestake, and Briscoe (1996) present an account of the dative alternation that illustrates the utility of the TDFS framework for encoding defeasible lexical semantic entailments in terms of Dowty's (1989) proto thematic roles, and the interac-4 We omit a formal proof as this would require more detailed specification of the syntactic component than is warranted in the rest of the paper. 5 An alternative method of exploiting the TDFS formalism to encode rules was mentioned in L&C (page 87) and has been explored by Malouf (1999). This technique uses the TDFS description language to allow a very succinct statement of rules that use coindexation to relate their input and output: effectively, paths in the input and output structure can be specified to be coindexed by default. The expanded rules have the same properties as the lexical rule variants described by Copestake (1992) or Riehemann (1993). Thus, in terms of the current paper, this encoding is a way of improving the representation of syntactic rules. 503 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 tion of these with the dative alternation (e.g., Green 1974). This account draws heavily on Goldberg's (1995) analysis of dative in construction grammar (e.g., Fillmore, Kay, and O'Connor 1988), and attempts to integrate her insights and general approach into a more formally explicit constraint-based framework. In this section, we extend this account by embedding the account in a syntactic framework based on UCG (Zeevat, Klein, and Calder 1987), as integrated with Dowty's approach to thematic roles and extended by Sanfilippo (1990, 1992, 1993), and augmented with linking theory (Chang 1995). 6 This allows us to utilize TDFS lexical rules in an insightful way to express an alternation otherwise naturally treated in terms of rearrangement of a list-valued SUBCAT feature. In Section 8 we go on to propose a probabilistic interpretation of TDFS lexical rules that allows us to capture the semiproductivity of the dative alternation, and other lexical rules.","Following Goldberg (1995) we argue that there is a family of dative constructions that exhibit the same syntactic properties and related semantic properties, exemplified in (6).

Under this interpretation, (6b) involves a shift in meaning where the recipient may or may not receive the affected-object, but the agent acts with this intention, whilst (6c) involves a similar shift as the act of transfer is intended to take place at some point in the future and may not in fact occur. (6d), unlike the previous examples, does not have an oblique counterpart. The remaining examples all appear to involve metaphorical or idiomatic extensions to the core dative construction.","We represent the difference in the basic (abstract) meaning of the dative construction in (6a) and (6b) in terms of entailments associated with proto thematic roles, so that agent becomes p-agt-cause-transfer in (6a) and p-agt-cause-make-intend-transfer in (6b).

It should only be necessary to state the form of the dative construction once. Furthermore, it should not be necessary to say that verbs of creation, such as paint, are lexically ambiguous between two- and three-place predicates; rather, it is participation in the dative construction itself that creates the third benefactive argument for these inherently two-place predicates. We also assume without explicit argument here that the for PP variant is produced by a lexical rule introducing the optional PP. In the TDFS framework we can state the semantics of the dative construction independently of specific lexical heads (or arguments) as a type constraint on the set of dative lexical items. The type constraint expressed as a TDFS in Figure 11 achieves this and utilizes default specification of the proto-roles on the arguments so that specific verbs can override the core entailments. This constraint stipulates that dative verbs will necessarily have a p-agt-cause role, but, by default, this will be specialized to p-agtcause-transfer, thus expressing the generalization that the dative construction usually implies that some transfer has taken place. Similarly, the role on the proto-patient is p-pat-aff-obj by default, since the object will usually be affected, and p-obl-recip captures the entailment that the oblique argument usually corresponds to a recipient. (We assume that the second object is treated as an oblique [indirect object] argument in the framework, though nothing particularly rests on this assumption.) Most verbs will not be directly specified in the lexicon as being of type dative, but will become associated with this type via the lexical rules relating oblique-transfer verbs and transitive-creation verbs to it.

Chang (1995) follows Wechsler (1991) and Davis (1996) in assuming that linking generalizations are captured via constraints specified as TFSs, but makes the assumption that linking applies after lexical rule application. She shows how linking generalizations can be captured within the TDFS framework assuming the linguistic framework of UCG/construction grammar and proto thematic roles outlined above. By reorganizing the semantic type hierarchy to take account of the distinction between internal and external causation (see Levin and Rappaport Hovav [1995]), Chang is able to define 11 partly defeasible verbal linking constraints, each specifying the link between one thematic role and one argument position, correctly linking monadic, dyadic, and triadic predicates that may undergo causative-inchoative, passive, and/or dative alternations by persistent default unification of all linking constraints with each distinct basic and derived verbal type. Thus, our approach to lexical rules is similar to that of Pinker (1989) in that all basic and derived lexical entries are subject to a few general linking constraints that coindex syntactic arguments with appropriate proto-roles.

It would be straightforward to introduce a lexical rule mapping intransitive verbs to the dative construction. However, the relative productivity of this putative rule should be represented as being much lower than the two rules discussed above. Nothing in the representation we have presented so far equips us to deal with the issue of (semi)productivity which also arises with the two rules introduced earlier; consider the famous example of donate, which does not undergo the dative alternation although it is uncontroversially an oblique transfer verb.

Semiproductivity and Probabilistic TDFS Grammar The search for a fully productive statement of verb alternations such as dative has led to an increasingly semantic perspective on such rules.

In the attempt to define such subcases Pinker is forced to make subtle and often unintuitive distinctions, and to claim that the meaning components involved are features of universal grammar to which the grammars of any language may be sensitive. For example, in attempting to differentiate the dative alternating and nonalternating subclasses in (8a) and (8b), Pinker (1989, 110-111) characterizes those in (8a) as \"verbs of continuous imparting of force in some manner causing accompanied motion\" and those in (8b) as \"verbs of continuous causation of motion ... in a deictically-specified direction.\""]},{"title":"(8)","paragraphs":["a. *John dragged/pulled Bill the computer / the computer to Bill b.

More generally, Pinker's notion of a fully productive narrow-class lexical rule is falsified by many examples cited in Boguraev and Briscoe (1989), Levin (1992), and Sch/~tze (1997). We conclude that the program of treating all exceptions to dative as systematic, as opposed to accidental or idiosyncratic (Wasow 1980), fails for dative movement, and will, we suspect, fail for most verb diathesis alternations. Therefore, it is not possible to characterize such rules as a fully productive generative operation.","Within the generative tradition of work on lexical rules, the only alternative to treating such rules as fully productive generalizations is to treat them as redundancy rules of some form (e.g., Jackendoff [1975] and see the discussion in Section 2). However, this approach does not account for the"]},{"title":"semiproductive","paragraphs":["nature of such rules.

Similarly, the examples in (10b), (10c), and (10d) are all attested uses of the dative that violate putative (narrow-class) morphological or semantic constraints on its application from Pinker (1989, 155-157). The existence of creative or analogous application to nonce usages and attested exceptions to the narrow-class rules makes the redundancy rule approach unsatisfactory, at least, when formalized as a purely abbreviatory device (see Section 2 above).","The search for narrow classes and full productivity seems futile for rules of verb alternation because such rules are inherently semiproductive in the same manner that derivational rules are often characterized as semiproductive (e.g., Bauer 1983). Instead, we argue, following Goldberg (1995), who in turn is influenced by theories of semiproductivity developed for morphology, that rules of verb alternation are sensitive to both type and token frequency effects that determine language users' assessments of the degree of acceptability of a given derived form and also their willingness to apply a rule in producing or interpreting a novel form. Bauer (1983, 71f.), in supporting the view that lexical rules should be treated as fully productive generative rules analogous to those employed in syntactic description, argues that it is this greater \"item-familiarity\" of lexical items that allows judgements of relative novelty/conventionality to be built up. He points out that there are simply too many combinatoric possibilities at the sentential level for the frequency of particular combinations to be assessed with any confidence by a language user. However, in the case of words and, we might add, idioms, the range of possibilities, though large, is not so great that judgements of novelty based on frequency of use cannot be acquired. Bauer argues, therefore, that accounting for semiproductivity is an issue of performance, not competence. There is considerable evidence that language users are very sensitive to the relative frequency of variant forms and senses of lexical items. Such assumptions underlie influential theories of language variation and change (e.g., Labov 1972) and psycholinguistic accounts of preferences and misinterpretation during language comprehension (e.g., Kelly and Martin 1994). 511 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","The frequency with which a given word form is associated with a particular lexical entry (i.e., sense or grammatical realization) is often highly skewed; Church and Mercer (1993) point out that a model of part-of-speech assignment in context will be 90% accurate (for English) if it simply chooses the lexically most frequent part-of-speech for a given word.

We associate a single probability with each complete TDFS that represents a lexical entry. In a probabilistic grammar based on this approach, the probability of a derivation must depend in part on details of the grammatical approach adopted. In a categorial framework it may be there are only mutually exclusive schemata for combining lexical entries into phrasal and clausal signs, so the probability of a given derivation can be treated as the product of the probability of the lexical entries utilized in that derivation.

The FSM encoding devised by Meurers and Minnen is specifically developed as a form of precompilation compatible with this possibility. The majority of clearly recursive or cyclic rules in the literature are derivational, so it is clear from the word form how many times a rule has applied. We can extend the probabilistic encoding scheme to allow sets of probabilities to be encoded on states annotated with number of affixations (e.g., [q4, [anti,p1; anti-anti,p2; ...]]). We assume for now that rules of conversion, such as most verb alternation rules, do not apply cyclically or recursively and discuss apparent exceptions in Section 7.","A second problem with the acquisition of reliable estimates of such probabilities for a language user (or implemented parser) is that many possibilities will remain 514 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules unseen and will, therefore, be unattested. For instance, the fact that donate has not been seen in the dative construction may indicate the ungrammaticality of this realization or merely reflect lack of linguistic exposure to the appropriate dialect, register, or whatever. The simple maximum likelihood estimator shown above will assign zero probability to unseen events. There are a variety of methods for estimating probabilistic parameters or smoothing probability distributions that avoid assigning zero probability to unseen events. One standard approach assigns a hypothetical single observation to each unseen event in a distribution before normalizing frequencies to obtain probabilities. This captures the intuition that the more frequent the observation of some events in a distribution, the less likely it is that the unseen possibilities will occur. Thus, a rare word with only a few observations may be more likely to be seen in an alternative realization than a very frequent word that has been observed many times in some subset of the possible realizations licensed by the grammar. However, all unseen events will be assigned the same probability within each distinct distribution and this is at best a gross estimate of their actual distribution. (The technique is analogous to assuming a uniform prior distribution within the framework of Bayesian estimation.)","In the case of unattested derived lexical entries for a given word form, the relative productivity of the lexical rule(s) required to produce the derived entry are the most likely source of information to estimate the probability of an unattested derived entry given a word form. 8 Within the probabilistic framework presented above lexical rules are not directly associated with probabilities. Nevertheless we can represent the relative productivity of each lexical rule by calculating the ratio of possible to attested outputs for each rule (see Aronoff [1976]): M Prod(lexical-rule) = (where N is the number of attested lexical entries that match the lexical rule input and M is the number of attested output entries). This is a very simple estimate of productivity, and more complex accounts are considered below.","The estimate for degree of productivity of a rule can be combined with smoothing to obtain a variant-enhanced smoothing method of the type discussed by Church and Gale (1991), capable of assigning distinct probabilities to unseen events within the same distribution. This can be achieved by estimating the held-back probability mass to be distributed between the unseen entries using the basic smoothing method outlined above and then distributing this mass differentially by multiplying the total mass for unseen entries (expressed as a ratio of the total observations for a given word) by a different ratio for each lexical rule. This ratio is obtained by dividing the ratio representing the productivity of the lexical rule(s) by the sum of the ratios of the lexical rules required to construct all the unseen entries.","Unseen-pr-mass(word-form) =","number-of-unattested-entries(word-form) freq(word-form)+number-of-unattested-entries(word-form) Est-freq(lex-entryi with word-formj) =","Prod(lri) TT ,~ ~ ,4~ m.~ ~nseen_t,r_mass~wor _ or~,,jj x ~ Prod(lrl),...,Prod(Irn) 8 An estimate of the relative productivity of a lexical rule would correspond to Goldberg's (1995) notion of type frequency, while the conditional probability of a lexical entry being associated with a specific word form corresponds to her token frequency. 515 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 (where"]},{"title":"lrl.., lrn","paragraphs":["are the n lexical rules needed to derive the n unattested entries for word-formj).

For example, we could factor the computation of productivity between subtypes of the input type of a rule and derive more fine-grained measures of productivity for each narrow class a rule applies to (assuming the type system is not recursive in such a way that the subclasses of the input type are infinite). In the case of specialized subcases of lexical rules that apply to a narrower range of lexical items, but yield a more specific interpretation (such as the rules of Meat or Fur grinding, as opposed to general Grinding, proposed in Copestake and Briscoe [1995]; see Section 7), the relative productivity of each rule will be estimated in the manner described above, but the more specialized rule is likely to be more productive since it will apply to fewer entries than the more general rule. Similarly, in Figure 21, we assumed a Use-Substance lexical rule, but a more accurate estimation of probabilities might be obtained by considering specialized subclasses. This approach to deriving estimates of the productivity of lexical rules is applied to four denominal verb forma-516 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules tion rules in Briscoe and Copestake (1996), where the probabilities of the basic and derived word forms are estimated from part-of-speech tagged textual corpora.","The probabilistic approach we have presented is part of a theory of language use or performance rather than one of competence or grammatical representation. As such it is not a part of the T(D)FS representation language, which is intended as a general formalism in which paradigmatic (lexical) and syntagmatic (syntactic and semantic) theories can be encoded or embedded. This probabilistic approach to lexical rules integrates neatly with extant proposals to control application of lexical rules efficiently within a constraint-based framework, such as those of Meurers and Minnen (1997). To our knowledge it is the first attempt to formalize relatively informal accounts of semiproductivity based on the item-familiarity view of (morphological) lexical rules. As such it serves to highlight a potential difference between genuinely lexical rules and unary syntactic rules, such as Adjunct Introduction, because in the probabilistic framework presented here the latter rule applied during construction of a sentential derivation will not affect the probability of the derivation, while lexical rules may, since they can output lexical entries with estimated conditional probabilities.","The general claim we make here is that if we assume that speakers choose well-attested high-frequency forms to realize particular senses and listeners choose well-attested high-frequency senses when faced with ambiguity, then much of the semiproductivity of lexical rules is predicted.

The two other control effects suggested in Copestake (1992) are both also superseded by the current proposal. One of these was to allow for blocking, which is discussed below. The other was that more specific lexical rules should be preferred over more general ones. We would expect that, in general, the more specialized rule will be more productive, as a natural consequence of applying to a smaller class, but the earlier proposal would have had the undesir-able consequence that this was a fixed consequence, which could not be adjusted for cases where the generalization did not hold. Thus the grammar writer was, in effect, required to consider both competence and performance when stipulating a rule.","Blocking can be treated as a special case of this principle: if speakers use higher-frequency forms to convey a given meaning, an extended meaning will not become conventionalized if a common synonym exists.

However, this is not the complete story, since we have not accounted formally for the extra implicatures that the use of a blocked form conveys, nor have we allowed for the generation of blocked forms (apart from in the circumstances where the generator's lexicon omits the synonym). Both these problems require an account of the interface with pragmatics (see Copestake and Lascarides [1997] for one such account, which integrates probabilistic information into pragmatic reasoning). 517 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","The method proposed above for estimating the probability of unattested but possible derived lexical entries for given lexical items is simple. Other more complex schemes could be developed, which, for example, took account of the average probability of the output of a lexical rule. This might be necessary, for example, to model the relative frequencies of -er versus -ee suffixation, since although the latter is more productive (by Baayen and Lieber's [1991] definition), tokens of the former are more frequent overall (Barker 1995). However, we have presented a simple approach here, since we currently have no evidence that a more complex approach is justified, given that our main aim is to rank unseen senses by plausibility. Another problem is the need to ensure that classes have comparable frequency distributions. This could matter if there were competing lexical rules, defined on different but overlapping classes, since if one class has a high percentage of low-frequency words compared to the other, the estimate of its productivity will tend to be lower. The productivity figure could be adjusted to allow for item frequency within classes. We will not discuss this further here, but see Baayen and Sproat (1996) for discussion of the related phenomenon of ambiguous derivational affixes.","Schiitze (1997, 133f.) argues, in the context of a detailed critique of Pinker (1989), that accounts of lexical rules that do not include a quantitative component cannot form the basis for a satisfactory theory of the acquisition of lexical rules by language learners. The seed for the formation of a specific lexical rule must be comparison of the semantics and alternation/derivation behavior of a class of lexical items, but since there will always be noise in the form of exceptions because of the inherent semiproductivity of the processes modeled by lexical rules, the induction of a rule must be based in part on quantitative reasoning concerning the degree of generalization obtained from, or equivalently number of exceptions to, a putative lexical rule. The probabilistic approach proposed here could, we think, form the basis for such reasoning (see Schiitze [1997] for a detailed discussion of the learning of lexical rules.) Jackendoff (1997a, 115f.) also notes that the learning of semiproductive lexical rules must be grounded in the prior existence of basic and derived lexical entries in the child's lexicon. Jackendoff (1997a, 124f.) goes on to argue for a full entry theory of lexical organization in which the output of semiproductive lexical rules is entirely specified lexically. He suggests that the advantage of positing semiproductive rules remains because the \"informational-cost\" of learning such semiregular components of the lexicon is reduced. The attraction of the current proposal, integrated with Meurers and Minnen's (1997) partial precompilation approach, is that we can do justice to the facts of semiproductivity and also achieve an efficient and maximally nonredundant encoding of the lexicon. 7. Other Lexical Processes Lexical rules should be able to account for processes of morphological inflection, derivation, and conversion. Verb alternations are a class of morphological conversion rules that exhibit similar semiproductive behavior to other processes of derivation and conversion. We have discussed dative in detail to demonstrate that a linguistically adequate account of one such rule is possible in the proposed framework. A similar approach to other alternations should be feasible within the framework presented. However the formalism introduced so far provides no mechanism for building up any recursive structure. There is no direct way of copying over information from the input into a different slot in the output structure. The mechanism proposed will therefore allow for at most one step of affixation as shown for the inflectional rule in Figure 7, because inputting the output to another rule would override the func-518 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules tion specification. Similarly, the rules given in Section 5 rely on their semantic effects applying to known structures in the input.","At first sight, this restriction might appear to preclude a treatment of rules such as Passive, which have been assumed to require manipulations of a list-valued SUBCAT feature (Pollard and Sag 1987). However, since Passive is nonrecursive, the appropriate effect can be expressed indirectly in our framework, by setting up a feature that is subsequently linked to the \"real\" SUBCAT. We use ARGREAL (for argument realization) for this feature in the sketch of the account of Passive that follows.","We assume the following types:"]},{"title":"unlinked-active : diffiist] ] SYN E R+ AL I unlinked-passive","paragraphs":["]] SYN: ARGREAL: [LIST: [HD:"]},{"title":"[~ppbysign]","paragraphs":["[LAST: [THL D :e~st] ]"]},{"title":"linked-active","paragraphs":["]","SYN I ARGREAL: [LIST: []]] : LSUBCAT : []"]},{"title":"linked-~assive","paragraphs":["SYN: [ARGREAL: [LIST: [TL: []]]] LSUBCAT : [] The Passive lexical rule simply states:"]},{"title":"unlinked-active ~-~ unlinked-passive","paragraphs":["The feature ARGREAL is encoded as a difference list on unlinked-active: that is, there are two features, LIST and LAST, such that the value of the LIST feature is a list in the usual HD/TL encoding and LAST is maintained as a pointer to the end of the list.

An advantage of this approach to Passive is that linking generalizations can be identical for active and passive forms, since they are expressed with respect to the ARGREAL slot rather than SUBCAT. The feature ARGREAL has similarities with the argument structure feature used in more recent versions of HPSG, and we suspect it would be possible to combine the functionality of both features.","The formalism is therefore sufficiently expressive to encode some nonrecursive list manipulation operations, if suitable pointers into the list, such as LAST, are set up lexically or on the output of rules that produce lists of sufficiently determinate structure. But this is inadequate for encoding rules that require that the entire semantics of the input (which may itself arise from previous rule applications) be modified by the semantics expressed by the rule. To take a simple example, consider prefixation by re-, and assume that this is encoded by a lexical rule that can apply an arbitrary number of times, each time appending re- to a list of prefixes in the PHON value, and 519 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","In )ut: oblique-transfer-verb PHON : give SYN ARGREAL : Output: \"unlinked-passive PHON : give"]},{"title":"[ [HD","paragraphs":["LIST : TL : k LAST : [] SYN ARGREAL : Linked form: - linked-passive PHON give SUBCAT : [] SYN : ARGREAL : Figure 22",": npsign ] 1 [ HD : npsign ] HD: pptosign"]},{"title":"[ [HD oppbysign 1] r HD :","paragraphs":["npsign LIST: TL: L ]TL [TL:ffl [HD:ppt°sign] L LAS T ~[HD : TL ::e~st ]","HD : npsign 1 r HD : pptosign ]"]},{"title":"] HD:","paragraphs":["[] ppbysign TL: TL: ffl[TL:elis t ] LAsT:LIST: [HD:[]]][]TL: [] An example of Passive: oblique-transfer-verb is here assumed to be a subtype of unlinked-active.

Figure 24 illustrates how this could be used to express a lexical rule for re- prefixation, with @ being used as the notation to indicate that the value of the feature in the input be appended to the right of the structure stated in the output. Figure 25 shows the equivalent rule in the conventional notation, using reentrancy to indicate copying. However, this extension is more restricted in expressivity than allowing arbitrary copying between input and output structures, and still does not make available the arbitrary list-manipulation operations that are possible in conventional HPSG-style lexical rules. This extension relies on the use of a flat representation such as minimal recursion semantics (MRS, Copestake et al. 1995), 9 The semantic representation is not intended to be taken too seriously, but the argument applies to any representation where it is assumed that, for example, reretie is not equivalent to retie. 520 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules I PHON : I PREFIXES: < re >~ ]","~-~ EVENT:e >~< re_ ,~: verb ] SEM : < [ re-rel ] r r 1 I_ Figure 24 Sketch of lexical rule for re- prefixation. verb ] PHON: [PREFIXES: [~] ~-~ SEM: [] Figure 25 PHON: [PREFIXES: [ HD:reTL:[] ]]","r re-rel ] HD: |EVENT, e|","SEM: ~ARG: e' J [ TL : list Corresponding lexical rule using reentrancy notation for copying. since the reason we can simply use Append to construct the semantics of the output is that the semantics of any sign is always encoded as a list, without any embedding of structures. Thus we are exploiting the fact that semantic composition in the grammar as a whole relies on the Append operation.","The use of Append in conjunction with a flat semantic representation is also adequate to express potentially recursive rules of regular sense extension, such as \"grinding\" and \"portioning,\" as lexical rules (Copestake and Briscoe 1992, 1995). In general, we believe that our formulation of lexical rules is expressive enough to capture inflectional, derivational, and conversion processes, to model both systematic and idiosyncratic exceptions, and preemption by both synonymy and lexical form.","A rule such as Adjunct Introduction (Bouma and van Noord 1994), which adds adjunct categories to the SUBCAT lists of verb entries recursively creating a potentially infinite set of derived entries, seems to us to be a clear example of a nonlexical unary syntactic rule. Firstly, it appears to be fully productive in that it is neither lexically governed nor subject to idiosyncratic exceptions, blocking, or other forms of semiproductivity. Secondly, its function is to add, or better interpolate, adjunct categories to the SUBCAT list \"on demand,\" given the syntactic context, and this is best achieved by the syntactic component during syntactic analysis.","It is possible that an account of Adjunct Introduction could be formulated as a TDFS lexical rule via Append, though it is difficult to see how such a formulation could account naturally for argument-adjunct interpolation of the kind found in examples like: United flies from New York daily to the Gulf Coast. However, once we adopt the probabilistic approach to lexical rules, it becomes increasingly unnatural and unmotivated to attempt to interpret such processes as lexical. The item-familiarity theory of lexical productivity clearly should not extend to attempting to model whether a specific verb is more likely to appear with one or two adjuncts, because this is in no sense a definition of a \"possible lexeme.\"","Furthermore, there are now clear theoretical advantages for creating a distinct class of unary nonlexical rules. In the TDFS framework, an interface between the lexical component and syntactic-semantic component of the grammar is required so that some lexical default specification does not persist into the syntactic component (for example, defaults concerning grammatical agreement; see Lascarides and Copestake [1999]). Thus, such rules must necessarily apply after all genuinely lexical rules, and 521 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 creating such a separation means that it should be possible to ensure that the two types of rule cannot interact in ways that lead to unrestricted generative capacity in the full system. The two main criteria for distinguishing such rules that we have identified so far are (semi)productivity and the creation of (un)bounded list structures in the syntactic representation. 8. Conclusions Both Goldberg (1995) and Jackendoff (1997a, 1997b) contrast the lexical rule approach to bounded dependencies with one that treats each construction independently and characterizes relations between constructions, somewhat vaguely, in terms of \"inheritance.\" Jackendoff (1997b, 556f.) makes the point that lexical rules in lexicalist frameworks are expressive enough to describe bounded constructions and any idiosyncratic meanings they convey, so they can be used to capture relations among such constructions. He argues against this approach though, because he suggests that the elements of the constructions related by such rules are often not lexical. Copestake and Briscoe (1995) make the same point with respect to examples of systematic metonymy, where such semiproductive \"lexical\" rules apply to noun phrase constructions. Jackendoff also argues, however, that constructions need to be treated as a kind of phrasal lexical item whose (idiosyncratic) meaning is learnt like that of a lexical item (Jackendoff 1997b, 554). For us, the defining characteristic of a lexical rule is that it requires some listing of properties to accurately express its behavior, whether this be because it is lexically governed, has exceptions, is underspecified in its effects, or whatever. Thus idioms must be lexically specified, though they are best treated as particularly idiosyncratic phrases/constructions, rather than lexical items.","For Jackendoff (1997a, 115f.), the crucial distinction is not lexical/nonlexical but productive/semiproductive rule. Jackendoff's definition of a productive rule encompasses rules such as Plural Noun Formation or Third Singular Verb Formation (see Section 2 above), despite the existence of irregular derived forms, because he argues that such a rule's output need not be listed. It is semiproductive only to the extent that certain aspects of its output can be overridden or blocked by lexical specification of exceptions. He reserves the term semiproductive for rules, such as Denominal Verb Formation (shelf ~-+ shelve), where the exact output of the rule is underspecified and the existence of the derived words is not guaranteed. Thus, the precise meaning of the denominal verb is partly systematic ('to put x in/on y') and partly idiosyncratic and unpredictable (e.g., to saddle (a horse) means 'to put a saddle on a horse's back,' while to shelve a book means 'to put a book on a shelf'), and the phonological form is not always identical with or entirely predictable from the nominal form (e.g., shelve). Furthermore, there are many nouns that do not have corresponding denominal forms (mustard vs. butter, teapot vs. knife, etc.). Jackendoff argues that the nature of the exceptions to the latter type of rule requires (full) listing in the lexicon of the derived forms, while the former does not.","In our approach, lexical rules are those that require some element of lexical/listed specification, whether it be the listing of irregular forms that override aspects of the rule output or of idiosyncratic aspects of the resulting meaning, or the unattested status of the derived entry. The approach to lexical rules we have advocated, integrating a restrictive default-based formalization with partial precompilation and a probabilistic account of item-familiarity and semiproductivity, is capable of expressing inflectional, derivational, and conversion rules whose domain is (within) that of a bounded dependency construction (i.e., includes \"alternation\" rules relating bounded constructions). This approach reintegrates construction-based generalizations with more traditional 522 Briscoe and Copestake Lexical Rules lexical rules, provides a very general means for encoding semiproductivity, and makes a principled distinction between lexical and unary syntactic rules that should allow the generative power of the overall grammar to be restricted. To summarize: lexical rules cannot perform arbitrary operations on unbounded lists; they are unidirectional, but have limited reversibility properties appropriate to account for backformation; they involve no extension to the underlying logic of the TDFS framework; they require the statement of what changes, not what stays the same; they are subject to type constraints and can exploit the default inheritance hierarchy to capture generalizations; they can be semiproductive and are predicted to be sensitive to blocking, exceptions, conventionalization, and so forth; and they allow a linguistically elegant, and accurate, account of the dative construction/alternation, subsuming the insights emerging from recent detailed analyses of this specific lexical rule.","Furthermore, we outlined ways in which this approach can be extended straightforwardly to deal with rules apparently involving more complex SUBCAT list manipulations, and with recursive processes of derivation and conversion and their associated semantics, without sacrificing these desirable properties. It follows from our approach that some putative lexical rules should be treated as unary syntactic rules. A potential advantage of this division of labor is that it may even be possible to develop a separate treatment of unary syntactic rules that does not utilize category-valued variables over list-valued features. In any case, if these rules only apply to the output of the lexicon, this will avoid the increase in generative capacity identified by Carpenter (1991), resulting from the interaction of recursion, arbitrary list operations and unbounded lists, by keeping list-valued features bounded during lexical rule application, and only allowing unbounded additions to, or limited modification of, such features during syntactic processing.
