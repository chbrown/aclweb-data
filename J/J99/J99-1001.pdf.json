This paper presents a plan-based model for understanding cooperative negotiation subdialogues. Our system infers both the communicative actions that people pursue when speaking and the beliefs underlying these actions. Beliefs, and the strength of these beliefs, are recognized from the surface form of utterances,from discourse acts, and from the explicit and implicit acceptance of previous utterances. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse actions combines linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge in a unified framework. By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to model negotiation subdialogues. Since negotiation is an integral part of multiagent activity, our process model addresses an important aspect of cooperative interaction and thus is a step toward an intelligent and robust natural language consultation system. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In a typical expert-consultation dialogue, one participant (hereafter referred to as the executing agent or EA) has a goal that he 1 wants to achieve and is working with the other participant (referred to as the consulting agent or CA) to construct a plan for achieving this goal. Although both the plan construction process and the conversation are collaborative activities, this does not mean that people always believe what they are told. In fact, part of the collaborative activity of conversation is negotiation of conflicting beliefs. This negotiation is particularly important in task-oriented expert-consultation dialogues, since the participants must resolve any conflicting beliefs in order to work together effectively to devise a plan that is both well-formed and addresses the executing agent's needs. Thus, a robust natural language consultation system must be able to handle negotiation subdialogues.","Even though there is wide agreement that negotiation is an integral part of multiagent activity, previous natural language understanding systems have been unable to handle negotiation subdialogues such as the following: (1) (2) $1: Who is teaching CS360? $2: Dr. Smith is teaching CS360. * Department of Computer Science, Newark, DE 19716, USA Department of Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering, Newport News, VA 23606, USA 1 For exposition purposes, we will use the masculine gender when referring to EA and the feminine gender when referring to CA.

CS360 is an undergraduate course. Dr. Smith teaches both graduate and undergraduate courses. $1: Who handles the CS360 lab? For example, existing systems do not recognize when an agent is expressing doubt at a previous response as in utterance (3), when an agent is attempting to resolve a conflict suggested by the other participant as in utterances (4)-(5), or when an agent is implicitly conveying acceptance of a communicated proposition as in utterance (6). These shortcomings prevent existing natural language systems from being able to handle dialogues in which one agent initially does not accept the proposition conveyed by the other agent and initiates a negotiation subdialogue to resolve their differences in belief.","We have developed a plan-based model of dialogue that addresses these limitations.

Section 2 describes the kinds of expressions of doubt found in our corpus analysis, and Section 3 discusses the factors that must be taken into account in recognizing the kind of expression of doubt that we have been studying. Section 4 presents our process model for recognizing complex discourse acts (such as expressions of doubt) and assimilating them into the dialogue context. First it discusses why it is necessary to capture varying degrees of belief, describes the multistrength model of belief used in our system, and discusses how our description of actions avoids assuming that a speaker will automatically adopt a communicated proposition. Then it introduces the notion of an action that requires evidence for its recognition and presents our recognition algorithm that uses a combination of linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge. Section 5 steps through an extended example that illustrates our system's ability to recognize complex discourse acts and model negotiation subdialogues. Section 6 discusses the evaluation of our system and our plans for future work, and Section 7 discusses related research. The examples in this paper are taken from a university advisement domain, since this is the domain in which we have implemented our system."]},{"title":"2. Motivation from Naturally Occurring Dialogues","paragraphs":["To identify how speakers express doubt, we analyzed a corpus of naturally occurring dialogues in the domains of financial planning, university courses, real estate, pets, taxes, and travel. The real estate, pets, and financial planning (Harry Gross Transcripts 1982) dialogues were transcribed from radio talk shows, the taxes and travel (SRI Transcripts 1992) dialogues were transcribed from tapes of simulated interactions, and the university courses dialogues (Columbia University Transcripts, 1985) were Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues transcribed from student advisement sessions. In the corpus we found instances in which a speaker expressed doubt at a proposition by contending that some other conflicting proposition was true. 2 In addition, we extracted other examples of such expressions of doubt from the dialogues in novels. These kinds of expressions of doubt can be realized as surface negative questions or tag questions and are often accompanied by the cue word but, as in the following example taken from the Harry Gross financial planning dialogues (Harry Gross Transcripts 1982) in which S2's last utterance expresses doubt at Sl's recommendation: $1: $2: $1: $2: I would like to see that into an individual retirement account rollover in a mutual fund group. At my age? Yes. Uh, yeah but isn't there any risk? However, our corpus analysis also provided instances where surface negative and tag questions were used to seek verification, such as in the following excerpt from the set of financial planning dialogues: $1: $2: $1: And if you have more money left after you pay the taxes what difference does it make if you pay a few bucks more in taxes? I'm telling my wife but she won't listen. Well maybe she'll listen to me. If you get 200 bucks--isn't it better to have 200 bucks and uh have 200 left than to have nothing at all?","Our recognition algorithm has only been concerned with recognizing instances in which a speaker expresses doubt by contending that some other proposition is true. However, in our corpus, speakers also expressed doubt in the following ways, and our future work will include extending our system to handle these: 3 Drawing attention to an inconsistent feature or proposition: The speaker brings into focus a feature or proposition that is already part of the dialogue context but that is intended to discredit the proposition being doubted. These utterances were often realized as an elliptical fragment and included \"And you're how old?', \"Even though it's four more years?\", and \"At my age?\" Drawing attention to violated expectations: The speaker mentions an expectation that is inconsistent with the doubted proposition. An example of this from our corpus is \"You're kidding, what happened to the seventy-eight dollar fares or those sort of things ?\" 2 We found a very few instances in which the speaker asked the hearer if he was sure the conflicting proposition wasn't true; an example from our corpus is \"Are you sure he didn't name himself as attorney for the estate?\" taken from the Harry Gross financial planning dialogues (Harry Gross Transcripts 1982). Our current system does not handle such expressions of doubt. 3 Walker (1996) analyzed the Harry Gross financial planning dialogues (Harry Gross Transcripts 1982) to identify features that distinguish acceptance from rejection. However, she did not consider expressions of doubt and some of her rejections would fall into our \"express doubt\" category. 3 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1","• Repetition: The speaker queries the doubted proposition; this usually took the form of a declarative followed by a question mark, as in \"You have 40 thou(sand) inn a ram fund?\"","• Explicit statements and questions: The speaker explicitly doubts what has been said or asks for justification; examples from our corpus include \"I'm not so sure of that.\" and \"Who ever said that?\"","• Cue words: The speaker uses discourse markers to convey his doubt. In addition to the cue word but that is often used to realize expressions of doubts in the other categories, cue words such as Really? and What? were used by themselves to express doubt and cue words such as even though were used to convey doubt in utterances such as \"Even though it's four more years ?\" 3. Recognizing Expressions of Doubt When a listener in a collaborative interaction does not accept the proposition that the speaker is trying to convey, a negotiation subdialogue ensues in which the participants attempt to \"square away\" (Joshi 1982) their disparate beliefs. Negotiation subdialogues often involve complex discourse acts that implicitly refer to some proposition that is part of the existing dialogue context. We have found that such complex discourse acts require evidence for their recognition. Since the motivation for our work is the recognition of communicative acts that occur in negotiation subdialogues, this section examines in detail how plausibility and evidence affect the recognition of one kind of complex discourse act, an expression of doubt.","For a listener to recognize a discourse action, it must be plausible that the speaker holds the requisite beliefs for performing the action. (A belief is plausible if the available evidence does not refute it.) For example, in order for a listener to interpret an utterance as felicitously asking a question in order to obtain information, it must be plausible that the speaker does not already know the information and that the speaker believes that the listener may be able to provide it. Similarly, to interpret an utterance as expressing doubt at a proposition Pdoubt by contending Pi, it must be plausible that the speaker holds certain beliefs. Consider a university setting in which each course has only one instructor and a speaker uses the proposition Pi, that Dr. Brown teaches Architecture, to express doubt at the proposition Pdoubt, that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture, as in utterance (9) of Figure 1.

This evidence is provided by linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge. These knowledge sources can either provide evidence for a generic discourse act (such as an expression of doubt) or evidence that the conditions are satisfied for performing a specific discourse act (such as expressing doubt that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture). In addition, contextual knowledge can suggest a particular interpretation when equivalent evidence exists for several specific discourse acts. These knowledge sources are discussed in the next sections. 3.1 Linguistic Knowledge 3.1.1 Evidence for a Generic Discourse Act. A number of researchers (Reichman 1978, 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1986; Cohen 1987; Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Allen 1987; Schiffrin 1987; Hinkelman 1989; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Knott and Dale 1994; Knott and Mellish 1996; Marcu 1997) have investigated the use in discourse of special words and phrases such as"]},{"title":"but, anyway,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"by the way.","paragraphs":["They found that these clue words, or discourse markers, have a number of different functions, including indicating the role of an utterance in the dialogue, conveying the relationship between utterances, suggesting shifts in focus of attention, conveying the structure of the discourse, etc.","Consider again the dialogue shown in Figure 1.

In particular, a clue word can provide evidence for a generic discourse act, such as"]},{"title":"Express-Doubt,","paragraphs":["but it remains for other sources to resolve what is being doubted. Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 3.1.2 Evidence for a Specific Discourse Act. Expressions of doubt do not always include clue words, as illustrated by utterance (9) in Figure 1. In the absence of a clue word, we need evidence that the speaker holds the three beliefs, listed earlier in Section 3, for performing a specific discourse act. Evidence for the second belief (that the speaker believes that Pi is true) is often provided by the surface form of the utterance, such as an utterance of the form \"Isn't Pi ?\"--for example, \"Isn't Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\" in (9). This surface form indicates a strong belief in the queried proposition while a simple yes-no question, such as \"Is Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\", does not. Therefore, if EA were to follow (7)-(8) with \"Is Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\", EA would seem to have a misconception that more than one person can teach a course or perhaps be seeking information in order to subsequently express doubt--but the utterance itself is not conveying doubt that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture. Thus the surface form of the utterance is one source of evidence that the speaker holds the requisite beliefs for performing a specific discourse act. 3.2 World Knowledge World knowledge in the form of stereotypical beliefs is another source of evidence that the speaker holds the requisite beliefs for a particular discourse act. For example, world knowledge can provide evidence for the third speaker belief, that if Pi is true, then Pdoubt is not. Suppose that it is stereotypically believed that prestigious fellowships are awarded for sabbaticals, that faculty on sabbatical do not teach, and that faculty only teach in their area of expertise. Consider the dialogue shown in Figure 2. After (13), there are two propositions that have been conveyed by CA but not yet completely accepted by EA: the proposition that Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical and the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360, cormnunicated by utterances (13) and (11), respectively. A subsequent utterance might express doubt at one of these propositions or might forego the opportunity to doubt them, perhaps by pursuing some discourse act unrelated to either of the propositions. Consider the following three possible continuations of the dialogue:","(14)a. b. C. EA: Wasn't Dr. Smith awarded a Fulbright? EA: Isn't Dr. Smith a theory person? EA: Isn't Dr. Smith an excellent teacher? While (14a) and (14b) seem to be expressing doubt, (14c) is simply seeking further information about Dr. Smith. The reason for this difference in interpretation is that in the case of (14a) and (14b), evidence from world knowledge suggests that EA believes that Pi (the proposition that EA contends is true) implies that one of the two open propositions is false, whereas no such evidence exists in the case of (14c). In the case of (14a), since it is stereotypically believed that prestigious fellowships are awarded for sabbaticals, EA's utterance should be interpreted as expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical. In the case of (14b), since Dr. Smith being a theory person is an alternative to Dr. Smith being a systems person and it is stereotypically believed that being a systems person is necessary for teaching CS360 (a systems course), EA's utterance would instead be interpreted as expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360. Thus, world knowledge in the form of stereotypical beliefs is another source of evidence that the speaker holds the requisite beliefs for performing a particular discourse act.","If EA had uttered (14c), EA's utterance would be interpreted as merely seeking new information since there is no domain knowledge suggesting that EA believes that Dr. Smith being an excellent teacher contributes to determining whether Dr. Smith is Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues (10) EA: Who is teachir~g CS360 (a systems course)? (11) CA: Dr. Smith is teaching CS360. (12) EA: Isn't Dr. Smith on sabbatical? (13) CA: No, Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical. Figure 2 A dialogue with two open propositions. on sabbatical or to identifying the instructor of CS360. Note that (14c) demonstrates why plausibility alone is insufficient for recognition. Although there is no evidence that EA believes that Dr. Smith being an excellent teacher implies that Dr. Smith is on sabbatical or that Dr. Smith is not teaching CS360, there is also no evidence to the contrary, and thus it is plausible that EA believes that Dr. Smith being an excellent teacher indicates that he is on sabbatical or that he is not teaching CS360. This is not sufficient, however, to interpret (14c) as an expression of doubt. 3.3 Contextual Knowledge An agent can infer from a dialogue many of the beliefs of the other participant. These acquired beliefs about the other participant's beliefs form one kind of contextual knowledge that can be used as evidence for the beliefs listed above. In addition, contextual knowledge determines the salience (or degree of prominence) of propositions at the current point in the dialogue, and salience is a factor that constrains the interpretation of coherent discourse actions. Consider the first three utterances in the dialogue shown in Figure 2. EA's acceptance of CA's telling of the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360 establishes the mutual belief that CA believes that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360 and thus provides evidence for the first belief; 5 in addition, the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360 becomes salient and is added to the dialogue context. Thus, while an utterance such as (12a) (12)a. EA: Doesn't Dr. Smith usually teach theory courses? might be used following (11) to express doubt at the statement that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360, it cannot be used following (11) to express doubt at the proposition that Dr. Smith teaches CS410 because 1) there is no reason for EA to believe that CA has any belief in the proposition that Dr. Smith teaches CS410, and 2) the proposition that Dr. Smith teaches CS410 is not salient at this point in the dialogue.","In addition, contextual knowledge plays two other roles in the recognition of discourse acts. First, in the case of expressions of doubt, contextual knowledge distinguishes propositions that have not yet been accepted by the speaker and thus are open for rejection. Consider again the dialogue in Figure 2. After (13), there are two propositions that have not yet been accepted by EA and are thus open for rejection by EA. If EA were to continue with (14b), repeated below, (14)b. EA: Isn't Dr. Smith a theory person? then EA would again be expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360 and would have implicitly conveyed acceptance of the proposition that 5 Note that here EA is only accepting CA's felicitous telling of the proposition, but EA is not adopting the proposition as one of his own beliefs. 7 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical. Thus, as the conversation continues, only one proposition would remain open for rejection: the proposition that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360. This claim is supported by a combination of 1) the stack paradigm (Polanyi 1986; Reichman 1978; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Litman and Allen 1987), which treats topic structure as following a stack-like discipline; 2) focusing heuristics (McKeown 1983) that suggest that if a speaker has more to say about a topic, then he should do so before moving back to a topic deeper on the stack; and 3) the notion of implicit acceptance (discussed in Section 4.6) that argues that passing up the opportunity to reject an assertion in a collaborative dialogue communicates acceptance of it.","Second, contextual knowledge orders propositions according to their relative salience in the current dialogue. This salience can be used to arbitrate among discourse acts for which there is equivalent evidence. Consider again the dialogue in Figure 2 and suppose that EA had continued with (14d). (14)d. EA: But isn't Dr. Smith an excellent teacher? Here we have a clue word suggesting an expression of doubt, but the speaker could be expressing doubt either that Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical or that Dr. Smith is teaching CS360. In both cases, we lack evidence for the third speaker belief. Contextual knowledge suggests that, all other things being equal, the proposition being doubted is the proposition that Dr. Smith is not on sabbatical, since it is the most salient proposition that is open for rejection at this point in the dialogue. Thus, contextual knowledge arbitrates when equivalent evidence is available for several specific discourse acts. 3.4 Summary In addition to the requisite speaker beliefs being plausible and the constraints on the discourse act being satisfied (such as the constraint that a proposition be salient at the current point in the dialogue), certain discourse acts require additional evidence for their recognition. Two kinds of evidence that may be used in recognizing discourse actions are 1) evidence (such as a clue word) for a generic discourse act, and 2) evidence that a speaker holds the requisite beliefs for performing a particular discourse act. Evidence for these beliefs can come from linguistic, world, or contextual knowledge. Although we have illustrated each of these knowledge sources by showing how they might provide evidence for one of the requisite beliefs for expressing doubt, it should be noted that each knowledge source might also be used as evidence for other beliefs required for expressing doubt or for beliefs for other discourse acts. For example, although it does not generally arise in the kind of interactive dialogues that we are studying, world knowledge in the form of stereotypical beliefs might be used as evidence that a speaker believes that a hearer has some belief in the doubted proposition"]},{"title":"Pdoubt\" 4. The Process Model","paragraphs":["Grosz and Sidner (1986) claim that a robust model of understanding must use multiple knowledge sources in order to recognize the complex relationships that utterances have to one another. We have developed an algorithm that combines linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge, such as that identified in Section 3, in order to recognize complex discourse acts, including one kind of expression of doubt. Linguistic knowledge consists of clue words and the surface form of the utterance; world knowledge includes a set of stereotypical beliefs that users generally hold and recipes for performing discourse acts; and contextual knowledge consists of a model of the user's beliefs 8 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues acquired from the preceding dialogue, the current structure of the discourse, the existing focus of attention (that aspect of the task on which the participants' attention is currently centered), and the relative salience (degree of prominence) of propositions in the discourse.","The remainder of this section presents the core ideas of our algorithm. Section 4.1 shows why it is necessary to capture varying degrees of belief in a proposition and presents the multistrength belief model used in our system. Section 4.2 describes our representation of recipes for actions and shows how our recipe for an Inform action refrains from assuming that the listener will adopt the communicated proposition as part of his own beliefs; it also presents a recipe for expressing doubt and shows how constraints on the speaker's beliefs are captured in the recipe's applicability conditions. Section 4.3 gives an overview of our dialogue model. Section 4.4 describes how chaining is used to hypothesize a sequence of higher-level discourse acts that a speaker may be performing; Section 4.5 introduces the notion of a discourse action that requires evidence for its recognition; Section 4.6 discusses how our model recognizes implicit acceptance of a discourse act; and Section 4.7 presents our recognition algorithm that uses a combination of linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge in recognizing discourse acts. 4.1 A MultiStrength Belief Model As argued in Section 3, if a speaker is expressing doubt at a proposition"]},{"title":"Pdoubt","paragraphs":["by contending some other proposition Pi, then the speaker must have some belief in Pi. Evidence for this belief is often provided by the surface form of the speaker's utterance, such as an utterance of the form \"Isn't Pi?\" for example, \"Isn't Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\" But if we treat such an utterance as conveying certain belief that Pi is true, then we cannot handle situations in which an utterance such as this is merely requesting verification since a speaker cannot felicitously seek verification of a proposition that he already knows is true. Therefore, since modeling only ignorance and certainty is inadequate for recognizing complex discourse acts, it is necessary to model the strength of an agent's beliefs. 4.1.1 Representing Varying Degrees of Belief. We use a multistrength model of belief, which captures not only ignorance and certainty about the truth of a proposition but also several degrees of belief in between. Utterances of the form \"Isn't Pi ?\" are treated as conveying a strong (but uncertain) belief in Pi. In this way, our system is able to handle instances in which an utterance of the form \"Isn't Pi?\" is used to request verification (since the utterance is viewed as conveying uncertainty about Pi) as well as instances in which it is used to express doubt (since the utterance is viewed as conveying some belief in Pi).","Our multistrength belief model maintains three degrees of belief: certain belief (a belief strength of C); strong but uncertain belief, as in \"Isn't Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\" (a belief strength of S); and weak belief, as in \"I think that Dr. Cayne might be an education instructor\" (a belief strength of W). Three degrees of disbelief (indicated by attaching a subscript of N, such as SN to represent strong disbelief and WN to represent weak disbelief) are also maintained, and one degree indicating no belief about a proposition (a belief strength of 0). We adopted three degrees of positive and negative belief in our model because that was the minimum number of degrees required for modeling the beliefs communicated in the dialogues that we examined and in the negotiation subdialogues that our system is intended to handle.","Although an agent has some specific strength of belief in a proposition, the other agent may not always know precisely what that strength of belief is but may be able 9 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 to bound it--for example, he may be able to say that the first agent has"]},{"title":"some","paragraphs":["belief in a proposition.

However, explicit acceptance is less common than implicit acceptance; Section 4.6 discusses implicit acceptance and its recognition.","Since we do not currently have a response generation component, our system processes the utterances of both participants, alternating between playing the role of CA and the role of EA. Note that this differs from playing the role of a third-party observer--when the system plays the role of EA, the system has access to EA's beliefs (including EA's beliefs about the current dialogue model and EA's beliefs about CA), and when the system plays the role of CA, it has access to CA's beliefs. However, whenever the system assumes the role of a participant and processes a new utterance, it is assumed that this participant has correctly interpreted previous utterances and has a correct model of the preceding dialogue. 4.1.2 Related Work on Modeling Belief. Young (1987) built a model in which the beliefs of the user are part of an explicit, missing, or stereotype module (he used the system's beliefs as a stereotype). Although this system provides needed differentiation among beliefs that the system knows the user holds, those that the system has attributed to the user, and those about which the system has no knowledge, this model still does not contain degrees of partial belief that are essential for modeling discourse acts such as expressing doubt. Ballim and Wilks (1991) developed a nested belief model that captures an agent's beliefs about other agents' beliefs. Their system combines belief ascription based on stereotypes with belief ascription based on per-turbations of the system's own beliefs, but they do not represent how strongly a belief is held. 10 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues","Galliers (1991, 1992) has specified a nonnumeric theory of belief revision that relates strength of belief to persistence of belief. She points out that a belief model for communication must contain a multistrength model of beliefs that can be modified as the conversation proceeds. She uses endorsements (Cohen 1985) in an assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS [DeKleer 1986]) to specify a system that orders beliefs according to how strongly they are held. This ordering is used to calculate which beliefs should be revised when beliefs are challenged in the course of conversation.","Walker (1991, 1992) has examined dialogues in which people repeat what they already know either in question or statement form (e.g., \"I have four children.\" \"OK. Four children.\"). Walker claims that this repetition by the second speaker is given so that the first speaker realizes that her utterance was understood and believed. That is, cooperative listeners often provide some evidence to speakers to indicate that the listener believes the speaker's claims. Like Galliers, Walker has based the strength of belief on the amount and kind of evidence available for that belief. Cohen and Levesque (1991a) also found this kind of corroboration. Our work has not investigated the belief reasoning process or how much evidence is needed for an agent to have a particular amount of confidence in a belief. Instead, we have been concerned with taking into account different communicated strengths of belief and the impact that the different belief strengths have on the recognition of discourse acts.","Our multistrength belief model is very simple and is only intended to meet our system's need for representing how strongly an agent holds a particular belief. We recently became aware of work by Driankov on a logic in which belief/disbelief pairs capture how strongly a proposition is believed (Driankov 1988; Bonarini, Cappelletti, and Corrao 1990). 6 This work appears to be the only formally defined and well-developed logic that models strength of belief. With the exception that Driankov's logic does not in-chide a state of weak belief, it appears to provide the representational and reasoning capability needed by our system and we intend to investigate it for future use. 4.2 Discourse Recipes In previous work, we noted the need to differentiate among domain, problem-solving, and discourse actions (Lambert and Carberry 1991; Elzer 1995). In task-oriented consultation dialogues, the participants are constructing a plan for achieving some domain goal, such as owning a home, and the resultant plan will consist of domain actions such as applying for a mortgage. In order to construct the domain plan, the participants pursue problem-solving actions such as evaluating alternative domain actions or correcting an action in the partially constructed domain plan. Domain and problem-solving actions have been investigated by many researchers (Allen and Perrault 1980; Perrault and Allen 1980; Wilensky 1981; Litman and Allen 1987; van Beek and Cohen 1986; Ramshaw 1989; Carberry 1990).","Discourse actions are communicative actions that are executed by the dialogue participants in order to obtain or convey the information needed to pursue the problem-solving actions necessary for constructing the domain plan. Examples of very different discourse actions include answering a question, informing, and expressing doubt. Although our system models domain, problem-solving, and discourse actions, this paper is only concerned with recognizing discourse acts, particularly complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt.","Our system's knowledge about how to perform actions is contained in a library 6 We would like to thank one of the anonymous reviewers and Ingrid Zukerrnan for bringing this work to our attention. 11 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 of discourse, problem-solving, and domain recipes (Pollack 1990). Our representation of a recipe includes a header giving the action defined by the recipe, the recipe type, preconditions, applicability conditions, constraints, a body, effects, and a goal. The recipe type is primitive, specialization, or decomposition. If the recipe type is primitive, then the body of the recipe is empty and the header action corresponds with a primitive action in the domain. In a specialization recipe, the body gives a set of alternative ways of performing the header action (Pollack 1990; Kautz 1990). For example, one might earn credit in a course either by taking the course for credit or getting credit by exam. In a decomposition recipe, the body gives a set of subactions that constitute performing the header action. A # preceding a subaction in the body of a decomposition recipe indicates that the subaction can be performed any number of times (including zero). 7 Constraints limit the allowable instantiation of variables in each component of a recipe (Litman and Allen 1987). For example, a variable might have a constraint requiring that it be instantiated with a proposition that is salient at the current point in the discourse. Which instantiations of variables will satisfy the constraints is part of the shared knowledge of the participants. 8","Applicability conditions (Carberry 1987) are conditions that must be satisfied in order for a recipe to be reasonable to pursue in a given situation. The applicability conditions of our discourse recipes capture attitudes (beliefs and wants) that the agent of the action must hold in order for it to be felicitous (Searle 1970). Applicability conditions differ from preconditions in that one can plan to satisfy preconditions but it is generally anomalous to try to satisfy applicability conditions. For example, in order for _agent1 to inform _agent2 of _proposition, _agent1 must believe that _proposition is true and must not believe that _agent2 already believes _proposition. It would be anomalous for _agent1 to try to adopt the proposition as one of his beliefs solely for the sake of being able to inform someone else of it, and similarly it would be anomalous for _agent1 to get _agent2 to disbelieve a proposition so that _agent1 can subsequently inform him of it. 9","Belief intervals are used in the applicability conditions to specify the range of strengths that an agent's behefs may assume. Intervals such as [bi:bj] specify a strength of belief between bi and bj inclusive. For example, Figure 3 displays the recipes for the Inform and Tell discourse acts. The goal of the Inform action, believe (_agent2, _proposition, [C : C] ), is that _agent2 be certain that _proposition is true. On the other hand, believe(_agent2, _proposition, [CN:S]) means that _agent2 is not convinced that _proposition is true (i.e., _agent2 could have any belief ranging from being certain that _proposition is false to having a strong belief that it is true). Thus the applicability condition believe (_agent l, believe (_agent2, _proposition, [CN : S] ), [0 :C] ) of the"]},{"title":"Inform","paragraphs":["act in Figure 3 means that _agent I must 7 In this work, we are interested in understanding, not generating, responses. However, a generation system would pursue an action preceded by # if its applicability conditions are satisfied and the system does not believe that the action's goal will be satisfied if the action is omitted. The belief reasoning techniques described in Cawsey et al. (1992) can be used in modeling this. 8 In this research, we have assumed that the participants have equivalent knowledge of language and maintain equivalent discourse models, and we have not addressed the problem of recognizing miscommunication. 9 How applicability conditions on discourse acts are checked during planning is an interesting question that requires further research. Consider an agent who wants to determine whether a proposition is true; the agent might accomplish this by asking another agent about the proposition. An applicability condition on asking another agent is that the speaker wants to know the other agent's belief about the proposition. But when did this want come into existence? It certainly must be satisfied at the time the question is asked, but instead of being part of the initial state, it appears to result from the speaker's decision about how to obtain the desired information. 12 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues Discourse Recipe Action: Inform(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition)"]},{"title":"{_agent1 informs _agent2 of_proposition} Recipe-Type:","paragraphs":["Decomposition","Appl Cond: believe(_agentl, _proposition, [C:C])","believe(_agentl, believe(_agent2, _proposition, [CN:S]), [0:C])","Body: Tell(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition)","#Address-Behevability(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition)","Effects: believe(_agent2, want(_agentl, believe(_agent2, _proposition, [C:C])),"]},{"title":"[c:c])","paragraphs":["Goal: believe(_agent2, _proposition, [C:C]) Discourse Recipe Action: Tell(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition)"]},{"title":"{_agent1 tells _agent 2 of_proposition} Recipe-Type:","paragraphs":["Decomposition Appl Cond: believe(_agentl, _proposition, [C:C]) Body: Surface-Say-Prop(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition)","#Address-Understanding(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition) Effects: told-about(_agentl, _agent2, _proposition) Goal: beheve(_agent2, believe(_agentl, _proposition, [C:C]), [C:C]) Figure S Recipes for"]},{"title":"Inform","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Tell","paragraphs":["discourse acts. either be ignorant about _agent2's belief in _proposition or have some belief (possibly certain) that _agent2 is not already certain that _proposition is true, i.e., _agentl does not believe that _agent2 is already convinced that _proposition is true.

An that the speaker might be intending to perform with the utterance. In such a chain, action Ai contributes to the performance of its successor action Ai+l. For example, the semantic representation of an utterance such as \"Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture\" is Surface-Say-Prop(_agentl, _agent2, Teaches(Dr.Smith, Architecture)) A Surface-Say-Prop is a subaction in the recipe for a Tell discourse act, which in turn is a subaction in the recipe for an Inform discourse act. Thus chaining from the surface utterance produces a sequence of hypothesized discourse acts, each of which plays a role in the performance of its successor on the chain.","We have expanded on Litman and Allen's (1987) notion of constraint satisfaction and Allen and Perrault's (1980) use of beliefs. As described earlier, many of the applicability conditions in our discourse recipes are beliefs that the agent of the action must hold in order for the action to be felicitous. Our recognition algorithm requires that the system be able to plausibly ascribe these beliefs in hypothesizing a new action; if the belief ascription is implausible or if the constraints of the discourse recipe are not satisfied, the inference is rejected. 4.5 Evidence Actions As we claimed in Section 3, actions such as the expressions of doubt in utterances (14a) and (14b) (repeated in Figure 6) require evidence for their recognition. Let us further examine why this is the case. Figure 7 illustrates a situation in which we have several discourse acts (with different degrees of salience) that the agent might be expected to pursue.

As depicted in the figure, the process model can infer a chain of actions starting with some surface speech act surface-action(EA, CA, PROPD), up to some other action, action (EA, CA, PROPD), up to some other action, e-action (EA, CA, _propl, PROPD). The action e-action contains two propositions. One of these, PROPD, is instantiated by chaining from the earlier action, act ion (EA, CA, PROPD). However, the other proposition, _propl, cannot be instantiated by plan chaining; it must be instantiated by unification with a proposition from the existing dialogue context. For example, if e-action is identified as contributing to action-3 in the existing dialogue context, then _propl might be instantiated as PROPC. On the other hand, if e-action is identified as contributing to action-i, then _propl might be instantiated as PROPA. Chaining might suggest three possibilities (e-action could contribute to action-3, or to action-I, or to neither of them), and the relative salience of the propositions in the existing dialogue context is not sufficient to identify this relationship.","As a concrete example, consider again the dialogue segment in Figure 6 consisting of utterances (10)-(13) followed by one of utterances (14a)-(14c). After utterance (13),","15 These are actions on the active path of the dialogue model; the actions that are deepest on the active path are closer to the current focus of attention and are therefore regarded as more salient. 18 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues the actions on the active path of the dialogue model include (among others): action-l: Inform(CA, EA, Teaches(Smith,CS360)) action-2: Address-Unacceptance(EA,CA, Teaches(Smith,CS360), On-Sabbatical(Smith)) action-3: Inform(CA, EA, ~On-Sabbatical(Smith)) If EA utters (14a), (14b), or (14c), three inference paths can be constructed: one that links up to action-I, one that links up to action-3, and one that does not link up to any action on the active path. If CA utters (14a), then CA's action should be identified as contributing to action-3 above and thus the proposition being doubted should be recognized as ~On-Sabbatical(Smith), even though this proposition did not appear explicitly in EA's utterance. However, if EA utters (14b), then EA's action should be identified as contributing only to action-1 and the proposition being doubted therefore should be recognized as Teaches(Smith, CS360); in this case, we are rejecting the inference path that links up to action-3 even though action-3 is more salient at this point in the dialogue. On the other hand, if EA utters (14c), then EA's action should be recognized as not contributing to any of the actions on the active path and interpreted as merely seeking information about Dr. Smith. Since chaining and salience alone are insufficient to identify the correct interpretation, we need some additional mechanism.","We define an evidence-action (abbreviated e-action) to be an action that introduces a new parameter that cannot be directly instantiated by chaining from the utterance. We contend that such actions require evidence for their recognition. In our model, the relationship between _prop1 (the proposition whose instantiation must be inferred from the existing dialogue context) and PROPD (a proposition instantiated by chaining from the current utterance) is modeled in the applicability conditions of a recipe for e-action.

Our recognition algorithm captures the kinds of evidence identified in Section 3: 1) evidence provided by world knowledge, contextual knowledge, and the surface form of the utterance indicating that the applicability conditions for an e-action are satisfied, and 2) linguistic evidence from clue words suggesting a generic discourse action.","Grosz and Sidner (1986) claim that when evidence is available from one source, less evidence should be required from others. Thus, if there is evidence indicating that the applicability conditions for a discourse act hold, then less linguistic evidence suggesting the discourse act should be required. This is the case for interpreting (9) (repeated below) as an expression of doubt. (7) EA: What is Dr. Smith teaching? (8) CA: Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture. 19 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 (9) EA: Isn't Dr° Brown teaching Architecture? Even though there is no linguistic clue word suggesting an Express-Doubt discourse act, there is enough evidence from the surface form of the utterance and from world and contextual knowledge to correctly interpret (9) as an expression of doubt at the proposition conveyed by (8).","Let us examine this evidence in more detail. The applicability conditions of the Express-Doubt discourse act (see Figure 4) specify that EA must have some belief in each of the following: a° b. C. that CA believes that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture; that Dr. Brown is teaching Architecture; and that Dr. Brown teaching Architecture is an indication that Dr. Smith is not teaching Architecture. Belief (c) models how the proposition in utterance (9) (that Dr. Brown is teaching Architecture) relates to the proposition in the existing dialogue context (that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture). Therefore, evidence that EA holds belief (c) (that Dr. Brown teaching Architecture is an indication that Dr. Smith is not teaching Architecture) is particularly significant since it shows how the utterance relates to the preceding discourse.","The system has evidence \"for all three applicability conditions. The system's evidence that EA holds belief (a) is provided by beliefs derived from the goal of the Tell discourse act. In utterance (8), CA initiates a Tell discourse act as part of an Inform discourse act; thus immediately after (8), both the Inform and the Tell are part of the existing dialogue context. If (9) is indeed an expression of doubt, then it contributes to the Inform act by addressing the believability of the communicated proposition. In this case, EA will have implicitly conveyed that EA understood CA's previous utterance, i.e., EA will have passed up the opportunity to contribute to the Tell discourse act that is a child of the Inform act, and will have thereby implicitly conveyed that the Tell act was successful. This notion of implicit acceptance is discussed further in Section 4.6. Since the goal of CA's Tell act is that EA believe that CA believes that Dr. Smith teaches Architecture, the hypothesis that the Tell act has completed successfully (and therefore that its goal has been achieved) provides evidence that (a) is a belief held by EA.","The surface form of (9) provides evidence that EA believes (b), since it conveys an uncertain but still strong belief that Dr. Brown is teaching Architecture. Finally, if the system's model of a stereotypical user indicates that users typically believe that each course has only one instructor, then this world knowledge provides evidence that EA believes (c). Thus, the system has evidence for all three of the applicability conditions. In addition, contextual knowledge indicates that the single constraint on the Express-Doubt discourse act is satisfied--namely, that proposition Pdoubt be salient at this point in the dialogue. Thus, the system would recognize (9) as an expression of doubt.","However, \"Isn't Dr. Smith an excellent teacher?\" would not be recognized as an expression of doubt because the system would have no evidence that EA believes that being an excellent teacher suggests that Dr. Smith is not teaching Architecture. Thus, world knowledge helps the system to correctly differentiate between utterances that are expressions of doubt and those that are not.","On the other hand, if there is sufficient linguistic knowledge suggesting a particular discourse action, then the applicability conditions should be attributed to the 20 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues speaker as long as they are plausible. So, if the clue word but is used, then a nonacceptance discourse action such as expressing doubt should be easier to recognize (i.e., should require less evidence that the applicability conditions hold) than if the clue word is not present. Thus, if EA said \"But isn't Dr. Smith an excellent teacher?\", then even though there is no world knowledge indicating that all of the applicability conditions hold, the linguistic clue word is sufficient evidence to interpret this utterance as an expression of doubt.","The concept of accommodation in conversation (Lewis 1979; Thomason 1990) (re-moving obstacles to the speaker's goals) suggests that a listener might recognize a surface negative question as an expression of doubt by accommodating a belief about some incompatibility between the proposition conveyed by the surface negative question and a proposition that might be doubted. But in the extreme case, this means that any surface negative question could be recognized as an expression of doubt. We contend that there should be evidence for such recognition. This is similar to Pollack's model of plan recognition (Pollack 1990) that can account for user misconceptions; instead of inferring a relationship between every query and the speaker's goal, Pollack requires that the system apply only well-motivated rules that hypothesize principled variations of the system's own beliefs and that the system treat as incoherent any queries that cannot be explained via these rules. (Pollack's example of incoherence is the query \"I want to talk to Kathy, so I need to find out how to stand on my head.\") In our model we look for evidence of incompatibility, and in our implemented system this evidence takes the form of stereotypical befiefs about the domain. While our implementation does not include other means of deducing an incompatibility, they are not precluded by our theory but are left for future work. Moreover, it should be noted that if the speaker intends for the hearer to recognize the expression of doubt from the incompatibility between the doubted proposition and the proposition that the speaker is contending is true, then the speaker must believe that the belief about the incompatibility is a mutual belief. Our stereotypical befiefs fall into this category. In other cases, the clue word but causes the listener to accommodate a belief about incompatibility that he might not otherwise have done and thereby recognize the expression of doubt.","So, in the case of complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, the system should require evidence for recognizing the discourse act and should prefer to recognize discourse acts for which there is multiple evidence: both linguistic clue words suggesting the generic discourse act and evidence suggesting that the applicability conditions for a particular discourse act are satisfied. However, the system should be willing to accept just one kind of evidence when that is all that is available."]},{"title":"4.6 Implicit Acceptance","paragraphs":["In a collaborative task-oriented dialogue, the participants are working together to construct a plan for accomplishing a task.

Similarly, if a listener does not believe a communicated proposition, he must convey this disagreement as soon as possible (Walker and Whittaker 1990). But by questioning the validity of a proposition, the listener conveys that he believes that he understood the utterance. As Clark and Schaefer (1989) note, by passing up the opportunity to ask for a repair, a listener conveys that he has understood an utterance.

This dialogue model contains three levels of tree structures, one for each kind of action discussed in Section 4.2 (domain, problem-solving, and discourse) with links among the actions on different levels. At the lowest level, the discourse actions are represented; these actions may contribute to the problem-solving actions at the middle level which, in turn, may contribute to the domain actions at the highest level.

Due to space limitations, we will only discuss two interesting features of the dialogue and its processing by our system. Utterance (30) illustrates the use of a linguistic clue word to suggest an expression of doubt.

Since the proposition Teaches (Dr. Hart, CS510) is closest to the existing focus of attention in the discourse tree, it is the most salient of the three propositions that are open for rejection. Utterance (33) is therefore interpreted as expressing doubt at the proposition that Dr. Hart is teaching CS510 by contending that it is a graduate-level course. Thus contextual knowledge arbitrates when equivalent evidence is available for several specific discourse acts. 6. Evaluation and Future Work We undertook an evaluation of our prototype system both to assess whether it derived appropriate interpretations of utterances and to identify areas for further research. We obtained eight human volunteers, six of whom are not engaged in NLP research and two of whom are involved in unrelated NLP projects. The subjects were given a set of world knowledge stereotypically believed in the domain, such as that faculty on sabbatical do not normally teach. The subjects were presented with a set of dialogues and asked to analyze several utterances from each dialogue. The selected utterances did not include simple questions initiating the dialogue or straightforward answers to questions, since it seemed likely that the subjects would agree with the system's interpretation and thus the results would be biased in favor of the system. The selected utterances did include surface negative questions (both with and without a clue word"]},{"title":"but),","paragraphs":["statements interpreted by our system as support for a previous assertion or as explanations about why a proposition was not in conflict with a previous claim, and examples of implicit acceptance.","For each utterance selected for analysis, the subjects were given a suggested interpretation, and asked whether the suggested interpretation was reasonable and whether they could identify a better interpretation. 27 For 15 of 20 utterances, the subjects unanimously believed that the system's interpretation was best. It should be noted there was unanimous agreement that utterance (42) below should be interpreted as an expression of doubt but that utterance (39) should not.

When the subjects did not interpret the utterance as an expression of doubt (see below), five of them contended that a better interpretation would be that EA was seeking verification of the queried proposition. Since our system already recognizes from the surface negative question that the speaker has a strong (but uncertain) belief in the queried proposition, it is easy to extend our system so that it can explicitly identify a"]},{"title":"Seek-Veri~cation","paragraphs":["discourse act.","The other category for which there was disagreement was surface negative questions where a clue word was not present and the stereotypical domain knowledge did not provide a conflict. In two of five instances, some subjects used their own experience to identify a mutual belief that might suggest a conflict, such as the belief that sometimes certain faculty are not allowed to teach graduate level courses. While this knowledge cannot be captured as a default rule, it does represent a kind of shared experiential knowledge that would provide weak evidence for a potential conflict. However, it should be noted that our subjects were split on how these problematic cases should be interpreted, agreeing with the system's interpretation slightly more than half the time. There was also another such surface negative question where one subject viewed the system's interpretation as reasonable but argued that an expression of doubt would be a better interpretation. In order to derive this interpretation, the subject posited an attribute for the speaker that was neither evident from the dialogue nor stereotypically true. (The other subjects agreed that the system's interpretation was best.) These examples bear on the issue of accommodation mentioned in Section 4.5.1, since one could argue that the subjects who interpreted the utterances as expressions of doubt were trying to accommodate an incompatibility. This is particularly true in the last instance where the subject found it necessary to resort to nonshared knowledge in making the interpretation. However, it is unclear whether a speaker would expect a listener to recognize such utterances as expressions of doubt without additional clues. As noted below, our future research will consider other forms of evidence (gestural and intonational) in order to resolve such ambiguous utterances.","After they had finished analyzing the dialogues, we asked the subjects to construct three dialogues containing an expression of doubt and to explain why the expression of doubt should be interpreted as such. While these dialogues provided no contradic-tions to our approach, they did provide a couple of interesting examples, such as the following dialogue, that suggest areas for future work. (43) EA: We have basil, parsley, and oregano, but we need marjoram. (44) CA: Isn't marjoram the same as oregano? Clearly (44) is expressing doubt at the claim conveyed by (43), but it relies on shared world knowledge that if a list contains X items, the X items are presumed to be different. Our system does not currently include such knowledge.","Our subjects commented that intonation and facial gesture might alter their interpretation of the utterances in the dialogues; we are beginning research that will take these kinds of evidence into account (Carberry, Chu-Carroll, and Lambert 1996). In addition, we will be expanding the kinds of world knowledge incorporated into our system, and will be considering both the strength of different pieces of evidence and how several pieces of weak evidence affect interpretation. We would also like to extend our use of linguistic clues to include a wide variety of clue words and phrases and to recognize the functions that these words can play. In addition, we are developing a plan-based response generation component (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994). 43 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 Initial work on this component includes a subsystem that can identify what evidence to present to a user when conflicts arise (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995b, 1998) and what information to request when the system cannot rationally decide whether to accept a proposition conveyed by the user (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995a, 1998).","We will also be investigating the scale-up of our system as we extend its coverage. Part of the motivation for the content of the current discourse recipes was their future extension to other domains, such as tutoring. For example, as discussed in Section 4.2.1, the formulation of our Ask-Ref recipe allows it to be used as a subaction of a future Test-Knowledge discourse act since the recipe does not presume that the speaker is ignorant about the correct value of the requested term. This should aid in extending the kinds of discourse acts that can be handled. Although transporting our system to another domain will require encoding new domain knowledge and new domain recipes, the recipes for discourse and problem-solving acts are domain-independent and thus will remain unchanged. Moreover, the knowledge captured in our recipes is communicative knowledge shared by dialogue participants; we believe that such communicative knowledge (such as how to express doubt) is finite although the possible intentions (such as the intention of expressing doubt at Dr. Smith teaching CS360) are infinite. 7. Other Related Work 7.1 Grosz and Sidner's Theory of Discourse Processing Grosz and Sidner (1986) postulated a theory of discourse structure that included linguistic, intentional, and attentional components, and they argued that the dominance and satisfaction-precedes relationships between discourse segments must be identified in order to determine discourse structure. They also noted three kinds of information that contribute to determining the purposes of discourse segments and their relationship to one another: linguistic markers, utterance-level intentions, and general knowledge about actions and objects. Subsequently Lochbaum (1994) developed an algorithm based on Grosz and Sidner's SharedPlan model (Grosz and Sidner 1990) that recognizes discourse segment purposes and discourse structure.","We contend that, in order to understand utterances and respond appropriately, it is necessary not only to determine the structure of the discourse but also to identify the communicative acts that an agent intends to perform with an utterance. 2s For example, if a listener does not recognize when an utterance such as \"Wasn't Dr. Smith on campus yesterday?\" is expressing doubt, then the listener's response might fail to address the reasons for this doubt. Our research provides a computational algorithm that uses multiple knowledge sources to recognize complex discourse acts, including expressions of doubt, and to identify their relationship to one another. This algorithm and our strategy for recognizing implicit acceptance enable us to model negotiation subdialogues, something that previous systems have been unable to handle. 7.2 Argument Understanding Systems Several researchers have built argument understanding systems, but none has addressed participants coming to an agreement or mutual belief about a particular situation, either because the researchers investigated monologues only (Cohen 1987; Cohen and Young 1991), or because they assumed that dialogue participants do not change","28 In a dialogue, Grosz and Sidner's discourse segment purpose is intended to capture the purpose of a segment consisting of a series of utterances by both participants, not the communicative intentions underlying each participant's discourse actions. 44 Carberry and Lambert Modeling Negotiation Subdialogues their minds (Flowers, McGuire, and Birnbaum 1982; Quilici 1991). Cohen (1987) developed an argument understanding system that used clue words and an evidence oracle to build a discourse structure for arguments based on which utterances served as support for other utterances. Cohen's model, however, handles only monologues, so responses to arguments are not modeled in her system. Birnbaum, Flowers, Dyer, and McGuire (Flowers and Dyer 1984; McGuire, Birnbaum, and Flowers 1981; Birnbaum, Flowers, and McGuire 1980) developed a system that finds flaws in arguments and determines how to respond. Quilici (1991) created a system in which agents respond to each other's arguments based on a justification pattern that will support the agent's position. Both Quilici and Birnbaum et al., however, assume that all participants in an argument will retain their opinion throughout the course of the argument, and concentrate mainly on how to find flaws in arguments and construct responses based on those findings; they do not address actually winning arguments. Reichman (1981) modeled informal debates by using her idea of context spaces and expectations to determine who should respond and what possible topics might be addressed. However, she does not provide a detailed computational mechanism for recognizing the role of each utterance in a debate. 7.3 Models of Collaborative Behavior Several models of discourse have recently been built which view conversation as a kind of collaborative behavior in which speakers try to make themselves understood and listeners work with speakers to help speakers attain this goal.","Clark and Schaefer (1989) contend that utterances must be \"grounded,\" or understood, by both parties, but they do not address conflicts in belief, only lack of understanding. Walker (1992) has found many occasions of redundancy in collaborative dialogues, and explains these by claiming that people repeat themselves in order to ensure that each utterance has been understood. 29 Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1990) propose a collaborative model of dialogue in which referring is viewed as a collaborative process and each conversation unit is viewed as a contribution, which consists of 1) an utterance that performs a referring action, and 2) the utterances required to understand the referent described in the utterance. Heeman (1991) implemented this model in a plan-based collaborative model of dialogue that is able to plan and recognize referring expressions and their corrections.","Other collaborative models assume that two participants are working together to achieve a common goal (Cohen and Levesque 1990a, 1991a, 1991b; Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner 1990; Lochbaum 1991; Grosz and Sidner 1990; Searle 1990). Searle (1990) proposes a model in which the two agents working together have a joint intention, a \"we intention,\" instead of individual intentions. Cohen and Levesque (1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1991a, 1991b) have developed a formal theory in which agents are jointly committed to accomplishing a goal, so both parties have individual intentions to accomplish the goal as part of their joint commitment. Grosz, Lochbaum, and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner 1990; Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner 1990; Lochbaum 1991) have specified a system in which two agents are working to accomplish some common goal by build-ing a \"shared plan\" in which each agent holds certain beliefs and intentions. These beliefs and intentions indicate that the agents intend to perform some joint action, and that they believe they can perform this action. All of these models indicate the need for modeling collaborative dialogue, but none suggests a system that can handle the","29 Another reason for repetition, she claims, is for centering (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), but she concentrates on repetitions that give evidence of understanding. 45 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 kind of negotiation subdialogues that people often engage in when trying to negotiate their conflicts in belief, even when they are both working towards the same goal."]},{"title":"8. Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a plan-based model for handling cooperative negotiation subdialogues. Our system infers both the communicative actions that people pursue when speaking and the beliefs underlying these actions. Beliefs, and the strength of these beliefs, are recognized from the surface form of utterances and from the explicit and implicit acceptance of previous utterances. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse actions combines linguistic, contextual, and world knowledge in a unified framework. By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to model negotiation subdialogues. Since negotiation is an integral part of multiagent activity, our process model addresses an important aspect of cooperative interaction and thus is a step toward an intelligent and robust natural language consultation system."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-9122026.
