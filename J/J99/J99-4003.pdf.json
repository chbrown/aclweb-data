Heeman* Oregon Graduate Institute James F. Allen t University of Rochester Interactive spoken dialogue provides many new challenges for natural language understanding systems. One of the most critical challenges is simply determining the speaker's intended utterances: both segmenting a speaker's turn into utterances and determining the intended words in each utterance. Even assuming perfect word recognition, the latter problem is complicated by the occurrence of speech repairs, which occur where speakers go back and change (or repeat) something they just said. The words that are replaced or repeated are no longer part of the intended utterance, and so need to be identified. Segmenting turns and resolving repairs are strongly intertwined with a third task: identifying discourse markers. Because of the interactions, and interactions with POS tagging and speech recognition, we need to address these tasks together and early on in the processing stream. This paper presents a statistical language model in which we rede~'ne the speech recognition problem so that it includes the identification of POS tags, discourse markers, speech repairs, and intonational phrases. By solving these simultaneously, we obtain better results on each task than addressing them separately. Our model is able to identify 72% of turn-internal intonational boundaries with a precision of 71%, 97% of discourse markers with 96% precision, and detect and correct 66% of repairs with 74% precision. 1. Introduction Consider the following example from the Trains corpus (Heeman and Allen 1995). Example 1 (d93-13.3 utt63) um it'll be there it'll get to Dansville at three a.m. and then you wanna do you take tho- want to take those back to Elmira so engine E two with three boxcars will be back in Elmira at six a.m. is that what you wanna do In order to understand what the speaker was trying to say, the reader probably segmented the above into a number of sentence-like segments, utterances, as follows. Example 1 Revisited um it'll be there it'll get to Dansville at three a.m. and then you wanna do you take tho- want to take those back to Elmira so engine E two with three boxcars will be back in Elmira at six a.m. is that what you wanna do * Computer Science and Engineering, P.O.

E-mail: james@cs.rochester.edu (~) 1999 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Even this does not fully capture what the speaker was intending to convey. The first and second utterances contain speech repairs, where the speaker goes back and changes (or repeats) something she just said. In the first, the speaker changed it'll be there to it'll get to; in the second, she changed you wanna to do you take tho-, which she then further revised. The speaker's intended utterances are thus as follows: 1 Example 1 Revisited Again um it'll get to Dansville at three a.m. and then do you want to take those back to Elmira so engine E two with three boxcars will be back in Elmira at six a.m. is that what you wanna do","The tasks of segmenting speakers' turns into utterance units and resolving speech repairs are strongly intertwined with a third task: identifying whether words, such as so, well, and right, are part of the sentential content or are being used as discourse markers to relate the current speech to the preceding context. In the example above, the second and third utterances begin with discourse markers. 1.1 Utterance Units and Intonational Phrases As illustrated above, understanding a speaker's turn necessitates segmenting it into individual utterance units. However, there is no consensus as to how to define an utterance unit (Traum and Heeman 1997). The manner in which speakers break their speech into intonational phrases undoubtedly plays a major role in its definition. Intonational phrase endings are signaled through variations in the pitch contour, segmental lengthening, and pauses. Beach (1991) demonstrated that hearers can use intonational information early on in sentence processing to help resolve syntactic ambiguities. Bear and Price (1990) showed that a parser can use automatically extracted intonational phrasing to reduce ambiguity and improve efficiency. Ostendorf, Wightman, and Veilleux (1993) used hand-labeled intonational phrasing to do syntactic disambiguation and achieved performance comparable to that of human listeners. Due to their significance, we will focus on the task of detecting intonational phrase boundaries. 1.2 Speech Repairs The on-line nature of spoken dialogue forces conversants to sometimes start speaking before they are sure of what they want to say. Hence, the speaker might need to go back and repeat or modify what she just said. Of course there are many different reasons why speakers make repairs; but whatever the reason, speech repairs are a normal occurrence in spoken dialogue. In the Trains corpus, 23% of speaker turns contain at least one repair and 54% of turns with at least 10 words contain a repair.","Fortunately for the hearer, speech repairs tend to have a standard form. As illustrated by the following example, they can be divided into three intervals, or stretches of speech: the reparandum, editing term, and alteration. 2 1 The speech that was revised cannot simply be thrown out since it might contain information, such as the identity of an anaphoric reference as the following example shows: Peter was well he wasfired. 528 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Example 2 (d92a-2.1 utt29) that's the one with the bananas I mean that's taking the bananas reparandum ip editing terms alteration The reparandum is the stretch of speech that the speaker is replacing, and can end with a word fragment, where the speaker interrupts herself during the middle of a word. The end of the reparandum is the interruption point and is often accompanied by a disruption in the intonational contour. This can be optionally followed by the editing term, which can consist of filled pauses, such as um or uh or cue phrases, such as I mean, well, or let's see. Reparanda and editing terms account for 10% of the words in the Trains corpus. The last part is the alteration, which is the speech that the speaker intends as the replacement for the reparandum. In order for the hearer to determine the intended utterance, he must detect the repair and determine the extent of the reparandum and editing term. We refer to this latter process as correcting the speech repair. In the example above, the speaker's intended utterance is that's the one that's taking the bananas.","Hearers seem to be able to effortlessly understand speech with repairs in it, even when multiple repairs occur in a row. In laboratory experiments, Martin and Strange (1968) found that attending to speech repairs and the content of an utterance are mutually inhibitory, and Bard and Lickley (1997) found that subjects have difficulty remembering the actual words in the reparandum. Listeners must be resolving repairs very early on in processing the speech. Earlier work by Lickley and colleagues (Lickley, Shillcock, and Bard 1991; Lickley and Bard 1992) strongly suggests that there are prosodic cues across the interruption point that hearers make use of in detecting repairs. However, little progress has been made in detecting speech repairs based solely on acoustical cues (cf. Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992; Nakatani and Hirschberg 1994; O'Shaughnessy 1994; Shriberg, Bates, and Stolcke 1997). 1.2.1 Classification of Speech Repairs. Psycholinguistic work in speech repairs and in understanding the implications that they pose for theories of speech production (e.g. Levelt 1983; Blackmer and Mitton 1991; Shriberg 1994) has come up with a number of classification systems. Categories are based on how the reparandum and alteration differ, for instance whether the alteration repeats the reparandum, makes it more appropriate, or fixes an error in the reparandum. Such an analysis can shed light on where in the production system the error and its repair originated. Our concern, however, is in computationally resolving repairs. The relevant features are those that the hearer has access to and can make use of in detecting and correcting a repair. Following loosely in the footsteps of the work of Hindle (1983), we divide them into the following categories: fresh starts, modification repairs, and abridged repairs.","Fresh starts occur where the speaker abandons the current utterance and starts again, where the abandonment seems to be acoustically signaled either in the editing term or at the onset of the alteration. Example 3 illustrates a fresh start where the speaker abandons the partial utterance I need to send, and replaces it by the question how many boxcars can one engine take. 2 Our notation is adapted from Levelt (1983). We follow Shriberg (1994) and Nakatani and Hirschberg (1994) in using reparandum to refer to the entire interval being replaced. We use alteration in the same way. 529 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Example 3 (d93-14.3 utt2) I need to send let's see how many boxcars can one engine take reparandum ip editing terms alteration For fresh starts, there can sometimes be little or even no correlation between the reparandum and alteration. Although it is usually easy to determine the reparandum onset, initial discourse markers and preceding intonational phrases can prove problematic.","The second type are modification repairs, which comprise the remainder of repairs with a nonempty reparandum. The example below illustrates this type of repair. Example 4 (d92a-1.2 utt40) you can carry them both on","J reparandum lp","tow both on the same engine Y alteration Modification repairs tend to have strong word correspondences between the reparandum and alteration, which can help the hearer determine the reparandum onset as well as signal that a repair occurred. In the example above, there are word matches on the instances of both and on, and a replacement of the verb carry by tow. Modification repairs can in fact consist solely of the reparandum being repeated by the alteration.","The third type are the abridged repairs. These repairs consist of an editing term, but with no reparandum, as the following example illustrates. Example 5 (d93-14.3 utt42)","we need to um manage to get the bananas to Dansville more quickly T v Ip editing terms For these repairs, the hearer has to determine that an editing term occurred, which can be difficult for phrases such as let's see or well since they can also have a sentential interpretation. The hearer also has to determine that the reparandum is empty. As the example above illustrates, this is not necessarily a trivial task because of the spurious word correspondences between need to and manage to. 1.3 Discourse Markers Phrases such as so, now, firstly, moreover, and anyways can be used as discourse markers (Schiffrin 1987). Discourse markers are conjectured to give the hearer information about the discourse structure, and so aid the hearer in understanding how the new speech or text relates to what was previously said and for resolving anaphoric refer-ences (Hirschberg and Litman 1993). Although discourse markers, such as firstly, and moreover, are not commonly used in spoken dialogue (Brown and Yule 1983), a lot of other markers are employed. These markers are used to achieve a variety of effects: such as signal an acknowledgment or acceptance, hold a turn, stall for time, signal a speech repair, or signal an interruption in the discourse structure or the return from one.","Although Schiffrin defines discourse markers as bracketing units of speech, she explicitly avoids defining what the unit is. We feel that utterance units are the building 530 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances blocks of spoken dialogue and that discourse markers operate at this level to relate the current utterance to the discourse context or to signal a repair in an utterance. In the following example, and then helps signal that the upcoming speech is adding new information, while so helps indicate a summary is about to be made. Example 6 (d92a-1.2 utt47) and then while at Dansville take the three boxcars so that's total of five 1.4 Interactions The tasks of identifying intonational phrases and discourse markers and detecting and correcting speech repairs are highly intertwined, and the solution to each task depends on the solution for the others. 1.4.1 Intonational Phrases and Speech Repairs. Phrase boundaries and interruption points of speech repairs share a number of features that can be used to identify them: there is often a pause at these events as well as lengthening of the final syllable before them. Even correspondences, traditionally associated with speech repairs, can cross phrase boundaries (indicated with \"%\"), as the following example shows. Example 7 (d93-8.3 utt73) that's all you need % you only need one boxcar % Second, the reparandum onset for repairs, especially fresh starts, often occurs at the onset of an intonational phrase, and reparanda usually do not span phrase boundaries. Third, deciding if filled pauses and cue phrases should be treated as abridged repairs can only be done by taking into account whether they are midutterance or not (cf. Shriberg and Lickley 1993), which is associated with intonational phrasing. 1.4.2 Intonational Phases and Discourse Markers. Discourse markers tend to be used at utterance boundaries, and hence have strong interactions with intonational phrasing. In fact, Hirschberg and Litman (1993) found that discourse markers tend to occur at the beginning of intonational phrases, while sentential usages tend to occur midphrase. Example 8 below illustrates so being used midutterance as a subordinating conjunction, not as a discourse marker. Example 8 (d93-15.2 utt9) it takes an hour to load them % just so you know %","Now consider the third turn of the following example in which the system is not using no as a quantifier to mean that there are not any oranges available, but as a discourse marker in signaling that the user misrecognized oranges as orange juice. 531 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 1 Frequency of discourse markers in the editing term of speech repairs and as the alteration onset. Abridged Modification Fresh Starts Number of repairs 423 1,301 671 DM in editing term 36 60 155 DM as alteration onset 8 126 147 Either 41 179 269 Example 9 (d93-11.1 utt109-111) system: so so we have three boxcars of oranges at Coming user: three boxcars of orange juice at Coming system: no um oranges The discourse marker interpretation is facilitated by the phrase boundary between no and oranges, especially since the determiner reading of no would be very unlikely to have a phrase boundary separating it from the noun it modifies. Likewise, the recognition of no as a discourse marker makes it more likely that there will be a phrase boundary following it. 1.4.3 Speech Repairs and Discourse Markers. Discourse markers are often used in the editing term to help signal that a repair occurred, and can be used to help determine if it is a fresh start (cf. Hindle 1983; Levelt 1983), as the following example illustrates. Example 10 (d92a-1.3 utt75) we have the orange juice in two oh reparandum zp et how many did we need Realizing that oh is being used as a discourse marker helps facilitate the detection of the repair, and vice versus. This holds even if the discourse marker is not part of the editing term, but is the first word of the alteration. Table 1 shows the frequency with which discourse markers co-occur with speech repairs. We see that a discourse marker is either part of the editing term or is the alteration onset for 40% of fresh starts and 14% of modification repairs. Discourse markers also play a role in determining the onset for fresh starts, since they are often utterance initial. 1.5 Interactions with POS Tagging and Speech Recognition Not only are the tasks of identifying intonational phrases and discourse markers and resolving speech repairs intertwined, but these tasks are also intertwined with identifying the lexical category or part of speech (POS) of each word, and the speech recognition problem of predicting the next word given the previous context.","Just as POS taggers for text take advantage of sentence boundaries, it is natural to assume that tagging spontaneous speech would benefit from modeling intonational phrases and speech repairs. This is especially true for repairs, since their occurrence disrupts the local context that is needed to determine the POS tags (Hindle 1983). In 532 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances the example below, both instances of load are being used as verbs; however, since the second instance follows a preposition, it could easily be mistaken for a noun."]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["11 (d93-12.4 utt44) by the time we load in load the bananas"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["reparandum ~p However, by realizing that the second instance of load is being used in a repair and corresponds to the first instance of load, its POS tag becomes obvious. Conversely, since repairs disrupt the local syntactic context, this disruption, as captured by the POS tags, can be used as evidence that a repair occurred, as shown by the following example."]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["12 (d93-13.1 utt90) I can run trains on the in the opposite direction reparandum alteration Here we have a preposition following a determiner, an event that only happens across the interruption point of a speech repair.","Just as there are interactions with POS tagging, the same holds for the speech recognition problem of predicting the next word given the previous context. For the lexical context can run trains on the, it would be very unlikely that the word in would be next. It is only by modeling the occurrence of repairs and their word correspondences that we can account for the speaker's words.","There are also interactions with intonational phrasing. In the example below, after asking the question what time do we have to get done by, the speaker refines this to be whether they have to be done by two p.m. The result, however, is that there is a repetition of the word by, but separated by a phrase boundary."]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["13 (d93-18.1 utt58) what time do we have to get done by % by two p.m. % By modeling the intonational phrases, POS taggers and speech recognition language models would be expecting a POS tag and word that can introduce a new phrase."]},{"title":"1.6 Modeling Speakers' Utterances","paragraphs":["In this paper, we address the problem of modeling speakers' utterances in spoken dialogue, which involves identifying intonational phrases and discourse markers and detecting and correcting speech repairs. We propose that these tasks can be done using local context and early in the processing stream. Hearers are able to resolve speech repairs and intonational phrase boundaries very early on, and hence there must be enough cues in the local context to make this feasible. We redefine the speech recognition problem so that it includes the resolution of speech repairs and identification of intonational phrases, discourse markers, and POS tags, which results in a statistical language model that is sensitive to speakers' utterances. Since all tasks are being resolved in the same model, we can account for the interactions between the tasks in a 533 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","Timing","laI,,~m6,n:","k /","It","takes","no","tit~","it,","cf,nple",".r","decemlde cars","~",".",".",".-..u...~","I¢","takes","1","hcmr","t.","le~d","t,e","unh~d any amcmm","¢~¢","carge,","¢,11","a","tram","Manuf~luring","O","J:","One","be,xcar oranges","c,,nwrts","into",".me","tanker","hxld.","Any","a,~,,mt","can","be","made","in","e~le","hmtr, Figure 1 Map used by the system in collecting the Trains corpus. framework that can compare alternative hypotheses for the speaker's turn. Not only does this allow us to model the speaker's utterance, but it also results in an improved language model, evidenced by both improved POS tagging and in better estimating the probability of the next word. Furthermore, speech repairs and phrase boundaries have acoustic correlates, such as pauses between words. By resolving speech repairs and identifying intonational phrases during speech recognition, these acoustic cues, which otherwise would be treated as noise, can give evidence as to the occurrence of these events, and further improve speech recognition results.","Resolving the speaker's utterances early on will not only help a speech recognizer determine what was said, but it will also help later processing, such as syntactic and semantic analysis. The literature (e.g., Bear and Price 1990; Ostendorf, Wightman, and Veilleus 1993) already indicates the usefulness of intonational information for syntactic processing. Resolving speech repairs will further simplify syntactic and semantic understanding of spontaneous speech, since it will remove the apparent ill-formedness that speech repairs cause. This will also make it easier for these processes to cope with the added syntactic and semantic variance that spoken dialogue seems to license. 1.7 Overview of the Paper We next describe the Trains corpus and the annotation of speech repairs, intonational phrases, discourse markers, and POS tags. We then introduce a language model that incorporates POS tagging and discourse marker identification. We then augment it with speech repair and intonational phrase detection, repair correction, and silence information, and give a sample run of the model. We then evaluate the model by analyzing the effects that each component of the model has on the other components. Finally, we compare our work with previous work and present the conclusions and future work. 2. The Trains Corpus One of the goals that we are pursuing at the University of Rochester is the development of a conversationally proficient planning assistant, which assists a user in constructing a plan to achieve some task involving the manufacture and shipment of goods in a railroad freight system (Allen et al. 1995). In order to do this, we need to know what kinds of phenomena occur in such dialogue. To this end, we have collected a corpus of human-human dialogues (Heeman and Allen 1995). The person playing the role of the system was given the map in Figure 1. The user was also given a map, but lacking 534 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Table 2 Size of the Trains corpus. Dialogues 98 Intonational Phrases 10,947 Speaker Turns 6,163 Turn-Internal Phrase Boundaries 5,535 Words 58,298 Abridged Repairs 423 Fragments 756 Modification Repairs 1,302 Filled Pauses 1,498 Fresh Starts 671 Discourse Markers 8,278 Editing Terms 1,128 the distances and timing information. The collection procedure was designed to make the setting as close to human-computer interaction as possible, but was not a Wizard of Oz scenario, where one person pretends to be a computer; rather, both participants know that they are speaking to a real person. Thus these dialogues provide a snapshot into an ideal human-computer interface that is able to engage in fluent conversation. Table 2 gives details about the Trains corpus. The corpus consists of six and a half hours of speech produced by 34 different speakers solving 20 different problems.","The Trains corpus provides natural examples of dialogue usage that spoken dialogue systems need to handle in order to carry on a dialogue with a user. For instance, the corpus contains instances of overlapping speech, back-channel responses, and turn taking: phenomena that do not occur in collections of single speaker utterances, such as ATIS (MADCOW 1992). The Trains corpus also differs from the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992) in that it is task oriented and has a limited domain, making it a more realistic domain for studying the types of conversations that people would want to have with a computer. 2.1 Word Transcription Table 3 gives a dialogue from the Trains corpus. Overlapping speech is indicated by the \"+\" markings. Each word was transcribed using its orthographic spelling, unless it was mispronounced and the speaker subsequently repairs the mispronunciation. Contractions, including words such as wanna, were transcribed as single words. Word fragments were annotated by spelling as much of the word as can be heard followed by a dash. If it was clear what word the speaker was saying, then the rest of the word was enclosed in parentheses before the dash. 2.2 POS and Discourse Marker Annotations Our POS tagset is based on the Penn tagset (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), but modified to include tags for discourse markers and end-of-turns, and to provide richer syntactic information (Heeman 1997). Table 4 lists our tagset with differences from the Penn tagset marked in bold. Contractions are annotated using \"A\" to conjoin the tag for each part; for instance, can't is annotated as MDARB.","Discourse marker usage is captured by the POS tags. The tag AC marks single word acknowledgments, such as okay, right, mm-hm, and no. The tag CC_D marks discourse conjuncts, such as and, so, and but. The tag RB_D marks discourse adverbials, such as then, now, actually, first, and anyway. Finally, UH_D marks interjections, such as oh, well, hm, and mm. Verbs used as discourse markers, such as wait, and see, are not given special markers, but are annotated as VB. No attempt has been made at analyzing multiword discourse markers, such as by the way and you know; however, phrases such as oh really and and then are treated as two individual discourse markers. 535 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 3 Transcription of dialogue d93-12.2.

As with the POS tags, \"A\" can be used in annotating contracted words. 3 2.4 Intonation Annotations For our intonation annotation, we have annotated the intonational phrase boundaries, using the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) definition (Silverman et al. 1992). Intonational phrases are determined by both the pitch contour and the perceived juncture between each pair of words, where the perceived juncture takes into account both interword pauses and preboundary lengthening (normalized duration of the final consonants). Labeling with the full ToBI annotation scheme is very time-consuming; hence, we labeled only the intonational phrase boundaries. 3. POS-based Language Model In this section, we present a speech recognition language model that incorporates POS tagging. Here, POS tags are viewed as part of the output of the speech recognizer rather than as intermediate objects. Not only is this syntactic information needed for 3 Shriberg (1994) also extends the scheme of Bear et al. (1993) to deal with overlapping repairs. 537 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 modeling the occurrence of speech repairs and intonational phrases, but it will also be useful for higher-level syntactic and semantic processes. Incorporating POS tagging can also be seen as a first step in tightening the coupling between speech recognition and natural language processing so as to be able to make use of richer knowledge of natural language than simple word-based language models provide. 3.1 Word-based Language Models The goal of speech recognition is to find the most probable sequence of words I;V given the acoustic signal A (Jelinek 1985). 1~ = arg mwax Pr(W]A) (1) Using Bayes' rule, we rewrite the above equation in the following manner.","Pr(A] W) Pr(W)","l~ = arg max (2) w Pr(A) Since Pr(A) is independent of the choice of W, we can simplify the above as follows.

However, no matter how large the corpus is, there will always be event-context pairs that have not been seen, or have been seen too rarely to accurately estimate the probability. To alleviate this problem, one must partition the contexts into equivalence classes and use these to compute the relative frequencies.

These are the same distributions that are needed by previous POS-based language models (Equation 5) and POS taggers (Church 1988; Charniak et al. 1993). However, these approaches simplify the context so that the lexical probability is just conditioned on the POS category of the word, and the POS probability is conditioned on just the preceding POS tags, which leads to the following two approximations. Pr(WiIWl,i_lDl,i) ~ Pr(WilDi) (8) Pr(DiIWu_lDl,i_l) ~ Pr(DiIDu_l) (9) However, to successfully incorporate POS information, we need to account for the full richness of the probability distributions, as will be demonstrated in Section 3.4.4. 3.3 Estimating the Probabilities To estimate the probability distributions, we follow the approach of Bahl et al. (1989) and use a decision tree learning algorithm (Breiman et al. 1984) to partition the context into equivalence classes. The algorithm starts with a single node. It then finds a question to ask about the node in order to partition the node into two leaves, each more informative as to which event occurred than the parent node. Information-theoretic metrics, such as minimizing entropy, are used to decide which question to propose. The proposed question is then verified using held-out data: if the split does not lead to a decrease in entropy according to the held-out data, the split is rejected and the node is not further explored. This process continues with the new leaves and results in a hierarchical partitioning of the context. After the tree is grown, relative frequencies are calculated for each node, and these probabilities are then interpolated with their parent node's probabilities using a second held-out dataset.","Using the decision tree algorithm to estimate probabilities is attractive since the algorithm can choose which parts of the context are relevant, and in what order.

For a categorical variable C, it searches over questions of the form: \"is C E S\", where S is a subset of the possible values of C.

The algorithm starts with each POS tag in a separate class and iteratively finds two classes to merge that results in the smallest loss of information about POS adjacency.

Instead, we view the word identities as a further refinement of the POS tags. We start the clustering algorithm with a separate class for each word and each tag that it takes on. Classes are only merged if the tags are the same. The result is a word classification tree for each tag. This approach means that the trees will not be polluted by words that are ambiguous as to their tag, as exemplified by the word loads, which is used in the corpus as a third-person present tense verb VBZ and as a plural noun NNS. Furthermore, this approach simplifies the clustering task because the hand annotations of the POS tags resolve a lot of the difficulty that the algorithm would otherwise have to learn. Hence, effective trees can be built even when only a small amount of data is available.","Figure 3 shows the classification tree for the personal pronouns (PRP). For reference, we also list the number of occurrences of each word for the POS tag. In the figure, we see that the algorithm distinguished between the subjective pronouns L we, and they, and the objective pronouns me, us, and them. The pronouns you and it can take both cases and were probably clustered according to their most common usage in the corpus. The class low is used to group singleton words, which do not have enough training data to allow effective clustering. In using the word identities with the decision tree algorithm, we restrict the algorithm from asking word questions when the POS tag for the word is not uniquely determined by previous questions. 3.3.4 Example Decision Tree. Figure 4 illustrates the top part of the tree that was grown for estimating the probability distribution of the POS tag of the current word.

The first set examines the effect of using richer contexts for estimating the word and POS probability distributions. The second set measures whether modeling discourse usage leads to better language modeling. Before we give the results, we explain the methodology that we use throughout the experiments. 3.4.1 Experimental Setup. In order to make the best use of our limited data, we tested our model using a sixfold cross-validation procedure. We divided the dialogues into six partitions and tested each partition with a model built from the other partitions. We divided the dialogues for each pair of speakers as evenly between the six partitions as possible. Changes in speaker are marked in the word transcription with the special token <turn>. The end-of-turn marker is not included in the POS results, but is included in the perplexity results. We treat contractions, such as that'll and gonna, as separate words, treating them as that and 'll for the first example, and going and ta for the second. We also changed all word fragments into a common token <fragment>.","Since current speech recognition rates for spontaneous speech are quite low, we have run the experiments on the hand-collected transcripts. In searching for the best sequence of POS tags for the transcribed words, we follow the technique proposed by Chow and Schwartz (1989) and only keep a small number of alternative paths by pruning the low probability paths after processing each word. 3.4.2 Perplexity. A way to measure the effectiveness of the language model is to measure the perplexity that it assigns to a test corpus (Bahl et al. 1977). Perplexity is an estimate of how well the language model is able to predict the next word of a test corpus in terms of the number of alternatives that need to be considered at each point. For word-based language models, with estimated probability distribution of Pr(wilwl,i_l) , the perplexity of a test set Wl,N is calculated as 2 H, where H is the","i ~----1 log2 Pr(wilwl,i-1) • entropy, which is defined as H = -~ 542 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Table 6 Using richer histories to estimate probabilities."]},{"title":"Pr(Wi[Di) Pr(Wi[Di-2,iWi-2,i-1) Pr(Di[Di-2,i-1) Pr(Di[Di-2,i-lWi-2,i-1)","paragraphs":["POS Errors 1,778 1,711 POS Error Rate 3.04 2.93 DM Errors 690 630 DM Error Rate 8.33 7.61 DM Recall 95.86 96.75 DM Precision 95.79 95.68 Word Perplexity 43.22 24.04 Branching Perplexity 47.25 26.35 Branching Perplexity.

The error rate is the number of errors in identifying an event over the number of times that the event occurred. 3.4.4 Using Richer Histories. Table 6 shows the effect of varying the richness of the information that the decision tree algorithm is allowed to use in estimating the POS and word probabilities. The second column uses the approximations given in Equation 8 and 9 and the third column uses the full context. The results show that adding the extra context has the biggest effect on the perplexity measures, decreasing the word perplexity by 44.4% from 43.22 to 24.04. The effect on POS tagging is less pronounced, but still gives a reduction of 3.8%. We also see a 8.7% improvement in identifying discourse markers. Hence, in order to use POS tags in a speech recognition language model, we need to use a richer context for estimating the probabilities than what is typically used. In other work (Heeman 1999), we show that our POS-based model results in lower perplexity and word error rate than a word-based model. 543 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 7 Effect of modeling discourse markers with special POS tags.

Table 7 shows the effect of modeling discourse markers by using special POS tags. In column two, we give the results of a model in which we use a POS tagset that does not distinguish discourse marker usage (P). The discourse conjuncts CC_D are collapsed into CC, discourse adverbials RB_D into RB, and acknowledgments AC and discourse interjections UH_D into UH_FP. The third column gives the results of the model in which we use our tagset that does distinguish discourse marker usage (D). To ensure a fair comparison, we do not penalize POS errors that result from a confusion between discourse and sentential usages. We see that modeling discourse markers results in a perplexity reduction from 24.20 to 24.04 and reduces the number of POS errors from 1,219 to 1,189, giving a 2.5% error rate reduction. Although the improvements in perplexity and POS tagging are small, they indicate that there are interactions, and hence discourse markers should be resolved at the same time as POS tagging and speech recognition word prediction. 4. Identifying Speech Repairs and Intonational Phrases In the previous section, we presented a POS-based language model that uses special tags to denote discourse markers. However, this model does not account for the occurrence of speech repairs and intonational phrases. Ignoring these events when building a statistical language model will lead to probabilistic estimates for the words and POS tags that are less precise, since they mix contexts that cross intonational boundaries and interruption points of speech repairs with fluent stretches of speech. However, there is not a reliable signal for detecting the interruption point of speech repairs (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992) nor the occurrence of intonational phrases. Rather, there are a number of different sources of information that give evidence as to the occurrence of these events. These sources include the presence of pauses, filled pauses, cue phrases, discourse markers, word fragments, word correspondences, and syntactic anomalies. Table 8 gives the number of occurrences for some of these features for each word in the corpus that is not turn-final nor part of the editing term of a speech repair. Each word is classified by whether it immediately precedes the interruption point of a fresh start, modification, or abridged repair, or ends an intonational phrase. All other words are categorized as fluent. The first row gives the number of occurrences of these events. The second row reports whether the word is a fragment. The third and fourth give the number of times the word is followed by a filled pause or discourse marker, respectively. The fifth and sixth rows report whether the word is followed by a pause that is less than or greater than 0.5 seconds, respectively. Pause durations were computed automatically with a speech recognizer constrained to the word transcription (Entropic Research Laboratory, Inc. 1994). The next row reports whether there is a word match that crosses the word with at most two intervening words, and the next row, those with at most five intervening words. 544 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Table 8 Occurrence of features boundaries. that signal speech repairs and intonational","Fluent Abridged Modification Fresh Intonational Feature Speech Repairs Repairs Starts Boundaries All 43,439 423 1,301 671 5,211 Fragments 7 0 481 150 0 Filled Pauses 97 374 114 71 358 Short Pauses 4,415 146 711 313 1,710 Long Pauses 1,537 121 176 186 1,622 Matching (2) 2,629 27 869 197 373 Matching (5) 11,479 94 1,517 575 1,375","From the table, it is clear that none of the cues on their own is a reliable indicator of speech repairs or intonational boundaries. For instance, 44.5% (1,622/3,642) of all long pauses occur after an intonational boundary and 13.3% occur after the interruption point of a speech repair. Conversely, 31.1% (1,622/5,211) of intonational boundaries are followed by a pause while 20.2% of all repairs are followed by a long pause. Hence, pauses alone do not give a complete picture of whether a speech repair or intonational boundary occurred. The same holds for filled pauses, which can occur both after the interruption point of a speech repair and in fluent speech, namely between utterances or after utterance-initial discourse markers. Word matchings can also be spurious, as evidenced by the 27 word matches with at most two intervening words across abridged repairs, as well as the matchings across intonational boundaries and fluent speech. Even syntactic ill-formedness at the interruption point is not always guaranteed, as the following example illustrates.

Dowding et al. 1993) will not be robust.","In this section, we augment our POS-based language model so that it also detects intonational boundaries and speech repairs, along with their editing terms. Although not all speech repairs have obvious syntactic anomalies, the probability distributions for words and POS tags are going to be different depending on whether they follow the interruption point of a speech repair, an intonational boundary, or fluent speech. So, it makes sense to take the speech repairs and intonational boundaries into account by directly modeling them when building the language model, which automatically gives us a means of detecting these events and better prediction of the speech that follows. To model the occurrence of intonational boundaries and speech repairs, we introduce three extra variables into the language model. The repair tag"]},{"title":"Ri, the","paragraphs":["editing term tag"]},{"title":"Ei","paragraphs":["and the intonation tag"]},{"title":"Ii.","paragraphs":["These utterance tags capture the discontinuities in the speaker's turn, and we use these discontinuities to better model the speech that follows. 4.1 Speech Repairs The repair tag indicates the occurrence of speech repairs. However, we not only want to know whether a repair occurred, but also the type of repair: whether it is a modification 545 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 repair, a fresh start, or an abridged repair. The type of repair is important since the strategy that a hearer uses to correct the repair depends on the type of repair. For fresh starts, the hearer must determine the beginning of the current utterance. For modification repairs, the hearer can make use of the correspondences between the reparandum and alteration to determine the reparandum onset. For abridged repairs, there is no reparandum, and so simply knowing that it is abridged gives the correction.","For repairs that do not have an editing term, the interruption point is where the local context is disrupted, and hence is the logical place to tag such repairs. For repairs with an editing term, there are two choices for marking the speech repair: either directly following the end of the reparandum, or directly preceding the onset of the alteration. The following example illustrates these two choices, marking them with Mod?. Example 16 (d92a-5.2 utt34) so we'll pick up a tank of Mod? uh Mod? the tanker of oranges The editing term by itself does not completely determine the type of repair. The alteration also helps to disambiguate the repair. Hence, we delay hypothesizing about the repair type until the end of the editing term, which should keep our search-space smaller, since we do not need to keep alternative repair type interpretations while processing the editing term. This leads to the following definition of the repair variable Ri for the transition between word Wi-1 and Wi: Mod","Ri = Can Abr null if Wi is the alteration onset of a modification repair if Wi is the alteration onset of a fresh start (or cancel) if Wi is the alteration onset of an abridged repair otherwise 4.2 Editing Terms Editing terms are problematic for tagging speech repairs since they separate the end of the reparandum from the alteration onset, thus separating the discontinuity that gives evidence that a fresh start or modification repair occurred. For abridged repairs, they separate the word that follows the editing term from the context that is needed to determine the identity of the word and its POS tag. If editing terms could be identified without having to consider the context, we could skip over them, but still use them as part of the context for deciding the repair tag (cf. Heeman and Allen 1994). However, this assumption is not valid for words that are ambiguous as to whether they are an editing term, such as let me see. Even filled pauses are problematic since they are not necessarily part of the editing term of a repair. To model editing terms, we use the variable E i to indicate the type of editing term transition between word W/_ 1 and Wi.

The context for each includes all of the words, POS, intonation, repair, and editing term tags that have been hypothesized, each as a separate piece of information. In principal, we could give this to the decision tree algorithm and let it decide what information to use in constructing equivalence classes. However, repairs, editing terms, and even intonation phrases do not occur in the same abundance as fluent speech and are not as constrained. Hence, it will be difficult to model the discontinuities that they introduce into the context. 547 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Consider the following example of a speech repair without an editing term. Example 19 (d92-1 utt53) engine E two picks Mod takes the two boxcars When predicting the first word of the alteration takes, it is inappropriate to ask about the preceding words, such as picks, without realizing that there is a modification repair in between. The same also holds for intonational boundaries and editing term pushes and pops. In the example below, a question should only be asked about is in the realization that it ends an intonational phrase. Example 20 (d92a-1.2 utt3) you'll have to tell me what the problem is % I don't have their labels Although the intonation, repair, and editing term tags are part of the context and so can be used in partitioning it, the question is whether this will happen. The problem is that null intonation, repair, and editing term tags dominate the training examples. So, we are bound to run into contexts in which there are not enough intonational phrases and repairs for the algorithm to learn the importance of using this information, and instead might blindly subdivide the context based on some subdivision of the POS tags. The solution is analogous to what is done in POS tagging of written text: we give a view of the words and POS tags with the non-null repair, non-null intonation, and editing term push and pop tags inserted. By inserting these tags into the word and POS sequence, it will be more difficult for the learning algorithm to ignore them. It also allows these tags to be grouped with other tags that behave in a similar way, such as change in speaker turn, and discourse markers.

Correcting Speech Repairs The previous section focused on the detection of speech repairs, editing terms, and intonational phrases. But for repairs, we have only addressed half of the problem; the other half is determining the extent of the reparandum. Hindle (1983) and Kikui and Morimoto (1994) both separate the task of correcting a repair from detecting it by assuming that there is an acoustic editing signal that marks the interruption point of speech repairs (as well as access to the POS tags and utterance boundaries). Although the model of the previous section detects repairs, this model is not effective enough. In fact, we feel that one of its crucial shortcomings is that it does not take into consideration the task of correcting repairs (Heeman, Loken-Kim, and Allen 1996). Since hearers are often unaware of speech repairs (Martin and Strange 1968), they must be able to correct them as the utterance is unfolding and as an indistinguishable event from detecting them and recognizing the words involved.","Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg (1992) proposed that multiple information sources need to be combined in order to detect and correct speech repairs. One of these sources 549 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 9 Occurrences of common repair structures. x. 362 mmr.mmr 10 mm.mxm 4 mxmx.mm 2 m.m 249 m.xm 10 xmmm.mmm 3 mmm.mmxm 2 r.r 136mxx.m 8 mrx.mr 3 mm.xxmm 2 mm.mm 85 mmmx.mmm 8 mrr.mrr 3 mm.mxxm 2 mx.m 76 m.xxm 8 mrmx.mrm 3 xr.r 2 mmx.mm 35 mrm.mrm 7 mmmmm.mmmmm 3 xmx.m 2 mr.mr 29 mx.xm 6 mm.xmm 3 xmmx.mm 2 mmm.mmm 22 xm.m 5 mmmmx.mmmm 2 rr.rr 2 rx.r 20 mmmmr.mmmmr 5 mrmm.mrmm 2 rm.rxm 2 rm.rm 20rmm.rmm 4 mmmxx.mmm 2 r.xr 2 xx. 12 mmxx.mm 4 mmm.xxxmmm 2 mmmm.mmmm 12 mmn~.mmmr 4 mmm.mxmm 2 includes a pattern-matching routine that looks for simple cases of word correspondences that could indicate a repair. However, pattern matching is too limited to capture the variety of word correspondence patterns that speech repairs exhibit (Heeman and Allen 1994). For example, the 1,302 modification repairs in the Trains corpus take on 160 different repair structures, even when we exclude word fragments and editing terms. Of these, only 47 occurred at least twice, and these are listed in Table 9. Each word in the repair is represented by its correspondence type: m for word match, r for replacement, and x for deletions and insertions. A period \".\" marks the interruption point. For example, the structure of the repair given in Example 14"]},{"title":"(engine two from Elmi(ra)- or engine three from Elmira)","paragraphs":["would be mrm.mrm.","To remedy the limitation of Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg (1992), we proposed that the word correspondences between the reparandum and alteration could be found by a set of well-formedness rules (Heeman and Allen 1994; Heeman, Loken-Kim, and Allen 1996). Potential repairs found by the rules were passed to a statistical language model (a predecessor of the model of Section 4), which pruned out false positives. Part of the context for the statistical model was the proposed repair structure found by the well-formedness rules. However, the alteration of a repair, which makes up half of the repair structure, occurs after the interruption point and hence should not be used to predict the occurrence of a repair. Hence this model was of limited use for integration into a speech recognizer.","Recently, Stolcke and Shriberg (1996) presented a word-based model for speech recognition that models simple word deletion and repetition patterns. They used the prediction of the repair to clean up the context and to help predict what word will occur next. Although their model is limited to simple types of repairs, it provides a starting point for incorporating speech repair correction into a statistical language model. 5.1 Sources of Information There are several sources of information that give evidence as to the extent of the reparandum of speech repairs. Probably the most widely used is the presence of word correspondences between the reparandum and alteration, both at the word level and at the level of syntactic constituents (Levelt 1983; Hindle 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992; Heeman and Allen 1994; Kikui and Morimoto 1994). Second, there tends to be a fluent transition from the speech that precedes the onset of the reparandum to the alteration (Kikui and Morimoto 1994). This source is very important for repairs that do not have initial retracing, and is the mainstay of the \"parser-first\" approach (e.g., 550 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Dowding et al. 1993)--keep trying alternative corrections until one of them parses. Third, there are certain regularities for where speakers restart. Reparandum onsets tend to be at constituent boundaries (Nooteboom 1980), and in particular, at boundaries where a coordinated constituent can be placed (Levelt 1983). Hence, reparandum onsets can be partially predicted without even looking at the alteration."]},{"title":"5.2 Our Approach","paragraphs":["Most previous approaches to correcting speech repairs have taken the standpoint of finding the best reparandum given the neighboring words. Instead, we view the problem as finding the reparandum that best predicts the following words. Since speech repairs are often accompanied by word correspondences (Levelt 1983; Hindle 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg 1992; Heeman and Allen 1994; Kikui and Morimoto 1994), the actual reparandum will better predict the words in the alteration of the repair. Consider the following example:"]},{"title":"Example","paragraphs":["24 (d93-3.2 utt45) which engine are we are we taking"]},{"title":"T","paragraphs":["reparandum lp In this example, if we predicted that a modification repair occurred and that the reparandum consists of are we, then the probability of are being the first word of the alteration would be very high, since it matches the first word of the reparandum. Conversely, if we are not predicting a modification repair with reparandum are we, then the probability of seeing are would be much lower. The same reasoning holds for predicting the next word, we: it is much more likely under the repair interpretation. So, as we process the words of the alteration, the repair interpretation will better account for the words that follow it, strengthening the interpretation.","When predicting the first word of the alteration, we can also make use of the second source of evidence identified in the previous section: the context provided by the words that precede the reparandum.

In fact, we see that the repair interpretation (with the correct reparandum onset) provides better context for predicting the first word of the alteration than a hypothesis that predicts either the wrong reparandum onset or predicts no repair at all. Hence, by predicting the reparandum of a speech repair, we no longer need to predict the onset of the alteration on the basis of the ending of the reparandum, as we did in Section 4.5. Such predictions are based on limited amounts of training data since only examples of speech repairs can be used. Rather, by first predicting the reparandum, we can use examples of fluent transitions to help predict the first word of the alteration.","We can also make use of the third source of information.

The first indicates the number of intonational phrase boundaries embedded in the proposed reparandum. The second indicates the number of discourse markers in the reparandum. Discourse markers at the beginning of the reparandum are not included, and if discourse markers appear consecutively, the group is only counted once.

In the Trains corpus, 35.6% of nonabridged repairs overlap.

Hence we include a variable that indicates whether there is a previous repair, and if there is, whether the proposed onset coincides with, precedes, or follows the alteration onset of the preceding repair. 5.4 The Active Repair Determining word correspondences is complicated by the occurrence of overlapping repairs.

Acoustic Cues Silence, as well as other acoustic information, can also give evidence as to whether an intonational phrase, speech repair, or editing term occurred, as was shown in Table 8.

For the repair variable, we only do the adjustment if the intonation tag is null and the editing term tag is not a push or pop. Figure 7 gives the adjustments for the resulting six equivalence classes of utterance tags. The ratio 557 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 between the curves gives the preference for one class over another, for a given silence duration. Silence durations were automatically obtained from a word aligner (Entropic Research Laboratory, Inc. 1994).","Silences between speaker turns are not used in computing the preference factor, nor is the preference factor used at such points. The end of the speaker's turn is determined jointly by both the speaker and the hearer. So when building a system that is designed to participate in a conversation, these silence durations will be partially determined by the system's turn-taking strategy. We also do not include the silence durations after word fragments since these silences were hand-computed. 7. Example This section illustrates the workings of the algorithm. As in Section 3.4.1, the algorithm is constrained to the word transcriptions and incrementally considers all possible interpretations (those that do not get pruned), proceeding one word at a time. Since resolving speech repairs is the most complicated part of our model, we focus on this using the following example of overlapping repairs. Example 35 (d92a-2.1 utt95)","okay % uh and that will take a total of um let's see total of s- of seven hours T \" \" ~ lp~:mod reparandum ~p:mod ~ reparandum Rather than try to show all of the competing hypotheses, we focus on the correct interpretation, which, for this example, happens to be the winning interpretation. We contrast the probabilities of the correct tags with those of its competitors. For reference, we give a simplified view of the context that is used for each probability. Full results of the algorithm will be given in the next section. 7.1 Predicting \"um\" as the Onset of an Editing Term Below, we give the probabilities involved in the correct interpretation of the word um given the correct interpretation of the words okay uh and that will take a total of. We start with the intonation variable. The correct tag of null is significantly preferred over the alternative, mainly because intonational boundaries rarely follow prepositions. Pr(Iw=null [ a total of) = 0.9997 Pr(h0=% I a total of) = 0.0003 For I10 = null, we give the alternatives for the editing term tag. Since an editing term is not in progress, the only possible values are Push and null. Pr(E10=Push ]a total of) = 0.242 Pr(E10=null [ a total of) = 0.758 With El0 = Push, the only allowable repair tag is null. Since no repair has been started, the reparandum onset O10 must be null. Similarly, since no repair is in progress, L10, the correspondence licensor, and C10, the correspondence type, must both be null.","We next hypothesize the POS tag. Below we list all of the tags that have a probability greater than 1%. Since we are starting an editing term, we see that POS tags 558 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances associated with the first word of an editing term have a high probability, such as UFLFP for um, AC for okay, CC_D for or, UH_D for well, and VB for the let in let's see. For D10 Pr(D10=UH_FP [ a total of Push) = 0.731 Pr(D10--AC [ a total of Push) = 0.177 Pr(D10=CC_D I a total of Push) = 0.026 Pr(D10=UH_D [ a total of Push) = 0.020 Pr(D10--VB I a total of Push) = 0.026 set to UH_FP, the word choices are um, uh, and er. Pr(W10=um [ a total of Push UH_FP) = 0.508 Pr(W10=uh [ a total of Push UH_FP) -- 0.488 Pr(Wl0=er I a total of Push UH_FP) = 0.004 Given the correct interpretation of the previous words, the probability of the filled pause um along with the correct tags is 0.090. 7.2 Predicting \"total\" as the Alteration Onset We now give the probabilities involved in the second instance of total, which is the alteration onset of the first repair, whose editing term um let's see, which ends an intonational phrase, has just finished. Again we start with the intonation variable. Pr(I14=% [ a total of Push um let's see) = 0.902 Pr(I14=null I a total of Push um let's see) = 0.098 For I14 -~ %, the editing term probabilities are given below. Since an editing term is in progress, the only possibilities are that it is continued or that it has ended. Pr(E14=Pop [ a total of Push um let's see %) = 0.830 Pr(E14=ET I a total of Push um let's see %) -- 0.170 For E14 ~ Pop, we give the probabilities for the repair variable. Since an editing term has just ended, the null tag for the repair variable is ruled out. Note the modification interpretation receives a score approximately one third of that of a fresh start. However, the repair interpretation catches up after the alteration is processed. Pr(R14=Mod I a total of Push um let's see % Pop) = 0.228 Pr(R14=Can I a total of Push um let's see % Pop) = 0.644 Pr(R14=Abr I a total of Push um let's see % Pop) -- 0.128 For R14 = Mod, we give the probabilities assigned to the possible reparandum onsets. 559 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 For each, we give the proposed reparandum onset, X, and the words that precede it.

Pr(L10,x=Corr ]W=will take a X=total R=Mod) = 0.973 Pr(L10,x=Corr ]W=will take a X=of R=Mod) = 0.027 With total as the correspondence licensor, we need to decide the type of correspondence: whether it is a word match, word replacement, or otherwise. Pr(C14=m ]W=will take a L=total R=Mod) = 0.5882 Pr(C14=r [W=will take a L=total R=Mod) = 0.1790 Pr(C14---x ]W=will take a L=total R=Mod) = 0.2328 For the correct interpretation, the word correspondence is a word match with the word total and POS tag NN. Hence, the POS tag and identity of the current word are both fixed and hence have a probability of 1. Given the correct interpretation of the previous words, the probability of the word total along with the correct tags is 0.0111. 8. Results In this section, we present the results of running our model on the Trains corpus. This section not only shows the feasibility of the model, but also supports the thesis that the tasks of resolving speech repairs, identifying intonational phrases and discourse markers, POS tagging, and speech recognition language modeling must be accomplished in a single model to account for the interactions between these tasks. We start with the models that we presented in Section 3, and vary which variables of Section 4, 5, and 6 that we include. All results in this section were obtained using the sixfold cross-validation procedure described in Section 3.4.1. 8.1 POS Tagging, Perplexity, and Discourse Markers Table 10 shows that POS tagging, word perplexity, and discourse markers benefit from modeling intonational phrases and speech repairs. The second column gives the results of the POS-based language model of Section 3. The third column adds intonational phrase detection, which reduces the POS error rate by 3.8%, improves 560 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances Table 10 Comparison of POS tagging, discourse marker identification, and perplexity rates.

These improvements are of course at the expense of the branching perplexity, which increases from 26.35 to 30.61. Column four augments the POS-based model with speech repair detection and correction, which improves POS tagging and reduces word perplexity by 3.6%, while only increasing the branching perplexity from 26.35 to 27.69. Although we are adding five variables to the speech recognition problem, most of the extra ambiguity is resolved by the time the word is predicted. Thus, corrections can be sufficiently resolved by the first word of the alteration. Column five combines the models of columns three and four and results in a further improvement in word perplexity. POS tagging and discourse marker identification do not seem to benefit from combining the two processes, but both rates remain better than those obtained from the base model.","Column six adds silence information. Silence information is not directly used to decide the POS tags, the discourse markers, nor what words are involved; rather, it gives evidence as to whether an intonational boundary, speech repair, or editing term occurred. As the following sections show, silence information improves the performance on these tasks, and this translates into better language modeling, resulting in a further decrease in perplexity from 22.96 to 22.35, giving an overall perplexity reduction of 7.0% over the POS-based model. We also see a significant improvement in POS tagging with an error rate reduction of 9.5% over the POS-based model, and a reduction in the discourse marker error rate of 15.4%. As we further improve the modeling of the user's utterance, we should expect to see further improvements in the language model. 8.2 Intonational Phrases Table 11 demonstrates that modeling intonational phrases benefits from modeling silence information, speech repairs, and discourse markers. Column two gives the base results of modeling intonational phrase boundaries. Column three adds silence information, which reduces the error rate for turn-internal boundaries by 9.1%. Column four adds speech repair detection, which further reduces the error rate by 3.5%. Column five adds speech repair correction. Curiously, this actually slightly increases the error rate for intonational boundaries but the rate is still better than not modeling repairs at all (column four). The final result for within-turn boundaries is a recall rate of 71.8%, with a precision of 70.8%. The last column subtracts out the discourse marker modeling by using the POS tagset P of Section 3.4.5, which collapses discourse marker usage with sentential usages. Removing the modeling of discourse markers results in a 2.0% degradation in identifying turn-internal boundaries and 7.2% for end-of-turn boundaries. 561 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 11 Comparison of errors in detecting intonational phrase boundaries.

Table 14 contrasts the full model (column 3) with one that collapses modification repairs and fresh starts (column 2). To ensure a fair comparison, the reported detection rates do not penalize incorrect identification of the repair type. We find that distinguishing fresh starts and modification repairs results in a 7.0% improvement in detecting repairs and a 6.6% improvement in correcting them. Hence, the two types of repairs differ enough both in how they are signaled and the manner in which they are corrected that it is worthwhile to model them separately. Interestingly, we also see that distinguishing between fresh starts and modification repairs improves intonational phrase identification by 1.9%. This improvement is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that the reparandum onset of fresh starts interacts more strongly with intonational boundaries than does the reparandum onset of modification repairs. As for perplexity and POS tagging, there was virtually no difference, except a slight increase in branching perplexity for the full model. 563 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 14 Effect of collapsing modification repairs and fresh starts.

Comparison Comparing the performance of our model to others that have been proposed is problematic. First, there are differences in corpora. The Trains corpus is a collection of dialogues between two people, both of whom realize that they are talking to an-other person. The ATIS corpus (MADCOW 1992), on the other hand, is a collection of human-computer dialogues. The rate of repairs in this corpus is much lower and almost all speaker turns consists of just one contribution. The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992) is a collection of human-human dialogues, which are much less constrained and about a much wider domain. Even more extreme are corpora of professionally read speech. A second problem is that different systems employ different inputs; for instance, does the input include POS tags, utterance segmentation, or hand-transcriptions of the words that were uttered? We also note that this work is the first proposal that combines the detection and correction of speech repairs, the identification of intonational phrases and discourse markers, and POS tagging, in a framework that is amenable to speech recognition. Hence our comparison is with systems that address only part of the problem. 9.1 Speech Repairs Table 15 gives the results of the full model for detecting and correcting speech repairs. The overall correction recall rate is 65.9% with a precision of 74.3%. In the table, we also report the results for each type of repair using the"]},{"title":"Exact Repair","paragraphs":["metric. To facilitate comparisons with approaches that do not distinguish between modification repairs and fresh starts, we give the combined results of these two categories.","Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg (1992) investigated the use of pattern matching of the word correspondences, global and local syntactic and semantic ill-formedness, and acoustic cues as evidence for detecting speech repairs. They tested their pattern matcher on a subset of the ATIS corpus from which they removed \"all trivial\" repairs, repairs that involve only the removal of a word fragment or a filled pause. For their 564 Heeman and Allen Modeling Speakers' Utterances pattern-matching results, they achieved a detection recall rate of 76% with a precision of 62%, and a correction recall rate of 44% with a precision of 35%. They also tried combining syntactic and semantic knowledge in a \"parser-first\" approach--first try to parse the input and if that fails, invoke repair strategies based on word patterns in the input. In a test set containing 26 repairs Dowding et al. 1993, they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% with a precision of 85%, and a correction recall rate of 31% with a precision of 62%.","Nakatani and Hirschberg (1994) proposed that speech repairs should be detected in a \"speech-first\" model using acoustic-prosodic cues, without relying on a word transcription. In order to test their theory, they built a decision tree using a training corpus of 148 turns of speech. They used hand-transcribed prosodic-acoustic features such as silence duration, energy, and pitch, as well as traditional text-first cues such as presence of word fragments, filled pauses, word matches, word replacements, POS tags, and position of the word in the turn, and obtained a detection recall rate of 86% with a precision of 91%. The cues they found relevant were duration of pauses between words, word fragments, and lexical matching within a window of three words. Note that in their corpus, 73% of the repairs were accompanied by a word fragment, as opposed to 32% of the modification repairs and fresh starts in the Trains corpus. Hence, word fragments are a stronger indicator of speech repairs in their corpus than in the Trains corpus. Also note that their training and test sets only included turns with speech repairs; hence their \"findings should be seen more as indicative of the relative importance of various predictors of [speech repair] location than as a true test of repair site location\" (page 1612).","Stolcke and Shriberg (1996b) incorporated repair resolution into a word-based language model. They limited the types of repair to single and double word repetitions and deletions, deletions from the beginning of the sentence, and filled pauses. In predicting a word, they summed over the probability distributions for each type of repair (including no repair at all). For hypotheses that include a repair, the prediction of the next word was based upon a cleaned up representation of the context, and took into account whether a single or double word repetition was predicted. Surprisingly, they found that this model actually degrades performance, in terms of perplexity and word error rate. They attributed this to their treatment of filled pauses: utterance-medial filled pauses should be cleaned up before predicting the next word, whereas utterance-initial ones should be left intact, a distinction that we make in our model by modeling intonational phrases.","Siu and Ostendorf (1996) extended a language model to account for three roles that words such as filled pauses can play in an utterance: utterance-initial, part of a nonabridged repair, or part of an abridged repair. By using training data with these roles marked and a function-specific variable n-gram model (i.e., use a different context for the probability estimates depending on the function of the word), and summing over each possible role, they achieved a perplexity reduction of 82.9 to 81.1. 9.2 Utterance Units and Intonational Phrases We now contrast our intonational phrase results with the results of other researchers in phrases, or other definitions of utterance units. Table 16 gives our performance. Most methods for detecting phrases use end-of-turn as a source of evidence; however, this is jointly determined by both participants. Hence, a dialogue system, designed to participate in the conversation, will not be able to take advantage of this information. For this reason, we focus on turn-internal intonational phrase boundaries. 565 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 Table 16 Intonational phrase results for full model. Recall Precision Error Rate Within Turn 71.76 70.82 57.79 End of Turn 98.05 94.17 8.00 All Boundaries 84.76 82.53 33.17","Wightman and Ostendorf (1994) used preboundary lengthening, pausal durations, and other acoustic cues to automatically label intonational phrases and word accents. They trained a decision tree to estimate the probability of a phrase boundary given the acoustic context. These probabilities were fed into a Markov model whose state is the boundary type of the previous word. For training and testing their algorithm, they used a single-speaker corpus of news stories read by a public radio announcer. With this speaker-dependent model, they achieved a recall rate of 78.1% and a precision of 76.8%. 4 However, it is unclear how well this will adapt to spontaneous speech, where repairs might interfere with the cues that they use, and to speaker independent testing.","Wang and Hirschberg (1992) also looked at detecting intonational phrases. Using automatically labeled features, including POS tag of the current word, category of the constituent being built, distance from last boundary, and word accent, they built decision trees to classify each word as to whether it has an intonational boundary. Note that they do not model interactions with other tasks, such as POS tagging. With this approach, they achieved a recall rate of 79.5% and a precision rate of 82.7% on a subset of the ATIS corpus. Excluding end-of-turn data gives a recall rate of 72.2% and a precision of 76.2%. These results group speech repairs with intonational boundaries and do not distinguish between them. In their corpus, there were 424 disfluencies and 405 turn-internal boundaries. The performance of the decision tree that does not classify disfluencies as intonational boundaries is significantly worse. However, these results were achieved with one-tenth the data of the Trains corpus.","Kompe et al. (1995) combined acoustic cues with a statistical language model to find intonational phrases. They combined normalized syllable duration, length of pauses, pitch contour, and energy using a multilayered perceptron that estimates the probability Pr(vilci), where vi indicates if there is a boundary after the current word and ci is the acoustic features of the neighboring six syllables. This score is combined with the score from a statistical language model, which determines the probability of the word sequence with the hypothesized phrase boundary inserted using a backoff strategy. Pr ( VilCi ) Pr ~ (... wi- 1WiViWi+ 1Wi+ 2 \" \" \" ) Building on this work, Mast et al. (1996) segmented speech into speech acts as the first step in automatically classifying them and achieved a recognition accuracy of 92.5% on turn-internal boundaries using Verbmobil dialogues. This translates into a recall rate of 85.0%, a precision of 53.1%, and an error rate of 90.1%. Their model, which employs rich acoustic modeling, does not account for interactions with speech repairs or discourse markers, nor does it redefine the speech recognition language model.","Meteer and Iyer (1996) investigated whether modeling linguistic segments, segments with a single independent clause, improves language modeling. They computed 4 Derivations of recall and precision rates are given in detail in Heeman (1997). 566 Heernan and Allen Modeling Speakers\" Utterances the probability of the sequence of words with the hypothesized segment boundaries inserted into the sequence. Working on the Switchboard corpus, they found that predicting linguistic boundaries improved perplexity from 130 to 127. Similar to this work, Stolcke and Shriberg (1996a) investigated how the language model can find the boundaries. Their best results were obtained by using POS tags as part of the input, as well as the word identities of certain word classes, in particular, filled pauses, conjunctions, and certain discourse markers. However, this work does not incorporate automatic POS tagging and discourse marker identification. 9.3 Discourse Markers The full model results in 533 errors in discourse marker identification, giving an error rate of 6.43%, a recall of 97.26%, and a precision of 96.32%. Although numerous researchers have noted the importance of discourse markers in determining discourse structure, there has not been a lot of work in actually identifying them.","Hirschberg and Litman (1993) examined how intonational information can distinguish between discourse and sentential interpretation for a set of ambiguous lexical items. They used hand-transcribed intonational features and only examined discourse markers that were one word long, as we have. They found that discourse usages were either an intermediate phrase by themselves (or in a phrase consisting entirely of ambiguous tokens), or they are first in an intermediate phrase (or preceded by other ambiguous tokens) and are either de-accented or have a low word accent. In a monologue of approximately 12,500 words, their model achieved a recall rate of 63.1% with a precision of 88.3%. Many of the errors occurred on coordinate conjuncts, such as and, or, and but, which proved problematic for annotating as well, since \"the discourse meanings of conjunction as described in the literature ... seem to be quite similar to the meanings of sentential conjunction\" (page 518).","Litman (1996) used machine learning techniques to identify discourse markers. The best set of features for predicting discourse markers were lengths of intonational and intermediate phrase, positions of token in intonational and intermediate phrase, composition of intermediate phrase (token is alone in intermediate phrase or phrase consists entirely of potential discourse markers), and identity of the token. The algorithm achieved a success rate of 85.5%, which translates into a discourse marker error rate of 37.3%, in comparison to the rate of 45.3% for Hirschberg and Litman (1993). Direct comparisons with our error rate of 6.4% are problematic since our corpus is five times as large and we use task-oriented human-human dialogues, which include a lot of turn-initial discourse markers for coordinating mutual belief. In any event, the work of Litman and Hirschberg indicates the usefulness of modeling intermediate phrase boundaries and word accents. Conversely, our approach does not force decisions to be made independently and does not assume intonational annotations as input; rather, we identify discourse markers as part of the task of searching for the best assignment of discourse markers along with POS tags, speech repairs, and intonational phrases. 10. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we redefined the speech recognition language model so that it also identifies POS tags, intonational phrases, and discourse markers, and resolves speech repairs. This language model allows the speech recognizer to model the speaker's utterances, rather than simply the words involved. This allows it to better account for the words involved and allows it to return a more meaningful analysis of the speaker's turn for later processing. The model incorporates identifying intonational phrases, discourse markers, and POS tags, and detecting and correcting speech repairs; hence, 567 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4 interactions that exist between these tasks, as well as the task of predicting the next word, can be modeled.","Constraining our model to the hand-transcription, it is able to identify 71.8% of all turn-internal intonational boundaries with a precision of 70.8%, identify 97.3% of all discourse markers with a precision of 96.3%, and detect and correct 65.9% of all speech repairs with a precision of 74.3%. These results are partially attributable to accounting for the interaction between these tasks: modeling intonation phrases improves speech repair detection by 7.4% and correction by 6.3%; modeling speech repairs improves intonational phrase identification by 3.5%; modeling repair correction improves repair detection by 8.3%; modeling repairs and intonational phrases improves discourse marker identification by 15.4%; and removing the modeling of discourse markers degrades intonational phrase identification by 2.0%, speech repair detection by 4.8%, and speech repair correction by 5.2%. Speech repairs and intonational phrases create discontinuities that traditional speech recognition language models and POS taggers have difficulty modeling. Modeling speech repairs and intonational phrases results in a 9.5% improvement in POS tagging and a 7.0% improvement in perplexity. Part of this improvement is from exploiting silences to give evidence of the speech repairs and intonational phrase boundaries.","More work still needs to be done. First, with the exception of pauses, we do not consider acoustic cues. This is a rich source of information for detecting (and distinguishing between) intonational phrases, interruption points of speech repairs, and even discourse markers. It would also help in determining the reparandum onset of fresh starts, which tend to occur at intonational boundaries. Acoustic modeling is also needed to identify word fragments. The second area is extending the model to incorporate higher level syntactic and semantic processing. This would not only allow us to give a much richer output from the model, but it would also allow us to account for interactions between this higher-level knowledge and modeling speakers' utterances, especially in detecting the ill-formedness that often occurs with speech repairs. It would also aid in finding richer correspondences between the reparandum and alteration, such as between the noun phrase and pronoun in the following example."]},{"title":"Example 36","paragraphs":["(d93-14.3 utt27)","the engine can take as many ~ ,~ it can take up to three loaded boxcars •","•","y Y","re,aran,~ume ~ zp et alteration The third area of future research is to show that our model works on other languages. Although the model encodes the basic structure of speech repairs, intonational phrases, and discourse markers, actual parameters are learned from a training corpus. Preliminary work on a Japanese corpus indicates that the model is not language specific (Heeman and Loken-Kim 1999). The fourth and most important area is to incorporate our work into a speech recognizer. We have already used our POS-based model to rescore word-graphs, which results in a one percent absolute reduction in word error rate in comparison to a word-based model (Heeman 1999). Our full model, which accounts for intonational phrases and speech repairs, should lead to a further reduction, as well as return a richer understanding of the speech."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We wish to thank Allen Black, John Dowding, K.H.
