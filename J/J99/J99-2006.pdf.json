For unification-based approaches, like LFG, PATR, or HPSG (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Shieber et al. 1983; Pollard and Sag 1994), this problem turns out to be a formal problem of the underlying grammar formalism, when the mapping between strings and semantic representations is defined by the grammar. Semantic representations are then encoded in a separate part of the feature structures (henceforth f-structures) that are assigned to the sentences by the grammar. This is normally achieved by a distinct attribute SF.M (or an additional a-projection that is formally reconstructable by such an attribute) whose value is intended to represent the semantics of the sentence the f-structure is assigned to.

Hence, natural language grammars (of the LFG and PATR formalisms) must satisfy conditions that do not allow us to show the undecidability of the problem.
