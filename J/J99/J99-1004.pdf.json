We prove that with their production probabilities assigned by the relative weighted frequency method, PCFGs are subcritical, i.e., their branching rates are less than one. We also show that by renormalization, connected supercritical PCFGs become subcritical ones. Finally, some minor issues, including identifiability and approximation of production probabilities of PCFGs, are discussed. 1. Introduction This article proves a number of useful properties of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). In this section, we give an introduction to the results and related topics. 1.1 Assignment of Proper PCFG Distributions Finite parse trees, or parses, generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) can be equipped with a variety of probability distributions. The simplest way to do this is by production probabilities. First, for each nonterminal symbol in the CFG, a probability distribution is placed on the set of all productions from that symbol. Then each finite parse tree is allocated a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of all productions in the tree. More specifically, denote a finite parse tree by T. For any production rule A ~ a of the CFG, letf(A ~ a; ~-) be the number of times it occurs in T. Let R be the set of all production rules. Then p(T) = H p(A ~"]},{"title":"o~)/(A~;~-).","paragraphs":["(A--~oc)ER","A CFG with a probability distribution on its parses assigned in this way is called a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) (Booth and Thompson 1973; Grenander * Department of Statistics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

(~) 1999 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 1976) 1 and the probability distribution is called a PCFG distribution. A PCFG may be improper, i.e., the total probability of parses may be less than one. For instance, consider the CFG in Chomsky normal form: S~SS S ~ a (1) where S is the only nonterminal symbol, and a is the only terminal symbol. If p(S SS) = p, then p(S ~ a) = 1 - p. Let Xh be the total probability of all parses with height no larger than h. Clearly, Xh is increasing. It is not hard to see that Xh+l = 1 -- p + px~. Therefore, the limit of Xh, which is the total probability of all parses, is a solution for the equation x = 1 - p + px 2. The equation has two solutions: 1 and 1/p - 1. It can be shown that x is the smaller of the two: x = min(1,1/p - 1). Therefore, if p > 1/2, x < 1--an improper probability.","How to assign proper production probabilities is quite a subtle problem. A sufficient condition for proper assignment is established by Chi and Geman (1998), who prove that production probabilities estimated by the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation procedure (or relative frequency estimation procedure, as it is called in computational linguistics) always impose proper PCFG distributions. Without much difficulty, this result can be generalized to a simple procedure, called \"the relative weighted frequency\" method, which assigns proper production probabilities of PCFGs. We will give more details of the generalization in Section 3 and summarize the method in Proposition 1. 1.2 Entropy and Moments of Parse Tree Sizes As a probabilistic model for languages, the PCFG model has several important statistical properties, among which is the entropy of PCFG distribution on parses. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of a probability distribution. The larger its entropy, the less one can learn about parses randomly sampled from the distribution. As an example, suppose we have a set S of N parses--or any objects--T1 ..... TN, where N is very large. We may ask how much one can learn from the sentence \"T is a random sample from S.\" At one extreme, let the distribution on S be p(~-l) = 1, and P(;i) = O, for i ~ 1. Then, because with probability one, ; = T1, there is no uncertainty about the sample. In other words, we can get full information from the above sentence. At the other extreme, suppose the distribution is p(~-l) ..... p(TN) = 1/N. In this case, all the elements of S are statistically equivalent. No specific information is given about T that would make it possible to know it from S. Greater effort is required--for example, enumerating all the elements in S--to find what T is. Since S is big, the uncertainty about the sample is then much greater. Correspondingly, for the two cases, the entropy is 0 and N log N >> 0, respectively.","Entropy plays a central role in the theory of information. For an excellent exposi-tion of this theory, we refer the reader to Cover and Thomas (1991). The theory has been applied in probabilistic language modeling (Mark, Miller, and Grenander 1996; Mark et al. 1996; Johnson 1998), natural language processing (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996; Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1997), as well as computational vision (Zhu, Wu, and Mumford 1997). In addition, all the models proposed in these articles are based on an important principle called the maximum entropy principle. Chapter 11 of Cover and Thomas (1991) gives an introduction to this principle. 1 A probabilistic context-free grammar is also called a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) 132 Chi Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars","Briefly, the maximum entropy principle says that among all the distributions that satisfy the same given conditions, the one that achieves the largest entropy should be the model of choice. For a distribution p on parses, its entropy is","1","H(p) = Z P(~) log p(T). T In order that the maximum entropy principle makes sense, all the candidate distributions should have finite entropies, and this is usually implicitly assumed.","Take Mark, Miller, and Grenander's (1996) model, for example. First, a PCFG distribution p is selected to serve as a \"reference\" distribution on parses. Then, by invoking the minimum relative entropy principle, which is a variant of the maximum entropy principle, the distribution that minimizes D(qIIP) = E q(T) log q0-) = E q(T) log 1 ~- p(T) ~- p~ - H(q) subject to a set of constraints incorporating context-sensitive features is chosen to be the distribution of the model. It is then easy to see that the assumption that H(q) is finite is necessary.","Conceptually, having finite entropy is a basic requirement for a \"good\" probabilistic model because a probability distribution with infinite entropy has too much uncertainty to be informative.","Problems regarding entropies of PCFGs are relatively easy to tackle because they can be studied analytically. Several authors have reported results on this subject, including Miller and O'Sullivan (1992), who gave analytical results on the rates of entropies of improper PCFGs. It is worthwhile to add a few more results on entropies of proper PCFGs. In this paper, we show that the entropies of PCFG distributions imposed by production probabilities assigned by the relative weighted frequency method are finite (Section 4, Corollary 2).","In addition to entropy, we will also study the moment of sizes of parses. The moment is of statistical interest because it gives information on how sizes of parses are distributed. For PCFG distributions, the first moment of sizes of parses, i.e., the mean size of parses, is directly linked with the entropy: the mean size of parses is finite if and only if the entropy is. The second moment of sizes is another familiar quantity. The difference between the second moment and the mean squared is the variance of sizes, which tells us how \"scattered\" sizes of parses are distributed around the mean. Proposition 2 shows that, under distributions imposed by production probabilities assigned by the relative weighted frequency method, sizes of parses have finite moment of any order. 1.3 Gibbs Distributions on Parses and Renormalization of Improper PCFGs Besides PCFG distributions, a CFG can be equipped with many other types of probability distributions. Among the most widely studied is the Gibbs distribution (Mark, Miller, and Grenander 1996; Mark et al. 1996; Mark 1997; Abney 1997). Gibbs distributions arise naturally by invoking the maximum entropy principle. They are considered to be more powerful than PCFG distributions because they incorporate more features, especially context-sensitive features, of natural languages, whereas PCFG distributions only consider frequencies of production rules. On the other hand, Gibbs distributions are not always superior to PCFG distributions. A Gibbs distribution, with only frequencies of production rules in parse as its features, turns into a PCFG. More specifically, we will show in Proposition 4 in Section 5, that a CFG equipped with a Gibbs 133 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 distribution of the form","1 P,~(r) = Z7 H"]},{"title":"e~'a~d(A~;~')","paragraphs":["(2) (A---+e~)ER is actually a PCFG, and we can get the production probabilities of the PCFG explicitly from the Gibbs form.","The fact that a Gibbs distribution of the form in (2) is imposed by production probabilities has a useful consequence. Suppose p is an improper PCFG distribution.

What (2) implies is that ~ is also a PCFG distribution (Corollary 3). Moreover, in Section 6 we will show that, under certain conditions, ~ is subcritical.","There is another issue about the relations between PCFG distributions and Gibbs distributions of the form in (2), from a statistical point of view. Although PCFG distributions are special cases of Gibbs distributions in the sense that the former can be written in the form of the latter, PCFG distributions cannot be put in the framework of Gibbs distributions if they have different parameter estimation procedures. We will compare the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation procedures for these two distributions. As will be seen in Section 5, numerically these two estimation procedures are different. However, Corollary 4 shows that they are"]},{"title":"equivalent in","paragraphs":["the sense that estimates by the two procedures impose the same distributions on parses. For this reason, a Gibbs distribution may be considered a generalization of PCFG, not only in form, but also in a certain statistical sense. 1.4 Branching Rates of PCFGs Because of their context-free nature, PCFG distributions can also be studied from the perspective of stochastic processes. A PCFG can be described by a random branching process (Harris 1963), and its asymptotic behavior can be characterized by its branching rate. A branching process, or its corresponding PCFG, is called subcritical (critical, supercritical), if its branching rate < 1 (= 1, > 1). A subcritical PCFG is always proper, whereas a supercritical PCFG is always improper. Many asymptotic properties of supercritical branching processes are established by Miller and O'Sullivan (1992). Chi and Geman (1998) proved the properness of PCFG distributions imposed by estimated production probabilities, and around the same time S~nchez and Benedi (1997) established the subcriticality of the corresponding branching processes, hence their properness. In this paper we will explore properties of branching rate further. First, in Proposition 5, we will show that if a PCFG distribution is imposed by production probabilities assigned by the relative weighted frequency method, then the PCFG is subcritical. The result generalizes that of S~nchez and Bened~ (1997), and has a less involved proof. Then in Proposition 7, we will demonstrate that a connected and improper PCFG, after being renormalized, becomes a subcritical PCFG. 1.5 Identifiability and Approximation of Production Probabilities Returning to the statistical aspect of PCFGs, we will discuss the identifiability of production probabilities of PCFGs as well as parameters of Gibbs distributions. Briefly speaking, production probabilities of PCFGs are identifiable, which means that different production probabilities always impose different distributions on parses (Proposition 8). In contrast, for the Gibbs distribution given by (2), the ,~ parameters are not identifiable; in fact, there are infinitely many different ,~ that impose the same Gibbs distribution. 134 Chi Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars","Finally, in Proposition 9, we propose a method to approximate production probabilities. Perhaps the most interesting part about the result lies in its proof, which is largely information theoretic. We apply the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is the information distance between two probability distributions, to prove the convergence of the approximation. In information theory literature, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is also called the relative entropy. We also use Lagrange multipliers to solve the constrained minimization problem involved. Both Kullback-Leibler divergence and Lagrange multipliers method are becoming increasingly useful in statistical modeling, e.g., modeling based on the maximum entropy principle. 1.6 Summary As a simple probabilistic model, the PCFG model is applied to problems in linguistics and pattern recognition that do not involve much context sensitivity. To design sensible PCFG distributions for such problems, it is necessary to understand some of the statistical properties of the distributions. On the other hand, the PCFG model serves as a basis for more expressive linguistic models. For example, many Gibbs distributions are built upon PCFG distributions by defining"]},{"title":"p(T)e;~uo ) PO-) - z \"","paragraphs":["where p is a PCFG distribution. Therefore, in order for the Gibbs distribution P to have certain desired statistical properties, it is necessary for p to have those properties first. This paper concerns some of the fundamental properties of PCFGs. However, the methods used in the proofs are also useful for the study of statistical issues on other probabilistic models.","This paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we gather the notations for PCFGs that will be used in the remaining part of the paper. Section 3 establishes the relative weighted frequency method. Section 4 proves the finiteness of the entropies of PCFG distributions when production probabilities are assigned using the relative weighted frequency method. In addition, finiteness of the moment of sizes of parses are proved. Section 5 discusses the connections between PCFG distributions and Gibbs distributions on parses. Renormalization of improper PCFGs is also discussed here. In Section 6, PCFGs are studied from the random branching process point of view. Finally, in Section 7, idenfifiability of production probabilities and their approximation are addressed. • 2. Notations and Definitions In this section, we collect the notations and definitions we will use for the remaining part of the paper. Definition 1 A context-free grammar (CFG) G is a quadruple (N, T, R, S), where N is the set of variables, T the set of terminals, R the set of production rules, and S E N is the start symbol. 2 Elements of N are also called nonterminal symbols. N, T, and R are always 2 Some of our discussion requires that each sentential form have only finitely many parses. For this reason, we shall assume that in G, there are no null or unit productions. 135 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 assumed to be finite.

Indeed, numerically log~ and ~ are different. For example, the estimator (23) only gives one estimate of the system of production probabilities, whereas the estimator (24) may yield infinitely many solutions. Such uniqueness and nonuniqueness of estimates is related to the identifiability of parameters. We will discuss this in more detail in Section 7.","Despite their numerical differences, the ML estimators for PCFG distributions and Gibbs distributions with the form (19) are"]},{"title":"equivalent, In","paragraphs":["the sense that the estimates produced by the estimators impose the same distributions on parses. Because of this, In the context of ML estimation of parameters, we can regard PCFG distributions as special cases of Gibbs distributions. Corollary 4 If ~ is the solution of (23), then log fi is a solution of ML estimation (24). Similarly, if ~ is a solution of (25), then log fi is a solution of ML estimation (26). Hence, the estimates of production probabilities of PCFG distributions and parameters of Gibbs distributions with the form (19) impose the same distributions on parses. 150 Chi Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars Proof Suppose ,~ is a solution for (24). By Proposition 4, the Gibbs distribution PK is imposed by a system of production probabilities ~. Then ~ is the solution of (23). Let A = log ~, i.e., A(A ~ a) = log~(A ~ a). Then A impose the same distribution on parses as ,~. Therefore A are also a solution to (24). This proves the first half of the result. The second half is similarly proved. [] 6. Branching Rates of PCFGs In this section, we study PCFGs from the perspective of stochastic branching processes. Adopting the set-up given by Miller and O'Sullivan (1992), we define the mean matrix M of p as a ]N I x I N] square matrix, with its (A, B)th entry being the expected number of variables B resulting from rewriting A:","M(A, B) = ~ p(A ~ o~)n(B; oL). (27) aE(NUT)* s.t. (A-*rx)cR Clearly, M is a nonnegative matrix.","We say B E N can be reached from A E N, if for some n > 0, M (n) (A, B) > 0, where M (n) (A, B) is the (A, B)th element of M n. M is irreducible if for any pair A,'B E N, B can be reached from A. The corresponding branching process is called connected if M is irreducible (Walters 1982). It is easy to check that these definitions are equivalent to Definition 3.","We need the result below for the study of branching processes. Theorem 1: (Perron-Frobenius) Let M = [mq] be a nonnegative k x k matrix. . . There is a nonnegative eigenvalue p such that no eigenvalue of A has absolute value greater than p. Corresponding to the eigenvalue p there is a nonnegative left (row) eigenvector L, = (Vl,..., ~'k) and a nonnegative right (column) eigenvector #k",". If M is irreducible then p is a simple eigenvalue (i.e., the multiplicity of p is 1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are strictly positive (i.e. ui > 0, vi > 0 all i).","The eigenvalue p is called the branching rate of the process. A branching process is called subcritical (critical, supercritical), if p < 1 (p = 1, p > 1). We also say a PCFG is subcritical (critical, supercritical), if its corresponding branching process is. When a PCFG is subcritical, it is proper. When a PCFG is supercritical, it is improper.","The next result demonstrates that production probabilities assigned by the relative weighted frequency method impose subcritical PCFG distributions. 151 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1 Proposition 5 For p assigned by the relative weighted frequency method (8) and M by (27), p < 1.

Proposition 7 If p is a connected, improper PCFG distribution on parses, then its renormalized version ~ is subcritical. Proof We have 0 < P(f~s) < 1, and we shall first show, based on the fact that the PCFG is connected, that all 0 < p(f~a) < 1. Recall the proof of Corollary 1. There we got the relation qs _> qaps(A C T), where qa is the probability that trees rooted in A fail to terminate. Because the PCFG is connected, S is reachable from A, too. By the same argument, we also have qA ~ qSPA(S C T). Since both qs and pA(S E T) > O, qA > O, then p(f~A) = 1 -- qA < 1.

First of all, note that h~(0) = 0 only if hA(t) is linear. Assume Mu = u, which leads to h'(0) = 0 and the linearity of h(t). Together with h(0) = 0, this implies h(t) ~ O. Choose t < 0 such that 1 + tuA > 0 for all A. Then f(1 + tu) - 1 - tu = h(t) = 0. Therefore 1 + tu is a nonnegative solution of f(s) = s and is strictly less than 1.

By item (3) of Theorem 1, u is strictly positive, and there is a strictly positive left eigenvector L, such that L,M = py. Therefore yMu < vu, or p~,u < ~,u. Hence p < 1. This completes the proof. [] 7. Identifiability and Approximation of Production Probabilities of PCFGs Identifiability of parameters is related to the consistency of estimates, both being important statistical issues. Proving the consistency of the ML estimate of a system of production probabilities given in (5) is relatively straightforward. Consistency in this case means that, if p imposes a proper distribution, then as the size of the data composed of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples goes to infinity, with probability one, the estimate ~ converges to p. To see this, think of the sample parses as taken independently from a branching process governed by p. By the context-free nature of the branching process, for A E N, each instance of A selects a production A ~ a by probability p(A ~ a) independently of the other instances of A. As the size of the data set goes to infinity, the number of occurrences of A goes to infinity. Therefore, by the law of large numbers, the ratio between the number of occurrences of A ~ o~ and the number of occurrences of A, which is f~(A ~ ol), converges to p(A ~ o~), with probability one. 155 Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1","By the consistency of the ML estimate of a system of production probabilities, we can prove that production probabilities are identifiable parameters of PCFGs.
