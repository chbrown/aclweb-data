Current statistical techniques uncover translation rules from bilingual training texts and use those rules to translate new texts. The general architecture is the source-channel model: an English string is statistically generated (source), then statistically transformed into French (channel). In order to translate (or \"decode\") a French string, we look for the most likely English source. We show that for the simplest form of statistical models, this problem is NP-complete, i.e., probably exponential in the length of the observed sentence. We trace this complexity to factors not present in other decoding problems. 1. Introduction Statistical models are widely used in attacking natural language problems. The source-channel framework is especially popular, finding applications in part-of-speech tagging, accent restoration, transliteration, speech recognition, and many other areas. In this framework, we build an underspecified model of how certain structures (such as strings) are generated and transformed. We then instantiate the model through training on a database of sample structures and transformations.","Recently, Brown et al. (1993) built a source-channel model of translation between English and French. They assumed that English strings are produced according to some stochastic process (source model) and transformed stochastically into French strings (channel model). To translate French to English, it is necessary to find an English source string that is likely according to the models. With a nod to its cryptographic antecedents, this kind of translation is called decoding. This paper looks at decoding complexity. 2. Part-of-Speech Tagging The prototype source-channel application in natural language is part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988). We review it here for purposes of comparison with machine translation.","Source strings comprise sequences of part-of-speech tags like noun, verb, etc. A simple source model assigns a probability to a tag sequence tl .. •tm based on the probabilities of the tag pairs inside it. Target strings are English sentences, e.g., wl ... win. The channel model assumes each tag is probabilistically replaced by a word (e.g., noun by dog) without considering context. More concretely, we have: • v total tags","• A bigram source model with v 2 parameters of the form b(t]t), where P(tl... tin) \"\" b(tllboundary) • b(t2]tl) ..... b(tn]tm-1) \" b(boundary]tm) • Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA 90292 @ 1999 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 4","• A substitution channel model with parameters of the form s(w]t), where P(wl ...

Wm by finding the sequence tl... tm that maximizes P(h... tmlWl... Wm). By Bayes' rule, we can equivalently maximize P(h ... tm)'P(wl.., wmlh.., tin), which we can calculate directly from the b and s tables above.","Three interesting complexity problems in the source-channel framework are: • Can parameter values be induced from annotated text efficiently? • Can optimal decodings be produced efficiently? • Can parameter values be induced from unannotated text efficiently?","The first problem is solved in O(m) time for part-of-speech tagging--we simply count tag pairs and word/tag pairs, then normalize. The second problem seems to require enumerating all O(v m) potential source sequences to find the best, but can actually be solved in O(mv 2) time with dynamic programming. We turn to the third problem in the context of another application: cryptanalysis. 3. Substitution Ciphers In a substitution cipher, a plaintext message like HELLO WORLD is transformed into a ciphertext message like EOPPX YXAPF via a fixed letter-substitution table. As with tagging, we can assume an alphabet of v source tokens, a bigram source model, a substitution channel model, and an m-token coded text.","If the coded text is annotated with corresponding English, then building source and channel models is trivially O(m). Comparing the situation to part-of-speech tagging:","• (Bad news.) Cryptanalysts rarely get such coded/decoded text pairs and must employ \"ciphertext-only\" attacks using unannotated training data.","• (Good news.) It is easy to train a source model separately, on raw unannotated English text that is unconnected to the ciphertext. Then the problem becomes one of acquiring a channel model, i.e., a table s(fle ) with an entry for each code-letter/plaintext-letter pair. Starting with an initially uniform table, we can use the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively revise s(fle ) so as to increase the probability of the observed corpus P(f). Figure 1 shows a naive EM implementation that runs in O(mv m) time. There is an efficient O(mv 2) EM implementation based on dynamic programming that accomplishes the same thing. Once the s(fle ) table has been learned, there is a similar O(mv 2) algorithm for optimal decoding. Such methods can break English letter-substitution ciphers of moderate size. 608 Knight Decoding Complexity Given coded text f of length m, a plaintext vocabulary of v tokens, and a source model b: 1. set the s0Cle) table initially to be uniform 2. for several iterations do: a, b.

It runs in O(mv m) time. 4. Machine Translation In our discussion of substitution ciphers, we were on relatively sure ground the channel model we assumed in decoding is actually the same one used by the cipher writer for encoding. That is, we know that plaintext is converted to ciphertext, letter by letter, according to some table. We have no such clear conception about how English gets converted to French, although many theories exist. Brown et al. (1993) recently cast some simple theories into a source-channel framework, using the bilingual Canadian parliament proceedings as training data. We may assume: • v total English words. • A bigram source model with V 2 parameters. • Various substitution/permutation channel models. • A collection of bilingual sentence pairs (sentence lengths < m). • A collection of monolingual French sentences (sentence lengths < m).","Bilingual texts seem to exhibit English words getting substituted with French ones,","though not one-for-one and not without changing their order.

Here, j and i are absolute target/source word positions within a sentence, and m and I are target/source sentence lengths.","Inducing n, s, and d parameter estimates is easy if we are given annotations in the form of word alignments.

Next we give separate polynomial-time reductions from two NP-complete problems. Each reduction highlights a different source of complexity. 4.1 Reduction 1 (from Hamilton Circuit Problem) The Hamilton Circuit Problem asks: given a directed graph G with vertices labeled 0,...,n, does G have a path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to its starting point? We transform any Hamilton Circuit instance into an M1-DECIDE instance as follows. First, we create a French vocabulary fl ..... fn, associating word fi with vertex i in the graph.

The channel model lets us conclude that if P(f[e) is nonzero, then e contains the n words el,..., en in some order. If P(e) is nonzero, then every bigram in e (including the two boundary bigrams involving e0) has nonzero probability. Because each English word in e corresponds to a unique vertex, we can use the order of words in e to produce an ordering of vertices in G. We append vertex 0 to the beginning and end of this list to produce a Hamilton Circuit. The source model construction guarantees an edge between each vertex and the next.","If M1-DECIDE returns no, then we know that every string e includes at least one zero value in the computation of either P(e) or P(fle). From any proposed Hamilton Circuit--i.e., some ordering of vertices in G--we can construct a string e using the same ordering. This e will have P(f]e) = 1 according to the channel model. Therefore, P(e) = 0. By the source model, this can only happen if the proposed \"circuit\" is actually broken somewhere. So no Hamilton Circuit exists.","Figure 3 illustrates the intuitive correspondence between selecting a good word order and finding a Hamilton Circuit. We note that Brew (1992) discusses the NPcompleteness of a related problem, that of finding some permutation of a string that is acceptable to a given context-free grammar. Both of these results deal with decision problems.

If we assume that the channel model offers deterministic, word-for-word translations, then the bigram source model takes responsibility for ordering them. Some word pairs in the source language may be illegal. In that case, finding a legal word ordering is like finding a complete circuit in a graph. (In the graph shown above, a sample circuit is boundary --, this ---* year ~ comma ~ my --* birthday --~ falls --~ on ---* a --+ Thursday ~ boundary). If word pairs have probabilities attached to them, then word ordering resembles the finding the least-cost circuit, also known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. Salesman Problem. It introduces edge costs dq and seeks a minimum-cost circuit. By viewing edge costs as log probabilities, we can cast the Traveling Salesman Problem as one of optimizing P(e), that is, of finding the best source word order in Model 1 decoding. 4.2 Reduction 2 (from Minimum Set Cover Problem) The Minimum Set Cover Problem asks: given a collection C of subsets of finite set S, and integer n, does C contain a cover for S of size ~ n, i.e., a subcollection whose union is S? We now transform any instance of Minimum Set Cover into an instance of M1-DECIDE, using polynomial time. This time, we assume a rather neutral source model in which all strings of a given length are equally likely, but we construct a more complex channel.","We first create a source word ei for each subset in C, and let gi be the size of that subset. We create a table b(eilej) with values set uniformly to the reciprocal of the source vocabulary size (i.e., the number of subsets in C).","Assuming S has m elements, we next create target words fl ..... fm corresponding to each of those elements, and set up channel model tables as follows: if the element in S corresponding to j~ is also in the subset corresponding to ei otherwise","¢(mll) = {10 ifl~n otherwise fl if l>n"]},{"title":"~(m","paragraphs":["otherwise","Finally, we set k to zero.

In the example shown above, the smallest acceptable set of source words is {and, cooked, however, left, comma, period}.","If M1-DECIDE returns yes, then some decoding e with P(e) • P(f]e) > 0 must exist. We know that e must contain n or fewer words--otherwise P(f[e) = 0 by the c table. Furthermore, the s table tells us that every word fj is covered by at least one English word in e. Through the one-to-one correspondence between elements of e and C, we produce a set cover of size G n for S.","Likewise, if M1-DECIDE returns no, then all decodings have P(e) • P(f[e) = 0. Because there are no zeroes in the source table b, every e has P(f[e) = 0. Therefore either (1) the length of e exceeds n, or (2) somefj is left tmcovered by the words in e. Because source words cover target words in exactly the same fashion as elements of C cover S, we conclude that there is no set cover of size < n for S. Figure 4 illustrates the intuitive correspondence between source word selection and minimum set covering. 5. Discussion The two proofs point up separate factors in MT decoding complexity. One is word-order selection. But even if any word order will do, there is still the problem of picking a concise decoding in the face of overlapping bilingual dictionary entries. The former is more closely tied to the source model, and the latter to the channel model, though the complexity arises from the interaction of the two.","We should note that Model 1 is an intentionally simple translation model, one whose primary purpose in machine translation has been to allow bootstrapping into more complex translation models (e.g., IBM Models 2-5). It is easy to show that the intractability results also apply to stronger \"fertility/distortion\" models; we assign zero probability to fertilities other than 1, and we set up uniform distortion tables. Simple translation models like Model 1 find more direct use in other applications (e.g., lexicon construction, idiom detection, psychological norms, and cross-language information retrieval), so their computational properties are of wider interest. 614 Knight Decoding Complexity","The proofs we presented are based on a worst-case analysis. Real s, e, and b tables may have properties that permit faster optimal decoding than the artificial tables constructed above. It is also possible to devise approximation algorithms like those devised for other NP-complete problems. To the extent that word ordering is like solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, it is encouraging substantial progress continues to be made on Traveling Salesman algorithms. For example, it is often possible to get within two percent of the optimal tour in practice, and some researchers have demonstrated an optimal tour of over 13,000 U.S. cities. (The latter experiment relied on things like distance symmetry and the triangle inequality constraint, however, which do not hold in word ordering.) So far, statistical translation research has either opted for heuristic beam-search algorithms or different channel models. For example, some researchers avoid bag generation by preprocessing bilingual texts to remove word-order differences, while others adopt channels that eliminate syntactically unlikely alignments.","Finally, expensive decoding also suggests expensive training from unannotated (monolingual) texts, which presents a challenging bottleneck for extending statistical machine translation to language pairs and domains where large bilingual corpora do not exist.","References","Brew, Chris. 1992.
