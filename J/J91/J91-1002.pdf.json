These lexical chains are a direct result of units of text being \"about the same thing,\" and finding text structure involves finding units of text that are about the same thing. Hence, computing the chains is useful, since they will have a correspondence to the structure of the text. Determining the structure of text is an essential step in determining the deep meaning of the text. In this paper, a thesaurus is used as the major knowledge base for computing lexical chains. Correspondences between lexical chains and structural elements are shown to exist. Since the lexical chains are computable, and exist in non-domain-specific text, they provide a valuable indicator of text structure. The lexical chains also provide a semantic context for interpreting words, concepts, and sentences. 1. Lexical Cohesion A text or discourse is not just a set of sentences, each on some random topic. Rather, the sentences and phrases of any sensible text will each tend to be about the same things -- that is, the text will have a quality of unity. This is the property of cohesion -- the sentences \"stick together\" to function as a whole. Cohesion is achieved through back-reference, conjunction, and semantic word relations. Cohesion is not a guarantee of unity in text but rather a device for creating it. As aptly stated by Halliday and Hasan (1976), it is a way of getting text to \"hang together as a whole.\" Their work on cohesion has underscored its importance as an indicator of text unity.","Lexical cohesion is the cohesion that arises from semantic relationships between words. All that is required is that there be some recognizable relation between the words.","Halliday and Hasan have provided a classification of lexical cohesion based on the type of dependency relationship that exists between words. There are five basic classes: 1. Reiteration with identity of reference: Example 1 1. Mary bit into a peach. 2.

In these examples, lexical chains can be used as a contextual aid to interpreting word meanings.","In earlier work, Hirst (1987) used a system called \"Polaroid Words\" to provide for intrasentential lexical disambiguation. Polaroid Words relied on a variety of cues, including syntax, selectional restrictions, case frames, and -- most relevant here -- a notion of semantic distance or relatedness to other words in the sentences; a sense that had such a relationship was preferred over one that didn't. Relationships were determined by marker passing along the arcs in a knowledge base. The intuition was that semantically related concepts will be physically close in the knowledge base, and can thus be found by traversing the arcs for a limited distance. But Polaroid Words looked only for possible relatedness between words in the same sentence; trying to find connections with all the words in preceding sentences was too complicated and too likely to be led astray. The idea of lexical chains, however, can address this weakness in Polaroid Words; lexical chains provide a constrained easy-to-determine representation of context for consideration of semantic distance. 1.2.2 Cohesion and Discourse Structure. The second major importance of lexical chains is that they provide a clue for the determination of coherence and discourse structure. 23 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1","When a chunk of text forms a unit within a discourse, there is a tendency for related words to be used. It follows that if lexical chains can be determined, they will tend to indicate the structure of the text.","We will describe the application of lexical cohesion to the determination of the discourse structure that was proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). Grosz and Sidner propose a structure common to all discourse, which could be used along with a structurally dependent focus of attention to delineate and constrain referring expressions. In this theory there are three interacting components:"]},{"title":"linguistic structure, intentional structure,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"attentional state.","paragraphs":["Linguistic structure is the segmentation of discourse into groups of sentences, each fulfilling a distinct role in the discourse. Boundaries of segments can be fuzzy, but some factors aiding in their determination are"]},{"title":"clue words,","paragraphs":["changes in intonation (not helpful in written text), and changes in aspect and tense. When found, these segments indicate changes in the topics or ideas being discussed, and hence will have an effect on potential referents.","The second major component of the theory is the intentional structure. It is based on the idea that people have definite purposes for engaging in discourse. There is an overall discourse purpose, and also a discourse segment purpose for each of the segments in the linguistic structure described above. Each segment purpose specifies how the segment contributes to the overall discourse purpose. There are two structural relationships between these segments. The first is called a"]},{"title":"dominance","paragraphs":["relation, which occurs when the satisfaction (i.e., successful completion) of one segment's intention contributes to the satisfaction of another segment's intention. The second relation is called"]},{"title":"satisfaction precedence,","paragraphs":["which occurs when the satisfaction of one discourse segment purpose must occur before the satisfaction of another discourse segment purpose can occur.","The third component of this theory is the attentional state. This is a stack-based model of the set of things that attention is focused on at any given point in the discourse. It is \"parasitic\" on the intentional and linguistic structures, since for each discourse segment there exists a separate focus space. The dominance relations and satisfaction precedence relations determine the pushes and pops of this stack space. When a discourse segment purpose contributes to a discourse segment purpose of the immediately preceding discourse segment, the new focus space is pushed onto the stack. If the new discourse segment purpose contributes to a discourse segment purpose earlier in the discourse, focus spaces are popped off the stack until the discourse segment that the new one contributes to is on the top of the stack.","It is crucial to this theory that the linguistic segments be identified, and as stated by Grosz and Sidner, this is a problem area. This paper will show that lexical chains are a good indication of the linguistic segmentation. When a lexical chain ends, there is a tendency for a linguistic segment to end, as the lexical chains tend to indicate the topicality of segments. If a new lexical chain begins, this is an indication or clue that a new segment has begun. If an old chain is referred to again (a"]},{"title":"chain return),","paragraphs":["it is a strong indication that a previous segment is being returned to. We will demonstrate this in Section 4. 1.3 Cohesion and Coherence The theory of"]},{"title":"coherence relations","paragraphs":["(Hobbs 1978; Hirst 1981; McKeown 1985) will now be considered in relation to cohesion.

Of course, most sentences that relate coherently do exhibit cohesion as well. 1 1.4 The Importance of Both Cohesion and Coherence Halliday and Hasan (1976) give two examples of lexical cohesion involving identity of reference: Example 11 1.

He uses a formal definition of coherence relations, an extensive knowledge base of assertions and properties of objects and actions, and a mechanism that searches this knowledge source and makes simple inferences.

The Thesaurus and Lexical Cohesion The thesaurus was conceived by Peter Mark Roget, who described it as being the \"converse\" of a dictionary. A dictionary explains the meaning of words, whereas a thesaurus aids in finding the words that best express an idea or meaning. In Section 3, we will show how a thesaurus can be used to find lexical chains in text. 2.1 The Structure of the Thesaurus"]},{"title":"Roget's International Thesaurus, 4th Edition","paragraphs":["(1977) is composed of 1042 sequentially numbered basic categories.

For each entry, a list of words suggesting its various distinct subsenses is given, and a category or paragraph number for each of these. Figure 2 shows the index entry for lid. To find words related to lid in its sense of cover, one would turn to paragraph 5 of category 228. An index entry may be a pointer to a category or paragraph if there are no subsenses to be distinguished. 2.2 Differences from Traditional Knowledge Bases In the structure of traditional artificial intelligence knowledge bases, such as frames or semantic networks, words or ideas that are related are actually \"physically close\" in the representation. In a thesaurus this need not be true. Physical closeness has some importance, as can be seen clearly from the hierarchy, but words in the index of the thesaurus often have widely scattered categories, and each category often points to a widely scattered selection of categories.","The thesaurus simply groups words by idea. It does not have to name or classify the idea or relationship. In traditional knowledge bases, the relationships must be named. For example, in a semantic net, a relationship might be isa or color-of, and in a frame database, there might be a slot for color or location.","In Section 1, different types of word relationships were discussed: systematic semantic, nonsystematic semantic, word association, and words related by a common situation. A factor common to all but situational relationships is that there is a strong tendency for the word relationships to be captured in the thesaurus. This holds even for the nonsystematic semantic relations, which are the most problematic by definition. A thesaurus simply groups related words without attempting to explicitly name each relationship. In a traditional computer database, a systematic semantic relationship can be represented by a slot value for a frame, or by a named link in a semantic network. If it is hard to classify a relationship in a systematic semantic way, it will be hard to represent the relationship in a traditional frame or semantic network formalism. Of the 16 nonsystematic semantic lexical chains given as examples in Halliday and Hasan (1976), 14 were found in Roget's Thesaurus (1977) using the relations given in Section 3.2.2. This represents an 87% hit rate (but not a big sample space). Word associations show a strong tendency to be findable in a thesaurus. Of the 16 word association pairs given in Hirst (1987), 14 were found in Roget's Thesaurus (1977). Since two of the word senses were not contained in the thesaurus at all, this represents a 100% hit rate among those that were. Situational word relationships are not as likely to be found in a general thesaurus. An example of a situational relationship is between car and lights, where the two words are clearly related in the situation involving a car's lights, but the relationship will not be found between them in a general thesaurus. 28 Morris and Hirst Lexical Cohesion"]},{"title":"3.

Our intuition was to allow one transitive link: word a is related to word c but not to word d. It seemed that two or more transitive links would so severely weaken the word relationship as to cause it to be nonintuitive. Our analysis of our sample texts supported this. To summarize, a transitivity of one link is sufficient to successfully compute the intuitive chains. An automated system could be used to test this out extensively, varying the number of transitive links and calculating the consequences. It is likely that it varies slightly with respect to style, author, or type of text.","There are two ways in which a transitive relation involving one link can cause two words to be related. In the first way, if word a is related to word b, and word b is related to word c, then word a is related to word c.

For example, if word c is related to word a and to word b, then word a and word b are not related, since at the time of processing, they were not relatable. Symmetry was not found to be necessary for computing the lexical chains.","We now consider how many sentences can separate two words in a lexical chain before the words should be considered unrelated.

The distance will not be \"large,\" because words in a chain co-relate due to recognizable relations, and large distances would interfere with the recognition of relations.","The five texts were analyzed with respect to distance between clearly related words. The analysis showed that there can be up to two or three intermediary sentences between a word and the preceding element of a chain segment with which it can be linked. At distances of four or more intermediary sentences, the word is only able to signal a return to an existing chain. Returns happened after between 4 and 19 intermediary sentences in the sample texts. One significant fact emerged from this analysis: returns consisting of one word only were always made with a repetition of one of the words in the returned-to chain. Returns consisting of more than one word did not necessarily use repetition -- in fact in most cases, the first word in the return was not a repetition.","The question of chain returns and when they can occur requires further research. When distances between relatable words are not tightly bound (as in the case of returns), the chances of incorrect chain linkages increase. It is anticipated that chain return analysis would become integrated with other text processing tools in order to prevent this. Also, we believe that chain"]},{"title":"strength","paragraphs":["analysis will be required for this purpose. Intuitively, some lexical chains are \"stronger\" than others, and possibly only strong chains can be returned to. There are three factors contributing to chain strength. 1. Reiteration -- the more repetitions, the stronger the chain. 2. Density -- the denser the chain, the stronger it is. 3. Length -- the longer the chain, the stronger it is. Ideally, some combination of values reflecting these three factors should result in a chain strength value that can be useful in determining whether a chain is strong enough to be returned to. Also, a strong chain should be more likely to have a structural correspondence than a weak one. It seems likely that chains could contain particularly strong portions with special implications for structure. These issues will not be addressed here. 3.2.3 Notation and Data Structures. In the computation of lexical chains, the following information is kept for each word in a chain: A word number, which is a sequential, chain-based number for each word so that it can be uniquely identified. The sentence number in which the word occurs. The chain created so far.

Using Lexical Chains to Determine Text Structure This section describes how lexical chains formed by the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3 can be used as a tool. 4.1 Lexical Chains and Text Structure Any structural theory of text must be concerned with identifying units of text that are about the same thing. When a unit of text is about the same thing there is a strong tendency for semantically related words to be used within that unit. By definition, lexical chains are chains of semantically related words. Therefore it makes sense to use them as clues to the structure of the text.","This section will concentrate on analyzing correspondences between lexical chains and structural units of text, including: • the correspondence of chain boundaries to structural unit boundaries; • returns to existing chains and what they indicate about structural units;","• lexical chain strength and reliability of predicting correspondences between chains and structural units;","• an analysis of problems encountered, and when extra textual information is required to validate the correspondences between lexical chains and structural components. The text structure theory chosen for this analysis was that of Grosz and Sidner (1986). it was chosen because it is an attempt at a general domain-independent theory of text structure that has gained a significant acceptance in the field as a good standard approach.","The methodology we used in our analyses was as follows:","1. We determined the lexical chain structure of the text using the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3. (In certain rare cases where the algorithm did not form intuitive lexical chains properly, it is noted, both in Section 3.4 and in the analysis in this section. The intuitive chain was used for the analysis; however the lexical chain data given in Appendix A show the rare mismatches between intuition and the algorithm.) 2. We determined the"]},{"title":"intentional structure","paragraphs":["of the text using the theory outlined by Grosz and Sidner. 35 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1",". We compared the lexical structure formed in step 1 with the intentional structure formed in step 2, and looked for correspondences between them. 4.2 An Example Example 14 shows one of the five texts that we analyzed. It is the first section of an article in Toronto magazine, December 1987, by Jay Teitel, entitled \"Outland. \"2 The tables in Appendix A show the lexical chains for the text. (The other four texts and their analyses are given in Morris 1988.) Example 14 1. ¶I spent the first 19 years of my life in the suburbs, the initial 14 or so relatively contented, the last four or five wanting mainly to be elsewhere. 2. The final two I remember vividly: I passed them driving to and from the University of Toronto in a red 1962 Volkswagen 1500 afflicted with night blindness. 3. The car's lights never worked -- every dusk turned into a kind of medieval race against darkness, a panicky, mounfful rush north, away from everything I knew was exciting, toward everything I knew was deadly. 4. I remember looking through the windows at the commuters mired in traffic beside me and actively hating them for their passivity. 5. I actually punched holes in the white vinyl ceiling of the Volks and then, by way of penance, wrote beside them the names and phone numbers of the girls I would call when I had my own apartment in the city. 6. One thing I swore to myself: I would never live in the suburbs again. 7. ¶My aversion was as much a matter of environment as it was traffic -- one particular piece of the suburban setting: the \"cruel sun.\" 8. Growing up in the suburbs you can get used to a surprising number of things -- the relentless \"residentialness\" of your surroundings, the weird certainty you have that everything will stay vaguely new-looking and immune to historic soul no matter how many years pass. 9. You don't notice the eerie silence that descends each weekday when every sound is drained out of your neighbourhood along with all the people who've gone to work. 10. I got used to pizza, and cars, and the fact that the cultural hub of my community was the collective TV set. 11. But once a week I would step outside as dusk was about to fall and be absolutely bowled over by the setting sun, slanting huge and cold across the untreed front lawns, reminding me not just how barren and sterile, but how undefended life could be. 12. As much as I hated the suburban drive to school, I wanted to get away from the cruel suburban sun. 13. ¶When I was married a few years later, my attitude hadn't changed. 14. My wife was a city girl herself, and although her reaction to the suburbs was less intense than mine, we lived in a series of apartments safely straddling Bloor Street. 15. But four years ago, we had a second child, and simultaneously the school my wife taught at moved to Bathurst Street north of Finch Avenue. 2 Q Jay Teitel. Reprinted with kind permission of the author. 36 Morris and Hirst Lexical Cohesion 16. She was now driving 45 minutes north to work every morning, along a route that was perversely identical to the one I'd driven in college. 17. ¶We started looking for a house. 18. Our first limit was St. Clair -- we would go no farther north. 19. When we took a closer look at the price tags in the area though, we conceded that maybe we'd have to go to Eglinton -- but that was definitely it. 20. But the streets whose names had once been magical barriers, latitudes of tolerance, quickly changed to something else as the Sundays passed. 21. Eglinton became Lawrence, which became Wilson, which became Sheppard. 22. One wind-swept day in May I found myself sitting in a town-house development north of Steeles Avenue called Shakespeare Estates. 23. It wasn't until we stepped outside, and the sun, blazing unopposed over a country club, smacked me in the eyes, that I came to. 24. It was the cruel sun. 25. We got into the car and drove back to the Danforth and porches as fast as we could, grateful to have been reprieved. 26. ¶And then one Sunday in June I drove north alone. 27. This time I drove up Bathurst past my wife's new school, hit Steeles, and kept going, beyond Centre Street and past Highway 7 as well. 28. I passed farms, a man selling lobsters out of his trunk on the shoulder of the road, a chronic care hospital, a country club and what looked like a mosque. 29. I reached a light and turned right. 30. I saw a sign that said Houses and turned right again. 31. ¶In front of me lay a virgin crescent cut out of pine bush. 32. A dozen houses were going up, in various stages of construction, surrounded by hummocks of dry earth and stands of precariously tall trees nude halfway up their trunks. 33. They were the kind of trees you might see in the mountains. 34. A couple was walking hand-in-hand up the dusty dirt roadway, wearing matching blue track suits. 35. On a \"front lawn\" beyond them, several little girls with hair exactly the same colour of blond as my daughter's were whispering and laughing together. 36. The air smelled of sawdust and sun. 37. ¶It was a suburb, but somehow different from any suburb I knew. 38. It felt warm. 39. ¶It was Casa Drive. 40. ¶In 1976 there were 2,124,291 people in Metropolitan Toronto, an area bordered by Steeles Avenue to the north, Etobicoke Creek on the west, and the Rouge River to the east. 41. In 1986, the same area contained 2,192,721 people, an increase of 3 percent, all but negligible on an urban scale. 42. In the same span of time the three outlying regions stretching across the top of Metro -- Peel, Durham, and York -- increased in population by 55 percent, from 814,000 to some 1,262,000. 43. Half a million people had poured into the crescent north of Toronto in the space of a decade, during which time the population of the City of Toronto actually declined as did the populations of the \"old\" suburbs with the exception of Etobicoke and Scarborough. 44. If the sprawling agglomeration of people known as Toronto has boomed in the past 10 years it has boomed outside the traditional city confines in a totally new city, a new suburbia containing one and a quarter million people. 37 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1 4.3 The Correspondences between Lexical and Intentional Structures In Figure 6 we show the intentional structure of the text of Section 4.2, and in Figure 7 we show the correspondences between the lexical chains and intentions of the example.","There is a clear correspondenc.e between chain 1, { ...."]},{"title":"driving, car's","paragraphs":[".... }, and intention I (changing attitudes to suburban life).

Also, the returns coincided with intentional boundaries. 5. Conclusions The motivation behind this work was that lexical cohesion in text should correspond in some way to the structure of the text. Since lexical cohesion is a result of a unit of text being, in some recognizable semantic way, about a single topic, and text structure 39 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1 analysis involves finding the units of text that are about the same topic, one should have something to say about the other. This was found to be true. The lexical chains computed by the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3 correspond closely to the intentional structure produced from the structural analysis method of Grosz and Sidner (1986). This is important, since Grosz and Sidner give no method for computing the intentions or linguistic segments that make up the structure that they propose.","Hence the concept of lexical cohesion, defined originally by Halliday and Hasan (1976) and expanded in this work, has a definite use in an automated text understanding system. Lexical chains are shown to be almost entirely computable with the relations defined in Section 3.2.2. The computer implementation of this type of thesaurus access would be a straightforward task involving traditional database techniques. The program to implement the algorithm given in Section 3.2.3 would also be straightforward. However, automated testing could help fine-tune the parameters, and would help to indicate any unfortunate chain linkages. Although straightforward from an engineering point of view, the automation would require a significant effort. A machine-readable thesaurus with automated index searching and lookup is required.","The texts we have analyzed, here and elsewhere (Morris 1988) are general-interest articles taken from magazines. They were chosen specifically to illustrate that lexical cohesion, and hence this tool, is not domain-specific. 5.1 Improvements on Earlier Research The methods used in this work improve on those from Halliday and Hasan (1976). Halliday and Hasan related words back to the first word to which they are tied, rather than forming explicit lexical chains that include the relationships to intermediate words in the chain. They had no notions of transitivity, distance between words in a chain, or chain returns. Their intent was not a computational means of finding lexical chains, and they did not suggest a thesaurus for this purpose.","Ventola (1987) analyzed lexical cohesion and text structure within the framework of systemic linguistics and the specific domain of service encounters such as the exchange of words between a client at a post office and a postal worker. Ventola's chain-building rule was that each lexical item is \"taken back once to the nearest preceding lexically cohesive item regardless of distance\" (p. 131). In our work the related words in a chain are seen as indicating structural units of text, and hence distance between words is relevant. Ventola did not have the concept of chain returns, and transitivity was allowed up to any level. Her research was specific to the domain used. She does not discuss a computational method of determining the lexical chains.","Hahn (1985) developed a text parsing system that considers lexical cohesion. Nouns in the text are mapped directly to the underlying model of the domain, which was implemented as a frame-structured knowledge base. Hahn viewed lexical cohesion as a local phenomenon between words in a sentence and the preceding one. There was also an extended recognizer that worked for cohesion contained within paragraph boundaries. Recognizing lexical cohesion was a matter of searching for ways of relating frames and slots in the database that are activated by words in the text. Heavy reliance is put on the \"formally clear cut model of the underlying domain\" (Hahn 1985, p. 3). However, general-interest articles such as we analyzed do not have domains that can be a priori formally represented as frames with slot values in such a manner that lexical cohesion will correspond directly to them. Our work uses lexical cohesion as it naturally occurs in domain-independent text as an indicator of unity, rather than fitting a domain model to the lexical cohesion. Hahn does not use the concept of chain returns or transitivity.","Sedelow and Sedelow (1986, 1987) have done a significant amount of research 40 Morris and Hirst Lexical Cohesion on the thesaurus as a knowledge source for use in a natural language understanding system. They have been interested in the application of clustering patterns in the thesaurus. Their student Bryan (1973) proposed a graph-theoretic model of the thesaurus. A boolean matrix is created with words on one axis and categories on the other. A cell is marked as true if a word associated with a cell intersects with the category associated with a cell. Paths or chains in this model are formed by traveling along rows or columns to other true cells. Semantic \"neighborhoods\" are grown, consisting of the set of chains emanating from an entry. It was found that without some concept of chain strength, the semantic relatedness of these neighborhoods decays, partly due to homographs. Strong links are defined in terms of the degree of overlap between categories and words. A strong link exists where at least two categories contain more than one word in common, or at least two words contain more than one category in common. The use of strong links was found to enable the growth of strong semantic chains with homograph disambiguation.","This concept is different from that used in our work. Here, by virtue of words cooccurring in a text and then also containing at least one category in common or being in the same category, they are considered lexically related and no further strength is needed. We use the thesaurus as a validator of lexical relations that are possible due to the semantic relations among words in a text. 5.2 Further Research It has already been mentioned that the concept of chain strength needs much further work. The intuition is that the stronger a chain, the more likely it is to have a corresponding structural component.","The integration of this tool with other text understanding tools is an area that will require a lot of work. Lexical chains do not always correspond exactly to intentional structure, and when they do not, other textual information is needed to obtain the correct correspondences. In the example given, there were cases where a lexical chain did correspond to an intention, but the sentences spanned by the lexical chain and the intention differed by more than two. In these cases, verification of the possible correspondence must be accomplished through the use of other textual information such as semantics or pragmatics. Cue words would be interesting to address, since such information seems to be more computationally accessible than underlying intentions.","It would be useful to automate this tool and run a large corpus of text through it. We suspect that the chain-forming parameter settings (regarding transitivity and distances between words) will be shown to vary slightly according to author's style and the type of text. As it is impossible to do a complete and error-free lexical analysis of large text examples in a limited time-frame, automation is desirable. It could help shed some light on possible unfortunate chain linkages. Do they become problematic, and if so, when does this tend to happen? Research into limiting unfortunate linkages and detecting when the method is likely to produce incorrect results should be done (cf. Charniak 1986).","Analysis using different theories of text structure was not done, but could prove insightful. The independence of different people's intuitive chains and structure as-signments was also not addressed by this paper.","A practical limitation of this work is that it depends on a thesaurus as its knowledge base. A thesaurus is as good as the work that went into creating it, and also depends on the perceptions, experience, and knowledge of its creators. Since language is not static, a thesaurus would have to be continually updated to remain current. Furthermore, no one thesaurus exists that meets all needs."]},{"title":"Roget's Thesaurus,","paragraphs":["for example, is a general thesaurus that does not contain lexical relations specific to the geography 41 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 1 of Africa or quantum mechanics. Therefore, further work needs to be done on identifying other sources of word knowledge, such as domain-specific thesauri, dictionaries, and statistical word usage information, that should be integrated with this work. As an anonymous referee pointed out to us, Volks and Volkswagen were not included in the chain containing driving and car. These words were not in a general thesaurus, and were also missed by the authors!","Section 1 mentioned that lexical chains would be also useful in providing a context for word sense disambiguation and in narrowing to specific word meanings. As an example of a chain providing useful information for word sense disambiguation, consider words I to 15 of chain 2.1 of the example: {afflicted, darkness, panicky, mournful, exciting, deadly, hating, aversion, cruel, relentless, weird, eerie, cold, barren, sterile .... }. In the context of all of these words, it is clear that barren and sterile do not refer to an inability to reproduce, but to a cruel coldness. The use of lexical chains for ambiguity resolution is a promising area for further research.
