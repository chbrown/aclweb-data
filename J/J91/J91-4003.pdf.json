Introduction","paragraphs":["I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational complexity of large lexical databases. Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars. The wedding of these disciplines is so important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be difficult to carry out serious computational research in the fields of linguistics and NLP without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources (cf. Walker et al. [forthcoming] and Boguraev and Briscoe [1988]). Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical semantics, which is currently witnessing a revival.","In order to achieve a synthesis of lexical semantics and NLP, I believe that the lexical semantics community should address the following questions:","1. Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically sounder than the previous work in the field?","2. Do theories being developed today have broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work? Waltham, MA 02254 Q 1991 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4","3. Do current theories provide any new insights into the representation of knowledge for the global structure of the lexicon?","4. Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with useful resources for parsing, generation, and translation research?","Before addressing these questions, I would like to establish two basic assumptions that will figure prominently in my suggestions for a lexical semantics framework. The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail. There is no way in which meaning can be completely divorced from the structure that carries it. This is an important methodological point, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories.","The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual structures in the system and the domain it operates in. This is tantamount to stating that the semantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles (whatever their structure).","Computational lexical semantics should be guided by the following principles. First, a clear notion of semantic well-formedness will be necessary to characterize a theory of possible word meaning. This may entail abstracting the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences. For instance, this might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the semantic contributions of lexical items in composition. 1 Although this is not a necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for lexical semantic descriptions.","Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions (Gruber 1965; Fillmore 1968). As argued in Levin and Rappaport (1986), named roles are useful at best for establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language. The distinctions possible with theta-roles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a sentence. What is needed, I will argue, is a principled method of lexical decomposition. This presupposes, if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to several levels of interpretation in the semantics (Scha 1983).","Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs. Recent work has done much to clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows (Levin 1985, 1989). Yet it is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon and grammar. The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories (but see Miller and Johnson-Laird [1976], Miller and Fellbaum [1991], and Fass [1988]). That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, and even less into the semantics of nominals. Not until all major categories have been studied can we hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.","Stepping back from the lexicon for a moment, let me say briefly what I think the 1 This is still a contentious point and is an issue that is not at all resolved in the community. Hobbs (1987) and Wilensky (1990), for example, argue that there should be no distinction between commonsense knowledge and lexical knowledge. Nevertheless, I will suggest below that there are good reasons, both methodological and empirical, for establishing just such a division. Pustejovsky and Bergler (1991) contains a good survey on how this issue is addressed by the community. 410 James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon position of lexical research should be within the larger semantic picture. Ever since the earliest attempts at real text understanding, a major problem has been that of controlling the inferences associated with the interpretation process. In other words, how deep or shallow is the understanding of a text? What is the unit of well-formedness when doing natural language understanding; the sentence, utterance, paragraph, or discourse? There is no easy answer to this question because, except for the sentence, these terms are not even formalizable in a way that most researchers would agree on.","It is my opinion that the representation of the context of an utterance should be viewed as involving many different"]},{"title":"generative factors","paragraphs":["that account for the way that language users create and manipulate the context under constraints, in order to be understood. Within such a theory, where many separate semantic levels (e.g. lexical semantics, compositional semantics, discourse structure, temporal structure) have independent interpretations, the global interpretation of a \"discourse\" is a highly flexible and malleable structure that has no single interpretation. The individual sources of semantic knowledge compute local inferences with a high degree of certainty (cf. Hobbs et al. 1988; Charniak and Goldman 1988). When integrated together, these inferences must be globally coherent, a state that is accomplished by processes of cooperation among separate semantic modules. The basic result of such a view is that semantic interpretation proceeds in a principled fashion, always aware of what the source of a particular inference is, and what the certainty of its value is. Such an approach allows the reasoning process to be both tractable and computationally efficient. The representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure. 2. Methods in Lexical Semantics Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail. First, let us turn to the issue of methodology. How can we determine the soundness of our method? Are new techniques available now that have not been adequately explored? Very briefly, one can summarize the most essential techniques assumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example Cruse [1986]):","• On the basis of categorial distinctions, establish the fundamental differences between the grammatical classes; the typical semantic behavior of a word of category X. For example, verbs typically behave as predicators, nouns as arguments.","• Find distinctions between elements of the same word class on the basis of collocation and cooccurrence tests.

What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves as the descriptive details provided by each test. One thing that has changed, however -- and this is significant -- is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even new tools for lexical semantics research: see Atkins (1987) for sense discrimination tasks; Amsler (1985), Atkins et al. (forthcoming) for constructing concept taxonomies; Wilks et al. (1988) for establishing semantic relatedness among word senses; and Boguraev and Pustejovsky (forthcoming) for testing new ideas about semantic representations."]},{"title":"3. Descriptive Adequacy of Existing Representations","paragraphs":["Turning now to the question of how current theories compare with the coverage of lexical semantic data, there are two generalizations that should be made. First, the 413 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 taxonomic descriptions that have recently been made of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see Levin [1985] for review). Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of Talmy (1975, 1985) and Jackendoff (1983), fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were not captured in the earlier, primitives-based approach of Schank (1972, 1975) or the frame semantics of Fillmore (1968).","As an example of the verb classifications developed by various researchers (and compiled by the MIT Lexicon Project; see Levin [1985, 1989]), consider the grammatical alternations in the example sentences below (cf. Dow .ty 1991). Example 10 a. John met Mary. b. John and Mary met. Example 11 a. A car ran into a truck. b. A car and a truck ran into each other. Example 12 a. A car ran into a tree. b. *A car and a tree ran into each other. These three pairs show how the semantics of transitive motion verbs (e.g. run into) is similar in some respects to reciprocal verbs such as meet. The important difference, however, is that the reciprocal interpretation requires that both subject and object be animate or moving; hence 12b is ill-formed. (cf. Levin 1989; Dowty 1991).","Another example of how diathesis reveals the underlying semantic differences between verbs is illustrated in Examples 13 and 14 below. A construction called the conative (see Hale and Keyser [1986] and Levin [1985]) involves adding the preposition at to the verb, changing the verb meaning to an action directed toward an object. Example 13 a. Mary cut the bread. b. Mary cut at the bread. Example 14 a. Mary broke the bread. b. *Mary broke at the bread. What these data indicate is that the conative is possible only with verbs of a particular semantic class; namely, verbs that specify the manner of an action that results in a change of state of an object.","As useful and informative as the research on verb classification is, there is a major shortcoming with this approach. Unlike the theories of Katz and Fodor (1963), Wilks (1975a), and Quillian (1968), there is no general coherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other major categories are studied. This can be essential for establishing a globally coherent theory of semantic representation. On the other hand, the semantic distinctions captured by these older theories were often too coarse-grained. It is clear, therefore, that the classifications made by Levin and her colleagues are an important starting point for a serious theory of knowledge representation. I claim that lexical semantics must build upon this research toward 414 James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon constructing a theory of word meaning that is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in a real knowledge representation system."]},{"title":"4. Explanatory Adequacy of Existing Representations","paragraphs":["In this section I turn to the question of whether current theories have changed the way we look at representation and lexicon design. The question here is whether the representations assumed by current theories are adequate to account for the richness of natural language semantics. It should be pointed out here that a theory of lexical meaning will affect the general design of our semantic theory in several ways. If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings to expressions, accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc., then our view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the language denote. Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functors or passive arguments (Montague 1974). But we will see that if we change the way in which categories can denote, then the form of compositionality itself changes. Therefore, if done correctly, lexical semantics can be a means to reevaluate the very nature of semantic composition in language.","In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics? I mentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes. In fact, the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb. This has obvious consequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity. For example, consider the verb bake in the two sentences below."]},{"title":"Example 15","paragraphs":["a. John baked the potato. b.

In fact, given strict requirements on the way that a verb can project its lexical information, the verb run in Example 18 will also have two lexical entries, depending on the syntactic environment it selects (Talmy 1985; Levin and Rappaport 1988). 415 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 Example 18 a.

Inferences are made through the primitives into which a word is decomposed. In contrast to this view, a relation-based theory of word meaning claims that there is no need for decomposition into primitives if words (and their concepts) are associated through a network of explicitly defined links (e.g. Quillian 1968; Collins and Quillian 1969; Fodor 1975; Carnap 1956; Brachman 1979).

I will build on Grimshaw's recent proposals (Grimshaw 1990) for how to define the mapping from the lexicon to syntax. to a particular vocabulary of primitives, a lexical semantics should provide a method for the decomposition and composition of lexical items. 7 Some of these roles are reminiscent of descriptors used by various computational researchers, such as Wilks (1975b), Hayes (1979), and Hobbs et al. (1987). Within the theory outlined here, these roles determine a minimal semantic description of a word that has both semantic and grammatical consequences. 418 James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon","This provides us with an answer to the question of what levels of semantic representation are necessary for a computational lexical semantics. In sum, I will argue that lexical meaning can best be captured by assuming the following levels of representation.","1. Argument Structure: The behavior of a word as a function, with its arity specified. This is the predicate argument structure for a word, which indicates how it maps to syntactic expressions.","2. Event Structure: Identification of the particular event type (in the sense of Vendler [1967]) for a word or phrase: e.g. as state, process, or transition.","3. Qualia Structure: The essential attributes of an object as defined by the lexical item.","4. Inheritance Structure: How the word is globally related to other concepts in the lexicon. These four structures essentially constitute the different levels of semantic expressiveness and representation that are needed for a computational theory of lexical semantics. Each level contributes a different kind of information to the meaning of a word. The important difference between this highly configurational approach to lexical semantics and feature-based approaches is that the recursive calculus defined for word meaning here also provides the foundation for a fully compositional semantics for natural language and its interpretation into a knowledge representation model. 5.1 Argument Structure A logical starting point for our investigations into the meaning of words is what has been called the functional structure or argument structure associated with verbs. What originally began as the simple listing of the parameters or arguments associated with a predicate has developed into a sophisticated view of the way arguments are mapped onto syntactic expressions (for example, the"]},{"title":"f-structure","paragraphs":["in Lexical Functional Grammar [Bresnan 1982] and the"]},{"title":"Projection Principle","paragraphs":["in Government-Binding Theory [Chomsky 1981]).","One of the most important contributions has been the view that argument structure is highly structured independent of the syntax. Williams's (1981) distinction between external and internal arguments and Grimshaw's proposal for a hierarchically structured representation (Grimshaw 1990) provide us with the basic syntax for one aspect of a word's meaning.","The argument structure for a word can be seen as a minimal specification of its lexical semantics. By itself, it is certainly inadequate for capturing the semantic characterization of a lexical item, but it is a necessary component. 5.2 Event Structure As mentioned above, the theory of decomposition being outlined here is based on the central idea that word meaning is highly structured, and not simply a set of semantic features.

The event structure of a word is one level of the semantic specification 419 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 for a lexical item, along with its argument structure, qualia structure, and inheritance structure. Because it is recursively defined on the syntax, it is also a property of phrases and sentences. 8","I will assume a sortal distinction between three classes of events: states (eS), processes (8), and transitions (eT). Unlike most previous ,;ortal classifications for events, I will adopt a subeventual analysis or predicates, as argued in Pustejovsky (1991) and independently proposed in Croft (1991). In this view, an event sort such as e T may be decomposed into two sequentially structured subevents, (ee,sS). Aspects of the proposal will be introduced as needed in the following discussion. 6. A Theory of Qualia In Section 5, I demonstrated how most of the lexical semantics research has concentrated on verbal semantics. This bias influences our analyses of how to handle ambiguity and certain noncompositional structures. Therefore, the only way to relate the different senses for the verbs in the examples below was to posit separate entries. Example 22 a. John baked the potato. (bake1 = change(x, State(y))) b. John baked the cake. (bake2 = create(x,y)) Example 23 a. Mary hammered the metal. (hammer1 = change(x, State(y))) b. Mary hammered the metal fiat. (hammer2 = cause(x, Become(fiat(y)))) Example 24 a. John wiped the table. (wipe1 = change (x, State (y) )) b. John wiped the table clean. (wipe2 = cause(x, Become(clean(y)))) Example 25 a. Mary ran yesterday. (run1 = move(x)) b. Mary ran to the store yesterday. (run2 = go-to(x, y)) • Although the complement types selected by bake in 22, for example, are semantically related, the two word senses are clearly distinct and therefore must be lexically distinguished. According to the sense enumeration view, the same argument holds for the verbs in 23-25 as well. 8 This proposal is an extension of ideas explored by Bach (1986), Higginbotham (1985), and Allen (1984). For a full discussion, see Pustejovsky (1988, 1991). See Tenny (1987) for a proposal on how aspectual distinctions are mapped to the syntax. 420 James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon","A similar philosophy has lead linguists to multiply word senses in constructions involving Control and Equi-verbs, where different syntactic contexts necessitate different semantic types? Example 26 a. It seems that John likes Mary. b. John seems to like Mary. Example 27 a. Mary prefers that she come. b. Mary prefers to come. Normally, compositionality in such structures simply refers to the application of the functional element, the verb, to its arguments. Yet, such examples indicate that in order to capture the systematicity of such ambiguity, something else is at play, where a richer notion of composition is operative. What then accounts for the polysemy of the verbs in the examples above?","The basic idea I will pursue is the following. Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function as simple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself. The product of function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument.

We return to this topic below.","10 I will be assuming a Davidsonian-style representation for the discussion below. Predicates in the language are typed for a particular event-sort, and thematic roles are treated as partial functions over the event (cf. Dowty 1989 and Chierchia 1989).","11 More precisely, the process e p should reflect that it is the substance contained in the object x that is affected. See footnote 20 for explanation. 421 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 is a natural kind, while the latter is an artifact. Knowledge of an object includes not just being able to identify or refer, but more specifically, being able to explain how an artifact comes into being, as well as what it is used for; the denotation of an object must identify these roles. Thus, any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, relative to certain predicates.","As is well known from work on event semantics and Aktionsarten, it is a general property of processes that they can shift their event type to become a transition event (cf. Hinrichs 1985; Moens and Steedman 1987; and Krifka 1987). This particular fact about event structures, together with the semantic distinction made above between the two object types, provides us with an explanation for what I will refer to as the logical polysemy of verbs such as bake.","As illustrated in Example 30a, when the verb takes as its complement a natural kind such as potato, the resulting semantic interpretation is unchanged; i.e., a process reading of a state-change. This is because the noun does not \"project\" an event structure of its own. That is, relative to the process of baking, potato does not denote an event-type. 12"]},{"title":"Example 30","paragraphs":["a. bake as Process: 3eP[bake(e P) A agent(~,j) A object(e P, a-potato)] b. P John baked V VP a potato NP What is it, then, about the semantics of cake that shifts this core meaning of bake from a state-change predicate to its creation sense? As just suggested, this additional meaning is contributed by specific lexical knowledge we have about artifacts, and cake in particular; namely, there is an event associated with that object's \"coming into being,\" in this case the process of baking. Thus, just as a verb can select for an argument-type, we can imagine that an argument is itself able to select the predicates that govern it. I will refer to such constructions as cospecifications. Informally, relative to the process bake, the noun cake carries the selectional information that it is a process of \"baking\" that brings it about. 13 12 However, relative to the process of growing, the noun potato does denote an event: 1. Mary grew the potato.","13 Other examples of cospecifications are: a. read a book, b. smoke a cigarette, c. mail a letter, d. deliver a lecture, and e. take a bath. 422 James Pustejovsky The Generative Lexicon","We can illustrate this schematically in Example 31, where the complement effectively acts like a \"stage-level\" event predicate (cf.

The semantic \"connectedness,\" as it were, is tighter when cospecification obtains. In such cases, the verb is able to successfully drop the dative PP argument, as shown below in (1). When the complement does not select the verb governing it, dative-drop is ungrammatical as seen in (2) (although there are predicates selected by these nouns; e.g. keep a secret, read a book, and play a record). la.

In Pustejovsky (1989b) and Pustejovsky and Anick (1988), I suggest that there is a system of relations that characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb. I called this the Qualia Structure, inspired by Aristotle's theory of explanation and ideas from Moravcsik (1975). Essentially, the qualia structure of a noun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb's meaning. The elements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as container, space, surface, figure, artifact, and so on. 19","As stated earlier, there are four basic roles that constitute the qualia structure for a lexical item.

Lexical Inheritance Theory In previous sections, I discussed lexical ambiguity and showed how a richer view of lexical semantics allows us to view a word's meaning as being flexible, where word senses could arise generatively by composition with other words. The final aspect of this flexibility deals with the logical associations a word has in a given context; that is, how this semantic information is organized as a global knowledge base. This involves capturing both the inheritance relations between concepts and, just as importantly, how the concepts are integrated into a coherent expression in a given sentence.","I will assume that there are two inheritance mechanisms at work for representing the conceptual relations in the lexicon:"]},{"title":"fixed","paragraphs":["inheritance and"]},{"title":"projective","paragraphs":["inheritance.

(1987) and Wilks (1975), while interesting work on shared information structures in NLP domains is that of Flickinger et al.

What we have not addressed, however, is how the fixed inheritance information of a lexical item is formally derivable during composition. This issue is explicitly addressed in Briscoe et al. (1990) as well as Pustejovsky and Briscoe (1991). 8. Conclusion In this paper I have outlined a framework for lexical semantic research that I believe can be useful for both computational linguists and theoretical linguists alike. I argued against the view that word meanings are fixed and inflexible, where lexical ambiguity must be treated by multiple word entries in the lexicon. Rather, the lexicon can be seen as a generative system, where word senses are related by logical operations defined by the well-formedness rules of the semantics. In this view, much of the lexical ambiguity of verbs and prepositions is eliminated because the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to the other lexical categories. I described a language for structuring the semantic information carried by nouns and adjectives, termed Qualia structure, as well as the rules of composition that allow this information to be incorporated into the semantic interpretation of larger expressions, including explicit methods for type coercion. Finally, I discussed how these richer lexical representations can be used to generate projective inheritance structures that connect the conceptual information associated with lexical items to the global conceptual lexicon. This suggests a way of accounting for relations such as coherence and the prototypicality of a predication. Although much of what I have presented here is incomplete and perhaps somewhat programmatic, I firmly believe this approach can help clarify the nature of word meaning and compositionality in natural language, and at the same time bring us closer to understanding the creative use of word senses.
