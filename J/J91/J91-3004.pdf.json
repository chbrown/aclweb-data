Watson Research Center Speech recognition language models are based on probabilities P(Wk+I = v [ WlW2~..., Wk) that the next word Wk+l will be any particular word v of the vocabulary, given that the word sequence Wl, w2,..., Wk is hypothesized to have been uttered in the past. If probabilistic context-free grammars are to be used as the basis of the language model, it will be necessary to compute the probability that successive application of the grammar rewrite rules (beginning with the sentence start symbol s) produces a word string whose initial substring is an arbitrary sequence wl, w2, . . . , Wk+l. In this paper we describe a new algorithm that achieves the required computation in at most a constant times k3-steps. 1. Introduction The purpose of this article is to develop an algorithm for computing the probability that a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) (that is, a grammar whose production rules have attached to them a probability of being used) generates an arbitrary initial substring of terminals. Thus, we treat the same problem recently considered by Wright and Wrigley (1989) from the point of view of LR grammars.","Probabilistic methods have been shown most effective in automatic speech recognition. Recognition (actually transcription) of natural unrestricted speech requires a \"language model\" that attaches probabilities to the production of all possible strings of words (Bahl et al. 1983). Consequently, if we believe that word generation can be modeled by context-free grammars, and if we want to base speech recognition (or handwriting recognition, optical character recogition, etc.) on such models, then it will become necessary to embed them into a probabilistic framework.","In speech recognition we are presented with words one at a time, in sequence, and so we would like to calculate the probability P(s --* w~w2... Wk...) that an arbitrary string wlw2... Wk is the initial substring of a sentence generated by the given SCFG. I * P.O. Box 218, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 1 In fact, in speech recognition (Bahl et al. 1983) we are presented with a hypothesized past text (the history) WlW2 .. • Wk and are interested in computing, for any arbitrary word v, the conditioned probability P(Wk+ 1 ---- v [ wlw2.., wk) that the next word uttered will be v given the hypothesized past wl w2 ... Wk. Assuming that successive sentences s are independent of each other (a rather dubious assumption justifiable only by a lack of adequate understanding of how one sentence influences another), we may as well take the view that wl is the first word of the current sentence and that Wk is not the last. Then P(s --* wlw2.., wkv...) P(Wk+I = v I WlW2...Wk) =","P(s --* wlw2... Wk...) Hence our interest in the calculation of P(s --~ wlw2 • .. Wk...). (~) 1991 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 3 2. Definition of Stochastic Context-Free Grammars We will now define stochastic context free grammars (SCFGs) and establish some notation. We will use script symbols for sets, lowercase letters for elements of the sets or specific string items, and capitals for variables. We start with a vocabulary V = {Vl, V2,...,VN} whose elements, words vi, are the terminal symbols of the language. We next list a set of nonterminals g = {gl = s, g2~... ~gM} whose elements gj are grammatical phrase markers. They include the distinguished phrase marker s, the sentence \"start\" symbol. The purpose of our grammar is to generate sentences WlW2... w n of varying length n. The generation is accomplished by use of production rules, belonging to a set 2\"4, that rewrite individual phrase markers as sequences of phrase markers or words. For simplicity of manipulation but without loss of generality, we will limit the productions to the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). That is, only the following types of productions will be allowed: 1. H --+ GIG2 2. H-+ V (1)","The grammar is stochastic, because to each rule there is assigned a probability of its use. Let H be any nonterminal, and let #(H) be the number of productions rewriting H. The ith of these productions will then take place with probability P(i I H). It is assumed that for all i = 1,2 .... , #(H), P(i I H) is a strictly positive number and that","#(~) P(i l H ) = 1 i=1 (2)","It will be convenient to denote the probabilities P(i I H) by the productions they refer to, e.g., P(H --+ GIG2) or P(H --+ V).","A context-free grammar is assumed to generate sentences from top to bottom, starting with some rule s --+ G1G2 that rewrites the sentence symbol s and is used with probability P(s --+ GIG2). The generated nonterminals G1 and G 2 are then rewritten, and the rewriting process continues until no nonterminals remain to be rewritten, all having been replaced by words through use of rewrite rules of type (1). The probability of the entire process is equal to the product of the probabilities of the individual rewrite rules used.","We say that a SCFG is well defined in case it forms a language model; that is, the total probability of strings of terminals generated by the grammar is equal to 1: OO"]},{"title":"XI P(s---+ WlW2...Wn)-~- 1","paragraphs":["n=l"]},{"title":"wlw2...wnEV.","paragraphs":["A context-free grammar is said to be proper if starting from the distinguished nonterminal s, the only nonterminals produced are those whose further rewriting can eventually result in a string of terminals.
