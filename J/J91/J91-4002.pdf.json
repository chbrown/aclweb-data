It is shown that this problem is NP-hard, and a restriction to the formalism, which renders the classification problem soluble in polynomial time, is suggested. An algorithm for the unrestricted classification problem, which separates a potentially expensive second stage from a more tractable first stage, is then presented. 1. Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we describe algorithms that enable the system networks of Systemic Grammar (HaUiday 1976, 1975) to be exploited in applications, such as natural language understanding, that require incremental description refinement. We are attracted to the system network formalism on three main counts: Potential Reversibility. System networks fit well with a model of linguistic behavior as goal-directed action, since they encode grammatical information in the form of sets of interconnected choices that a language user needs to make in order to produce apposite and communicative utterances. It seems natural to exploit this information for comprehension as well as generation. Computational Convenience. System networks look simple, yet are expressive enough to allow the development of substantial grammars. If this apparent simplicity is reflected in the mathematical properties of the system network formalism then it may be possible to design cheap description refinement algorithms that use the networks. Wider Applications. If the networks turn out to be easy to process, they may have wider applications in tasks requiring representation of nonlinguistic knowledge. We think that the tasks for which such networks are most likely to be appropriate are those for which conventional taxonomic representations are nearly, but not quite, sufficient. Our algorithms (presented in the final part of this paper) operate by converting as much as possible of the information contained in the networks to taxonomic form. • University of Sussex, U.K., and 2 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, U.K., currently at Sharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd., Oxford, U.K. Supported by a studentship provided by the Science and Engineering Research Council's Information Technology Initiative.

Our main example will therefore be the network shown in Figure 1. This network provides information about the choices a speaker needs to make in order to correctly produce English pronouns. Similar networks can describe the choices that have to be made in order to generate other components of an utterance, such as sentences, verb phrases, or into-nation contours, but for present purposes pronouns will prove sufficient illustration.

Each network lays out a set of interconnected options, but does not specify how the system chooses between the options in a particular situation.","In systemic grammar, language production involw,~s the task of traversing a network, gradually making choices that incrementally specify various aspects of the form of an utterance. As choices are made the system collects features that are eventually realized in an appropriate form.

It is at its most systemic in its approach to what (Halliday 1975, p. 5) refers to as functions in structure, but contains nothing directly corresponding to the macro-functions by which Halliday characterizes the functions of language. In other words, Houghton's system retains the role of systemic networks in codifying choice, but the architecture does not align with tripartite systemic distinction between textual, ideational, anti interpersonal macro-functions (Winograd 1983, p. 288).","An interaction between two simulated agents is largely controlled by a representational level of interaction frames, which lays out a space of possible moves that allow an agent to initiate conversations, request information from an interlocutor, signal as-sent, convey information, and so on. This work is in the tradition of Davey (1978) and Power (1979), emphasizing the gamelike structure of multi-agent dialog in preference to the textual structure of extended monolog. In this context there seems to be little need for an explicit representation of the systemic macro-functions: Houghton's interaction frames suffice.","The interaction frames specify a repertoire of actions available to a simple planning mechanism that the agents use to carry out tasks specified by the system designer. The agents make no distinction between different types of action, and linguistic behavior only arises when it becomes necessary for an agent to enlist help to achieve its top-level goal. It is just as valid to find something out by looking as by asking, although interesting linguistic behavior will only occur in the latter case.","Houghton (1986) defines the interaction of"]},{"title":"Making Something Known","paragraphs":["as follows: Participants --- initiator <has_type AGENT>","addressee <has_type AGENT>","prop <has_type FACT> End Goal --- know(addressee,prop) Effect --- know(addressee,","know(initiator,prop)) Precondition --- know(initiator,","not(know(addressee,prop))) Response --- addressee -> update worldview","initiator -> check acceptance Reply --- accept or reject information 378 Chris Brew Systemic Classification and its Efficiency and comments that The goal of this interaction is to get the addressee to know something. The immediate effect here is that they will at least know that you know it, and the precondition is that the initiator believes the addressee does not already know it. The response of an addressee is to attempt to integrate that information into its current beliefs. The initiator waits for uptake of the information, which is indicated by the addressee's reply. (Houghton 1986, p. 90). In order to achieve the goal of informing someone that a door is locked, the speaker would instantiate initiator to point to herself, addressee to indicate her addressee and prop to stand for something like locked(door_a), setting up the environment within which linguistic decisions are to be made.","In principle an agent is free to draw on any available information in order to reach decisions about the choices offered within Houghton's systemic networks, and the outcome of these choices will affect the eventual form of the utterance. In practice the types of information available to the agent can be brought into a rough and ready correspondence with the types of information carried by Halliday's macro-functions.

Reference to the propositional content ensures that the system knows"]},{"title":"what","paragraphs":["it is trying to express. The distribution of propositional content between elements of the eventual utterance is mediated by a simple (de)compositional semantics using a lambda calculus-like representation similar to that provided by Pereira and Shieber (1987). The propositional content that is assigned to a particular constituent is extensively used by the chooser functions that determine the choices made in the course of realizing that constituent, but it is not the sole determinant of the eventual form of the utterance. Information about the component that Halliday calls textual is almost unnecessary in Houghton's system, since the tightly constrained structure of the dialogs make explicit signalling of topic or textual interconnections largely redundant. Houghton's agents are too simple and too single-minded to indulge in the sort of topic shifts that seem typical of real dialog, so there is no need to make available textual resources capable of signalling such shifts. Textual factors nevertheless play a role in the patterning of pronominalization decisions, and the information necessary for making these decisions comes primarily from 379 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 a record of the preceding dialog maintained by the system. This is part of the task of deciding how to say what it is that needs to be said.","Given the simplicity of the domain and the actors, the nature of the dialog, the absence of an explicitly represented version of Halliday's tripartite distinction, and the central role of the planning system, the issue of how tlhe various components interact loses much of the importance it has in standard systemic grammar. While Houghton does provide a mechanism by which making a choice at a particular node of a systemic network may, as a side effect, pre-empt decisions that might otherwise need to be made later, the issue of parallel selection of features does not matter as much as it would in a system where autonomous textual, ideational, and interpersonal components were acting in tandem to constrain the form of a text.","In standard systemic grammars the connection between features and utterances is encoded in the form of realization rules. In Houghton's system the realization relations are specified indirectly by means of an association between sets of features and the production of a context-free phrase structure grammar. Generation begins with a single node that will eventually span the whole sentence, and proceeds by recursively expanding that node until a complete phrase marker is produced. Whenever a node needs to be expanded the system collects a set of features by traversing one or more systemic networks, then uses the features to select an appropriate production from the context-free part of the grammar. The recursive generation of constituents terminates when it reaches a situation where all the current leaf nodes can be realized lexically. The phrase structure component encodes the range of available constructions and mediates the distribution of semantic content to the leaves of the tree. For a more detailed account of the generation process see the descriptions in Houghton (1986) and Houghton and Isard (1987). 2.1.2 The Generation of Pronouns. Having sketched the reasons for which we became interested in the properties of systemic networks and their role in a grammar, we now return to the discussion of system networks as formal objects in their own right, which is the main subject of this paper. Sample realization rules for English pronouns are provided in Figure 2. For pronouns, the realization relationship is particularly simple, since every distinct set of features that can be produced by the network maps onto a single lexical item. Throughout the rest of the paper we shall be using the generation of pronouns as a place holder for the more elaborate generation process outlined above.","Let us consider two situations in which a hypothetical language-generation system might need to generate a pronoun, and trace the choices that need to be made. In both cases the system is attempting to brief its client about a government decision, but in the first situation it has just produced the sentence The government has decided to raise taxes, but in the second the corresponding sentence was The government have decided to raise taxes. These sentences are both grammatically acceptable in British English, but in one case the government are seen as a collection of people while in the other it is being treated as an entity in its own right. 1 In either case the system now wants to tell the user that the government is/are unlikely to carry out its/their decision before the next election. 2 1 The sentence containing this footnote is deliberately infelicitous, illustrating the mistake that we wouldn't want the system to make. 2 Stephen Isard points out that the parallel sentences The government has fallen and The government have fallen describe very different situations; evidently it is an oversimplification to suppose that a generation system has an entirely free choice between the alternative ways of referring to governments. 380 Chris Brew Systemic Classification and its Efficiency","The system's understanding of pronoun use is based on the network shown in Figure 1, which it will use in choosing an appropriate pronoun for each of these situations.","The traversal of the network starts at the left-hand side. The first choice that has to be made is the one between question, personal and demonstr. In both cases we need a personal pronoun rather than a question pronoun or a demonstr one. We are now faced with the need for decisions on CASE, PERSON and NUMBER. Let us stipulate that the government, however we describe it, is to be the subject of the sentence; the pronoun therefore receives the feature subject ire in both cases. The pronoun also has to be third person, since neither the system nor its client is the subject of the planned sentence. However the choice of NUMBER depends on the choice that was made earlier in the discourse, so in the first case the system will need to choose singular and in the second it will need plural. If it chooses plural it has reached the edge of the network, and can use the collected feature set to access the appropriate pronoun, which is they.","However, if it chooses singular it still needs to decide whether the government requires a feminine, masculine or neuter pronoun, since otherwise it cannot decide between she, he, and it. The system network formalizes the availability or otherwise of the GENDER choice by placing the corresponding system in a position that can only be reached if the pronoun being generated is both third and singular. Of course, a more elaborate process is involved in the generation of complex constituents, but the principle remains the same: networks are traversed, produce sets of features, and the features are used to guide the construction or selection of sub-constituents."]},{"title":"2.2 Systemic Language Analysis","paragraphs":["By specifying the range of options available to the language user a system network defines a set of possible outcomes to the generation process, and hence also a space of possible structures corresponding to the various feature sets that can be obtained by traversing the network. It may be that the networks admit structures that are never in fact used by the system as a whole, but without knowledge of the details of the mechanism by which choices are made we cannot exploit any additional constraints imposed by the process of realization. In this paper we focus on the use of the networks as a knowledge source in their own right. Systemic networks form a terminological representation system in the sense of the term used in work on KL-ONE and its successors (Brachman and Schmolze 1985; Nebel 1990). We would like to understand the nature of the knowledge they express well enough to be able to use system networks as the basis of a general, and perhaps computationally convenient, terminological language for use in linguistic applications. Our approach is very close to that of Mellish (1988), as well as to a multitude of other formalisms involving partial descriptions, such as Shieber (1986).","By way of example, consider the word your, as it is described by the network and rules in Figures 1 and 2. Without further information we do not know whether it is singular or plural, although we can be sure that it is second, personal and possdet. This information will sometimes be provided by context. In the sentence You should not take my word for it, but bolster your own intuitions by inspecting the realization rules for yourselves, we eventually discover that the writer is addressing the sentence to an audience of more than one person. In generation the system would presumably have made a decision about which mode of address was more appropriate, but when using the same networks and rules for interpretation the partial nature of the information at our disposal complicates the task of using the knowledge encoded by the networks. Note that the clinching yourselves appears several words after the instance of your in question, and that it could equally well have been yourself. 381 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 2.2.1 Systemic Classification. Following Mellish, we refer to the task of using system networks in comprehension as systemic classification. We conceive of this as an activity similar to the taxonomic classification carried out by biologists. By making use of the observable features of a specimen we attempt to pin down the point at which that specimen ought to be accommodated within the space of structural descriptions we have at our disposal. On the assumption that the slpeaker's linguistic options are correctly described by a particular collection of networks, a listener is entitled to make inferences from this assumption, and to use knowledge of the form of the system networks in the search for a plausible global hypothesis about the properties of the utterance that the speaker seems to have produced. Because the choices made by a speaker are interdependent, a plausible hypothesis about part of the description of an utterance may allow us to reconstruct part or all of the missing portion of the description. The job of a scheme for systemic classification is to provide efficient and correct algorithms for the construction of consistent descriptions and the rejection of inconsistent hypotheses. Nebel (1990) discusses a slightly more general notion of classification, applicable to a knowledge representation language like NIKL (Kaczmarek, Bates, and Robins 1986), BACK (Von Luck et al. 1986) or LOOM (MacGregor and Bates 1987). The notions of subsumption that operate in such rich formalisms are more sophisticated, but the essential idea of classification, namely the organization of terms into a pre-computed subsumption hierarchy, remains the same. As in Mellish's work, the main goal is to gain efficiency by pre-computing some or all of the useful subsumption relationships that hold between descriptions. For the purposes of this paper the descriptions are feature-based systemic descriptions and the role of the pre-computed subsumption graphs described by Nebel is played by the specially designed encodings that ensure that subsumption information is readily available at run-time. There is of course a price to pay for this run-time efficiency, since we have to pre-process the networks in order to establish the encoding relations that will be of use at run-time.","For the purposes of analyzing an utterance, the most important property of the feature system induced by a system network is the following Any system network defines a set of atomic labels that can be combined to form descriptions of linguistic objects. It also provides a complex of constraining principles that conspire to declare inconsistent certain combinations of features. For example, the network in Figure 1 expresses the constraint that no pronoun can be specified as both feminine and masculine, and also the constraint that only third person singular pronouns can bear either of these features. 2.3 Prior Work on Systemic Language Analysis Winograd (1983) and McCord (1977) have both provided techniques that re-express system networks and their associated realization rules as hand-crafted recognition programs.","In both cases this amounts to a proceduralization of the grammar, and runs the risk of making it even harder than necessary to debug a malfunctioning grammar. We prefer to adopt a more declarative approach, in which the grammar is represented in a form as close as possible to that with which linguists actually work.","Patten and Ritchie (1986) have produced a formal account of what a systemic grammar is. This covers the whole of Systemic Grammar, including the realization rules and the details of the way in which choices are made as well as the networks that are the present concern. Patten and Ritchie are primarily concerned with language-generation 382 Chris Brew Systemic Classification and its Efficiency rather than comprehension, but since they aim for a declarative specification of the generation relationship between systemic grammars and the utterances they license, it might be possible to use their grammars in either direction. For Patten and Ritchie a systemic grammar is encoded as a set of rules for a production system, and the generation process involves the application of these rules.","Kasper (1987a, 1987b) has designed algorithms that involve the encoding of both system networks and the associated realization rules as constraints expressed within a feature logic involving disjunction. He then implements the key operation of unification by applying a general technique for unification of disjunctive feature descriptions (Kasper 1988). These techniques decompose the problem of disjunctive unification into three stages, only the last of which is exponentially hard. We are not attempting to match his general algorithms for disjunctive unification, but rather to design special purpose algorithms that are particularly suitable for use with system networks, and particularly for those networks that play a role in Houghton's system.","In practice the set of constraints that Kasper develops from his systemic grammar is too large to solve conveniently with the constraint-solving technology available to him, so he augments the constraint grammar with a small hand-crafted phrase structure component. The main motivation for this move is the search for efficiency rather than any particular wish to use a phrase structure grammar. Kasper's basic strategy remains that of building up a large set of constraints that can then be solved by general theorem-proving techniques.","Like Kasper, we use a chart parser, but in our case the phrase structure grammar is an essential component of the knowledge used by the system rather than a small addition required for the sake of efficiency. This makes no difference from a formal point of view, but reflects our strategy of using appropriate special purpose mechanisms in preference to potentially costly general techniques. Although system networks, systemic realization rules, and context-free grammars can all be translated into formulae of Kasper's extended FUG, our approach has been to investigate ways in which the knowledge contained in these components can be exploited using simpler methods.","While Kasper's approach involves the translation of system networks into a more general constraint formalism, Mellish (1988) displays encodings that reduce the key operations of systemic classification to straightforward manipulations of PROLOG-like terms. Unfortunately, it turns'out that system networks sometimes need a rather opaque encoding, which would require costly re-translation if users needed to inspect the workings of an NLP system that used it. The general encoding is in principle capable of handling any system of constraints expressed in the propositional calculus, and makes no use of the particular structure of systemic descriptions.","Mellish's approach to the implementation of systemic classification is to construct structure preserving mappings from the space of systemic descriptions to an isomorphic space in which classes of entities are represented by terms taken from the GAF lattice. 3 These terms act as partial descriptions of linguistic objects, and are combined using the operation of term unification. Unfortunately the only generally applicable mapping that Mellish is able to offer has unpleasant properties, producing large terms whose internal structure has little in common with the structure of relationships between the descriptive feature labels used in the network. 4 Although the terms produced by the brute force mapping are spectacularly large, our main objection to 3 For most purposes this lattice is the same as the recursively defined space of terms used by PROLOG, but for a technical introduction see (Reynolds 1970). 4 The terms produced represent classes of objects by a technique little different from exhaustive enumeration. 383 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 this approach is the loss of transparency associated with the mapping. It doesn't seem likely that a linguist would feel comfortable with the output of the mapping, so a grammar development system would presumably have to include facilities for translating the machine representation back into more readable form. Although the simpler mappings that Mellish has developed for more restricted forms of network do offer more perspicuity, we feel that even in those cases our representations are at least as accessible to the human user as Mellish's, which do not in any case generalize to the full system network formalism.","Our view of the nature of system networks is close to those of Mellish and Kasper, since we try to separate questions about the underlying meaning of the networks from decisions about the processes by which they can be exploited. We treat system networks as alternative notations for sets of logical axioms constraining the co-occurrence of property symbols in descriptions. Nothing more elaborate than the propositional calculus is required. In principle one could apply standard theorem-proving techniques to these axioms, but in practice it is better to employ special purpose techniques that make more use of the structure inherent in the networks. The translation of system networks into logical axioms is very similar to the one described in Mellish (1988), but by adopting a slightly different labeling scheme we obtain a little extra clarity, which helps when we come to design algorithms that make use of the axioms produced. 2.3.1"]},{"title":"Classification and Consistency Checking.","paragraphs":["In order to carry out classification we need to answer the following questions 1.

Given two descriptions of the same object, how may the descriptions be combined to produce a more fully specified description? and in order to answer the questions we need to understand the behavior of the key operations of subsumption checking and unification as they apply to the description space within which we are operating. Both these operations can effectively be treated as special cases of consistency checking.","This is the operation of checking a conjunction of positive and negative boolean attributes for consistency with the axioms derived from a network.

The implicit disjunction between the different productions of Houghton's phrase structure grammar is handled by the usual techniques of chart parsing, which are described in, for example, section 3.6 of Winograd's textbook (Winograd 1983). Since these techniques are acceptably efficient, there is no pressing need to adopt Kasper's approach, within which the realization rules are conjunctive constraints, and the effect of including realizations is to change the representation of choice systems from disjunctions of atomic formulae into disjunctions of complex formulae.

In a well-formed system network no line may precede itself. Strictly speaking, this is a deviation from Systemic Grammar as presented in Hudson (1971), which explicitly permits cyclic systems. For our purposes cyclic networks are unsatisfactory, because useful cyclic paths in the network have to be traversed more than once. If network traversal is to terminate, the choices made on the last traversal of such a path have to differ from those made on earlier traversals. The sets of features that could be generated by a network would then depend not just upon the structure of the network but also on the way it was used by a particular generation system. Our techniques would have nothing to say about this situation, since we are examining the networks in their own right, and do not have access to the criteria by which the choices are made. We are therefore outlawing cyclic networks for the moment.","Assuming that the graph formed by the system network is acyclic implies that there must be at least one line that is not preceded by any other.

In this section we introduce the idea of a basic labeling, which is intended as a formalization of what we take to be the uncontroversial part of the process of labeling a system network.

The major difference is that some nodes attached to the left but not to the right of choice systems get given labels that correspond approximately to feature names. Since these labels add nothing to the meaning of the network they can safely be ignored.","The restriction to networks without duplicated labels simplifies the discussion in the rest of the paper, but it is not hard to transform networks with duplicated labels into ones in which all labels are distinct. The details of this transformation are not discussed here. 2.4.4 Exhaustive Labelings.. Every exhaustive labeling builds on a basic labeling, and is a labeling in which every line in the network is labeled with some value. In contrast to the conventional systemic labelings, in which labels are constrained to be atomic names, exhaustive labelings assign boolean conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic names as labels for some lines. The full definition of an exhaustive labeling follows.","Let Y\" be a 1-1 function from lines to names for these lines. ~- is an exhaustive labeling of a network if and only if the following conditions hold:","1.

This work is closely related to a similar translation scheme given in Mellish (1988), but because our scheme works with slightly different labelings the results are a bit easier to understand.","The translation scheme in Mellish's paper can be applied to all four types of systems in an exhaustively labeled network, and the correct results will be produced, but it turns out that many of the systems in an exhaustively labeled network map into uninteresting tautologies.","Mellish proposed that a choice system such as the one for GENDER in Figure I should be translated as AMO{femininG masculine, neuter} (1) GENDER - feminine V masculine V neuter (2) where AMO stands for a complex formula meaning 'at most one of.' (Mellish actually presents these axioms in a predicate calculus notation, but we have suppressed this detail, which makes no difference.) In the example of a choice system given above the full expansion of the complex formula would be -~(feminine A masculine)A ~(feminine A neuter) A -~(masculine A neuter) (3) In Figure 5 we have removed the GENDER label from the left-hand side of the choice system and replaced it with the appropriate complex label. When we employ Melish's scheme the translation becomes: AMO{feminine, masculine, neuter} (4) third A singular -- feminine V masculine V neuter (5) but the essential principle remains the same. Two intimately linked axioms arise from each choice system. Where necessary we shall refer to the axiom involving AMO as the exclusivity axiom and the other one as the accessibility axiom. It is easy to construct the exclusivity axiom given the corresponding accessibility axiom, but the converse is not true. We shall therefore be basing our implementation on the use of the accessibility axiom, with the exclusivity axiom understood to be implicitly present.","For and systems Mellish proposes a translation that is as if the label from the left of the and system had been written onto the lines to the direct right of the and system. In our scheme the label actually has been written there by the time the translation comes into operation, so there is no need to provide an independent translation for and systems. Instead the systems to the right of the and system will automatically receive translations reflecting the presence of the and system. This happens for the three and systems of Figure 5, with question, personal, and demonstr being propagated across the system in the appropriate way.","For disjunctive and conjunctive systems applying Mellish's translation would again yield a tautology. Where Mellish translates the disjunctive system of Figure 3 (which carries the feature name NUMBER on its right-hand branch) as personal V demonstr =_ NUMBER (6) 390 Chris Brew Systemic Classification and its Efficiency applying Mellish's translation to our labeling scheme yields the tautologous personal V demonstr =_ personal V demonstr (7) Intuitively it looks as if the real work that goes on in a system network happens in choice systems, and the other lines exist only in order to link together choice systems in the appropriate ways. From any point of view except that of a mathematical troublemaker this was probably obvious from the outset.","The axioms derived from the pronoun network in Figure 5 are the following. question =_ animate V inanimate"]},{"title":"(8)","paragraphs":["demonstr =_ near v far question V personal =_ subj v obj V refl V possess V possdet personal V demonstr =- singular V plural personal ~ first V second V third third A singular =_ feminine V masculine V neuter (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) The algorithm for translating system networks into a more standard form is now complete, so we move on to consider the ways in which this information can be used. 2.6 Computational Tractability In the next section we address the question of whether the labeling schemes developed so far can form the basis of efficient algorithms for carrying out the task of systemic classification.","We start by showing that system networks can be used to express NP-hard problems. This is something of a disappointment, since the original goal of this work was to show that the network formalism could function as a low-power version of more general feature formalisms. The idea was that linguists who chose to express their grammars within the network formalism would be sacrificing a measure of notational convenience in order to gain a guarantee of acceptable computational behavior. Since we must currently assume that NP-hard problems are intractable, we are unable to provide the desired guarantee. 2.6.1 Systemic Classification is NP-Hard. In this section we show that the problem of systemic classification is at least as hard as problems known to be NP-hard. This is done by constructing a polynomial time mapping 11 from instances of the NP-hard problem called 3SAT to networks that can be tricked into solving this problem for us. This is a standard technique from complexity theory. For an introduction to similar linguistic applications of complexity theory see Barton, Berwick, and Ristad (1988).","If there were a polynomial time algorithm for checking arbitrary system networks, it would follow that 3SAT could be solved by the composition of the mapping that constructs the network with the algorithm that checks the network. Since this composition is itself a polynomial time algorithm we would then have a polynomial time solution for 3SAT, and hence for all other problems of the complexity class W'. Thus the successful construction of 1I implies that systemic classification is itself NP-hard. (Whether NP-hard problems can be solved in polynomial time is still an open question at the time of writing, but, for the moment at least, they must be considered intractable). Kasper's demonstration that general disjunctive unification is NP-complete, taken together with the reducibility of systemic classification to that problem, indicates that 391 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4"]},{"title":"V Y -qy X","paragraphs":["b?_"]},{"title":"I bl a2 I al Figure 6","paragraphs":["A network for 3SAT. systemic classification is NP-complete as well as NP-hard. We think this upper bound on the complexity class to be of purely theoretical interest, since our parsers depend on efficient description-matching as a primitive, and an NP-hard problem is in our view already too expensive to be solved regularly in an efficient parsing system. We are aware that the complexity result only applies to the worst case, but in the absence of a satisfactory account of precisely what constraints a grammar writer has to observe to avoid the bad cases, we are uneasy about providing these grammar writers with a potentially explosive general mechanism. Our guess is that there is something about the human cognitive system that ensures that hard cases won't arise naturally, but it is dangerous to assume that they won't arise, not least because one possible way of using the technology provided here is as a target representation for automatic grammar development environments that present the user with higher level primitives. Whatever modularity constraints may be observed by a human writer, it is unclear that similar constraints will automatically hold over the output of an automatic grammar transformer. The 3SAT problem. 3SAT is the problem of determining the satisfiability of a boolean formula, stated in conjunctive normal form, in which exactly three variables occur in each clause of the conjunction. These variables may either be positive or negated, and may be repeated from clause to clause.

If the right-hand side of an axiom matches the expression then the left-hand side of the axiom is combined to form an extension of the expression. Because the compilation step has organized the axioms in order of depth this algorithm is able to make all legitimate deductions from the relaxed form of the network, and also to fail if the expression given is outlawed by this relaxed form.","In the second stage of checking we use the output of the first stage, attempting to discharge any generated features that have been introduced.

All boolean expressions can be reduced to the form of a disjunction of conjunctions of (possibly negated) atomic symbols. The expressions to be checked will consist either of simple conjunctions of unnegated atomic symbols, or, if we need to support subsumption checking, conjunctions of a single negated atomic symbol with a number of unnegated symbols. The algorithm will in fact handle any number of negated atomic symbols, but we do not make any use of this capability. An appropriate representation of such expressions is as a vector of slots capable of taking three values along each dimension. Each of the N slots corresponds to one and only one of the N atomic symbols in the set of axioms, and the order of the slots is the order of increasing depth given by the depth relationships in the network. We shall illustrate these vectors using strings of symbol specifications. Within such a string there are three possible types of symbol specification:","• the presence of a positive specification for a symbol is represented using a boldface capital letter (A1)","• the presence of a negated specification for a symbol is represented with a boldface capital letter with a line above (~)","• the absence of any specification for a symbol is represented using a lighter lower case font (al).

However, for the simplified sets of axioms in which we are primarily interested, this form reduces to a single conjunction of atomic symbols, which can readily be represented using the scheme for target expressions given above.","Examples of axioms and their representation follow. e ~ R 1 V a 2 is represented by (C2, Cl, b2, bl, a2, al, e) ~ (c2, Cl, b2, bl, A2, A1, e) while is represented by a2 V bl ~ Cl V c2 (C2, Cl, b2, bl, A2, al, e) V (c2, Cl, b2, B1, a2, al, e) = (C2, C1, b2, bl, a2, al, e) In order to convert these axioms into nondisjunctive equivalents we transform the disjunctive axiom by generating a new feature for its left-hand side, giving e A genfeatl =~ cl V C 2 which is represented by an eight-element vector (because we have introduced an extra feature name, and need an extra slot). The axiom becomes (c2, cl, b2, bl, a2, al, GENFEAT1, E) =- (C2, C1, b2, bl, a2, al, genfeatl, e) This illustrates the fact that the representations of expressions in the first and second stage of checking differ slightly because of the introduction of generated features.","The checking algorithm organizes the axioms into a list of decreasing depth.

Each process may attempt to write a different combination of features in its own personal copy of the relevant parts of the target expression, and it is crucial that the activities of the separate processes, whether or not they actually run in parallel, be prevented from interfering with one another, as would happen if they modified a common copy of the same data structure. This is obviously the expensive part of the checking procedure, since there can be a very considerable number of quasi-parallel or parallel processes if we happen to be dealing with an awkward case. 3.6 The Cost of the First Stage of Checking It is possible to code up the algorithm for the first stage of checking as an algorithm operating on a two-tape Turing machine, in which one input tape represents the axioms used and the other represents the expression to be checked. Analysis of this algorithm reveals that it is the substitution step that will prove most costly. It turns out that the possible space needed to represent the axiom tape is proportional to the square of the number of atomic labels in the set of axioms, and that the Turing machine needs no more than three passes over this tape to complete the necessary substitutions. In any event both time and space bounds for the first stage of checking are certainly polynomial in the number of labels in the network being checked. 6 3.7 The Second Stage of Checking The second stage of checking has the job of re-imposing the constraints that were ignored in the first stage. By inserting generated features, we have effectively marked the locations at which extra material may have to be introduced. While it would obviously work to simply throw away the results of the first stage of checking, and re-check the original expression (using the original axioms) from scratch, it is more satisfactory to turn the work we have already done to our advantage. This section describes one way of doing this. The parsing system adopts a different, but in essence equivalent, approach, building PROLOG terms as the output of the first stage, then compiling the alias rules into clauses of a procedure that attempts to find a consistent substitution for generated features.","In Winograd's pronoun network (shown in Figure 1) the first stage of checking for the description"]},{"title":"subjective A singular","paragraphs":["(22) would yield"]},{"title":"subjective A singular A genfeatl A genfeat2 A pn","paragraphs":["(23) 6 Although we introduce a potentially large number of extra labels in the transformation from disjunctive to nondisjunctive networks, these can be omitted without affecting the correctness of the first stage of checking. The labels are introduced as a convenience for use during the second stage of checking, rather than as an essential part of the first stage. In any case, as pointed out by an anonymous referee, the number of these labels is bounded by the number of choice systems in the network as a whole. 401 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 which contains two generated features, 7 one corresponding to the expression genfeatl - question V personal (24) and the other to genfeat2 =_ personal V demonstr. (25) In this case it should be obvious that all we have to do is choose compatible values from the disjunctive parts of expressions 24 and 25, and that this is achieved by choosing personal in both cases. This has no further consequences. In this simple case we find that the fullest description we can be sure of on the basis of what we know is: subjective A singular A personal A pn. (26) Unfortunately, looking for noncontradictory choices of substitution for generated features will not always gain us the information which we need to know. We illustrate this with reference to Figure 10, which provides a network for the pronoun system of an imaginary language closely related to English.","The path leading from pn to the choice between first, second, and third involves passing through an extra choice system encoding the alternation between honorific and familiar, so we would have inserted familiar rather than personal.

In the imaginary language in question the choice of an honorific makes it unnecessary to consider further features of the pronoun.

The job of the second stage of checking is to deal with this uncertainty, and the potential complexity arises from the possibility that many interacting axioms contribute to the uncertainty. Often there will be several small and independent islands of uncertainty, each involving only a few axioms, and it will be possible to decompose the checking task into more manageable portions.","We now show how to characterize the subsets of axioms involved in each island of uncertainty.

Ideally the sets of axioms will be disjoint, which means that the islands of uncertainty induced by the disjunctive left-hand sides can be handled independently. In fact the examples we are using represent the opposite case, in which different generated features are associated with nondisjoint (actually identical) sets of axioms. Our method for carrying out the substitutions collects nondisjoint sets of axioms into larger sets.

The number of possible substitutions depends both on the number of generated features in the network and on the way they interact. The more sharing there is between the sets of axioms corresponding to the generated features the greater will be the number of distinct ways of substituting for the generated features.","In the first example we have to consider the following possibilities: genfeatl = question genfeat2 = personal (31) genfeatl = question genfeat2 = demonstr (32) genfeatl = personal genfeat2 = personal (33) genfeatl = personal genfeat2 = demonstr (34) of which only the expression 33 satisfies the exclusivi W axiom for axiom 29. Since there are no other relevant axioms either for genfeatl or for genfeat2 the check is complete. 8 There may be more efficient algorithms than this, but we have not yet found the need to explore them. 404 Chris Brew Systemic Classification and its Efficiency","In the second example, axiom 29 does not do quite as much for us, because the possible combinations of substitutions are: genfeat l = question genfeatl = question genfeatl = familiar genfeatl = familiar genfeat2 = familiar (35) genfeat2 = demonstr (36) genfeat2 = familiar (37) genfeat2 = demonstr (38) only one of which (expression 36) can be eliminated by checking against the exclusivity axioms.

In fact the presence of familiar combines with axiom 30 to demand the addition of personal. Demonstr and question are incompatible with personal so only the expression produced from expression 40 can satisfy axiom 29. The full expansion of this expression is subjective A singular A familiar A personal A pn (42) which is the required answer.","It may seem unnecessarily elaborate to separate out the effects of disjunctive axioms, but a major reason for doing so is that the partitioning of the set of axioms that is involved can be carried out as a compilation step, which both prepares the axioms for the simpler first stage of checking and gives us an informal measure of the extent to which we are going to be able to decompose the potentially expensive second stage of the problem into small and independent problems.","In the set of axioms coming from the network in Figure 6, we find that every introduced feature interacts with every other one, producing a compile time clue that if we are unlucky we shall have to check an unreasonably large number of possible ways of carrying out the substitution. If a situation like this arose in a natural language application we should probably begin to look for a way of redesigning the network, and consider whether the costly accuracy produced by the second stage of checking actually helps our application much or at least start to suspect that the application should not be expected to produce reliable real-time response.","For Houghton's networks it turns out that the second stage of checking is rarely needed at all, so we have implemented only a simple version of the second stage of checking. In this implementation we make the pessimistic assumption that all generated features may interact. The more sophisticated approach outlined above will certainly produce significant improvements for some networks, but we do not currently have access to a large corpus of independently constructed networks, so cannot tell for sure whether the effort of implementing the slightly trickier algorithm would in fact be justified by linguistic practice. 4. Conclusions This paper has explored the potential of system networks as a classification tool for linguists. The results of this enterprise can be divided into a group of technical resuits about networks as such and a collection of less formal ideas about the practical implications of these results for the working computational linguist. 405 Computational Linguistics Volume 17, Number 4 The technical results come first. . .

Mellish (1988) reports an application in which this route was taken with satisfactory results. It is :not yet clear whether the restriction to nondisjunctive networks will be acceptable as a basis for large natural language grammars.","Note that the networks are not the only possible source of disjunction in a large natural language system, since when realization rules are taken into account the choice systems of the system networks can stand for disjunctions of general feature structures. 9 This objection carries most force in the context of a purely constraint based system like Kasper's, since in our hybrid parser each line of analysis is committed to a particular choice of realization rule before feature matching is necessary. Effectively the control regime of the nondeterministic parser is dealing with some of the search that is necessary in order to resolve the disjunctions implicit in the grammar. The chart-parsing part of this involves only a number of feature-matching operations polynomial in the size of the grammar and the length of the input string, 1° so the complexity of the overall parsing process hinges on the efficiency of the feature-matching algorithm involved. The actual performance of the parser may be much better than that indicated by the theoretical properties of the algorithm, but if so the efficiency depends upon contingent properties of the grammar used, so it would be unwise to provide a definitive guarantee that a parser will maintain acceptable performance as the grammar is developed and extended.","For practical purposes the following results are probably of more interest.","1. A given system network can be compiled into a set of axioms without reference to the particular expressions to be checked with these axioms. Although this process is potentially expensive, it can be carried out off-line.","2. The potentially expensive part of systemic classification can be separated from a cheaper first stage. The first stage is comparable in cost to taxonomic classification, and can be implemented efficiently using current technology. The second stage may turn out to be exponentially expensive in the worst case, but for some applications, such as the parsers we have implemented, the second stage proves unnecessary. The issue of how the algorithms would perform on yet larger grammars is as yet unexplored.","3.

In the worst case axioms are interdependent, and general algorithms for the unification of disjunctive constraints, such as the ones of Kasper (1987b) and Eisele and D6rre (1988) are likely to out-perform the techniques described here. We see our algorithms more as illustrations of the nature of the problem than as competitors of the more sophisticated algorithms presented by others. The representations used by our algorithms are close to those present in the networks themselves, so systems built on our algorithms should be easier to debug than those in which the networks are compiled into low-level formalisms. As a by-product of the production of these representations we can obtain an informal measure of the likely cost of using a particular set of networks. We have provided a preliminary analysis of the nature of the information contained in system networks, indicated why the flexible use of this information is likely to be costly, and sketched techniques that will somewhat alleviate the undesirable consequences of this situation. While we are unable to provide the linguist with the desired guarantee of computational tractability in the general case, we have provided tools and techniques that will aid linguists and implementors in the production of efficient grammars built in the systemic formalism.","References","Barton, G.
