First, a class-based trigram is adopted in basic word segmentation, which applies the Absolute Discount Smoothing algorithm to overcome data sparseness.

Introduction","paragraphs":["The word is a logical semantic and syntactic unit in natural language. Unlike English, there is no delimiter to mark word boundaries in Chinese language, so, in most Chinese NLP tasks, word segmentation is the foundational task which transforms the Chinese character string into a word sequence. It is a prerequisite to POS tagging, parser or further applications, such as Information Extraction, and the Question Answer system. Word segmentation has attracted long-term attention in the research community for more  1 This investigation is supported by the Key Program Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China (60435020), and the National Natural Foundation of China (60504021). ∗ School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Heilongjiang Province, 150001, P. R. China E-mail: jiangwei@insun.hit.edu.cn   394 Wei Jiang et al. than two decades. Various methods have been proposed, which fall into two main categories. The first category is made up of rule-based approaches that make use of linguistic knowledge. Cheng [1999] and Liang [1993] described Maximum Forward Match and Maximum Backward Match segmentation. Hockenmaier [1998] and Palmer [1997] used transformation-based error-driven learning. Wu [1998] combined segmentation with a parser and word segmentation became a by-product of the sentence parser. The second category is made up of statistical methods that make use of machine learning algorithms and training on corpus. The typical language model is n-gram [Gao 2002]. Zhang [2003] used the Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In addition, there are some other machine learning methods, such as EM [Peng and Schuurmans 2001], and the channel noise model [Gao 2003]. Sproat [1996] used the WFST method. At present, many state-of-the-art systems use hybrid approaches. Gao [2004] proposed a unified method via the class-based model, and Zhang [2003] presented a unified approach using the Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model. Xue [2003] used Maximum Entropy. Peng [2004] used the Conditional Random Fields model.","Though many methods have been proposed and many improvements have been achieved, as a challenge task, word segmentation is not well-performed. The disambiguation and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) identification are the main bottlenecks. Due to Zipf’s Law, the sparse data problem is rarely avoided, while this problem brings great difficulties in improving the performance of the disambiguation and OOV identification. A meaningful direction for exploration to overcome the sparse data problem is to collect more linguistic knowledge or features and incorporate them into the processing systems.","In this paper, the authors propose to solve the Chinese word segmentation task based on mixing models. The “No Free Lunch Theorem” and “Ugly Duckling Theorem” in Machine Learning theory have indicated that domain knowledge is essential for improving the processing performance. For this reason, different language models will be applied to solve each special sub-task, which is classified according to its linguistic phenomenon and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology used in the word segmentation. Another consideration is the pragmatic attribution, e.g. some successive processing may require different kinds of balance between precision and efficiency. So, this approach is a pragmatic one, which may incorporate several delicate processing modules, some of which can improve precision by introducing complicated models and utilizing more linguistic knowledge. However, this does result in a decrease in efficiency. Based on the assumption that more delicate linguistic knowledge or some fine linguistic statistical phenomenon can bring information gain to the segmentation task, the authors propose to apply Rough Set Theory and Average Mutual Information, etc. to extract complicated and long distance features. and the authors will also explore combining the word cluster and the thesaurus to extend the features so as to overcome the sparse data problem. This system participated in the Second   A Pragmatic Chinese Word Segmentation Approach Based on Mixing Models 395 International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (SIGHAN 2005), and a simplified version participated in the SIGHAN 2006.","Section 2 describes the structure of the system.
