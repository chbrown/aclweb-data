Introduction","paragraphs":["Extracting temporal information in documents is a useful technique for many NLP applications such as question answering, text summarization, machine translation, and so on. Temporal information includes three elements: 1. temporal expressions, which describe time or period in the real or virtual world; 2. event or situation expressions that occur instantaneously or that last for a period of time; 3. temporal relations, which describe the ordering relation between an event expression and a temporal expression or between two event expressions. There is a great deal of research dealing with temporal expressions and event expressions. Extracting temporal expressions is a subtask of NER [IREX committee 1999] and is widely studied in many languages [Mani et al. 2006b]. Normalizing temporal expressions has been investigated in evaluation workshops [Chinchor 1997]. Event semantics has been investigated in linguistics and in AI fields [Bach 1986]. However, research on temporal relation extraction is still limited. Temporal relation extraction includes the following issues: identifying events, anchoring an event to the timeline, ordering events, and reasoning of  ∗ Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan E-mail: {yuchan-c, masayu-a, matsu}@is.naist.jp   172 Yuchang Cheng et al. contextually underspecified temporal expressions. To extract temporal relations, several knowledge sources are necessary, such as tense and aspect of verbs, temporal adverbs, and world knowledge [Mani et al. 2006b].","The goal of our research is to efficiently construct a temporal relation tagged corpus of Chinese. In English, TimeBank [Pustejovsky et al. 2006], a temporal information tagged corpus, is available for introducing machine learning approaches to automatically extract temporal relations. In Chinese, there is some related research on temporal expression extraction [Li et al. 2005]. However, there is no publicly available resource for temporal information processing in Chinese. Currently, such resources, event and temporal relation tagged corpora, are being made. Annotating all temporal relations of event pairs is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a dependency structure based method to annotate temporal relations manually on a limited set of event pairs and extend the relations using inference rules. This method reduces manual effort. The dependency structure helps to detect subordinate and coordinate structures in sentences. We also describe a guideline for corpus annotation. Our annotation guideline is based on TimeML [Saurí et al. 2005], which was originally designed for English texts. We have developed a machine learning based dependency analyzer for Chinese [Cheng 2005]1","and a Chinese morphological analyzer [GOH 2006]. We can use our dependency analyzer to analyze raw text then use the output to annotate the temporal relations. However, in this paper, we use a syntactic tagged Chinese treebank (Penn Chinese Treebank) [Palmer et al. 2005] to create a temporal information annotated corpus. Finally, we survey the distribution of the temporal relations in our tagged corpus. We also evaluate the coverage of limited event pairs in our criteria."]},{"title":"2.

Therefore, our corpus does not focus on the relations between an event and a temporal expression, but between two events.

In this section, first, we introduce the resource -- TimeBank and describe the temporal relation links of original TimeML.

Link tags annotate temporal relations between entities. The tag “TLINK” represents the temporal relationship between two entities. The definition of temporal relations using the tag “TLINK” is based on Allen’s temporal relations [Allen 1983]. The tags “SLINK” and “ALINK” annotate the relations between a main event and its subordinate event. While the tag “ALINK” describes an aspectual relation, the tag “SLINK” describes a subordinate relation without explicit aspectual meaning.

Intuitively, ordering two events requires a temporal expression that can anchor events on the timeline. Previous research [Li et al. 2001] focused on simple anchoring problems, such as co-reference resolution between an event and a temporal expression. However, recent research ([Mani et al. 2006b], [Li et al. 2004]) has covered temporal relations depending on not only the temporal expressions but also world knowledge such as verb ontology in VerbOcean [Chklovski and Pantel 2004] and inference rules.","However, some events cannot be anchored on a timeline without ordering the events independently. For example, in Figure 1, there is one temporal expression “昨天早上六点” (6 A.M. yesterday) and four verb phrases (“起床” (wake up), “吃早餐” (eat breakfast), “搭公车”"]},{"title":"Figure 1.

In this example, there is only one temporal expression “昨天早上 六点” (6 A.M. yesterday) that can be analyzed, and it is the anchor time of the event “起床” (wake up). Figure 1 (1) describes the temporal relations of adjacent event pairs2",", and we can recognize some temporal relations by considering the event pairs rather than the temporal expression. These temporal relations are: the event “起床” (wake up) occurs before the event “吃早餐” (eat breakfast); the event “吃早餐” (eat breakfast) occurs before the event “搭公车” (by bus); and the events “搭公车” (by bus) and “上学” (go to school) occur at the same time. Figure 1 (2) describes the temporal relation between the anchor time “昨天早上六点” (6 A.M. yesterday) and the event “起床” (wake up). This temporal relation can anchor the event on the timeline. Combining the temporal relations in Figure 1 (1) and (2), the reader can recognize what happened and when they happened. Therefore, we can divide the process of recognizing the temporal information in the sentence into two steps: (1) recognizing the temporal relation between two events; (2) anchoring the events on the timeline. In extreme cases, we can think that a reader can recognize the situation by only considering the temporal relation between events, even if the reader does not know the anchor time of the events. Therefore, we think that annotating the temporal relations between event pairs is an independent task in temporal information processing. In this research, we focus on annotating the relations between two events."]},{"title":"Table 2.

There are 72,245 verbs (the words with POS-tags VV, VA, VE, VC) and 10,129 temporal phrases (the phrases with the tag “TMP”) in this Treebank. Only a portion of the verbs in an article have their own temporal expression (phrases), other verbs do not have direct temporal expression to anchor the verbs on the timeline.

We investigate the distribution of temporal tags as shown in Table 2. TimeBank includes 9,615 links (TLINK, SLINK, and ALINK), of which, 5,763 links are the relations between adjacent entity pairs4"," (an adjacent pair means the focal event and its linearly preceding event). According to the distribution, if we are able to recognize adjacent relations correctly (at least 60% (5,763/9,615)5","of temporal relations are recognized), we expect to acquire more temporal relations with an additional process, such as adaptation of inference rules that we will describe in Section 4.4. We refer to the links of adjacent relations as “adjacent links”. To recognize the adjacent links of events, we annotate adjacent event pairs.","Additionally, we find that about 40% (2,296/5,763) of the links in the adjacent links are SLINKs and ALINKs. The links with the tag “SLINK” mean subordinate relations between events (not from an event to a temporal expression). Subordinate relation is the relationship between a focus event and a main event that the focus event depends on. SLINKs do not include TLINKs. If we extract SLINKs first, extracting other TLINKs from the remaining temporal entities would become simple. This observation gives us the idea that recognition of SLINKs is an important task for annotating adjacent relations.  3 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ 4 The tag “TLINK” includes the temporal relations between document creation time and other temporal entities in an article, and includes the temporal relations between two matrix verb events in different sentences. 5 An adjacent link could simultaneously be a head-modifier link. Therefore the numbers of the column “adjacent links” and the column “head-modifier links” in Table 2 are not complementary. The column “all links” is not the sum of “adjacent links” and “head-modifier links”. Further more, we only consider the dependency structure of “sentences”. If the relation links in Timebank cross different sentences, the dependency structures cannot recognize these links. The remnants of SLINKS that are not head-modifier relations are the links crossing different sentences.

To calculate the distribution of links in TimeBank using dependency structure, we parse the sentences in TimeBank into the dependency structure and estimate the number of head-modifier (governor-dependent) relations that are SLINK or ALINK. We use the POS-tagger “TnT” [Brants 2000] to tag the sentences and use the MST parser6","[McDonald et al. 2005] to parse sentences to dependency structures. The column of “Head-modifier links” in Table 2 shows the number of each type of link that is a head-modifier relation. Seventy-three (2,331/3197) percent of S/ALINKs (SLINK + ALINK) in TimeBank are of head-modifier relations. This shows that dependency structure can be used to extract most S/ALINKs in English articles. Note that an event pair in a head-modifier relation link can also be one in an adjacent relation link.","Previous researchers have shown that syntactic information is useful for temporal information extraction [Li et al. 2004]. We use dependency structure for annotating temporal relations. The reason is that dependency structures are simpler and more comprehensible than phrase structures. The dependency grammar is composed of asymmetric head-modifier relations between words. We focus on the relation of event pairs. Dependency structure can describe the semantic relations between events clearly. Subordinate relations can be identified by the dependency structure. Therefore, dependency structure analysis is very useful for annotating the temporal relation."]},{"title":"3. Strategy of Chinese Temporal Information Annotation","paragraphs":["We propose an annotation guideline for developing a Chinese temporal relation tagged corpus. The guideline is based on TimeML. TimeBank includes all possible temporal relations between two entities and is annotated manually. However, to annotate full temporal information of a newswire text requires considerable human effort and cost. To reduce human effort, we introduce several constraints on the original TimeML. First, we limit the definition of events to verbs. Second, we focus on three types of event pairs in a complete graph according to dependency structure and use inference rules to extend relations."]},{"title":"3.1 The Definition of the Events","paragraphs":["First, we limit the definition of events to verbs.

However, recognizing an instance whether nominalization represents an event or  6 We train the MST parser using Penn Treebank.   178 Yuchang Cheng et al. not is difficult in Chinese articles. For example, a nominalization “电话(telephone)” could mean a telephone machine in the example “我买了一具电话(I bought a telephone)”, or could mean a telephone call in the example “他在电话中说...(In the telephone call, he said...).” Similar to the example, the semantic role of most of the aforementioned non-finite entities (nominalizations and adjectives) is ambiguous in the morphological analysis and the meaning of an entity depends on the context. In other types of events (predicative clauses and prepositional phrases), recognizing these entities from a context needs chunking techniques. The phrases / clauses usually have the hierarchical structure of verbs. It will be complicated to recognize these event entities when we extract the events automatically. It is also difficult to recognize events from all of the aforementioned entities except for verbs. Therefore, to simplify the process of recognizing events, we only regard verbs as events in our research.","It should be noted that we do not limit the domain of verbs. In the related research [Li et al. 2001], the researchers manually created a dictionary which included the common verbs in Chinese financial news articles and recognized the event using the dictionary. However, our original data do not limit the domain of articles. We should consider all of the verbs in corpus to assure the multiplicity of our corpus."]},{"title":"3.2 Three Types of Event Pairs","paragraphs":["Second, we focus on three types of event pairs in the complete graph. The first type is adjacent event pairs. The second and third types are the head-modifier event pairs and the sibling event pairs in dependency tree representation of a sentence. The first type (adjacent event pairs as seen in Section 2.3) and the other two types (head-modifier or sibling event pairs as seen in Section 2.4) are not exclusive. According to our investigation in TimeBank, subordinate event pairs are head-modifier relations and coordinate event pairs are sibling relations. Therefore, using dependency structure can extract subordinate relations and coordinate relations in a sentence.","The three types of pairs are shown in Figure 2. The example phrase “停止拨付财政债券 安排的资金并起诉 (To stop providing funds that were prepared by financial bond, and to prosecute...) in Figure 2 has four events: “停止 (stop)”, “拨付 (provide)”, “安排 (prepare)” and “起诉 (prosecute)”.

However, many event pairs like this example do not have an explicit temporal relation. To analyze this kind of event pairs (“安排 (prepare)” and “起诉 (prosecute)”), we should consider not only the adjacent observation of events but also dependency structure of sentences to acquire the correct temporal information. Moreover, if an adjacent event pair does not have understandable relation, the adjacent chain (adjacent links) will be segmented. The dependency structure can be used to connect the fragments of adjacent links.","The row “Temporal relations of Head-modifier event pairs” in the table shows the temporal relations of the head-modifier event pairs.

We define the event pairs that share a head event as a sibling event pair and show them in the row “Temporal relations of sibling event pairs” of the table. It should be noted that some adjacent event pairs are also head-modifier event pairs or sibling event pairs. The event pairs {拨付-停止, 安排-拨付} are adjacent event pairs and are head-modifier event pairs.

We used the Penn Chinese Treebank [Palmer et al. 2005] as the original data. Since the Penn Chinese Treebank does not include the head-modifier relations, we transformed phrase structures into dependency structures using head rules [Cheng 2005]. The head rules decide the head word of each phrase in the phrase structure, and then the phrase structure becomes a dependency tree. We annotate the temporal attributes and the temporal relations of events on a part of the Penn Chinese Treebank. Our corpus contains 151 Chinese news articles with 7,239 events and 49,691 tokens.","The punctuation “‚” usually can be used in the semantic ending of a sentence in Chinese.

The definition of EVENT is based on the TimeML: an entity that describes a situation of happen, occur, state, or circumstance. However, we limit an event to one expressed by a verb in our guideline. According to the guidelines of Treebank, verbs serve as the predicate of a main clause or an embedded clause in corpus [Xia 2000]. We assume that a verb in a clause can be thought of as the representative entity of an event that the clause describes.","Verbs can be identified automatically, according to the POS tag of the word (the POS-tag: VV, VA, VC and VE). Most of the verbs in Treebank have the POS-tag “VV”, which includes major verbs, such as raising predicates (“可能”(may be)), control verbs (“要”(want)), physical action (“飞”(fly)), psychological action (“讨厌”(hate)), and so on [Xia 2000]. The POS-tag “VA” is used for predicative adjectives, such as “齐全”(well-appointed). We consider predicative adjectives to be the same as an event because these predicative adjectives usually describe a statement. The predicative adjectives can modify a noun in another context, but in these cases the POS-tag of the predicative adjectives is an adjective “JJ”. The difference can be analyzed in the step of morphological analysis or be distinguished in the original Treebank. Therefore, we also recognize predicative adjectives as a type of event according to the POS-tag. The POS-tag “VC” is the copula verb such as “是” (is). It describes a statement of a truth, such as the verb “是” (is) in the sentence: “我是学生” (I am a student), and we define these verbs as EVENT. The POS-tag “VE” describes the possessive or existential statement, such as the verb “有” (have) in the sentence “我有一本书” (I have a book). All these types of verbs are EVENTs and have the annotatable attribute in our criteria.","A SIGNAL is a textual element that makes explicit the relation between two temporal entities. In TimeML, it includes temporal prepositions, temporal conjunctions and prepositions signaling modality. Briefly, the original signals are composed by prepositions or conjunctions. A signal word could mean temporal or non-temporal relations depending on the contextual information. In the sentence “我昨天早上六点起床, 吃过早餐后搭公车上学”(I woke up at 6 A.M. yesterday, ate breakfast and then went to school by bus.) in Figure 1, the word “后” (after, then) is a signal word and describes the fact that the event “吃早餐”(eat breakfast) occurs before the event “搭公车” (by bus). However, the same word “后” (after, then) in the sentence “屋后有个花园” (There is a garden behind the house) means a location relation. Candidate words of SIGNAL in Chinese are limited. We collect these signal candidates according to the POS-tag standard of CKIP’s corpus [CKIP 1993], which lists the SIGNAL   Constructing a Temporal Relation Tagged Corpus of Chinese Based on 183 Dependency Structure Analysis candidates in the POS-tag “Ng” (Localizer). For example, the words “前, 后, 以上, 之前” are signal candidates. However, these signal candidates in Penn Chinese Treebank are not listed and are spread out in the prepositions (“P”), conjunctions (“CC”) and localizers (“LC”). To recognize the SIGNAL automatically, we use the SIGNAL candidate list that is collected from CKIP Treebank to annotate the words that correspond to the list as the “possible signal”. A signal candidate word has an attribute with two classes: “time” and “non-time” to describe if it is a temporal signal word or not. We require the annotator to classify the signal candidate words manually.

However, our corpus criteria have several features that are different from TimeML. First, the goal of our research is to construct a machine learning based annotation system. All attributes can be annotated automatically after we complete a large corpus and train a machine learner. In TimeML, the annotators need to extract the temporal entities and relations using their knowledge, which requires a large amount of time. However, in our criteria, our annotators focus on the attributes of events and inference rules are used to extend temporal relations. We can create a large corpus according to our criteria, which would be more difficult using TimeML. Second, for recognizing the events of corpus automatically, we limit the events to the verbs, but TimeML includes more syntactic event constituents. To limit the event only to verbs can reduce the manual effort and preserve the major parts of all events.","When we use the temporal relation tagged corpus to train a machine learner, every attribute of our criteria can be trained. However, training the machine learner with a corpus tagged by the TimeML annotation scheme is more difficult than with our corpus. TimeML includes more difficult criteria. For example, the machine learner should identify the event phrase9","(clause) in corpus. In a shared task of SemEval-2007 (Task 15: TempEval Temporal Relation Identification) [Verhagen 2007], participants use TimeBank as the corpus to identify the temporal relations in articles. However, they are not required to identify event phrases. Identifying event phrases requires chunking technology and world knowledge.","Finally, our criteria are based on dependency structure. TimeML does not consider any syntactic nor morphological information in their annotation. Our criteria are based on dependency structure and can describe the temporal relations of subordinate and coordinate event pairs clearly. In our experience, these criteria can provide annotators with useful information that help them to recognize the relations between events. Moreover, because verbs in Chinese do not have morphological change according to tense, recognizing the tense of an event needs the information of the modifier of the verb, such as a temporal expression “昨 天”(yesterday) or a temporal function word “已經”(have). This information directs the temporal relations analysis for Chinese. This information can be provided by dependency  9 The events in TimeML could be a noun phrase or verb phrase.

Since we request the annotators to annotate as many temporal relations as possible, they used a considerable amount of world knowledge and contextual information in reading the articles. Therefore, the class “ambiguous” in tag “Rel-linear-preceding” is infrequent.

There are few sentences that have events that modify the same event. Therefore, most events are singletons of their head events. In the tag “Rel-tree-ancestor (head-modifier event pairs),” the root event of the dependency structure does not have a head event and the correct selection of the tag “Rel-tree-ancestor” should be “first” in this case.

We can compare the relations of all pairs of events and the relations extracted by our criteria to observe the coverage of our criteria. However, it is difficult to annotate the temporal relations of all event pairs. For example, if an article contains 50 events, there are 1,225 event pairs (50C2). We cannot compare the two methods in a large corpus because the annotation cost is huge. Therefore, we select 50 articles in Penn Chinese Treebank and only use the first two paragraphs of each article to make our survey data.

However, our method would extract two directions of temporal relation (the relation that from Event C to Event A is possible). If a relation between a combination event pair is extracted, we extend the inverse relation automatically (if event A occurs before event B, then event B occurs after event A).","11 Such as the “POS” tag and the “TENSE” tag are used for creating inference rules in [McDonald et al. 2005].

The relations that we extract by our criteria must be included in the gold standard. In Table 9, the row “Total extracted event relations” is included in the true event relation. However, in our preliminary investigation (this result is NOT included in Table 9); the annotator does not consider any syntactic structure or full context in annotating the event pairs and then the extracted event relations are not completely consistent to the true event relations. Because this testing data set was annotated by an annotator but not completed in one day, the annotator does not remember the viewpoint before when he annotates the same instance. The annotator annotated the event combination first and then annotated the three types of event pairs of our criteria. The intuitive reorganization of event relations could be inconsistent with the dependency structure. Therefore we re-annotated the testing data several times to confirm the consistency of the relation attributes. This observation indicates the difficulty of constructing a corpus consistently.","According to our results, the precision of using “RTA+RTP” with the inference rules is better than the precision of only using “RLP” with the inference rules. The hypothesis in Section 3 is confirmed in the result. The head-modifier event pairs can connect some fragment structure and can extract many important relations that the adjacent event pairs cannot extract. The recall row shows the coverage of our method. We use three types of event pairs and the inference rules and acquire 63% relations of the gold standard can be extracted. One reason is that we only consider the absolute inference rules. We can add more inference rules that consider other syntactic or semantic information of events to extend the relations."]},{"title":"6.
