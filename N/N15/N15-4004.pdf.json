The focus of this tutorial is to provide an extensive overview on recent deep learning approaches to problems in language or text processing, with particular emphasis on important real-world applications including language understanding, semantic representation modeling, question answering and semantic parsing, etc. In this tutorial, we will first survey the latest deep learning technology, presenting both theoretical and practical perspectives that are most relevant to our topic. We plan to cover common methods of deep neural networks and more advanced methods of recurrent, recursive, stacking and convolutional networks. In addition, we will introduce recently proposed continuous-space representations for both semantic word embedding and knowledge base embedding, which are modeled by either matrix/tensor decomposition or neural networks. ","Next, we will review general problems and tasks in text/language processing, and underline the distinct properties that differentiate language processing from other tasks such as speech and image object recognition. More importantly, we highlight the general issues of natural language processing, and elaborate on how new deep learning technologies are proposed and fundamentally address these issues. We then place particular emphasis on several important applications, including (1) machine translation, (2) semantic information retrieval and (3) semantic parsing and question answering. For each task, we will discuss what particular architectures of deep learning models are suitable given the nature of the task, and how learning can be performed efficiently and effectively using end-to-end optimization strategies.
