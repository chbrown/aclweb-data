Recently, there has been increased interest in the extraction of named entities and relationships from multiple documents, since the redundancy of information across documents has been shown to be a powerful resource for obtaining high quality information even when the extractors have access to little or no training data (Etzioni et al., 2004; Hasegawa et al., 2004). Much of the recent work in multi-document relationship extraction has focused on the extraction of isolated relationships (Agichtein, 2005; Pasca et al., 2006), but often the goal, as in","1","http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related projects/muc/ single document tasks like MUC, is to extract a template or a relational database composed of related facts.","With databases containing multiple relationships, the semantics of the database impose constraints on possible database configurations. This paper presents a statistical method which picks relationships which violate few constraints as measured by a probabilistic database model. The constraints are hard constraints, and robust estimates are achieved by accounting for the underlying extraction/fusion uncertainty.","This method is applied to the problem of constructing management succession timelines which have a rich set of semantic constraints. Using constraints on probabilistic databases yields F-Measure improvements of 5 to 18 points on a per-relationship basis over a state-of-the-art multi-document extraction/fusion baseline. The constraints proposed in this paper are used in a context of minimally supervised information extractors and present an alternative to costly manual annotation."]},{"title":"2 Semantic Constraints on Databases","paragraphs":["This paper considers management succession databases where each record has three fields: a CEO’s name and the start and end years for that person’s tenure as CEO (Table 1 Column 1).

Multi-document extraction of single relationships exploits redundancy and variety of expression to extract accurate information from across many documents. However, these are not the only benefits of extraction from a large document collection. As well as being rich in redundant information, large document collections also contain a wealth of secondary relationships which are related to the relationship of interest via constraints as described above. These secondary relationships can yield benefits to augment those achieved by redundancy."]},{"title":"3 Multi-Document Database Fusion","paragraphs":["There are typically two steps in the extraction of single relationships from multiple documents. In the first step, a relationship extractor goes through the corpus, finds all possible relationships r in all sentences s and gives them a score p(r|s). Next, the ity, typically binary relationships are combined (McDonald et al., 2005). relationships are fused across sentences to generate one score φr for each relationship.","This paper proposes a third step which combines the fusion scores across relationships. This section first presents a probabilistic database model generated from fusion scores and then shows how to use this model for multi-document fusion. 3.1 A Probabilistic Database Model A relationship r is defined to be a 3-tuple rt,a,b","= r(t, a, b), where t is the type of the relationship (e.g. start), and a and b are the arguments of the binary relationship.3","To construct a probabilistic database for a given corpus, the weights generated in relationship fusion are normalized to provide the conditional probability of a relationship given its type: p(r t,a,b 1 |t1) = φrt,a,b","1","∑","ri:rt i=t φrt,a,b","i , where φr is the fusion score generated by the extraction/fusion system.4","By applying a prior over types p(t), a distribution p(r1, t1) can be derived. Given strong independence assumptions, the probability of an ordered database configuration R = r1..n of types t1..n is: p(r1..n, t1..n) = n ∏ i=1 p(ri, ti). (1) 3 For readibility in future examples, “a” and “b” are replaced","by the types of their arguments. For example, for start the year","in which the CEO starts is referred to as ryear",". 4 The following fusion method does not depend on a par-","ticular extraction/fusion architecture or training methodology,","merely this conditional probability distribution. 333","As proposed, the model in Equation 1 is faulty since the relationships in a database are not independent. Given a set of database constraints, certain database configurations are illegal and should be assigned zero probability. To address this, the model in Equation 1 is augmented with constraints that explicitly set the probability of a database configuration to zero when they are violated.","A database constraint is a logical formula η(r1..π(η)), where π(η) is the arity of the constraint η. For the constraints presented in this paper, all constraints η are modeled with two terms ηα","and ηβ where: η(r1..π(η)) = ( ηα","(r","1..π(η)) ⇒ ηβ (r","1..π(η))) .","For a set of relationships, a constraint holds if η(·) is true, and the constraint applies if ηα","(·) is true. A constraint η(·) can only be violated (false) when the constraint applies, since: (false ⇒ X) = true.","In application to a database, each constraint η is quantified over the database to become a quantified constraint ηr1..n. For example, the constraints that a person’s start date must come before their end date is universally quantified over all pairs of relationships in a configuration R = r1..n:","ηr1..n = ∀r1,r2 ∈ R : η(r1, r2) =","(rt","1 = start, rt","2 = end, rceo","1 = rceo","2 ) ⇒ (r year 1 < r year 2 ). This constraint applies to start and end relationships whose CEO argument matches and is violated when the years are not in order. If the quantified constraint ηr1..n is true for a given database configuration r1..n then it holds.","To ensure that only legal database configurations are assigned positive probabilities, Equation 1 is augmented with a factor φη r1..n =","{ 1 if ηr1..nholds 0 otherwise . To include a constraint η, the database model in Equation 1 is extended to be: pη(r1..n, t1..n) = 1 Z","( ∏ i p(ri, ti) ) φη r1..n, where Z is the partition function and corresponds to the total probability of all database configurations. A set of constraints η1..Q","= η1","..ηQ","can be integrated similarly: pη1..Q(r1..n, t1..n) = 1 Z","( ∏ i p(ri, ti) ) ∏ q φηq r1..n (2) With these added constraints, the probabilistic database model assigns non-zero probability only to databases which don’t violate any constraints.","3.2 Constraints on Probabilistic Databases for Relationship Rescoring Though the constrained probabilistic database model in Equation 2 is theoretically appealing, it would be infeasible to calculate its partition function which requires enumeration of all legal 2n databases. This section proposes two methods for re-scoring relationships with regards to how likely they are to be present in a legal database configuration using the model proposed above. The first method is a confidence estimate based on how likely it is that η holds for a given relationship r1: Λη(r1, t1) = Ep(r2..n,t2..n) [ φη r1..π(η) ] =","∑ r2..π(η)","(∏π(η)","i=2 p(ri, ti))","φη","r1..π(η)","∑ r2..π(η)","(∏π(η) i=2 p(ri, ti)) = ∑ r2..π(η) pη(r1..n, t1..n) ∑ r2..π(η) p(r1..n, t1..n) , where the expectation that the constraint holds is equivalent to the likelihood ratio between the database probability models with and without constraints. In effect, this model measures the expectation that the constraint holds for a finite database “look-ahead” of size π(η) − 1.","With this method, for a constraint to reduce the confidence in a particular relationship by half, half of all configurations would have to violate the constraint.5","Since inconsistencies are relatively rare, for a given relationship Λη(r, t) ≈ 1 (i.e. almost all small databases are legal). 5 Assuming equal probability for all relationships. 334 To remedy this, another factor φα","is defined similarly to φη",", except that it takes a value of 1 only if the constraint applies to that database configuration. An applicability probability model is then defined as: pα(r1..n, t1..n) = 1 Z","( ∏ i p(ri, ti) ) φα r1..n. The second confidence estimate is based on how likely it is that the constraint is holds in cases where it applies (i.e. is not violated): Λη,α(r1, t1) = Epα(r2..n,t2..n) [ φη r1..π(η) ] =","∑ r2..π(η)","(∏π(η)","i=2 p(ri, ti)) φα r1..π(η)φη","r1..π(η)","∑ r2..π(η)","(∏π(η)","i=2 p(ri, ti))","φα","r1..π(η) . When the constraint doesn’t apply it cannot be violated, so this confidence estimate ignores those configurations that can’t be affected by the constraint.","Recall that Λη(r, t) is the likelihood ratio between the probability of configurations in which r holds for constraint η and all configurations. In contrast, Λη,α(r, t) is the likelihood ratio between the database configurations where r applies and holds for η and the database configurations where η applies. In the later ratio, for confidence in a particular relationship to be cut in half, only half of the configurations which might actually contain an inconsistency would be required to produce a violation.6 As a result, Λη,α(r, t) gives a much higher penalty to relationships which create inconsistencies than does Λη(r, t).","In order to apply multiple constraints, independent database look-aheads are generated for each constraint q:","Λη1..Q ,α1..Q(r1, t1) = ∏ q","Ληq ,αq (r1, t1).

The method estimates the probability than the inclusion of a given relationship will violate database constraints by taking into account the uncertainty of the other extracted relationships. Along with the relationships explicitly listed in the database, constraints are formed over implicit fields directly recoverable from the explicit listed relationships.","The construction of CEO succession timelines using minimally trained extractors from web text is a particularly challenging problem because of noise resulting from the wide variation in genre in the corpora and errors in extraction. The use of constraints on probabilistic databases is effective in resolving many of these errors, leading to improved precision and recall of retrieved facts, with F-measure gains of 5 to 18 points.","The method presented in this paper combines symbolic and statistical approaches to natural language processing. Logical constraints are made more robust by taking into account the uncertainty of the extracted information. An interesting area of future work is the application of data mining to search for appropriate constraints to integrate into this model."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported in part by DoD contract #HM1582-06-1-2013.
