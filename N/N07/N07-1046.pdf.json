However, current state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) systems cannot yet translate named-entities which are not seen during training. New named-entities, such as person, organization, and location names are continually emerging on the World-Wide-Web. To realize effective cross-lingual natural language applications, handling out-of-vocabulary named-entities is becoming more crucial.","Named entities (NEs) can be translated via transliteration: mapping symbols from one writing system to an-other. Letters of the source language are typically transformed into the target language with similar pronunciation. Transliteration between languages which share similar alphabets and sound systems is usually not difficult, because the majority of letters remain the same. However, the task is significantly more difficult when the language pairs are considerably different, for example, English-Arabic, English-Chinese, and English-Japanese. In this paper, we focus on forward transliteration from Arabic to English.","The work in (Arbabi et al., 1994), to our knowledge, is the first work on machine transliteration of Arabic names into English, French, and Spanish. The idea is to vowelize Arabic names by adding appropriate vowels and utilizing a phonetic look-up table to provide the spelling in the target language. Their framework is strictly applicable within standard Arabic morphological rules. Knight and Graehl (1997) introduced finite state transducers that implement back-transliteration from Japanese to English, which was then extended to Arabic-English in (Stalls and Knight, 1998). Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) transliterated named entities in Arabic text to English by combining phonetic-based and spelling-based models, and reranking candidates with full-name web counts, named entities co-reference, and contextual web counts. Huang (2005) proposed a specific model for Chinese-English name transliteration with clusterings of names’ origins, and appropriate hypotheses are generated given the origins. All of these approaches, however, are not based on a SMT-framework. Technologies developed for SMT are borrowed in Virga and Khudanpur (2003) and AbdulJaleel and Larkey (2003). Standard SMT alignment models (Brown et al., 1993) are used to align letter-pairs within named entity pairs for transliteration. Their approach are generative models for letter-to-letter translations, and the letter-alignment is augmented with heuristics. Letter-level contextual information is shown to be very helpful for transliteration. Oh and Choi (2002) used conversion units for English-Korean Transliteration; Goto et al. (2003) used conversion units, mapping English letter-sequence into Japanese Katakana character string. Li et al. (2004) presented a framework allowing direct orthographical mapping of transliteration units between English and Chinese, and an extended model is presented in Ekbal et al. (2006).","We propose a block-level transliteration framework, as shown in Figure 1, to model letter-level context information for transliteration at two levels. First, we propose a bi-stream HMM incorporating letter-clusters to better model the vowel and non-vowel transliterations with position-information, i.e., initial and final, to improve the letter-level alignment accuracy. Second, based on the letter-alignment, we propose letter n-gram (letter-sequence) alignment models (block) to automatically learn the mappings from source letter n-grams to target letter n-grams. A few features specific for transliterations are explored, and a log-linear model is used to combine"]},{"title":"364","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Transliteration System Structure.

The proposed transliteration framework obtained significant improvements over a strong baseline transliteration approach similar to AbdulJaleel and Larkey (2003) and Virga and Khudanpur (2003).","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the transliteration as a general translation problem; in Section 4, we propose a log-linear alignment model with a local search algorithm to model the letter n-gram translation pairs; in Section 5, experiments are presented. Conclusions and discussions are given in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Transliteration as Translation","paragraphs":["Transliteration can be viewed as a special case of translation. In this approach, source and target NEs are split into letter sequences, and each sequence is treated as a pseudo sentence. The appealing reason of formulating transliteration in this way is to utilize advanced alignment models, which share ideas applied also within phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn, 2004).","To apply this approach to transliteration, however, some unique aspects should be considered. First, letters should be generated from left to right, without any reordering. Thus, the transliteration models can only execute forward sequential jumps. Second, for unvowelized languages such as Arabic, a single Arabic letter typically maps to less than four English letters. Thus, the fertility for each letter should be recognized to ensure reasonable length relevance. Third, the position of the letter within a NE is important. For example, in Arabic, letters such as “al” at the beginning of the NE can only be translated into “the” or “al”. Therefore position information should be considered within the alignment models.","Incorporating the above considerations, transliteration can be formulated as a noisy channel model. Let f J","1 = f1f2...fJ denote the source NE with J letters, eI","1 = e1e2...eI be an English transliteration candidate with I letters. According to Bayesian decision rule:","êI","1= arg max","{eI","1}","P (eI","1|f J 1 )= arg max","{eI","1}","P (f J 1 |eI 1)P (eI","1), (1)","where P (f J 1 |eI","1) is the letter translation model and P (eI","1)","is the English letter sequence model corresponding to","the monolingual language models in SMT. In this noisy-","channel scheme, P (f J","1 |eI","1) is the key component for","transliteration, in which the transliteration between eI","1 and f J","1 can be modeled at either letter-to-letter level, or letter n-gram transliteration level (block-level).","Our transliteration models are illustrated in Figure 1. We propose a Bi-Stream HMM of P (f J","1 |eI","1) to infer letter-to-letter alignments in two directions: Arabic-to-English (F-to-E) and English-to-Arabic (E-to-F), shown in the upper-part in Figure 1; refined alignment is then obtained. We propose a log-linear model to extract block-level transliterations with additional informative features, as illustrated in the lower-part of Figure 1."]},{"title":"3 Bi-Stream HMMs for Transliteration","paragraphs":["Standard IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) can be used to obtain letter-to-letter translations. However, these models are not directly suitable, because letter-alignment within NEs is strictly left-to-right. This sequential property is well suited to HMMs (Vogel et al., 1996), in which the jumps from the current aligned position can only be forward. 3.1 Bi-Stream HMMs","We propose a bi-stream HMM for letter-alignment within","NE pairs. For the source NE f J","1 and a target NE eI","1, a bi-stream HMM is defined as follows:","p(f J 1 |eI","1)=∑ aJ 1 J ∏","j=1p(fj|eaj )p(cfj |cea j )p(aj|aj−1), (2) where aj maps fj to the English letter eaj at the position aj in the English named entity. p(aj|aj−1) is the transition probability distribution assuming first-order Markov dependency; p(fj|eaj ) is a letter-to-letter translation lexicon; cfj is the letter cluster of fj and p(cfj |cea","j ) is a cluster level translation lexicon. As mentioned in the above, the vowel/non-vowel linguistic features can be utilized to cluster the letters. The letters from the same cluster tend to share the similar letter transliteration forms. p(cfj |cea","j ) enables to leverage such letter-correlation in the transliteration process.","The HMM in Eqn. 2 generates two streams of observations: the letters together with the letters’ classes following the distribution of p(fj|eaj ) and p(cfj |cea","j ) at each"]},{"title":"365","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Block of letters for transliteration. A block is defined by the left- and right- boundaries in the NE-pair. state, respectively. To be in accordance with the monotone nature of the NE’s alignment mentioned before, we enforce the following constraints in Eqn. 3, so that the transition can only jump forward or stay at the same state: aj−aj−1≥0 ∀j ∈ [1, J]. (3) Since the two streams are conditionally independent given the current state, the extended EM is straight-forward, with only small modifications of the standard forward-backward algorithm (Zhao et al., 2005), for parameter estimation. 3.2 Designing Letter-Classes Pronunciation is typically highly structured. For in-stance, in English the pronunciation structure of “cvc” (consonant-vowel-consonant) is common. By incorporating letter classes into the proposed two-stream HMM, the models’ expressiveness and robustness can be improved. In this work, we focus on transliteration of Arabic NEs into English. We define six non-overlapping letter classes: vowel, consonant, initial, final, noclass, and unknown. Initial and final classes represent semantic markers at the beginning or end of NEs such as “Al” and “wAl” (in romanization form). Noclass signifies letters which can be pronounced as both a vowel and a consonant depending on context, for example, the English letter “y”. The unknown class is reserved for punctuations and letters that we do not have enough linguistic clues for mapping them to phonemes."]},{"title":"4 Transliteration Blocks","paragraphs":["To further leverage the information from the letter-context beyond the letter-classes incorporated in our bi-stream HMM in Eqn. 2, we define letter n-grams, which consist of n consecutive letters, as the basic transliteration unit. A block is defined as a pair of such letter n-grams which are transliterations of each other. Dur-ing decoding of unseen NEs, transliteration is performed block-by-block, rather than letter-by-letter. The goal of transliteration model is to learn high-quality transliteration blocks from the training data in a unsupervised fashion.","Specifically, a block X can be represented by its left and right boundaries in the source and target NEs shown in Figure 2:","X = (f j+l j , ei+k","i ), (4) where f j+l","j is the source letter-ngram with (l + 1) letters in source language, and its projection of ei +k","i in the English NE with left boundary at the position of i, and right boundary at (i + k).","We formulate the block extraction as a local search problem following the work in Zhao and Waibel (2005): given a source letter n-gram f j+l","j , search for the projected boundaries of candidate target letter n-gram ei +k","i according to a weighted combination of the diverse features in a log-linear model detailed in §4.3. The log-linear model serves as a performance measure to guide the local search, which, in our setup, is randomized hill-climbing, to extract bilingual letter n-gram transliteration pairs. 4.1 Features for Block Transliteration Three features: fertility, distortion, and lexical translation are investigated for inferring transliteration blocks from the NE pairs. Each feature corresponds to one as-pect of the block within the context of a given NE pair. 4.1.1 Letter n-gram Fertility","The fertility P (φ|e) of a target letter e specifies the probability of generating φ source letters for transliteration. The fertilities can be easily read-off from the letter-alignment, i.e., the output from the Bi-stream HMM. Given letter fertility model P (φ|ei), a target letter n-gram eI 1, and a source n-gram f J","1 of length J, we compute a probability of letter n-gram length relevance: P (J|eI","1) via a dynamic programming. The probability of generating J letters by the English letter n-gram eI","1 is defined:","P (J|eI","1) = max {φI 1,J=∑","I","i=1 φi} I ∏ i=1 P (φi|ei). (5) The recursively updated cost φ[j, i] in dynamic programming is defined as follows: φ[j, i] = max    φ[j, i − 1] + log PNull(0|ei) φ[j − 1, i − 1] + log Pφ(1|ei) φ[j − 2, i − 1] + log Pφ(2|ei) φ[j − 3, i − 1] + log Pφ(3|ei) , (6) where PNull(0|ei) is the probability of generating a Null letter from ei; Pφ(k=1|ei) is the letter-fertility model of generating one source letter from ei; φ[j, i] is the cost"]},{"title":"366","paragraphs":["so far for generating j letters from i consecutive English letters (letter n-gram) ei","1 : e1, · · ·, ei.","After computing the cost of φ[J, I], the probability P (J|eI","1) is computed for generating the length of the source NE f J","1 from the English NE eI","1 shown in Eqn. 5. With this letter n-gram fertility model, for every block, we can compute a fertility score to estimate how relevant the lengths of the transliteration-pairs are. 4.1.2 Distortion of Centers","When aligning blocks of letters within transliteration pairs, we expect most of them are close to the diagonal due to the monotone alignment nature. Thus, a simple position metric is proposed for each block considering the relative positions within NE-pairs.","The center ⊙fj+l","j","of the source phrase f j+l j with a length of (l + 1) is simply a normalized relative position in the source entity defined as follows:","⊙fj+l j = 1 l + 1 j′ =j+l ∑ j′ =j j′ l + 1 . (7) For the center of English letter-phrase ei+k","i , we first define the expected corresponding relative center for every source letter fj′","using the lexicalized position score as follows:","⊙ei+k i","(fj′ ) =","1 k + 1","·∑(i+k) i′ =i i′","·P (f j′ |ei′",")","∑(i+k) i′ =i P (fj′","|ei′",") , (8) where P (fj′","|ei) is the letter translation lexicon estimated in IBM Models 1∼5. i is the position index, which is weighted by the letter-level translation probabilities; the term of","∑i+k i′ =i P (fj′","|ei′",") provides a normalization so","that the expected center is within the range of the target","length. The expected center for ei+k","i is simply the aver-","age of the ⊙ei+k i","(fj′ ):","⊙ei+k i = 1 l + 1 j+l ∑ j′ =j","⊙ei+k i","(fj′ ) (9)","Given the estimated centers of ⊙fj+l j","and ⊙ei+k i",", we","can compute how close they are via the probability of","P (⊙fj+l","j","|⊙ei+k i","). In our case, because of the monotone alignment nature of transliteration pairs, a simple gaussian model is employed to enforce that the point (⊙ei+k","i",", ⊙fj+l j ) is not far away from the diagonal. 4.1.3 Letter Lexical Transliteration","Similar to IBM Model-1 (Brown et al., 1993), we use a “bag-of-letter” generative model within a block to approximate the lexical transliteration equivalence:","P (f j+l","j |ei+k","i )=j+l","∏ j′ =j i+k ∑ i′ =i","P (fj′","|ei′ )P (ei′","|ei+k","i ), (10) where P (ei′","|ei+k","i ) ≃ 1/(k+1) is approximated by a bag-of-word unigram. Since named entities are usually relatively short, this approximation works reasonably well in practice. 4.2 Extended Feature Functions Because of the underlying nature of the noisy-channel model in our proposed transliteration approach in Section 2, the three base feature functions are extended to cover the directions both from target-to-source and source-to-target. Therefore, we have in total six feature functions for inferring transliteration blocks from a named entity pair.","Besides the above six feature functions, we also compute the average letter-alignment links per block. We count the number of letter-alignment links within the block, and normalize the number by the length of the source letter-ngram. Note that, we can refine the letter-alignment by growing the intersections of the two direction letter-alignments from Bi-stream HMM via additional aligned letter-pairs seen in the union of the two. In a way, this approach is similar to those of refining the word-level alignment for SMT in (Och and Ney, 2003). This step is shown in the upper-part in Figure 1.","Overall, our proposed feature functions cover relatively different aspects for transliteration blocks: the block level length relevance probability in Eqn. 5, lexical translation equivalence, and positions’ distortion from a gaussian distribution in Eqn. 8, in both directions; and the average number of letter-alignment links within the block. Also, these feature functions are positive and bounded within [0, 1]. Therefore, it is suitable to apply a log-linear model (in §4.3) to combine the weighted individual strengths from the proposed feature functions for better modeling the quality of the candidate transliteration blocks. This log-linear model will serve as a performance measure in a local-search in §4.4 for inferring transliteration blocks. 4.3 Log-Linear Transliteration Model We propose a log-linear model to combine the seven feature functions in §4.1 with proper weights as in Eqn. 11: P r(X|e, f )=","exp(∑M m=1 λmφm(X, e, f ))","∑","{X′ }exp(∑M","m=1 λmφm(X′",", e, f )) ,","(11) where φm(X, e, f ) are the real-valued bounded feature functions corresponding to the seven models introduced in §4.1. The log-linear model’s parameters are the weights {λm}associated with each feature function.","With hand-labeled data, {λm}can be learnt via generalized iterative scaling algorithm (GIS) (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) or improved iterative scaling (IIS) (Berger"]},{"title":"367","paragraphs":["et al., 1996). However, as these algorithms are computationally expensive, we apply an alternative approach using a simplex down-hill algorithm to optimize the weights toward better F-measure of block transliterations. Each feature function corresponds to one dimension in the simplex, and the local optimum only happens at a vertex of the simplex. Simplex-downhill has several advantages: it is an efficient approach for optimizing multi-variables given some performance measure. We compute the F-measure against a gold-standard block set extracted from hand-labeled letter-alignment.","To build gold-standard blocks from hand-labeled letter-alignment, we propose the block transliteration coherence in a two-stage fashion. First is the forward projection: for each candidate source letter-ngram f j+n","j , search for its left-most el and right-most er projected positions in the target NE according to the given letter-alignment. Second is the backward projection: for the target letter-gram er","l , search for its left-most fl′","and right-most fr′","projected positions in the source NE. Now if l′ ≥j and r′","≤j+n, i.e. f r","l is contained within the source","letter-ngram f j+n","j , then this block X = (f j+n","j , er","l ) is defined as coherent for the aligned pairs: (f j+n","j , er","l ) . We accept coherent X as gold-standard blocks. This block transliteration coherence is generally sound for extracting the gold-blocks mostly because of the the monotone left-to-right nature of the letter-alignment for transliteration. A related coherence assumption can be found in (Fox, 2002), where their assumption on phrase-pairs for statistical machine translation is shown to be somewhat restrictive for SMT. This is mainly because the word alignment is often non-monotone, especially for langauge-pairs from different families such as Arabic-English and Chinese-English. 4.4 Aligning Letter-Blocks: a Local Search Aligning the blocks within NE pairs can be formulated as a local search given the heuristic function defined in Eqn. 11. To be more specific: given a Arabic letter-ngram f j+l j , our algorithm searches for the best translation candidate ei+k","i in the target named entities. In our implementation, we use stochastic hill-climbing with Eqn. 11 as the performance measure. Down-hill moves are accepted to allow one or two left and right null letters to be attached to ei+k","i to expand the table of transliteration-blocks.","To make the local search more effective, we normalize the letter translation lexicon p(f |e) within the parallel entity pair as in:","P̂ (f |e) = P (f |e)","∑J j′ =1 P (fj′","|e) . (12) In this way, the distribution of P̂ (f |e) is sharper and more focused in the context of an entity pair.","Overall, given the parallel NE pairs, we can train the letter level translation models in both directions via the Bi-stream HMM in Eqn. 2. From the letter-alignment, we can build the letter translation lexicons and fertility tables. With these tables, the base feature functions are then computed for each candidate block, and the features are combined in the log-linear model in Eqn. 11. Given a named-entity pair in the training data, we rank all the transliteration blocks by the scores using the log-linear model. This step is shown in the lower-part in Figure 1. 4.5 Decoding Unseen NEs The decoding of NEs is an extension to the noisy-channel scheme in Eqn. 1. In our configurations for NE transliteration, the extracted transliteration blocks are used. Our letter ngram is a standard letter-ngram model trained using the SriLM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). To transliterate the unseen NEs, the decoder (Hewavitharana et al., 2005) is configured for monotone decoding. It loads the transliteration blocks and the letter-ngram LM, and it decodes the unseen Arabic named entities with block-based transliteration from left to right."]},{"title":"5 Experiments 5.1 The Data","paragraphs":["We have 74,887 bilingual geographic names from LDC2005G01-NGA, 11,212 bilingual person names from LDC2005G021",", and about 6,000 bilingual names extracted from the BAMA2","dictionary. In total, there are 92,099 NE pairs. We split them into three parts: 91,459 pairs as the training dataset, 100 pairs as the development dataset, and 540 unique NE pairs as the held-out dataset.","An additional test set is collected from the TIDES 2003 Arabic-English machine translation evaluation test set. The 663 sentences contain 286 unique words, which were not covered by the available training data. From this set of untranslated words, we manually labeled the entities of persons, locations and organizations, giving a total of 97 unique un-translated NEs. The BAMA toolkit was used to romanize the Arabic words. Some names from this test set are shown in Figure 1.","These untranslated NEs make up only a very small fraction of all words in the test set. Therefore, having correct transliterations would give only small improvements in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST scores. However, successfully translating these unknown NEs is very crucial for cross-lingual distillation tasks or question-answering based on the MT-output. 1 The corpus is provided as FOUO (for official use only) in","the DARPA-GALE project 2 LDC2004L02: Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Ana-","lyzer version 2.0"]},{"title":"368","paragraphs":["Table 1: Test Set Examples.","To evaluate the transliteration performance, we use edit-distance between the hypothesis against a reference set. This is to count the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to correct the hypothesis to match the given reference. An edit-distance of zero is a perfect match. However, NEs typically have more than one correct variant. For example, the Arabic name “mHmd” (in romanized form) can be transliterated as Muhammad or Mohammed; both are considered as correct transliterations. Ideally, we want to have all variants as reference transliterations. To enable our transliteration evaluation to be more informative given only one reference, edit-distance of one between hypothesis and reference is considered to be an acceptable match. 5.2 Comparison of Transliteration Models We compare the performance of three systems within our proposed framework in Figure.1: the baseline Block system, a system in which we use a log-linear combination of alignment features as described in §4.3, we call the the L-Block system, and finally a system, which also uses the bi-stream HMM alignment model as described in §3. This last system will be denoted LCBE system.","The baseline is based on the refined letter-alignment from the two directions of IBM-Model-4, trained with a scheme of 15","h5","45","using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2004). The final alignment was obtained by growing the intersections between Arabic-to-English (AE) and English-to-Arabic (EA) alignments with additional aligned letter-pairs seen in the union. This is to compensate for the inherent asymmetry in alignment models. Blocks (letter-ngram pairs) were collected directly from the refined letter-alignment, using the same algorithm as described in §4.3 for extracting gold-standard letter blocks. There is no length restrictions to the letter-ngram extracted in our system. All the blocks were then scored using relative frequencies and lexical scores in both directions, similar to the scoring of phrase-pairs in SMT (Koehn, 2004).","In the L-Block system additional feature functions as defined in §4.1 were computed on top of the letter-level alignment obtained from the baseline system. A log-linear model combining these features was learned with the gold-blocks described in §4.3. Transliteration blocks were extracted using the local-search §4.4. The other Table 2: Transliteration accuracy for different transliteration models. System Accuracy Baseline 39.18% L-Block 41.24% LCBE 46.39% components remained the same as in the baseline system.","The LCBE system is an extension to both the baseline and the L-Block system. The key difference in LCBE is that our proposed bi-stream HMM in Eqn. 2 was applied in both directions with extended letter-classes. The resulting combined alignment was used together with all features of the L-Block system to guide the local-search for extracting the blocks. The same procedure of decoding was then carried out for the unseen NEs using the extracted blocks.","To build the letter language model for the decoding process, we first split the English entities into characters; additional position indicators “ begin” and “ end” were added to the begin and end position of the named-entity; “ middle” was added between the first name and last name. A letter-trigram language model with SRI LM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) was then built using the target side (English) of NE pairs tagged with the above position information.","Table 2 shows that the baseline system gives an accuracy of 39.18%, while the extended systems L-Block and LCBE give 41.24% and 46.39%, respectively. These results show that the additional features besides the letter-alignment are helpful. The L-Block system, which uses these features, outperforms the baseline system significantly by 2.1% absolute in accuracy. The results also show that the bi-stream HMM alignment, which uses not only the letters but also the letter-classes, leads to significant improvement. It outperforms the L-Block system, which does not leverage the letter-classes and monotone alignment, by 4.15% absolute. 5.3 Incorporation of Spell Checking Our spelling-checker is based on the suggested word-forms from web search engines for ambiguous candidates. We collected web statistics frequency for both the proposed transliteration candidates from our system, and also the suggested candidates from web-search engines. All the candidates were re-ranked by their frequencies.","Figure 3 shows the performances on the held-out set, using system LCBE augmented with a spell-checker (LCBE+Spell), with varying sizes of N-best hypotheses lists.
