Following on from last year's innovation, papers presented at the separate student session are also to be found, gathered in a separate section at the end of this Proceedings.","In keeping with the prestigious nature of the meeting, and despite a number of alternative conferences in our area, the programme committee was once again confronted With a large number of very high quality submissions from around the world. Balancing our desire to accept as many as possible of those which merited inclusion with the need to present a conference programme which ordinary mortals could reasonably be expected to benefit from proved, as always, a difficult challenge. We hope the results, as represented by the conference itself and the papers collected here, will stand as a fair and representative cross-section of the best work in the field today.","Many people contributed to the success of this year's meeting, and I'm happy to have the opportunity of recording our thanks to them: to Martin Kay, Karen Sparck Jones and Don Walker, for the invited talks; to Bonnie Webber, for organising the excellent set of tutorial sessions; to Keith Devlin, William Gale, Joseph Kruskal, Mark Liberman, Mitch Marcus, Yves Schabes and Stuart Shieber for presenting the tutorials; to Sandra Carberry, Dan Chester and Kathleen McCoy, for handling the local arrangements; to David Traum and Lenhard Schubert for organising the Student Sessions; and finally to Don Walker and Betty Walker for their stalwart labours behind the scenes.","In a year when over seven hundred papers in the field were submitted for consideration by a number of meetings, reviewers' time and effort was at a premium, with many people being asked to read papers for several different meetings. My special thanks therefore to the programme committee members who read and diligently commented on large numbers of submissions, did so to a very tight timetable, and then participated in the traditional pressure cooker face-to-face programme committee meeting: Peter Brown,"]},{"title":"IBM T.

Kruskal, AT&T Bell Laboratories","As linguistic corpora get larger, computational linguists are turning increasingly to statistical techniques. This tutorial focusses on statistical techniques that have been useful in linguistic research, being careful to avoid those that have not been. For each method we review its strengths and weaknesses, and the conditions under which it it may or may not be used. The tutorial provides references to statistical texts, but does NOT include mathematical derivations. Graphical displays are used where possible to show the qualitative behavior of methods.","The review starts with some very basic tools, such as methods for estimating the frequency of a token (word or n-gram), especially in the important but subtle case when the token has not occurred in the training sample. We emphasize the sometimes underappreciated importance of uncertainty (variability, standard deviation) of estimates. The foundations of the Bayesian approach to statistics are reviewed, because the approach has been found useful in such Widely different contexts as author identification, information retrieval, and sense disambiguation. A general orientation to such broadly useful tools as clustering, factor analysis/principal components analysis, and multidimensional scaling is included. Leading Issues in Tree Adjunction Yves Schabes, University of Pennsylvania and Stuart Shieber, Harvard University","The use of an adjunction operation on elementary trees as the primitive operation of a grammar formalism was first proposed by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi in the mid 1970's. Since then, a series of formalisms based on tree adjunction, Under the name tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), have been defined and their properties explored. Certain attractive properties of tree-adjoining grammars have led to their being proposed as solutions to a wide variety of natural-language-processing problems.","In this tutorial, we will focus on leading issues in the use of tree adjunction and tree-adjoining grammars for computational linguistic applications. After reviewing the basic concepts of TAGs and some standard grammatical analyses making use of the mechanisms, the tutorial will focus on the following issues of currency in the TAG research community (and on the associated formalisms and methods): (1) lexicalization of TAGS (lexicalized TAGs); (2) mechanisms for specifying grammatical constraints (adjoining constraints and feature-based TAGs); (3) relation between syntactic and semantic structure (synchronous TAGs); (4) statistical modeling with TAGs (stochastic TAGs); (5) TAG parsing algorithms. We will describe how these issues bear on several computational applications of TAGs, including: grammatical analysis, semantic interpretation, tactical generation, machine translation, and statistical language modeling. Very Large Text Corpora: What You Can Do with Them, and How to Do It Mark Liberman and Mitch Marcus, University of Pennsylvania","This tutorial aims to give researchers who are interested in working with large text corpora the information and the resources they need to get started. We will discuss: (1) what corpora are available, and how to get them; (2) practical, legal and technical issues in getting new material; (3) availability of annotated corpora; (4) software for simple linguistic annotation of unrestricted text - lemmatizers, taggers, parsers - what is available, and how to create your own; (5) how to do efficient machine-aided annotation; (6) how to index and search large (annotated or plain) corpora efficiently; (7) examples of research based on large corpora.","Discussion of the design and implementation of a sample of useful and available software will be featured. We will provide a bibliography and a guide to available corpora and software. Situation Semantics Keith Devlin, Colby College","Situation semantics is a mathematically-based semantics, grounded in situation theory. Introduced by Barwise and Perry in the early 1980s, both situation theory and situation semantics have developed considerably since the appearance of their 1983 book Situations and Attitudes. The current \"standard text\" is my own book Logic and Information, published by Cambridge University Press in 1991. The tutorial will be based on that reference.","I will begin with a brief overview of situation theory, explaining how it provides a framework for a general theory of information. Although situation theory is a mathematical theory, it does not presuppose any substantial mathematical prerequisites, though some mathematical sophistication enables a greater appreciation of various parts of the situation-theoretic ontology. This will be followed by an introduction to situation semantics, covering the relational theory of word and sentence meaning. Specific topics to be covered in addition to the basic framework are definite descriptions and conditionals. Time permitting we will also look at how situation theory can be used to handle the way speaker and listener make use of social knowledge in natural language interaction, and possible applications of situation theory to the design of interactive information systems. ix"]},{"title":"TABLE OFCONTENTS","paragraphs":["Inferring Discourse Relations in Context Alex Lascarides, Nicholas Asher & Jon Oberlander ............................................................................................ 1","An Algorithm for VP Ellipsis Daniel Hardt .......................................................................................................... . ..................................... : ........ 9","A Simple But Useful Approach to Conjunct Identification Rajeev Agarwal & Lois Boggess ....................................................................................................................... 15","The Representation of Multimodal User Interface Dialogues Using Discourse Pegs Susann Luperfoy ................................................................................................................................................. 22","Monotonic Semantic Interpretation Hiyan Alshawi & Richard Crouch ..................................................................................................................... 32","Efficiency, Robustness and Accuracy in Picky Chart Parsing David M.

The success of the 1991 sessions in meeting these goals provided the incentive for again including student sessions in 1992.","The response to the call for papers was quite gratifying, eliciting 48 submissions (a 26% increase over last year).
