The integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection and aspectual realization processes that operate during the production of the target-language sentence: there are often a large number of lexical and aspectual possibilities to choose from in the production of a sentence from a lexical semantic representation. Aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-language terms limit the possibilities for generation of aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes. This paper will show that the selection/realization processes may be parameterized so that they operate uniformly across more than one language and it will describe how the parameter-based approach is currently being used as the basis for extraction of aspectual information from corpora. INTRODUCTION","This paper discusses how the two-level knowledge representation model for machine translation presented by Dorr (1991) integrates aspectual information with lexical-semantic information by means of parameterization. The parameter-based approach borrows certain ideas from previous work such as the lexical-semantic model of Jackendoff (1983, 1990) and models of aspectual representation including Bach (1986), Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), Mourelatos (1981), Passonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler (1967). However, unlike previous work, the current approach examines aspectual considerations within the context of machine translation. More recently, Bennett","*This paper describes research done in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland. A special thanks goes to Terry Gaasterland and Ki Lee for helping to close the gap between properties of aspectual information and properties of lexical-semantic structure. In addition, useful guidance and commentary during this research were provided by Bruce Dawson, Michael Herweg, Jorge Lobo, Paola Merlo, Norbert Hornstein, Patrick Saint-Dizier, Clare Voss, and Amy Weinberg.

(1990) have examined aspect and verb semantics within the context of machine translation in the spirit of Moens and Steedman (1988). This paper borrows from, and extends, these ideas by demonstrating how this theoretical framework might be adapted for crosslinguistic applicability. The framework has been tested within the context of an interlingual machine translation system and is currently being used as the basis for extraction of aspectual information from corpora.","The integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection and aspectual realization processes that operate during the production of the target-language sentence: there are often a large number of lexical and aspectual possibilities to choose from in the production of a sentence from a lexical semantic representation. Aspectual information from the source-language sentence constrains the choice of target-language terms. In turn, the target-language terms limit the possibilities for generation of aspect. Thus, there is a two-way communication channel between the two processes.","Figure 1 shows some of the types of parametric diver-9ences (Dorr, 1990a) that can arise cross-linguistically. 257 We will focus primarily on the third type, aspectual distinctions, and show how these may be discovered through the extraction of information in a monolingual corpus. We adopt the viewpoint that the algorithms for extraction of syntactic, lexical-semantic, and aspectual information must be well-grounded in linguistic theory. Once the information is extracted, it may then be used as the basis of parameterized machine translation. Note that we reject the commonly held assumption that the use of corpora necessarily suggests that statistical or example-based techniques be used as the basis for a machine translation system.","The following section discusses how the two levels of knowledge, aspectual and lexical-semantic, are used in an interlingual model of machine translation. We then describe how this information may be parameterized. Finally, we discuss how the automatic acquisition of new lexical entries from corpora is achieved within this framework. TWO-LEVEL Kit MODEL: ASPECTUAL AND LEXICAL-SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE","The hypothesis proposed by Tenny (1987, 1989) is that the mapping between cognitive structure and syntactic structure is governed by aspectual properties. The implication is that lexical-semantic knowledge exists at a level that does not include aspectual information (though these two types of knowledge may depend on each other in some way). This hypothesis is consistent with the view adopted here: we assume that lexical semantic knowledge consists of such notions as predicate-argument structure, well-formedness conditions on predicate-argument structures, and procedures for lexical selection of surface-sentence tokens; all other types of knowledge must be represented at some other level.","Figure 2 shows the overall design of the UNITRAN machine translation system (Dorr, 1990a, 1990b). The system includes a two-level model of knowledge representation (KR) (see figure 2(a)) in the spirit of Dorr (1991). The translation example shown here illustrates the fact that the English sentence John went to the store when Mary arrived can be translated in two ways in Spanish. This example will be revisited later.","The lexical-semantic representation that is used as the interlingua for this system is an extended version of lexi. cal conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see Jackendoff (1983, 1990)). This representation is the basis for the lexical-semantic level that is included in the KR component. The second level that is included in this component is the aspectual structure.","The KR component is parameterized by means of selection charts and coercion functions. The notion of selection charts is described in detail in Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) and will be discussed in the context of machine translation in the section on the Selection of Temporal Connectives. The notion of coercion functions was introduced for English verbs by Bennett et al. (1990). We extend this work by parameterizing the coercion functions and setting the parameters to cover Spanish; this will be discussed in the section on Selection and (~) (b)"]},{"title":"I Lexical- Semantic Structure I Aspectual Structure I Syntactic Structure Selection ~nd Coercion","paragraphs":["P&r&meters for English Selection and Coercion P~r~meters for Spanish John went to the store when Mary •rrived Juan fue 8 Is tiend•","..~ cu•ndo M•rf• lleg6","-4~ Ju•n fue • 18 fiend& 81 llegar Marf• Figure 2: Overall Design of UNITRAN Aspectual Realization of Verbs.","An example of the type of coercion that will be considered in this paper is the use of durative adverbials:"]},{"title":"{ foranhour. } (4) (i) John ransacked the house until Jack arrived. { foranhour. } (ii) John destroyed the house until Jack arrived. (iii), John obliterated the house{ for an hour.until Jack arrived. }","paragraphs":["Durative adverbials (e.g., for an hour and until...) are viewed as anti-cuiminators (following Bennett et al. (1990)) in that they change the main verb from an action that has a definite moment of completion to an action that has been stopped but not necessarily finished. For example, the verb ransack is allowed to be modified by a durative adverbial since it is inherently durative; thus, no coercion is necessary in order to use this verb in the durative sense. In contrast, the verb destroy is inherently non-durative, but it is coerced into a durative action by means of adverbial modification; this accounts for the acceptability of sentence (4)(ii). 1 The verb obliterate must necessarily be non-durative (i.e., it is inherently non-durative and non-coercible), thus accounting for the ill-formedness of sentence (4)(iii).","In addition to the KR component, there is also a syntactic representation (SR) component (see figure 2(b)) that is used for manipulating the syntactic structure of a sentence. We will omit the discussion of the SR component of UNITRAN (see, for example, Dorr (1987)) and will concern ourselves only with the KR component for the purposes of this paper.","The remainder of this section defines the dividing line between lexical knowledge (i.e., properties of predicates","1 Some native speakers consider sentence (4)(ii) to be odd, at best. This is additional evidence for the existence of inherent features and suggests that, in some cases (i.e., for some native speakers), the inherent features are considered to be absolute overrides, even in the presence of modifiers that might potentially change the aspectual features. 258 and their arguments) and non-lexical knowledge (i.e., aspect), and discusses how these two types of knowledge are combined in the Kit component. Lexlcal-Semantic Structure. Lexical-semantic structure exists at a level of knowledge representation that is distinct from that of aspect in that it encodes information about predicates and their arguments, plus the potential realization possibilities in a given language. In terms of the representation proposed by Jackendoff (1983, 1990), the lexical-semantic structures for the two events of figure 2 would be the following: (5) (i) [Event GOLoc","([Thing John],","[Position TOboc ([Thing John], [Location Storel)l)]","(ii) [Event GOLoc","([Thin s Mary],","[Position TOLoc ([Thing Mary], [Location el)])] 2 Although temporal connectives are not included in Jackendoff's theory, it is assumed that these two structures would be related by means of a lexical-semantic token corresponding to the temporal relation between the two events.","The lexical-semantic representation provided by Jackendoff distinguishes between events and states; however, this distinction alone is not sufficient for choosing among similar predicates that occur in different aspectual categories. In particular, events can be further subdivided into more specific types so that non-cnlminative events (i.e., events that do not have a definite moment of completion) such as ransack can be distinguished from culminative events (i.e., events that have a definite moment of completion) such as obliterate. This is a crucial distinction given that these two similar words cannot be used interchangeably in all contexts. Such distinctions are handled by augmenting the lexical-semantic framework so that it includes aspectual information, which we will describe in the next section. Aspectual Structure. Aspect is taken to have two components, one comprised of inherent features (i.e., those features that distinguish between states and events) and another comprised of non-inherent features (i. e., those features that define the perspective, e.g., simple, progressive, and perfective). This paper will focus primarily on inherent features, z","Previous representational frameworks have omitted aspectual distinctions among verbs, and have typically merged events under the single heading of dynamic (see, e.g., Yip (1985)). However, a number of aspectually oriented lexical-semantic representations have been proposed that more readily accommodate the types of aspectual distinctions discussed here. The current work borrows extends these ideas for the development of an interlingual representation. For example, Dowty (1979) and Vendler (1967) have proposed a four-way aspectual classification system for verbs: states, activities, achievements, and accomplishments, each of which has a different degree of telicity (i.e., culminated vs. nonculmi-2The empty location denoted by e corresponds to an un-realized argument of the predicate arrive. aSee Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) for a discussion about non-inherent aspectua] features. nated), and/or atomicity (i.e., point vs. extended). 4 A similar scheme has been suggested by Bach (1986) and Pustejovsky (1989) (following Mourelatos (1981) and Comrie (1976)) in which actions are classified into states, processes, and events.","The lexical-semantic structure adopted for UNITRAN is an augmented form of Jackendoff's representation in which events are distinguished from states (as before), but events are further subdivided into activities, achievements, and accomplishments. The subdivision is achieved by means of three features proposed by Bennett etal. (1990) following the framework of Moens and Steedman (1988): -t-dynamic (i.e., events vs. states, as in the Jackendoff framework), +telic (i.e., culminative events (transitions) vs. noneulminative events (activities)), and -I-atomic (i.e., point events vs. extended events). We impose this system of features on top of the current lexical-semantic framework. For example, the lexical entry for all three verbs, ransack, obliterate, and destroy, would contain the following lexical-semantic representation: (6) [Event CAUSE ([Thing X], [Event GOLoc","([Thing X],","[Position TOLoc ([X John], [Property DESTROYED])])])] The three verbs would then be distinguished by annotating this representation with the aspectual features [+d,- t,-a] for the verb ransack, [+d,+t,-a] for the verb destroy, and [+d,+t,+a] for the verb obliterate, thus providing the appropriate distinction for cases such as (4). 5","In the next section, we will see how the lexical-semantic representation and the aspeetual structure are combined parametrically to provide the framework for generating a target-language surface form.","CROSS-LINGUISTIC APPLICABILITY: PARAMETERIZATION OF THE","TWO-LEVEL MODEL","Although issues concerning lexical-semantics and aspect have been studied extensively, they have not been examined sufficiently in the context of machine translation. Machine translation provides an appropriate testbed for trying out theories of lexical semantics and aspect. The problem of lexical selection during generation of the target language is the most crucial issue in this regard. The current framework facilitates the selection of temporal connectives and the aspectual realization of verbs. We will discuss each of these, in turn,","4Dowty's version of this classification collapses achievements and accomplishments into a single event type called a transition, which covers both the point and extended versions of the event type. The rationale for this move is that all events have some duration, even in the case of so-called punctual events, depending on the granulaxity of time in-volved. (See Passonneau (1988) for an adaptation of this scheme as implemented in the PUNDIT system.) For the purposes of this discussion, we will maintain the distinction between achievements and accomplishments.","5This system identifies five distinct categories of predi-","State: i-d] (llke, know)","Activity (point): i-t-d, -t, -I-a] (tap, wink) cates: Activity (extended): i-I-d, -t, -a I (ransack, swim)","Achievement: [+d, +t, h-a] (obliterate, kill)","Accomplishment: i-I-d, -I-t, -a] (destroy, 8rrlve) 259 Matrix Adjunct Selected Features Perspective Type Perspective Word [4-d,-t,4-a pelf [+d,+t,4- a/ simp, perf When [4-d,-t,:l: a 1 perfeetive l+d,+t,-I-a I strop, perf Cuando [4-d,-t-t,4- ~ perf [+d,+t,+a] romp, perf AI Figure 3: Selection Charts for When, Cuando, and Al showing how selection charts and coercion functions are used as a means of parameterization for these processes.

In order to ensure that the framework presented here is cross-linguistically applicable, we must provide a mechanism for handling temporal connective selection in languages other than English. For the purposes of this discussion, we will examine distinctions between English and Spanish only.","Consider the following example: (7) (i) John went to the store when Mary arrived.","(it) John had gone to the store when Mary arrived. In Dorr (1991), we discussed the selection of the lexical connective when on the basis of the temporal relation between the main or matrix clause and the subordinate or adjunct clause. 6 For the purposes of this paper, we will ignore the temporal component of word selection and will focus instead on how the process of word selection may be parameterized using the aspectual features described in the last section.","To translate (7)0) and (it) into Spanish, we must choose between the lexical tokens cuando and al in order to generate the equivalent temporal connective for the word when. In the case of (7)(i), there are two possible translations, one that uses the connective cuando, and one that uses the connective ai: (S) (i) Juan fue a la tienda euando Maria lleg6.","(it) Juan fue a la tienda al llegar Maria. Either one of these sentences is an acceptable translation for (7)0). However, the same is not true of (7)(it): 7 (9) (i) Juan habfa ido a la tienda euando Maria lleg6.","(it) Juan habia ido a la tienda al Ilegar Maria. Sentence (9)(i) is an acceptable translation of (7)(it), but (9)(it) does not mean the same thing as (7)(it). This second sentence implies that John has already gone to the store and come back, which is not the preferred read-ing.","In order to establish an association between these connectives and the aspectual interpretation for the two events (i.e., the matrix and adjunct clause), we compile a table, called a selection chart, for each language that specifies the contexts in which each connective may be used. Figure 3 shows the charts for when, cuando, and al. s","The selection charts can be viewed as inverted dictionary entries in that they map features to words, not SThis work was based on theories of tense/time by Hornstein (1990) and Allen (1983, 1984). rI am indebted to Jorge Lobo (personal communication, 1991) for pointing this out to me. aThe perfective and simple aspects are denoted as per] and strop, respectively. words to features. 9 The charts serve as a means of parameterization for the program that generates sentences from the interlingual representation in that they are allowed to vary from language to language while the procedure for choosing temporal connectives applies cross-linguistically, l° The key point to note is that the chart for the Spanish connective al is similar to that for the English connective when except that the word al requires the matrix event to have the +telic feature (i.e., the matrix action must reach a culmination). This accounts for the distinction between cuando and al in sentences (9)(i) and (9)(it) above. 11,1~","These tables are used for the selection of temporal connectives during the generation process (for which the relevant index into the tables would be the aspectual features associated with the interlingual representation). The selection of a temporal connective, then, is simply a table look-up procedure based on the aspectual features associated with the events. Selection and Aspectual Realization of Verbs: Coercion Functions. Above, we considered the selection of temporal connectives without regard to the selection and aspectual realization of the lexical items that were being connected. Again, to ensure that the framework presented here is cross-linguistically applicable, we must provide a mechanism for handling lexical selection and aspectual realization in languages other than English.","Consider the English sentence I stabbed Mary. This may be realized in at least two ways in Spanish: 13 (10) (i) Juan le dio pufialadaa a Maria","(it) Juan le dio una pufialada a Maria","9 Note, however, that the features correspond to the events connected by the words, not to the words themselves.","1°Because we are not discussing the realization of temporal information (i.e., the time relations between the matrix and adjunct events), an abbreviated form of the actual chart is being used. Specifically, the chart shown in figure 3 assumes that the matrix event occurs before the adjunct event. See Dorr (1991) and Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) for more details about the relationship between temporal information and aspectual information and the actual procedures that are used for the selection of temporal connectives.","11 It has recently been pointed out by Michael Herweg (personal communication, 1991b) that the telic feature is not traditionally used to indicate a revoked consequence state (e.g., the consequence state that results after returning from the \"going to the store\" event), but it is generally intended to indicate an irrevocable, culminative, consequence state. Thus, it has been suggested that al acts more as a complementizer than as a \"pure\" adverbial connective such as cuando; this would explain the realization of the adjunct not as a tensed adverbial clause, but as an infinitival subordinate clause. This possibility is currently under investigation.","12Space limitations do not permit the enumeration of the other selection charts for temporal connectives, but see Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) for additional examples. Some of the connectives that have been compiled into tables are: after, as soon as, at the moment that, before, between, during, since, so long as, until, while, etc.","13Many other possibilities are available that are not listed here (e.g., Juan le acuchill6 a Maria). 260 Both of these sentences translate literally to \"John gave stab wound(s) to Mary.\" However, the first sentence is the repetitive version of the action"]},{"title":"(i.e.,","paragraphs":["there were multiple stab wounds), whereas the second sentence is the non-repetitive version of the action (i.e., there was only one stab wound).

Based on this observation, the following hypothesis has been made: Hypothesis 1: The only types of verbs that are allowed to precede progressive verbs are circumstantial verbs. Circumstantial verbs subsume stative verbs, but they also include verbs in other categories. In terms of the lexical-semantic primitives proposed by Jackendoff (1983, 1990), the circumstantial verbs found in a sub- set of the corpus are categorized as shown in figure 7. An intriguing result of this categorization is that the circumstantial verbs provide a systematic partitioning of Dowty's aspectual categories (i.e., states, activities, and achievements) into primitives of Jackendoff's system (i.e., BE, STAY, and GO). Thus, the analysis of the cor- pora has provided a crucial link between the primitives of Jackendoff's LCS representation and the features of the aspectual scheme described earlier. If this is the case, then the framework has proven to be well-suited to the task of automatic construction of conceptual structures from corpora. Assuming this partitioning is correct and complete, Hypothesis 1 can be refined as follows: Hypothesis 1'~ The only types of verbs that are allowed to precede progressive verbs are states, achievements, and activi- ties. If this hypothesis is valid, the program is in a better posi- tion to identify stative verbs because it corresponds to a test that requires positive evidence rather than negative evidence. The hypothesis can be described by adding the following line to figure 5: Verbs Aspectual Category(s) doing","paragraphs":["(ACC) facing (ACC ACT) asking (ACC ACT) made (ACC) drove ~ACC ACT) welcome","(STA ACC ACT ACH) emphasized (STA ACC ACT ACH) thanked (ACC ACT STA) staged (ACC) make (ACC) continue ~ACC ACT) writes ~ACC) building ~ACC) running (ACC ACT) paint { ACC) finds ( ACC ACT) arrives { ACC ACT) jailed {ACC ACT STA) nominating (ACH ACT ACC read ( ACC ACT) ) ensure (STA ACC ACT ACH) act ( ACT ACC) carry (ACC) exercise (ACC) impose (STA ACC ACT ACH) contain ~STA ACC ACT ACH) infuriate (ACC ACT)","Figure 9: Aspectual Classification Results whether X is stative. 2°","Another hypothesis that has been adopted pertains to the distribution of progressives with respect to the verb go: Hypothesis ~z The only types of progressive verbs that are allowed to follow the verb go are activities.","This hypothesis was adopted after it was discovered that constructions such as go running, go skiing, go swimming,"]},{"title":"etc. appeared in the corpus, but not construc- tions such as go eating, go writing, etc. The hypothesis can be described by adding the following line to figure 5:","paragraphs":["[ Test [ STA [ ACT [ ACC ] ACH [ 13. go X-ing is grammatical no yes no no","The combination of Dowty's tests and these hypothesized tests allows the four aspectual categories to be more specifically identified. Results and Future Work. Preliminary results have been obtained from running the program on 219 sentences of the LOB corpus (see figure 9). 21 Note that the program was not able to pare down the aspectual category to one in every case.

Because the program is para- metrically designed, it is expected to operate uniformly on corpora in other languages as well. Another future area of research is the automatic ac- quisition of parameter settings for the construction of selection charts and aspectual coercion mappings on a per-language basis. SUMMARY This paper has examined a two-level knowledge repre- sentation model for machine translation that integrates aspectual information based on theories by Bach (1986), Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), mourelatos (1981), Pas- sonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler (1967), and more recently by Bennett et al. (1990) and Moens and Steedman (1988), with lexical- semantic information based on Jackendoff (1983, 1990). We have examined the question of cross-linguistic ap- plicability showing that the integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine transla- tion when there are a large number of temporal connec- tives and verbal selection/realization possibilities that may be generated from a lexical semantic representa- tion. Furthermore, we have illustrated that the se- lection/realization processes may be parameterized, by means of selection charts and coercion functions, so that the processes may operate uniformly across more than one language. Finally, we have discussed the application of the theoretical foundations to the automatic acquisi- tion of aspectual representations from corpora in order to augment the lexical-semantic representations that have already been created for a large number of verbs.
