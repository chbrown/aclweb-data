Introduction","paragraphs":["Many language understanding systems and machine translation systems rely on a parser of English as the first step in processing an input sentence. The general impression may be that parsers with broad coverage of English are readily available. In an effort to gauge the state of the art in parsing, the authors conducted an experiment in Summer 1990 in which 35 sentences, all of length 13 words or less, were selected randomly from a several-million-word corpus of Associated Press news wire. The sentences were parsed by four of the major large-coverage parsers for general English. 1 Each of the authors, working separately, scored 140 parses for correctness of constituent boundaries, constituent labels, and part-of-speech labels. All that was required of parses was accuracy in delimiting and identifying obvious constituents such as noun phrases, prepositional phrases, and clauses, along with at least rough correctness in assigning part-of-speech labels, e.g. a noun could not be labelled as a verb. The tallies of each evaluator were compared, and were identical or very close in all cases. The best-performing parser was correct for 60% of the sentences and the the remaining parsers were below 40%. More recently, in early 1992, the creator of another well-known system performed self-scoring on a similar task and reported 30% of input sentences as having been correctly parsed. On the basis of the preceeding evidence it seems that the current state of the","t At least one of the parties involved insisted that no performance results be made public. Such reticence is widespread and understandable. However, it is nonetheless important that performance norms be established for the field. Some progress has been made in this direction [3, 4]. art is far from being able to produce a robust parser of general English.","In order to break through this bottleneck and begin making steady and quantifiable progress toward the goal of developing a highly accurate parser for general English, organization of the grammar-development process along scientific lines and the introduction of stochastic modelling techniques are necessary, in our view. We have initiated a research program on these principles, which we describe in what follows. An account of our overall method of attacking the problem is presented in Section 2. The grammar involved is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with the statistical modelling methods we employ. Finally, in Section 5, we present our experimental results to date. 2. Approach","Our approach to grammar development consists of the following 4 elements: • Selection of application domain. • Development of a manually-bracketed corpus (tree-"]},{"title":"bank)","paragraphs":["of the domain.","• Creation of a grammar with a large coverage of a blind test set of treebanked text.

Besides the possible practical advantages to being able to assign valid parses to the sentences in computer manuals, reasons for focusing on this domain include the very broad but not unrestricted range of sentence types and the availability of large corpora of computer manuals. We amassed a corpus of 40 million words, consisting of several hundred computer manuals. Our approach in attacking the goal of developing a grammar for computer manuals is one of successive approximation. As a first approxima-tion to the goal, we restrict ourselves to sentences of word length 7 - 17, drawn from a vocabulary consisting of the 3000 most frequent words (i.e. fully inflected forms, not lcmmas) in a 600,000-word subsection of our corpus. Approximately 80% of the words in the 40-million-word corpus are included in the 3000-word vocabulary. We have available to us about 2 million words of sentences completely covered by the 3000-word vocabulary. A lexicon for this 3000-word vocabulary was completed in about 2 months.","Treebank: A sizeable sample of this corpus is hand-parsed (\"treebanked\").

Hence the term \"skeleton parse\": clearly not all constituents will always figure in a treebank parse, but the essential ones always will. In practice, these are quite detailed parses in most cases.

The grammar developer is able to in-spect the training dataset at will, but can never see the test dataset. This latter restriction is, we feel, crucial for making progress in grammar development. The purpose of a grammar is to correctly analyze previously unseen sentences. It is only by setting it to this task that its true accuracy can be ascertained.

We currently have about 25,000 sentences for training.","The point of the treebank parses is to constitute a \"strong filter,\" that is to eliminate incorrect parses, on the set of parses proposed by a grammar for a given sentence. A candidate parse is considered to be \"accept-able\" or \"correct\" if it is consistent with the treebank parse. We define two notions of consistency: structure-consistent and label-consistent. The span of a consitituent is the string of words which it dominates, denoted by a pair of indices (i, j) where i is the index of the leftmost word and j is the index of the rightmost word. We say that a constituent A with span (i, j) in a candidate parse for a sentence is structure-consistent with the treebank parse for the same sentence in case there is no constituent in the treebank parse having span (i', j') satisfying i' < i < j' < j or i < i' < j < j'. In other words, there can be no \"crossings\" of the span of A with the span of any treebank non-terminal. A grammar parse is structure-consistent with the treebank parse if all of its constituents are structure-consistent with the treebank parse. continuously increasing the training set as more data is treebanked.","The notion of label-consistent requires in addition to structure-consistency that the grammar constituent name is equivalent 4 to the treebank non-terminal label.","The following example will serve to illustrate our consistency criteria.

For the label-consistent criterion, the first candidate parse is the only correct parse, because it has all of the bracket labels and parts-of-speech of the treebank parse. The second candidate parse is incorrect, since two of its part-of-speech labels and one of its bracket labels differ from those of the treebank parse. Grammar writing and statistical estimation: The task of developing the requisite system is factored into two parts: a linguistic task and a statistical task. The linguistic task is to achieve perfect or nearperfect coverage of the test set. By this we mean that among the n parses provided by the parser for each sentence of the test dataset, there must be at least one which is consistent with the treebank illter. s To eliminate trivial solutions to this task, the grammarian must hold constant over the course of development the geometric mean of the number of parses per word, or equivalently the total number of parses for the entire test corpus. The statistical task is to supply a stochastic model for probabilistically training the grammar such that the parse selected as the most likely one is a correct parse. 6","4See Section 4 for the definition of a many-to-many mapping be-tween grammar and trcebank non-terminals for determining equiv-Mence of non-termlnals.","SWe propose this sense of the term coverage as a replacement for the sense in current use, viz. simply supplying one or more parses, correct or not, for some portion of a given set of sentences.","6Clcarly the grammarian can contribute to this task by, among other things, not just holding the average number of parses con- \"I 87 The above decomposition into two tasks should lead to better broad-coverage grammars. In the first task, the grammarian can increase coverage since he can examine examples of specific uncovered sentences. In the second task, that of selecting a parse from the many parses proposed by a grammar, can best be done by maximum likelihood estimation constrained by a large treebank. The use of a large treebank allows the development of sophisticated statistical models that should outperform the traditional approach of using human intuition to develop parse preference strategies. We describe in this paper a model based on probabilistic context-free grammars estimated with a constrained version of the Inside-Outside algorithm (see Section 4)that can be used for picking a parse for a sentence. In [2], we desrcibe a more sophisticated stochastic grammar that achieves even higher parsing accuracy."]},{"title":"3. Grammar","paragraphs":["Our grammar is a feature-based context-free phrase structure grammar employing traditional syntactic categories. Each of its roughly 700 \"rules\" is actually a rule template, compressing a family of related productions via unification. 7 Boolean conditions on values of variables occurring within these rule templates serve to limit their ambit where necessary. To illustrate, the rule template below s f2 : V1 ~ f2 : V1 f2 : V1 f3 : V2 f3 : V3 f3 : V2 where (V2 ="]},{"title":"dig [h) & (V3 #","paragraphs":["~) imposes agreement of the children with reference to feature f2, and percolates this value to the parent. Accept-able values for feature f3 are restricted to three (d,g,h) for the second child (and the parent), and include all possible values for feature f3 ezeept k, for the first child. Note that the variable value is also allowed in all cases mentioned (V1,V2,V3). If the set of licit values for feature f3 is (d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,1}, and that for feature f2 is {r,s}, then, allowing for the possibility of variables remaining as such, the rule template above represents 3*4*9 = 108 different rules. If the condition were removed, the rule template would stand for 3\"10\"10 = 300 different rules. stunt, but in fact steadily reducing it. The importance of this contribution will ultimately depend on the power of the statistical models developed after a reasonable amount of effort.","Unification is to be understood in this paper in a very limited sense, which is precisely stated in Section 4. Our grammar is not a unification grammar in the sense which is most often used in the literature.","awhere fl,f2,f3 are features; a,b,c are feature values; and V1,V2,V3 are variables over feature values","While a non-terminal in the above grammar is a feature vector, we group multiple non-terminals into one class which we call a mnemonic, and which is represented by the least-specified non-terminal of the class. A sample mnemonic is N2PLACE (Noun Phrase of semantic category Place). This mnemonic comprises all non-terminals that unify with: I pos :n ] barnum : two details : place including, for instance, Noun Phrases of Place with no determiner, Noun Phrases of Place with various sorts of determiner, and coordinate Noun Phrases of Place. Mnemonics are the \"working nonterminals\" of the grammar; our parse trees are labelled in terms of them. A production specified in terms of mnemonics (a mnemonic production) is actually a family of productions, in just the same way that a mnemonic is a family of non-terminals. Mnemonics and mnemonic productions play key roles in the stochastic modelling of the grammar (see below). A recent version of the grammar has some 13,000 mnemonics, of which about 4000 participated in full parses on a run of this grammar on 3800 sentences of average word length 12. On this run, 440 of the 700 rule templates contributed to full parses, with the result that the 4000 mnemonics utilized combined to form approximately 60,000 different mnemonic productions. The grammar has 21 features whose range of values is 2 - 99, with a median of 8 and an average of 18. Three of these features are listed below, with the function of each: det_pos degree","noun_pronoun Determiner Subtype","Degree of Comparison","Nominal Subtype Table 3: Sample Grammatical Features","To handle the huge number of linguistic distinctions required for real-world text input, the grammarian uses many of the combinations of the feature set. A sample rule (in simplified form) illustrates this: pos : j barnum : one details : V1 degree : V3 pos : j barnum : zero details : V1 degree : V3 This rule says that a lexical adjective parses up to an adjective phrase. The logically primary use of the feature \"details\" is to more fully specify conjunctions and phrases 188 involving them. Typical values, for coordinating conjunctions, are \"or\" and \"but\"; for subordinating conjunctions and associated adverb phrases, they include e.g. \"that\" and \"so.\" But for content words and phrases (more precisely, for nominal, adjectival and adverbial words and phrases), the feature, being otherwise otiose, carries the semantic category of the head.","The mnemonic names incorporate \"semantic\" categories of phrasal heads, in addition to various sorts of syntactic information (e.g. syntactic data concerning the embedded clause, in the case of \"that-clauses\"). The \"semantics\" is a subclassification of content words that is designed specifically for the manuals domain. To provide examples of these categories, and also to show a case in which the semantics succeeded in correctly biasing the probabilities of the trained grammar, we contrast (simplified) parses by an identical grammar, trained on the same data (see below), with the one difference that semantics was eliminated from the mnemonics of the grammar that produced the first parse below.

What is interesting here is that the structural parse is different in the two cases. The first case, which does not match the treebank parse 9 parses the sentence in the same way as one would understand the sentence, \"Enter the chapter of the manual you want to begin with.\" In the second case, the semantics were able to bias the statistical model in favor of the correct parse, i.e. one which does match the treebank parse. As an experiment, the sentence was submitted to the second grammar with a variety of different verbs in place of the original verb \"connect\", to make sure that it is actually the semanitc class of the verb in question, and not some other factor, that accounts for the improvement. Whenever verbs were substituted that were licit syntatically but not semantically (e.g. adjust, comment, lead) the parse was as in the first case above. Of course other verbs of the class \"OR-GANIZE\" were associated with the correct parse, and verbs that did were not even permitted syntactically occasioned the incorrect parse.

For example, in the context: \"How to:\", the word \"How\" can be labelled once and for all as a General Wh-Adverb, rather than a Wh-Adverb of Degree (as in, \"How tall he is getting!\").

Possible uses not encountered were in general not included in our lexicon.","Our approach to grammar development, syntactical as well as lexical, is frequency-based. In the case of syntax, this means that, at any given time, we devote our attention to the most frequently-occurring construction which we fail to handle, and not the most \"theoretically interesting\" such construction. 4. Statistical Training and Evaluation","In this section we will give a brief description of the procedures that we have adopted for parsing and training a probabilistic model for our grammar. In parsing with the above grammar, it is necessary to have an efficient way of determining if, for example, a particular feature bundle A = (AI, A2,...,AN) can be the parent of a given production, some of whose features are expressed as variables.

We will later describe the modifications necessary to train with the constraint of a bracketed corpus.","To describe the training procedure we have used, we will assume familiarity with both the CKY algorithm [?] and the Inside-Outside algorithm [?], which we have adapted to the problem of training our grammar. The main computations of the Inside-Outside algorithm are indexed using the CKY procedure which is a bottom-up chart parsing algorithm. To summarize the main points"]},{"title":"190","paragraphs":["in our adaptation of these algorithms, let us assume that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. The general case involves only straight-forward modifications. Proceeding in a bottom-up fashion, then, we suppose that we have two nonterminals (bundles of features) B and C, and we find all nonterminals A for which A -~ B C is a production in the grammar. This is accomplished by using the unfication operation and checking that the relevent Boolean conditions are satisfied for the nonterminals A, B, and C.","Having found such a nonterminal, the usual Inside-Outside algorithm requires a recursive update of the Inside probabilities"]},{"title":"IA(i,j)","paragraphs":["and outside probabilities"]},{"title":"OA(i , j)","paragraphs":["that A spans (i, j). These updates involve the probability parameter PrA(A ---* B C). In the case of our feature-based grammar, however, the number of such parameters would be extremely large (the grammar can have on the order of few billion nonterminals). We thus organize productions into the equivalence classes induced by the mncmomic classes on the non-terminals. The update then uses mnemonic productions for the stochastic grammar using the parameter PrM(A)(J~4(B) --) A4(C) A4(C)). Of course, for lexical productions A --) w we use the corresponding probability Pr~(A)(jVI(A ) -~ w) in the event that we are rewriting not a pair of nonterminals, but a word w.","Thus, probabilities are expressed in terms of the set of mnemonics (that is, by the nodes in the mnemonic tree), rather that in terms of the actual nonterminals of the grammar. It is in this manner that we can obtain efficient and reliable estimates of our parameters. Since the grammar is very detailed, the mnemonic map JUt can be increasingly refined so that a greater number of linguistic phenomena are caputured in the probabilities. In principle, this could be carried out automatically to determine the optimum level of detail to be incorporated into the model, and different paramcterizations could be smoothed together. To date, however, we have only contructed mnemonic maps by hand, and have thus experimented with only a small number of paramcterizations.","Constrained training: The Inside-Outside algorithm is a special case of the general EM algorithm, and as such, succssive iteration is guaranteed to converge to a set of parameters which locally maximize the likelihood of generating the training corpus. We have found it useful to employ the trccbank to supervise the training of these parameters. Intuitively, the idea is to modify the algorithm to locally maximize the likelihood of generating the training corpus using parses which are \"similar\" to the treebank parses. This is accomplished by only collecting statistics over those parses which are consistent with the treebank parses, in a manner which we will now describe. The notion of label-consistent is defined by a (many-to-many) mapping from the mnemonics of the feature-based grammar to the nonterminal labels of the treebank grammar. For example, our grammar main-tains a fairly large number of semantic classes of singular nouns, and it is natural to stipulate that each of them is label-consistent with the nonterminal NI~I denoting a generic singular noun in the treebank. Of course, to exhaustively specify such a mapping would be rather time consuming. In practice, the mapping is implemented by organizing the nonterminals hierarchically into a tree, and searching for consistency in a recursive fashion.","The simple modification of the CKY algorithm which takes into account the treebank parse is, then, the following. Given a pair of nonterminals B and C in the CKY chart, if the span of the parent is not structure-consistent then this occurence of B C cannot be used in the parse and we continue to the next pair. If, on the other hand, it is structure-consistent then we find all candidate parents A for which A ~ B C is a production of the grammar, but include only those that are label-consistent with the treebank nonterminal (if any) in that position. The probabilities are updated in exactly the same manner as for the standard Inside-Outside algorithm. The procedure that we have described is called constrained training, and it significantly improves the effectiveness of the parser, providing a dramatic reduction in computational requirements for parameter estimation as well as a modest improvement in parsing accuracy.","Sample mappings from the terminals and nonterminals of our grammar to those of the Lancaster treebank are provided in Table 5. For ease of understanding, we use the version of our grammar in which the semantics are eliminated from the mnemonics (see above). Category names from our grammar are shown first, and the Lancaster categories to which they map are shown second: The first case above is straightforward: our prepositional-phrase category maps to Lancaster's. In the second case, we break down the category Relative Clause more finely than Lancaster does, by specifying the syntax of the embedded clause (e.g. FRV2: \"that opened the adapter\"). The third case relates to relative clauses lacking prefatory particles, such as: \"the row you are specifying\"; we would call \"you are specifying\" an SD (Declarative Sentence), while Lancaster calls it an Fr (Relative Clause). Our practice of distinguishing constituents which function as interrupters from the same constituents tout court accounts for the fourth case; the category in question is Infinitival Clause. Finally, we generate attributive adjectives (JB) directly from past participles (VVN) by rule, whereas Lancaster opts to label as adjectives (J J) those past participles so functioning."]},{"title":"5. Experimental Results","paragraphs":["We report results below for two test sets. One (Test Set A) is drawn from the 600,000-word subsection of our corpus of computer manuals text which we referred to above. The other (Test Set B) is drawn from our full 40-million-word computer manuals corpus. Due to a more or less constant error rate of 2.5% in the treebank parses themselves, there is a corresponding built-in margin of error in our scores. For each of the two test sets, results are presented first for the linguistic task: making sure that a correct parse is present in the set of parses the grammar proposes for each sentence of the test set. Second, results are presented for the statistical task, which is to ensure that the parse which is selected as most likely, for each sentence of the test set, is a correct parse.

In the roughly year-long period since we began work on the computer manuals task, this average has been held steady at roughly 1.35 parses per word. What this works out to is a range of from 8 parses for a 7-word sentence, through 34 parses for a 12-word sentence, to 144 parses for a 17-word sentence. In addition, during this development period, performance on the task of picking the most likely parse went from 58% to 73% on Test Set A. Periodic results on Test Set A for the task of providing at least one correct parse for each sentence are displayed in Table 8.","We present additional experimental results to show that our grammar is completely separable from its accompanying \"semantics\". Note that semantic categories are not \"written into\" the grammar; i.e., with a few minor exceptions, no rules refer to them. They simply percolate up from the lexical items to the non-terminal level, and contribute information to the mnemonic productions which constitute the parameters of the statistical training model.","An example was given in Section 3 of a case in which the version of our grammar that includes semantics out-performed the version of the same grammar without semantics. The effect of the semantic information in that particular case was apprently to bias the trained grammar towards choosing a correct parse as most likely. However, we did not quantify this effect when we presented the example. This is the purpose of the experimental results shown in Table 9. Test B was used to test our current grammar, first with and then without semantic categories in the mnemonics.","It follows from the fact that the semantics are not written into the grammar that the coverage figure is the same with and without semantics. Perhaps surprising, however, is the slight degree of improvement due to the semantics on the task of picking the most likely parse: only 2 percentage points. The more detailed parametriza-January 1991 91% April 1991 92% August 1991 94% December 1991 96% April 1992 96% Table 8: Periodic Results for Test Set A: Sentences With At Least 1 Correct Parse","Number of Sentences 1105 Average Sentence Length 12 Range of Sentence Lengths 7-17 Correct Parse Present (In Both Cases) 95%","Correct Parse Most Likely (With Semantics) 75% Correct Parse Most Likely (No Semantics) 73% Table 9: Test Subcorpus B With and Without Semantics tion with semantic categories, which has about 13,000 mnemonics achieved only a modest improvement in parsing accuracy over the parametrization without semantics, which has about 4,600 mnemonics. 6. Future Research","Our future research divides naturally into two efforts. Our linguistic research will be directed toward first parsing sentences of any length with the 3000-word vocabulary, and then expanding the 3000-word vocabulary to an unlimited vocabulary. Our statistical research will focus on efforts to improve our probabilistic models along the lines of the new approach presented in [2]. References","1.
