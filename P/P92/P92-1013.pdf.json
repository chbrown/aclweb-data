The effectiveness of the integration depends in part on a representation of events that captures people's uncertainty about their outcome - in particular, people's incomplete expectations about the changes effected by events.

He sold it for twenty dollars. b. *He sold them for fifty dollars. c. He had taken it from his brother's car. d. Neither of them was particularly useful. Here two entities are introduced via indefinite noun phrases (NPs) in the first sentence. The alternative follow-ons (a-d) show that subsequent reference to those entities is constrained. In particular, (b) highlights the difference in their existential status, even though there is no syntactic difference in how they are introduced. Now consider","*This work was partially supported by ARO grant DAAL 03-89-C-0031, DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863, and NSF grant IRI 90-16592 to the University of Pennsylvania. The paper draws upon material first presented at the workshop on Defensible Reasoning in Semantics and Pragmatics held at the European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information, Saarbr~cken, Germany, August 1991.","Example 2 Mix the flour, butter and water. a. Knead the dough until smooth and shiny. b. Spread the paste over the blueberries. c. Stir the batter until all lumps are gone. In each of the alternative follow-on (a-c), a different definite NP refers to the result of the mixing, even though the terms \"dough\", \"paste\" and \"batter\" are not interchangeable. (They denote substances with different consistencies, from a pliant solid - dough - to a liquid - batter.)","In both these examples, events 1 are mentioned that change the world being described. These examples will be used to show why the two mechanisms of context change discussed separately in the literature (context change by entity introduction and context change by event simulation) must be integrated (Section 2). For such integration to be effective, we argue that it must be based on a representation of events that captures people's uncertainty about their outcome - in particular, people's incomplete expectations about the changes effected by events. An understanding system can then use these expectations to accommodate [15] the particular changes that are mentioned in subsequent discourse (Section 3). In Section 4, we discuss our initial implementation of these ideas.","This work is being carried out as part of a project (AnlmNL) aimed at creating animated task simulations from Natural Language instructions [2; 4; 5; 6; 7; 14; 20]. Instructions are a form of text rich in the specification of events intended to alter the world in some way. Because of this, the issues discussed in this paper are particularly important to both understanding and generating instructions."]},{"title":"96","paragraphs":["1Event is used informally to mean any kind of action or process."]},{"title":"Mechanisms of Context Change","paragraphs":["Computational Linguistics research has recognized two independent mechanisms of context change.

The preconditions and postconditions of each action indicate the objects required in the working set for its performance and the changes it makes to objects in the working set as a result. For example, ADD (in the sense of \"add X to Y\") has as preconditions that X and Y be in the current working set and as post-conditions, that X and Y are absent from the resulting working set and a new object Z is present whose constituents are X and Y.","The form of recipe that EPICURE generates is the common one in which a list of ingredients is followed by instructions as to what to do with them.

Example 4","Mix the flour, butter and water.","a. Knead the dough until smooth and shiny.","b. Spread the paste over the blueberries.","c. Stir the batter until all lumps are gone. Example 5","John carved his father a chair for his birthday.","a. The wood came from Madagascar.","b. The marble came from Vermont. If the definite NPs in examples 4 and 5 are taken as definite by virtue of their association with the previously mentioned event (just as definites have long been noted as being felicitous by virtue of their association with previously mentioned objects), then Example 4 shows people associating a variety of different results with the same action and Example 5, a variety of different inputs. To deal with this, we argue for","1. characterizing an agent's knowledge of an action in terms of partial constraints on its WSi and partial expectations about its WSo;","2. accommodating [15] definite NPs in subsequent utterances as instantiating either a partial constraint in WSi or a partial expectation in WSo. There appear to be three ways in which an agent's knowledge of an action's constraints and expectations may be partial, each of which manifests it-self somewhat differently in discourse: the knowledge may be abstract, it may be disjunctive, or it may in-volve options that may or may not be realized. Abstract Knowledge. An agent may believe that an action has a predictable result, without being able to give its particulars. For example, an agent may know that when she adds white paint to any other color paint, she gets paint of a lighter color. Its particular color will depend on the color of the original paint and the amount of white she adds. In such cases, one might want to characterize the agent's partial beliefs as abstract descriptions. The agent may then bring those beliefs to bear in generating or understanding text describing events. That is, in both narrative and instructions, the speaker is taken to know more about what has happened (or should happen) than the listener. The listener may thus not be able immediately to form specific expectations about the results of described events. But she can accommodate [15] a definite NP that can be taken to denote an instantiation of those expectations.","In Example 4, for example, one might characterize the agent's expectation about the object resulting from a blending or mixing action abstractly as a mizture. Given an instruction to mix or blend some-thing, the agent can then accommodate a subsequent definite reference to a particular kind of mixture - a batter, a paste or a dough - as instantiating this expectation.","An agent's knowledge of the input constraints on an action may be similarly abstract, characterizing, for example, the input to \"carve\" as a unit of solid material. Having been told about a particular carv-ing action, a listener can understand reference to a unit of particular material (stone, wood, ice, etc.) as instantiating this input object. Disjunctive Knowledge. An experienced agent has, for example, alternative expectations about the result of beating oil into egg yolks: the resulting object will be either an emulsion (i.e., mayonnaise) or a curdled mass of egg yolk globules floating in oil. Most often, one of the disjuncts will correspond to the intended result of the action, although \"intended\" does not necessarily imply \"likely\". (The result may in fact be quite unpredictable.) In a text, the disjunctive knowledge that an agent has, or is meant to have, about actions is manifest in the descriptions given of all (or several) alternatives. Often, the unintended alternatives are presented in a conditional mood. Options. A third type of partial knowledge that an agent may have about an action is that it may or may not produce a particular, usually secondary, result, depending on circumstances. As with disjunctive expectations, these results are unpredictable. A corn-99 mon way to specify options such as these in recipes is with the '~f any\" construction, as in Ex-mple 6","Saute garlic until lightly browned. Remove","the burnt bits, if any, before continuing. Our work to date has focussed on modelling an agent's abstract knowledge of actions and how it can be used in updating context and accommodating subsequent referring expressions, as in Examples 4 and 5. e These abstract constraints and expectations can be applied immediately as a clause describing their associated action is processed. Context changes will then reflect explicit lexical material, when present, as in Mix the flour, butter and water into a paste. or simply the agent's (abstract) expectations, when explicit lexical material is not present, as in Mix the flour, butter and water. In the latter case, a subsequent definite NP denoting a particular kind of mixture (the solution, the paste, etc) can be taken as referring to an entity that is in the current working set, merely refining its description, as in Example 4 above."]},{"title":"Initial Implementation Entity Introduction and Elimination","paragraphs":["The Natural Language and reasoning components of the AnimNL project are being implemented in Prolog. In our initial implementation of context change, entities can be entered into the context by either entity introduction or event simulation, but they are never actually removed. Instead, actions are treated as changing the properties of entities, which may make them inaccessible to subsequent actions. For example, mixing flour, butter and water (Exampies 3a and 4) is understood as changing the properties of the three ingredients, so that they are no longer subject to independent manipulation. (Here we are following Hayes' treatment of \"liquid pieces\" [9] which holds, for example, that the piece of water that was in a container still \"exists\" even after being poured into a lake: It is just no longer independently accessible.)

If definite is absent, as in the case of interpreting \"mix some flour, water and butter\" ,the back chainer introduces new entities into the working set.

The definite reference resolution algorithm applies the knowledge that the existence of a mixture in the discourse is consistent with that mixture being dough, and the discourse is updated with dough(m).
