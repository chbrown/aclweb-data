They have been adopted as constraints by HPSG but no encoding in the formalism has been provided. Since they only order siblings, they are not quite adequate, at least not for German. We propose a notion of LP constraints that applies to linguistically motivated branching domains such as head domains. We show a type-based encoding in an HPSG-style formalism that supports processing. The encoding can be achieved by a compilation step. INTRODUCTION","Most contemporary grammar models employed in computational linguistics separate statements about dominance from those that determine linear precedence. The approaches for encoding linear precedence (LP) statements differ along several dimensions.","Depending on the underlying grammatical theory, different criteria are employed in formulating ordering statements. Ordering constraints may be expressed by referring to the category, grammatical function, discourse r61e, and many other syntactic, semantic, morphological or phonological features.","Depending on the grammar formalism, different languages are used for stating the constraints on permissible linearizations. LP rules, first proposed by Gazdar and Pullum (1982) for GPSG, are used, in different guises, by several contemporary grammar formalisms. In Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1985) and implemented versions of Lexical Functional Grammar, pattern languages with the power of regular expressions have been utilized.","Depending on the grammar model, LP statements apply within different ordering domains. In most frameworks, such as GPSG and HPSG, the ordering domains are local trees. Initial trees constitute the ordering domain in ID/LP TAGS (Joshi 1987). In current LFG (Kaplan & Zaenen 1988), functional precedence rules apply to functional domains. Reape","Research for this paper was mainly carried out in the project LILOG supported by IBM Germany. Some of the research was performed in the project DISCO which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology under Grant-No.: ITW 9002. We wish to thank our colleagues in SaarbriJcken, three anonymous referees and especially Mark Hepple for their valuable comments and suggestions. (1989) constructs word order domains by means of a special union operation on embedded tree domains.","It remains an open question which choices along these dimensions will turn out to be most adequate for the description of word order in natural language.","In this paper we do not attempt to resolve the linguistic issue of the most adequate universal treatment of word order. However we will present a method for integrating word order constraints in a typed feature unification formalism without adding new formal devices.","Although some proposals for the interaction between feature unification and LP constraints have been published (e.g. Seiffert 1991), no encoding has yet been shown that integrates LP constraints in the linguistic type system of a typed feature unification formalism. Linguistic processing with a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) containing LP constraints has not yet been described in the literature.","Since no implemented NL system has been demonstrated so far that handles partially free word order of German and many other languages in a satisfactory way, we have made an attempt to utilize the formal apparatus of HPSG for a new approach to processing with LP constraints. However, our method is not bound to the formalism of HPSG.","In this paper we will demonstrate how LP constraints can be incorporated into the linguistic type system of HPSG through the use of parametrized types. Neither additional operations nor any special provisions for linear precedence in the processing algorithm are required. LP constraints are applied through regular unification whenever the head combines with a complement or adjunct.","Although we use certain LP-relevant features in our examples, our aproach does not hinge on the selection of specific linguistic criteria for constraining linear order.","Since there is no conclusive evidence to the contrary, we assume the simplest constraint language for formulating LP statements, i.e., binary LP constraints. For computational purposes such constraints are compiled into the type definitions for grammatical categories.","With respect to the ordering domain, our LP constraints differ from the LP constraints commonly assumed in HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1987) in that they 201 apply to nonsibling constituents in head domains. While LP constraints control the order of nodes that are not siblings, information is accumulated in trees in such a way that it is always possible to detect a violation of an LP constraint locally by checking sibling nodes.","This modification is necessary for the proper treatment of German word order. It is also needed by all grammar models that are on the one hand confined to binary branching structures such as nearly all versions of categorial grammar but that would, on the other hand, benefit from a notion of LP constraints.","Our approach has been tested with small sets of LP constraints. The grammar was written and run in STUF, the typed unification formalism used in the project LILOG. LINGUISTIC MOTIVATION","This section presents the linguistic motivation for our approach. LP statements in GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985) constrain the possibility of linearizing immediate dominance (ID) rules. By taking the right-hand sides of ID rules as their domain, they allow only the ordering of sibling constituents. Consequently, grammars must be designed in such a way that all constituents which are to be ordered by LP constraints must be dominated by one node in the tree, so that \"flat\" phrase structures result, as illustrated in figure 1.","VmaX sollte V max should NP[nom] ADV NP[dat] NP[acc] V 0","der Kurier nachher einem Spion den Brief zustecken","the courier later a spy the letter slip The courier was later supposed to slip a spy the letter. Figure 1","Uszkoreit (1986) argues that such flat structures are not well suited for the description of languages such as German and Dutch. The main reason 1 is so-called complex fronting, i.e., the fronting of a nonfinite verb together with some of its complements and adjuncts as it is shown in (1). Since it is a well established fact that only one constituent can be fronted, the flat structure can account for the German examples in (1), but not for the ones in (2), (1) sollte der Kurier nachher einem Spion den Brief","zustecken","zustecken sollte der Kurier nachher einem","Spion den Brief","den Brief sollte der Kurier nachher einem","Spion zustecken","1Further reasons are discussed in Uszkoreit (1991b). einem Spion sollte der Kurier nachher den Brief zustecken naehher sollte der Kurier einem Spion den Brief zustecken tier Kurier sollte nachher einem Spion den Brief zustecken (2) den Brief znsteeken sollte der Kurier nachher einem Spion einem Spion den Brief zusteeken sollte der Kurier nachher naehher einem Spion den Brief znsteeken sollte der Kurier In the hierarchical tree structure in figure 2, the","boxed constituents can be fronted, accounting for the","examples in (1) and (2).","V~aX","I der Kurier []","! nachher Figure 2 I I den Brief zustecken But with this tree structure, LP constraints can no","longer be enforced over siblings. The new domain for","linear order is a head domain, defined as follows: A head domain consists of the lexical head of a phrase, and its complements and adjuncts.","LP constraints must be respected within a head","domain. An LP-constraint is an ordered pair <A,B> of category descriptions, such that whenever a node cx subsumed by A and a node 13 subsumed by B occur within the domain of an LP-rule (in the case of GPSG a local tree, in our case a head domain), cz precedes 13. An LP constraint <A,B> is conventionally written","as A < B. It follows from the definition that B can","never precede A in an LP domain. In the next section,","we will show how this property is exploited in our","encoding of LP constraints. ENCODING OF LP CONSTRAINTS","From a formal point of view, we want to encode LP constraints in such a way that 202 • violation of an LP constraint results in unification failure, and • LP constraints, which operate on head domains, can be enforced in local trees by checking sibling nodes.","The last condition can be ensured if every node in a projection carries information about which constituents are contained in its head domain.","An LP constraint A < B implies that it can never be the case that B precedes A. We make use of this fact by the following additions to the grammar: • Every category A carries the information that B","must not occur to its left. • Every category B carries the information A must","not occur to its right.","This duplication of encoding is necessary because only the complements/adjuncts check whether the projection with which they are combined contains something that is incompatible with the LP constraints. A projection contains only information about which constituents are contained in its head domain, but no restrictions on its left and right context 2.","In the following example, we assume the LP-rules A<B and B<C. The lexical head of the tree is X 0, and the projections are X, and X max. The complements are A, B and C. Each projection contains information about the constituents contained in it, and each complement contains information about what must not occur to its left and right. A complement is only combined with a projection if the projection does not contain any category that the complement prohibits on its right or left, depending on which side the projection is added."]},{"title":"xmax","paragraphs":["{A, B, C} A X [left: ~B] {B,"]},{"title":"C} B -- [left: ~C ]","paragraphs":["X Lright:"]},{"title":"--,AJ","paragraphs":["Figure 3"]},{"title":"{cl","paragraphs":["c x"]},{"title":"[right:-- B] [ }","paragraphs":["Having now roughly sketched our approach, we will turn to the questions of how a violation of LP constraints results in unification failure, how the","2Alternatively, the projections of the head could as well accumulate the ordering restrictions while the arguments and adjuncts only carry information about their own LP-relevant features.

MANIPULATION OF THE LP-STORE","Since information about constituents is added to the LP-STORE, it would be tempting to add this information by unification, and to leave the initial LP-STORE unspecified for all features. This is not possible because violation of LP constraints is also checked by unification. In the process of this unification, values for features are added that may lead to unwanted unification failure when information about a constituent is added higher up in the tree.","Instead, the relation between the LP-STORE of a projection and the LP-STORE of its mother node is encoded in the argument that is added to the projection.

When an argument is combined with a projection, the projection's LP-STORE is unified with the argument's LP-IN, and the argument's LP-OUT is the mother node's LP-STORE. The relation between LP-IN and LP-OUT is specified in the feature structure of the argument, as illustrated in figure 11 for the accusative pronoun ihn, which is responsible for changing figure 7 into figure 10.

It should be emphasized that our encoding only affects the compiled grammar used for the processing. The linguist does not lose any of the descriptive means nor the conceptual clarity that an ID/LP formalism offers. Yet he gains an adequate computational interpretation of LP constraints.","Because of the declarative specification of LP constraints, this encoding is neutral with respect to processing direction (parsing-generation). It does not depend on specific strategies (top-down vs. bottom-up) although, as usual, some combinations are more efficient than others. This is an advantage over the formalization of unification ID/LP grammars in Seiffert (1991) and the approach by Erbach (1991). Seiffert's approach, in which LP constraints operate over siblings, requires an addition to the parsing algorithm, by which LP constraints are checked during processing to detect violations as early as possible, and again after processing, in case LP-relevant information has been added later by unification. Erbach's approach can handle LP constraints in head domains by building up a list of constituents over which the LP constraints are enforced, but also requires an addition to the parsing algorithm for checking LP constraints during as well as after processing.","Our encoding of LP constraints does not require any particular format of the grammar, such as left- or right-branching structures. Therefore it can be incorporated into a variety of linguistic analyses. There is no need to work out the formal semantics of LP constraints because feature unification formalisms already have a well-defined formal semantics.","Reape (1989) proposes a different strategy for treating partially free word order. His approach also permits the application of LP constraints across local trees. This is achieved by separating word order variation from the problem of building a semantically motivated phrase structure. Permutation across constituents can be described by merging the fringes (terminal yields) of the constituents using the operation of sequence union. All orderings imposed on the two merged fringes by LP constraints are preserved in the merged fringe.","Reape treats clause union and scrambling as permutation that does not affect constituent structure. Although we are intrigued by the elegance and descriptive power of Reape's approach, we keep our bets with our more conservative proposal. The main problem we see with Reape's strategy is the additional 207 burden for the LP component of the grammar. For every single constituent that is scrambled out of some clause into a higher clause, the two clauses need to be sequence-unioned. A new type of LP constraints that refer to the position of the constituents in the phrase or dependency structure is employed for ensuring that the two clauses are not completely interleaved. Hopefully future research will enable us to arrive at better judgements on the adequacy of the different approaches.","Pollard (1990) proposes an HPSG solution to German word order that lets the main verb first combine with some of its arguments and adjuncts in a local tree. The resulting constituent can be fronted. The remaining arguments and adjuncts are raised to the subcategorization list 7 of the auxiliary verb above the main verb. Yet, even if a flat structure is assumed for both the fronted part of the clause and the part remaining in situ as in (Pollard 1990), LP constraints have to order major constituents across the two parts. For a discussion, see Uszkoreit (1991b).","Uszkoreit (1991b) applies LP principles to head domains but employs a finite-state automaton for the encoding of LP constraints. We are currently still investigating the differences between this approach and the one presented here.","Just as most other formal appraoches to linear precedence, we treat LP-rules as absolute constraints whose violation makes a string unacceptable. Sketchy as the data may be, they suggest that violation of certain LP-eonstraints merely makes a sentence less acceptable. Degrees of acceptability are not easily captured in feature structures as they are viewed today. In terms of our theory, we must ensure that the unification of the complement's or adjunct's left or right context restriction with the head's LP-STORE does not fail in case of a value clash, but rather results in a feature structure with lower acceptability than the structure in which there is no feature clash. But until we have developed a well-founded theory of degrees of acceptability, and explored appropriate formal means such as weighted feature structures, as proposed in (Uszkoreit 1991a), we will either have to ignore ordering principles or treat them as absolute constraints.
