However, the current trend (and focus of research) is shift-ing to consider aspects of semantics and discourse as part of NLP. This can be seen in the emergence of new theories of language, such as Situation Theory [Barwise 83] and Discourse Representation Theory [Kamp 84]. While these theories provide an excellent the-oretical framework for natural language understanding, the practical treatment of context dependency within the language can also be improved by enhancing underlying component technologies, such as knowledge based systems. In particular, alternate approaches to symbolic manipulation provided by connectionist models [Rumelhart 86] have emerged. Connectionist approaches enable the extraction of processing knowledge from examples, instead of building knowledge bases manually.","The model described here represents the unification of the connectionist approach and conventional symbolic manipulation; its most valuable feature is the use of word associations using neural network technology. Word and concept associations appear to be central in human cognition [Minsky 88]. Therefore, simulating word associations contributes to semantic disambiguation in the computational process of interpreting sentences by putting a strong preference to expected words(meanings).","The paper describes NLP reinforced by association of concepts and words via a connectionist network.

The use of association is a natural extension to the conventional context holding mechanism. The idea is summarized as follows. There are two stages of processing: network generation and kana-kanji conversion.","A network representing the strength of word association is automatically generated from real documents.

Each node has an activation level. The link between nodes is a weighted link and represents the strength of association between words. The network is a Hopfield-type network[Hopfield 84]; links are bidirectional and a network is one layered.","When the user chooses a word from homonym candidates, a certain value is inputted to the node corresponding to the chosen word and the node will be activated. The activation level of nodes connected to the activated node will be then activated. In this manner, the activation spreads over the net-226 work through the links and the active part of the network can be considered as the associative words in that context. In kana-kanji conversion, the converter decides the preference of word order for homonyms in the given context by comparing the node activation level of each node of homonyms. An example of the method is shown in Figure 1.","Assume the network is already built from certain documents. A user is inputting a text whose topic is related to computer hardware. In the example, words like clock ( ~ t~ .~ ~ ) and signal (4~'-~-) already appear in the previous context, so their activation levels are relatively high. When the word DOUKI (~\") ~) is inputted in kana and the conversion starts, the activation level of synchronization (~J~) is higher than that of other candidates due to its relationship to clock or signal. The input douki is then correctly converted into synchronization ([~jtj]).","The advantages of our method are:","* The method enables kanji to be given based on a preference related to the current context. Alternative kanji selections are not discarded but are just given a lower context weighing. Should the context switch, the other possible selections will obtain a stronger context preference; this strategy allows the system to capably handle context change.","* Word preferences of a user are reflected in the network.","• The correctness of the conversion is improved without high-cost computation such as semantic/discourse analyses."]},{"title":"4 Implementation","paragraphs":["The system was built on Toshiba AS-4000 workstation (Sun4 compatible machine) using C. The system configuration is shown in Figure 2.","The left-hand side of the dashed line represents an off-line network building process. The right-hand side represents a kana-kanji conversion process reinforced with a neural network handler. The network is used by the neural network handler and word associations are done in parallel with kana-kanji conversion. The kana-kanji converter receives kana-sequences from a user. It searches the dictionary for lexical and grammatical information and finally creates a list of possible homonym candidates. Then the neural network handler is requested for activation levels of homonyms. After the selection of preferred homonyms, it shows the candidates in kanji to a user. When the user chooses the desired one, the chosen word information is sent to the neural network handler through a homonym choice interface and the corresponding node is activated.","The roles and the functions of main components are described as follows. * Neural Network Generator Several real documents are analyzed and the network nodes and the weights of links are automatically decided. The documents consist of the mixture of kana and kanji; homonyms for the kanji within the given context are also provided. The documents, therefore, can be seen as training data for the neural network. The analysis proceeds through the following steps.","1.

As described above, the technique used here is a morphological and statistical analysis. Actually this module is a pattern learning of co-appearing words in a paragraph.

Because the training data for the network is supposed to be supplied by users' documents in our system, automatic network generation mechanism is necessary even if the generated network is somewhat inaccurate. • Neural Network Handler The role of the module is to recall the total patterns of co-appearing words in a paragraph from the partial patterns of the current paragraph given by a user.

Tile basic algorithm is almost same as the conventional one. The difference is that holnonym candidates are sorted by the activation levels of the corresponding nodes in the network, except when local constraints such as word co-occurrence restrictions are applicable to the candidates. The associative information also affects the preference decision of grammatical ambiguities."]},{"title":"5 Evaluation","paragraphs":["To evaluate tile method, we tested the implemented sytem by doing kana-kanji conversion for real documents.

The existence of noisy words is inevitable in automatic generation but plays a role to make unwanted associations. One approach to reducing noisy words is to identify those words which are context independent and remove them from the network generation stage. The identification can be based on word categories and meanings. In most cases, words representing very abstract concepts are noisy because they force unwanted activations in unrelated contexts. Therefore they should be detected through experiments. Another problem arises because of the ambiguity of morphological analysis. Word extraction from real documents is not always correct because of the agglutinative nature of the Japanese language. Other possibility for network improvement is to consider a syntactic relationship or co-occurrence relationship while deciding link weights. In addition, there are keywords in a document in general which play a central role in association. They will be reflected in a network more in consideration of technical terms. Preference decision in kana-kanji conversion The reinforcement of associative information complicates the decision of homonym preference in kana-kanji conversion.

So selectional restrictions should be weak constraints in homonym selection. In the same vein, associative information should be considered a weak constraint because associations by neural networks are not always reliable. Possible conflict between selectional restrictions and associative information, added to tile grammatical ambiguities remaining in the stage of homonym selection, make kanji selection very complex. The problem of multiply and weakly constrained 230 homonyms is one to which we have not yet found the best solution."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper described an association based natural language processing and its application to kana.kanji conversion.
