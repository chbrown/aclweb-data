But the situation is much less clear when switching to automatic MWE prediction. While Cafferkey et al. (2007) report a small improvement on the pure parsing","1","Multiword expressions can be roughly defined as continuous or discontinuous sets of tokens, which either do not exhibit full freedom in lexical selection or whose meaning is not fully compositional.

(2012) report results on the joint MWE recognition and parsing task, in which errors in MWE recognition alleviate their positive effect on parsing performance.","While the realistic scenario of syntactic parsing with automatic MWE recognition (either done jointly or in a pipeline) has already been investigated in constituency parsing (Green et al., 2011; Constant et al., 2012; Green et al., 2013), the French dataset of the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013) only recently provided the opportunity to evaluate this scenario within the framework of dependency syntax.2","In such a scenario, a system predicts dependency trees with marked groupings of tokens into MWEs. The trees show syntactic dependencies between semantically sound units (made of one or several tokens), and are thus particularly appealing for downstream semantic-oriented applications, as dependency trees are considered to be closer to predicate-argument structures.","In this paper, we investigate various strategies for predicting from a tokenized sentence both MWEs and syntactic dependencies, using the French dataset of the SPMRL 13 Shared Task. We focus on the use of an alternative representation for those MWEs that exhibit regular internal syntax. The idea is to represent these using regular syntactic internal structure, while keeping the semantic information that they are MWEs.","We devote section 2 to related work. In section 3, we describe the French dataset, how MWEs are originally represented in it, and we present and motivate an alternative representation. Section 4 describes the different architectures we test","2","The main focus of the Shared Task was on predicting both morphological and syntactic analysis for morphologically-rich languages.

To our knowledge, the first works3","on predicting both MWEs and dependency trees are those presented to the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task that provided scores for French (which is the only dataset containing MWEs). Constant et al. (2013) proposed to combine pipeline and joint systems in a reparser (Sagae and Lavie, 2006), and ranked first at the Shared Task. Our contribution with respect to that work is the representation of the internal syntactic structure of MWEs, and use of MWE-specific features for the joint system. The system of Björkelund et al. (2013) ranked second on French, though with close UAS/LAS scores. It is a less language-specific system that reranks n-best dependency parses from 3 parsers, informed with features from predicted constituency trees. It uses no feature nor treatment specific to MWEs as it focuses on the general aim of the Shared Task, namely coping with prediction of morphological and syntactic analysis.","Concerning related work on the representation of MWE internal structure, we can cite the Prague Dependency Bank, which captures both regular syntax of non-compositional MWEs and their MWE status, in two distinct annotation layers (Bejček and Stranak, 2010). Our representation also resembles that of light-verb constructions (LVC) in the hungarian dependency treebank (Vincze et al., 2010): the construction has regular syntax, and a suffix is used on labels to express it is a LVC (Vincze et al., 2013)."]},{"title":"3 Data: MWEs in Dependency Trees","paragraphs":["The data we use is the SPMRL 13 dataset for French, in dependency format.

Top: original flat representation. Bottom: Tree after regular MWEs structuring. 3.1 MWEs in Gold Data: Flat representation In gold data, the MWEs appear in an expanded flat format: each MWE bears a part-of-speech and consists of a sequence of tokens (hereafter the “components” of the MWE), each having their proper POS, lemma and morphological features. In the dependency trees, there is no “node” for a MWE as a whole, but one node per MWE component (more generally one node per token). The first component of a MWE is taken as the head of the MWE. All subsequent components of the MWE depend on the first one, with the special label dep_cpd (hence the name flat represen-744 tation). Furthermore, the first MWE component bears a feature mwehead equal to the POS of the MWE. An example is shown in Figure 1. The MWE en vain (pointlessly) is an adverb, containing a preposition and an adjective. The latter de-pends on former, which bears mwehead=ADV+.","The algorithm to recover MWEs is: any node having dependents with the dep_cpd label forms a MWE with such dependents. 3.2 Alternative representation for regular MWEs In the alternative representation we propose, irregular MWEs are unchanged and appear as flat MWEs (e.g. en vain in Figure 1 has pattern preposition+adjective, which is not considered regular for an adverb, and is thus unchanged). Regular MWEs appear with ’structured’ syntax: we modify the tree structure to recover the regular syntactic dependencies. For instance, in the bottom tree of the figure, biens is attached to the preposition, and the adjective sociaux is attached to biens, with regular labels. Structured MWEs can-not be spotted using the tree topology and labels only. Features are added for that purpose: the syntactic head of the structured MWE bears a regmwehead for the POS of the MWE (abus in Figure 1), and the other components of the MWE bear a regcomponent feature (the orange tokens in Figure 1).4","With this representation, the algorithm to recover regular MWEs is: any node bearing regmwehead forms a MWE with the set of direct or indirect dependents bearing a regcomponent feature. 3.2.1 Motivations Our first motivation is to increase the quantity of information conveyed by the dependency trees, by distinguishing syntactic regularity and semantic regularity. Syntactically regular MWEs (hereafter regular MWEs) show various degrees of semantic non-compositionality. For instance, in the French Treebank, population active (lit. active population, meaning ’working population’) is a partially compositional MWE. Furthermore, some sequences are both syntactically and semantically regular, but encoded as MWE due to frozen lexical selection. This is the case for déficit budgétaire (lit. budgetary deficit, meaning ’budget deficit’), 4","The syntactic head of a structured MWE may not be the first token, whereas the head token of a flat MWE is always the first one. because it is not possible to use déficit du budget (budget deficit). Our alternative representation distinguishes between syntactic internal regularity and semantic regularity. This renders the syntactic description more uniform and it provides an internal structure for regular MWEs, which is meaningful if the MWE is fully or partially compositional. For instance, it is meaningful to have the adjective sociaux attach to biens instead of on the first component abus. Moreover, such a distinction opens the way to a non-binary classification of MWE status: the various criteria leading to classify a sequence as MWE could be annotated separately and using nominal or scaled categories for each criteria. For instance, déficit budgétaire could be marked as fully compositional, but with frozen lexical selection. Further, annotation is of-ten incoherent for the MWEs with both regular syntax and a certain amount of semantic compositionality, the same token sequence (with same meaning) being sometimes annotated as MWE and sometimes not.","More generally, keeping a regular representation would allow to better deal with the interac-tion between idiomatic status and regular syntax, such as the insertion of modifiers on MWE subparts (e.g. make a quick decision).","Finally, using regular syntax for MWEs provides a more uniform training set. For instance for a sequence N1 preposition N2, though some external attachments might vary depending on whether the sequence forms a MWE or not, some may not, and the internal dependency structure (N1 → (preposition → N2)) is quite regular. One objective of the current work is to investigate whether this increased uniformity eases parsing or whether it is mitigated by the additional difficulty of find-ing the internal structure of a MWE.

MWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE. To define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to our linguistic knowledge. The internal structure for the matching MWEs was built deterministically, using heuristics favoring local attachments.5","Table 1 shows the proportions of MWEs classified as regular, and thus further structured. About half MWEs are structured, and about two thirds of structured MWEs are nouns.","For predicted parses with structured MWEs, we use an inverse transformation of structured MWEs into flat MWEs, for evaluation against the gold data. When a predicted structured MWE is flat-tened, all the dependents of any token of the MWE that are not themselves belonging to the MWE are attached to the head component of the MWE. 3.3 Integration of MWE features into labels In some experiments, we make use of alternative representations, which we refer later as “labeled representation”, in which the MWE features are incorporated in the dependency labels, so that MWE composition and/or the POS of the MWE be totally contained in the tree topology and labels, and thus predictable via dependency parsing. Figure shows the labeled representation for the sentence of Figure 1.","For flat MWEs, the only missing information is the MWE part-of-speech: we concatenate it to the dep_cpd labels. For instance, the arc from en to vain is relabeled dep_cpd_ADV. For structured MWEs, in order to get full MWE account within the tree structure and labels, we need to incorporate both the MWE POS, and to mark it as","5","The six regular expressions that we obtained cover nominal, prepositional, adverbial and verbal compounds. We manually evaluated both the regular versus irregular classification and the structuring of regular MWEs on the first 200 MWEs of the development set. 113 of these were classified as regular, and we judged that all of them were actually regular, and were correctly structured. Among the 87 classified as irregular, 7 should have been tagged as regular and structured. For 4 of them, the classification error is due to errors on the (gold) POS of the MWE components. c.

More precisely, we consider the following alternative for irregular MWEs:","• IRREG-MERGED: gold irregular MWEs are merged for training; for parsing, irregular MWEs are predicted externally, merged into one token at parsing time, and re-expanded into several tokens for evaluation;","• IRREG-BY-PARSER: the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2).

Both resources help to predict MWE-specific features (section 5.3) to guide the MWE-aware dependency parser. More-over, in some of the architectures, the external MWE analyzer is used either to pre-group irregular MWEs (for the architectures using IRREG-MERGED), or to post-annotate regular MWEs. 5.1 MWE lexicons MWE lexicons are exploited as sources of features for both the dependency parser and the external MWE analyzer. In particular, two large-coverage general-language lexicons are used: the Lefff6","lexicon (Sagot, 2010), which contains approximately half a million inflected word forms, among which approx. 25, 000 are MWEs; and the DELA7","(Courtois, 2009; Courtois et al., 1997) lexicon, which contains approx. one million inflected forms, among which about 110, 000 are MWEs.

Note that the lexicons do not include any information on the irregular or the regular status of the MWEs.

We obtain about 70% recall and 50% precision with respect to MWE spanning. 5.2 MWE Analyzer The MWE analyzer is a CRF-based sequential labeler, which, given a tokenized text, jointly performs MWE segmentation and POS tagging (of simple tokens and of MWEs), both tasks mutually helping each other9",". The MWE analyzer integrates, among others, features computed from the external lexicons described in section 5.1, which greatly improve POS tagging (Denis and Sagot, 2009) and MWE segmentation (Constant and Tellier, 2012). The MWE analyzer also jointly classifies its predicted MWEs as regular or irregular (the distinction being learnt on gold training set, with structured MWEs cf. section 3.2). 5.3 MWE-specific features We introduce information from the external MWE resources in different ways: Flat MWE features: MWE information can be integrated as features to be used by the dependency parser. We tested to incorporate the MWE-specific features as defined in the gold flat representation (section 3.1): the mwehead=POS feature for the MWE head token, POS being the part-of-speech of the MWE; the component=y feature for the non-first MWE component. Switch: instead or on top of using the mwehead feature, we use the POS of the MWE instead of the POS of the first component of a flat MWE. For instance in Figure 1, the token en gets pos=ADV instead of pos=P. The intuition behind this feature is that for an irregular MWE, the POS of the linearly first component, which serves as head, is not always representative of the external distribution of the MWE. For regular MWEs, the usefulness of such a trick is less obvious. The first component of a regular MWE is not necessarily its head (for instance for a nominal MWE with internal pattern adjective+noun), so the switch trick could be detrimental in such cases.10","9","Note that in our experiments, we use this analyzer for MWE analysis only, and discard the POS tagging prediction.

In the last two cases, the evaluation is performed against an instance of the gold data automatically transformed to match the representation type. Moreover, for the “labeled representation” evaluation, though the MWE information in the predicted parses is obtained in various ways, depending on the architecture, we always map all this information in the dependency labels, to obtain predicted parses matching the “labeled representation”. While the evaluation in flat representation is the only one comparable to other works on this dataset, the other two evaluations provide useful information. In the “labeled representation” evaluation, the UAS provides a measure of syntactic attachments for sequences of words, independently of the (regular) MWE status of subsequences. For the sequence abus de biens sociaux, suppose that the correct internal structure is predicted, but not the MWE status. The UAS for labeled representation will be maximal, whereas for the flat representation, the last two tokens will count as incorrect for UAS. For LAS, in both cases the three last tokens will count as incorrect if the wrong MWE status is predicted. So to sum up on the “labeled evaluation”, we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer: predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs.","The evaluation on “structured representation” can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only: both LAS and UAS are measured independently of errors on regular MWE status (note the UAS is exactly the same than in the “labeled” case).","For each architecture, Table 3 shows the results for two systems: first the baseline system without any MWE features nor switches and immediately below the best settings for the architecture. The JOINT baseline corresponds to a “pure” joint system without external MWE resources (hence the minus sign for the first three columns). For each architecture except the PIPELINE one, differences between the baseline and the best setting are statistically significant (p < 0.01). Differences between best PIPELINE and best JOINT-REG are not. Best JOINT has statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) over both best JOINT-REG and best PIPELINE. The situation for best JOINT-IRREG with respect to the other three is borderline (with various p-values depending on the metrics).","Concerning the tuning of parameters, it appears that the best setting is to use MWE-features, and switch for both regular and irregular MWEs, except for the pipeline architecture for which results without MWE features are slightly better.

On the structured representation, the two best systems (JOINT and JOINT-IRREG) significantly outperform the other systems (p < 0.01 for all; p < 0.05 for JOINT-REG).","Moreover, we provide in table 5 a comparison of our best architecture with reg/irregular MWE distinction with other architectures that do not make this distinction, namely the two best comparable systems designed for the SPMRL Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013): the pipeline simple parser based on Mate-tools of Constant et al. (2013) (Const13) and the Mate-tools system (without reranker) of Björkelund et al. (2013) (Bjork13). We also reimplemented and improved the uniform joint architecture of Constant et al. (2013), by adding MWE features and switch. Results can only be compared on the flat representation, because the other systems output poorer linguistic information. We computed statistical significance of differences between our systems and Const13. On dev, the best system is the enhanced uniform joint, but differences are not significant between that and the best reg/irreg joint (1st row) and the Const13 pipeline. But on the test corpus (which is twice bigger), the best system is Const13 750 Tasks LAS UAS ALL MWE REG MWE IRREG MWE System Parsing MWE FUM FTM FUM FTM FUM FTM Our best system (best JOINT) + all 85.15 88.78 77.6 74.5 70.8 67.8 85.4 82.6 Uniform pipeline/gold MWEs + - 88.73 90.60 - - - - - - CRF-based MWE analyzer - all - - 78.8 76.3 73.5 71.9 84.2 80.8 JOINT-REG + all 84.58 88.34 76.3 73.2 69.3 66.5 84.1 80.7 JOINT-REG/gold irreg.

So the first observation is that our architectures that distinguish between reg/irreg MWEs do not outperform uniform architectures. But we note that the differences are slight, and the output we obtain is enhanced with regular MWE internal structure. It can thus be noted that the increased syntactic uniformity obtained by our MWE representation is mitigated so far by the additional complexity of the task. The second observation is that currently the best system on this dataset is a pipeline system, as results on test set show (and somehow contrary to results on dev set). The joint systems that integrate MWE information in the labels seem to suffer from increased data sparseness. 6.5 Evaluating the double task with respect to simpler tasks In this section, we propose to better evaluate the difficulty of combining the tasks of MWE analysis and dependency parsing by comparing our systems with systems performing simpler tasks: i.e. MWE recognition without parsing, and parsing with no or limited MWE recognition, simulated by using gold MWEs. We also provide a finer evaluation of the MWE recognition task, in particular with respect to their regular/irregular status.","We first compare our best system with a parser where all MWEs have been perfectly pre-grouped, in order to quantify the difficulty that MWEs add to the parsing task. We also compare the performance on MWEs of our best system with that achieved by the CRF-based analyzer described in section 5.2. Next, we compare the best JOINT-REG system with the one based on the same architecture but where the irregular MWEs are perfectly pre-identified, in order to quantify the difficulty added by the irregular MWEs. Results are given in table 6. Without any surprise, the task is much easier without considering MWE recognition. We can see that without considering MWE analysis the parsing accuracy is about 2.5 points better in terms of LAS. In the JOINT-REG architecture, assuming gold irregular MWE identification, increases LAS by 1.3 point. In terms of MWE recognition, as compared with the CRF-based analyzer, our best system is around 2 points below. But the situation is quite different when breaking the evaluation by MWE type. Our system is 1 point better than the CRF-based analyzer for irregular MWEs. This shows that considering a larger syntactic context helps recognition of irregular MWEs. The ”weak point” of our system is therefore the identification of regular MWEs."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Tree-bank (Abeillé and Barrier, 2004), as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013). Our work focused on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure. We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs. This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic composition-ality of MWEs. The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical. Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Anne Abeillé and Nicolas Barrier. 2004.
