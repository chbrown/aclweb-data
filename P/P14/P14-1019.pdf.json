        "Much of the recent work on dependency parsing has been focused on solving inherent combinatorial problems associated with rich scoring functions. In contrast, we demonstrate that highly expressive scoring functions can be used with substantially simpler inference procedures. Specifically, we introduce a sampling-based parser that can easily handle arbitrary global features. Inspired by SampleRank, we learn to take guided stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse. We introduce two samplers for traversing the space of trees, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings with Random Walk. The model outperforms state-of-the-art results when evaluated on 14 languages of non-projective CoNLL datasets. Our sampling-based approach naturally extends to joint prediction scenarios, such as joint parsing and POS correction. The resulting method outperforms the best reported results on the CATiB dataset, approaching performance of parsing with gold tags.1"

        "Dependency parsing is commonly cast as a maximization problem over a parameterized scoring function. In this view, the use of more expressive scoring functions leads to more challenging combinatorial problems of finding the maximizing parse. Much of the recent work on parsing has been focused on improving methods for solving the combinatorial maximization inference problems. Indeed, state-of-the-art results have been ob-1",

We depart from this view and instead focus on using highly expressive scoring functions with substantially simpler inference procedures. The key ingredient in our approach is how learning is coupled with inference. Our combination outperforms the state-of-the-art parsers and remains comparable even if we adopt their scoring functions.",
        "Rich scoring functions have been used for some time. They first appeared in the context of reranking (Collins, 2000), where a simple parser is used to generate a candidate list which is then reranked according to the scoring function. Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees. The power of this method-ology is nevertheless limited by the initial set of alternatives from the simpler parser. Indeed, the set may already omit the gold parse. We dispense with the notion of a candidate set and seek to exploit the scoring function more directly.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a sampling-based parser that places few or no constraints on the scoring function. Starting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse. The proposal distribution over the moves is derived from the scoring function itself. Because the steps are small, the complexity of the scoring function has limited impact on the computational cost of the procedure. We explore two alternative proposal distributions. Our first strategy is akin to Gibbs sampling and samples a new head for each word in the sentence, modifying one arc at a time. The second strategy relies on a provably correct sampler for first-order scores (Wilson, 1996), and uses it within a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for general scoring functions. It turns out that the latter optimizes the 197 score more efficiently than the former.",
        "Because the inference procedure is so simple, it is important that the parameters of the scoring function are chosen in a manner that facilitates how we climb the scoring function in small steps. One way to achieve this is to make sure that improvements in the scoring functions are correlated with improvements in the quality of the parse. This approach was suggested in the SampleRank framework (Wick et al., 2011) for training structured prediction models. This method was originally developed for a sequence labeling task with local features, and was shown to be more effective than state-of-the-art alternatives. Here we apply SampleRank to parsing, applying several modifications such as the proposal distributions mentioned earlier.",
        "The benefits of sampling-based learning go beyond stand-alone parsing. For instance, we can use the framework to correct preprocessing mistakes in features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags. In this case, we combine the scoring function for trees with a stand-alone tagging model. When proposing a small move, i.e., sampling a head of the word, we can also jointly sample its POS tag from a set of alternatives provided by the tagger. As a result, the selected tag is influenced by a broad syntactic context above and beyond the initial tagging model and is directly optimized to improve parsing performance. Our joint parsing-tagging model provides an alternative to the widely-adopted pipeline setup.",
        "We evaluate our method on benchmark multilingual dependency corpora. Our method outperforms the Turbo parser across 14 languages on average by 0.5%. On four languages, we top the best published results. Our method provides a more effective mechanism for handling global features than reranking, outperforming it by 1.3%. In terms of joint parsing and tagging on the CATiB dataset, we nearly bridge (88.38%) the gap between in-dependently predicted (86.95%) and gold tags (88.45%). This is better than the best published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task (Seddah et al., 2013), including parser ensembles."

        "Earlier works on dependency parsing focused on inference with tractable scoring functions. For instance, a scoring function that operates over each single dependency can be optimized using the maximum spanning tree algorithm (McDonald et al., 2005). It was soon realized that using higher order features could be beneficial, even at the cost of using approximate inference and sacrificing optimality. The first successful approach in this arena was reranking (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) on constituency parsing. Reranking can be combined with an arbitrary scoring function, and thus can easily incorporate global features over the entire parse tree. Its main disadvantage is that the output parse can only be one of the few parses passed to the reranker.",
        "Recent work has focused on more powerful inference mechanisms that consider the full search space (Zhang and McDonald, 2012; Rush and Petrov, 2012; Koo et al., 2010; Huang, 2008). For instance, Nakagawa (2007) deals with tractability issues by using sampling to approximate marginals. Another example is the dual decomposition (DD) framework (Koo et al., 2010; Martins et al., 2011). The idea in DD is to decompose the hard maximization problem into smaller parts that can be efficiently maximized and enforce agree-ment among these via Lagrange multipliers. The method is essentially equivalent to linear programming relaxation approaches (Martins et al., 2009; Sontag et al., 2011), and also similar in spirit to ILP approaches (Punyakanok et al., 2004).",
        "A natural approach to approximate global inference is via search. For instance, a transition-based parsing system (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) incrementally constructs a parsing structure using greedy beam-search. Other approaches operate over full trees and generate a sequence of candidates that successively increase the score (Daumé III et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Wick et al., 2011). Our work builds on one such approach — SampleRank (Wick et al., 2011), a sampling-based learning algorithm. In SampleRank, the parameters are adjusted so as to guide the sequence of candidates closer to the target structure along the search path. The method has been successfully used in sequence labeling and machine translation (Haddow et al., 2011). In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt the method for parsing with rich scoring functions."

        "In this section, we introduce our novel sampling-based dependency parser which can incorporate 198 arbitrary global features. We begin with the no-tation before addressing the decoding and learning algorithms. Finally, we extend our model to a joint parsing and POS correction task. 3.1 Notations We denote sentences by x and the corresponding dependency trees by y ∈ Y(x). Here Y(x) is the set of valid (projective or non-projective) dependency trees for sentence x. We use xj to refer to the jth word of sentence x, and hj to the head word of xj. A training set of size N is given as a set of pairs D = {(x(i)",

We do not make any assumptions about how the feature function decomposes. In contrast, most state-of-the-art parsers operate under the assumption that the feature function decomposes into a sum of simpler terms. For example, in the second-order MST parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), all the feature terms involve arcs or consecutive siblings. Similarly, parsers based on dual decomposition (Martins et al., 2011; Koo et al., 2010) assume that s(x, y) decomposes into a sum of terms where each term can be maximized over y efficiently. 3.2 Decoding The decoding problem consists of finding a valid dependency tree y ∈ Y(x) that maximizes the score s(x, y) = θ · f (x, y) with parameters θ. For scoring functions that extend beyond first-order arc preferences, finding the maximizing non-projective tree is known to be NP-hard (McDonald and Pereira, 2006). We find a high scoring tree through sampling, and (later) learn the parameters θ so as to further guide this process.",

The target distribution p folds into the procedure by defining the probability that we will accept the proposed move. The general structure of our sampling algorithm is given in Figure 1. 3.2.1 Gibbs Sampling Perhaps the most natural choice of the proposal distribution q is a conditional distribution from p. This is feasible if we restrict the proposed moves to only small changes in the current tree. In our case, we choose a word j randomly, and then sample its head hj according to p with the constraint that we obtain a valid tree (when projective trees are sought, this constraint is also incorporated). For this choice of q, the probability of accepting the new tree (α in Figure 1) is identically one. Thus new moves are always accepted. 3.2.2 Exact First-Order Sampling One shortcoming of the Gibbs sampler is that it only changes one variable (arc) at a time. This usually leads to slow mixing, requiring more samples to get close to the parse with maximum score. Ideally, we would change multiple heads in the parse tree simultaneously, and sample those choices from the corresponding conditional distribution of p.

The algorithm in Wilson (1996) iterates over all the nodes, and for each node performs a random walk according to the weights wij until the walk creates a loop or hits a tree. In the first case the algorithm erases the loop and continues the walk. If the walk hits the current tree, the walk path is added to form a new tree with more nodes. This is repeated until all the nodes are included in the tree. It can be shown that this procedure generates i.i.d. trees from p(y).",

We use all sentences in CoNLL datasets during training and testing. We also use the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Marton et al., 2013). CATiB mostly includes projective trees. The trees are an-notated with both gold and predicted versions of POS tags and morphology information. Following Marton et al. (2013), for this dataset we use 12 core POS tags, word lemmas, determiner features, rationality features and functional genders and numbers.",
        "Some CATiB sentences exceed 200 tokens. For efficiency, we limit the sentence length to 70 tokens in training and development sets. However, we do not impose this constraint during testing. We handle long sentences during testing by applying a simple split-merge strategy. We split the sentence based on the ending punctuation, predict the parse tree for each segment and group the roots of resulting trees into a single node. Evaluation Measures Following standard practice, we use Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) as the evaluation metric in all our experiments. We report UAS excluding punctuation on CoNLL datasets, following Martins et al. (2013). For the CATiB dataset, we report UAS including punctuation in order to be consistent with the published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task (Seddah et al., 2013). Baselines We compare our model with the Turbo parser and the MST parser. For the Turbo parser, we directly compare with the recent published results in (Martins et al., 2013). For the MST parser, we train a second-order non-projective model using the most recent version of the code3",
        ".",
        "We also compare our model against a discriminative reranker. The reranker operates over the 3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mstparser/ top-50 list obtained from the MST parser4",
        ". We use a 10-fold cross-validation to generate candidate lists for training. We then train the reranker by running 10 epochs of cost-augmented MIRA. The reranker uses the same features as our model, along with the tree scores obtained from the MST parser (which is a standard practice in reranking). Experimental Details Following Koo and Collins (2010), we always first train a first-order pruner. For each word xi, we prune away the incoming dependencies ⟨hi, xi⟩ with probability less than 0.005 times the probability of the most likely head, and limit the number of candidate heads up to 30. This gives a 99% pruning recall on the CATiB development set. The first-order model is also trained using the algorithm in Figure 4. After pruning, we tune the regularization parameter C = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} on development sets for different languages. Because the CoNLL datasets do not have a standard development set, we randomly select a held out of 200 sentences from the training set. We also pick the training epochs from {50, 100, 150} which gives the best performance on the development set for each language. After tuning, the model is trained on the full training set with the selected parameters.",
        "We apply the Random Walk-based sampling method (see Section 3.2.2) for the standard dependency parsing task. However, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables. Therefore, the first-order distribution is not well-defined and we only employ Gibbs sampling for simplicity. On the CATiB dataset, we restrict the sample trees to always be projective as described in Section 3.2.1. However, we do not impose this constraint for the CoNLL datasets."

        "To put these numbers into perspective, the bottom part of Table 3 shows the accuracy of the best systems from the 2013 SPMRL shared task on Arabic parsing using predicted information (Seddah et al., 2013). Our system not only outperforms the best single system (Björkelund et al., 2013) by 1.4%, but it also tops the ensemble system that combines three powerful parsers: the Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010), the Easy-First parser (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010) and the Turbo parser (Martins et al., 2013) Impact of Sampling Methods We compare two sampling methods introduced in Section 3.2 with respect to their decoding efficiency. Specifically, we measure the score of the retrieved trees in testing as a function of the decoding speed, measured by the number of tokens per second. We change the temperature update rate c in order to decode with different speed. In Figure 7 we show the corresponding curves for two languages: Arabic and Chinese. We select these two languages as they correspond to two extremes in sentence length: Arabic has the longest sentences on average, while Chinese has the shortest ones. For both languages, the tree score improves over time. Given sufficient time, both sampling methods achieve the same score. However, the Random Walk-based sampler performs better when the quality is traded for speed. This result is to be expected given that each 204 Dev. Set (≤ 70) Testing Set POS Acc. UAS POS Acc.

The Effect of Constraints in Learning Our training method updates parameters to satisfy the pairwise constraints between (1) subsequent samples on the sampling path and (2) selected samples and the ground truth. Figure 8 shows that applying both types of constraints is consistently better than using either of them alone. Moreover, these results demonstrate that comparison between subsequent samples is more important than comparison against the gold tree.

Figure 7 illustrates this trade-off. In the experiments reported above, we chose a conservative cooling rate and continued to sample until the score no longer changed. The parser still managed to process all the datasets in a reasonable time. For example, the time that it took to decode all the test sentences in Chinese and Arabic were 3min and 15min, respectively. Our current implementation is in Java and can be further optimized for speed."
