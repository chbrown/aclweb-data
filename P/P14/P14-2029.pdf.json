        "Automated methods for identifying whether sentences are grammatical have various potential applications (e.g., machine translation, automated essay scoring, computer-assisted language learning). In this work, we construct a statistical model of grammaticality using various linguistic features (e.g., misspelling counts, parser outputs, n-gram language model scores). We also present a new publicly available dataset of learner sentences judged for grammaticality on an ordinal scale. In evaluations, we compare our system to the one from Post (2011) and find that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance."

        "In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality of sentences, and present a dataset of learner sentences rated for grammaticality. Such a system could be used, for example, to check or to rank outputs from systems for text summarization, natural language generation, or machine translation. It could also be used in educational applications such as essay scoring.",
        "Much of the previous research on predicting grammaticality has focused on identifying (and possibly correcting) specific types of grammatical errors that are typically made by English language learners, such as prepositions (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), articles (Han et al., 2006), and collocations (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011). While some applications (e.g., grammar checking) rely on such fine-grained predictions, others might be better addressed by sentence-level grammaticality judgments (e.g., machine translation evaluation).",
        "Regarding sentence-level grammaticality, there has been much work on rating the grammaticality of machine translation outputs (Gamon et al., 2005; Parton et al., 2011), such as the MT Quality Estimation Shared Tasks (Bojar et al., 2013, §6), but relatively little on evaluating the grammaticality of naturally occurring text. Also, most other research on evaluating grammaticality involves artificial tasks or datasets (Sun et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Wong and Dras, 2010; Post, 2011).",
        "Here, we make the following contributions.",
        "• We develop a state-of-the-art approach for predicting the grammaticality of sentences on an ordinal scale, adapting various techniques from the previous work described above.",
        "• We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality. With this unique data set, which we will release to the research community, it is now possible to conduct realistic evaluations for predicting sentence-level grammaticality."

      "paragraphs": [
        "We created a dataset consisting of 3,129 sentences randomly selected from essays written by non-native speakers of English as part of a test of English language proficiency. We oversampled lower-scoring essays to increase the chances of finding ungrammatical sentences. Two of the authors of this paper, both native speakers of English with linguistic training, annotated the data. We refer to these annotators as expert judges. When making judgments of the sentences, they saw the previous sentence from the same essay as context. These two authors were not directly involved in development of the system in §3.",
        "Each sentence was annotated on a scale from 1 to 4 as described below, with 4 being the most 174 grammatical. We use an ordinal rather than binary scale, following previous work such as that of Clark et al. (2013) and Crocker and Keller (2005) who argue that the distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical is not simply binary. Also, for practical applications, we believe that it is useful to distinguish sentences with minor errors from those with major errors that may disrupt communication. Our annotation scheme was influenced by a translation rating scheme by Coughlin (2003).",
        "Every sentence judged on the 1–4 scale must be a clause. There is an extra category (“Other”) for sentences that do not fit this criterion. We exclude instances of “Other” in our experiments (see §4). 4. Perfect The sentence is native-sounding. It has no grammatical errors, but may contain very minor typographical and/or collocation errors, as in Example (1).",
        "(1) For instance, i stayed in a dorm when i went to collge. 3. Comprehensible The sentence may contain one or more minor grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, determiner, and minor preposition errors that do not make the mean-ing unclear, as in Example (2).",
        "(2) We know during Spring Festival, Chinese family will have a abundand family banquet with family memebers. “Chinese family”, which could be corrected to “Chinese families”, “each Chinese family”, etc., would be an example of a minor grammatical error involving determiners. 2. Somewhat Comprehensible The sentence may contain one or more serious grammatical errors, including missing subject, verb, object, etc., verb tense errors, and serious preposition errors. Due to these errors, the sentence may have multiple plausible interpretations, as in Example (3).",
        "(3) I can gain the transportations such as buses and trains. 1. Incomprehensible The sentence contains so many errors that it would be difficult to correct, as in Example (4).",
        "(4) Or you want to say he is only a little boy do not everything clearly? The phrase “do not everything” makes the sentence practically incomprehensible since the subject of “do” is not clear. O. Other/Incomplete This sentence is incomplete. These sentences, such as Example (5), appear in our corpus due to the nature of timed tests. (5) The police officer handed the This sentence is cut off and does not at least in-clude one clause.",
        "We measured interannotator agreement on a subset of 442 sentences that were independently annotated by both expert annotators. Exact agreement was 71.3%, unweighted κ = 0.574, and Pearson’s r = 0.759.1",
        "For our experiments, one expert annotator was arbitrarily selected, and for the doubly-annotated sentences, only the judgments from that annotator were retained.",
        "The labels from the expert annotators are distributed as follows: 72 sentences are labeled 1; 538 are 2; 1,431 are 3; 978 are 4; and 110 are “O”.",
        "We also gathered 5 additional judgments using Crowdflower.2",
        "For this, we excluded the “Other” category and any sentences that had been marked as such by the expert annotators. We used 100 (3.2%) of the judged sentences as “gold” data in Crowdflower to block contributors who were not following the annotation guidelines. For those sentences, only disagreements within 1 point of the expert annotator judgment were accepted. In preliminary experiments, averaging the six judgments (1 expert, 5 crowdsourced) for each item led to higher human-machine agreement. For all experiments reported later, we used this average of six judgments as our gold standard.",
        "For our experiments (§4), we randomly split the data into training (50%), development (25%), and testing (25%) sets. We also excluded all instances labeled “Other”. These are relatively uncommon and less interesting to this study. Also, we believe that simpler, heuristic approaches could be used to identify such sentences.",

This is in contrast to treebank-trained grammars, which will generally provide some analysis regardless of grammaticality. Here, we use (1) the Link Grammar Parser8",

For this experiment, all models were estimated from the training set and evaluated on the development set. We report performance in terms of Pearson’s r between the averaged 1–4 human labels and unrounded system predictions.",

For test set evaluations, we trained on the combination of the training and development sets (§2), to maximize the amount of training data for the final experiments.",

Evaluat-ing on a binary scale allows us to measure how well the system distinguishes grammatical sentences from ungrammatical ones. For some applications, this two-way distinction may be more relevant than the more fine-grained 1–4 scale. To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the l2-regularized linear regression model with an l2-regularized logistic regression and used Kendall’s τ rank correlation between the predicted probabilities of the positive class and the binary gold standard labels as the grid search metric (§3.1) instead of Pearson’s r.",

        "In this paper, we developed a system for predicting grammaticality on an ordinal scale and created a labeled dataset that we have released publicly (§2) to enable more realistic evaluations in future research. Our system outperformed an existing state-of-the-art system (Post, 2011) in evaluations on binary and ordinal scales. This is the most realistic evaluation of methods for predicting sentence-level grammaticality to date.",
        "Surprisingly, the system from Post (2011) performed quite poorly on the GUG dataset. We speculate that this is due to the fact that the Post system relies heavily on features extracted from automatic syntactic parses. While Post found that such a system can effectively distinguish grammatical news text sentences from sentences generated by a language model, measuring the grammaticality of real sentences from language learners seems to require a wider variety of features, including n-gram counts, language model scores, etc. Of course, our findings do not indicate that syntactic features such as those from Post (2011) are without value. In future work, it may be possible to improve grammaticality measurement by integrating such features into a larger system."
