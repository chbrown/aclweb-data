We perform experiments on three Data sets — Version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Universal Dependency Treebanks and Treebanks from CoNLL shared-tasks, across ten languages.

Several supervised dependency parsing algorithms (Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007; Koo and Collins, 2010; Ma and Zhao, 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) have been proposed and achieved high parsing accuracies on several treebanks, due in large part to the availability of dependency treebanks in a number of languages (McDonald et al., 2013). However, the manually annotated treebanks that these parsers rely on are highly expensive to create, in particular when we want to build treebanks for resource-poor languages. This led to a vast amount of research on unsupervised grammar induction (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010; Blunsom and Cohn, 2010; Mareček and Straka, 2013; Spitkovsky et al., 2013), which appears to be a natural solution to this problem, as unsupervised methods require only unannotated text for training parsers. Unfortunately, the unsupervised grammar induction systems’ parsing accuracies often significantly fall behind those of supervised systems (McDonald et al., 2011). Furthermore, from a practical standpoint, it is rarely the case that we are completely devoid of resources for most languages.","In this paper, we consider a practically motivated scenario, in which we want to build statistical parsers for resource-poor target languages, using existing resources from a resource-rich source language (like English).1","We assume that there are absolutely no labeled training data for the target language, but we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language and a sufficient amount of labeled training data to build an accurate parser for the resource-rich language. This scenario appears similar to the setting in bilingual text parsing. However, most bilingual text parsing approaches require bilingual treebanks — treebanks that have manually annotated tree structures on both sides of source and target languages (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008), or have tree structures on the source side and translated sentences in the target languages (Huang et","1","For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the resource-poor language as the “target language”, and resource-rich language as the “source language”. In addition, in this study we use English as the source resource-rich language, but our methodology can be applied to any resource-rich languages. 1337 al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010). Obviously, bilingual treebanks are much more difficult to acquire than the resources required in our scenario, since the labeled training data and the parallel text in our case are completely separated. What is more important is that most studies on bilingual text parsing assumed that the parser is applied only on bilingual text. But our goal is to develop a parser that can be used in completely monolingual setting for each target language of interest.","This scenario is applicable to a large set of languages and many research studies (Hwa et al., 2005) have been made on it. Ganchev et al. (2009) presented a parser projection approach via parallel text using the posterior regularization framework (Graca et al., 2007). McDonald et al. (2011) proposed two parser transfer approaches between two different languages — one is directly transferred parser from delexicalized parsers, and the other parser is transferred using constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora. In that work, they demonstrate that even the directly transferred delexicalized parser produces significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers. Cohen et al. (2011) proposed an approach for unsupervised dependency parsing with non-parallel multilingual guidance from one or more helper languages, in which parallel data is not used.","In this work, we propose a learning framework for transferring dependency grammars from a resource-rich language to resource-poor languages via parallel text. We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data. Our work is based on the learning framework used in Smith and Eisner (2007), which is originally de-signed for parser bootstrapping. We extend this learning framework so that it can be used to transfer cross-lingual knowledge between different languages.","Throughout this paper, English is used as the source language and we evaluate our approach on ten target languages — Danish (da), Dutch (nl), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Swedish (sv). Our approach achieves significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art unsupervised and projected parsing systems across all the ten languages, and considerably bridges the Economic news had little effect on financial marketsRoot Figure 1: An example dependency tree. gap to fully supervised dependency parsing performance."]},{"title":"2 Our Approach","paragraphs":["Dependency trees represent syntactic relationships through labeled directed edges between heads and their dependents. For example, Figure 1 shows a dependency tree for the sentence, Economic news had little effect on financial markets, with the sentence’s root-symbol as its root. The focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available. Central to our approach is a maximizing likelihood learning framework, in which we use an English parser and parallel text to estimate the “transferring distribution” of the target language parsing model (See Section 2.2 for more details). Another advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach. 2.1 Edge-Factored Parsing Model In this paper, we will use the following notation: x represents a generic input sentence, and y represents a generic dependency tree. T(x) is used to denote the set of possible dependency trees for sentence x. The probabilistic model for dependency parsing defines a family of conditional probability pλ(y|x) over all y given sentence x, with a log-linear form:","pλ(y|x) = 1","Z(x) exp { ∑","j λj Fj (y, x)}","(1) where Fj are feature functions, λ = (λ1, λ2, . . .) are parameters of the model, and Z(x) is a normalization factor, which is commonly referred to as the partition function:","Z(x) = ∑ y∈T(x) exp { ∑","j λj Fj (y, x)} (2) 1338 A common strategy to make this parsing model efficiently computable is to factor dependency trees into sets of edges:","Fj (y, x) = ∑ e∈y fj(e, x). (3) That is, dependency tree y is treated as a set of edges e and each feature function Fj (y, x) is equal to the sum of all the features fj(e, x).","We denote the weight function of each edge e as follows:","w(e, x) = exp { ∑ j λj fj(e, x)} (4) and the conditional probability pλ(y|x) has the following form:","pλ(y|x) = 1 Z(x) ∏","e∈y w(e, x) (5) 2.2 Model Training One of the most common model training methods for supervised dependency parser is Maximum conditional likelihood estimation. For a supervised dependency parser with a set of training data {(xi, yi)}, the logarithm of the likelihood (a.k.a. the log-likelihood) is given by:","L(λ) = ∑ i log pλ(yi|xi) (6) Maximum likelihood training chooses parameters such that the log-likelihood L(λ) is maximized.","However, in our scenario we have no labeled training data for target languages but we have some parallel and unlabeled data plus an English dependency parser. For the purpose of transferring cross-lingual information from the English parser via parallel text, we explore the model training method proposed by Smith and Eisner (2007), which presented a generalization of K function (Abney, 2004), and related it to another semi-supervised learning technique, entropy regularization (Jiao et al., 2006; Mann and Mc-Callum, 2007). The objective K function to be minimized is actually the expected negative log-likelihood:","K = − ∑ i ∑","yi p̃(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi)","= ∑ i D(p̃i||pλ,i) + H(p̃i) (7) where p̃i(·) def","= p̃(·|xi) and pλ,i(·) def","= pλ(·|xi). p̃(y|x) is the “transferring distribution” that reflects our uncertainty about the true labels, and we are trying to learn a parametric model pλ(y|x) by minimizing the K function.","In our scenario, we have a set of aligned parallel data P = {xs","i , xt","i, ai} where ai is the word alignment for the pair of source-target sentences (xs","i , xt","i), and a set of unlabeled sentences of the target language U = {xt","i}. We also have a trained English parsing model pλE (y|x). Then the K in equation (7) can be divided into two cases, according to whether xi belongs to parallel data set P or unlabeled data set U . For the unlabeled examples {xi ∈ U }, some previous studies (e.g., (Abney, 2004)) simply use a uniform distribution over labels (e.g., parses), to reflect that the label is unknown. We follow the method in Smith and Eisner (2007) and take the transferring distribution p̃i to be the actual current belief pλ,i. The total contribution of the unsupervised examples to K then simplifies to KU = ∑","xi∈U H(pλ,i), which may be regarded as the entropy item used to constrain the model’s uncertainty H to be low, as presented in the work on entropy regularization (Jiao et al., 2006; Mann and McCallum, 2007).","But how can we define the transferring distribution for the parallel examples {xt","i ∈ P }? We define the transferring distribution by defining the transferring weight utilizing the English parsing model pλE (y|x) via parallel data with word alignments:","w̃(et",", xt","i) = {","wE(es",", xs","i ),","if et align −→ es","wE(et","delex, xs","i ), otherwise","(8) where wE(·, ·) is the weight function of the English parsing model pλE (y|x), and et","delex is the delexicalized form2","of the edge et",". From the definition of the transferring weight, we can see that, if an edge et","of the target language sentence xt i is aligned to an edge es","of the English sentence xs","i , we transfer the weight of edge et","to the corresponding weight of edge es","in the English parsing model pλE (y|x). If the edge et is not aligned to any edges of the English sentence xs","i , we reduce the edge et","to the delexicalized form and calculate the transferring weight in the English parsing model. There are two advan-","2","The delexicalized form of an edge is an edge for which only delexicalized features are considered. 1339 tages for this definition of the transferring weight. First, by transferring the weight function to the corresponding weight in the well-developed English parsing model, we can project syntactic information across language boundaries. Second, McDonald et al. (2011) demonstrates that parsers with only delexicalized features produce considerably high parsing performance. By reducing unaligned edges to their delexicalized forms, we can still use those delexicalized features, such as part-of-speech tags, for those unaligned edges, and can address problem that automatically generated word alignments include errors.","From the definition of transferring weight in equation (8), the transferring distribution can be defined in the following way:","p̃(y|x) = 1 Z̃(x) ∏","e∈y w̃(e, x) (9) where","Z̃(x) = ∑ y ∏","e∈y w̃(e, x) (10) Due to the normalizing factor Z̃(x), the transferring distribution is a valid one.","We introduce a multiplier γ as a trade-off between the two contributions (parallel and unsupervised) of the objective function K, and the final objective function K′","has the following form:","K′","= − ∑","xi∈P ∑","yi p̃(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi)","+ γ ∑ xi∈U H(pλ,i) = KP + γKU (11) KP and KU are the contributions of the parallel and unsupervised data, respectively. One may regard γ as a Lagrange multiplier that is used to constrain the parser’s uncertainty H to be low, as presented in several studies on entropy regularization (Brand, 1998; Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004; Jiao et al., 2006).","2.3 Algorithms and Complexity for Model Training To train our parsing model, we need to find out the parameters λ that minimize the objective function K′","in equation (11). This optimization problem is typically solved using quasi-Newton numeri-cal methods such as L-BFGS (Nash and Nocedal, 1991), which requires efficient calculation of the objective function and the gradient of the objective function.","The first item (KP ) of the K′","function in equation (11) can be rewritten in the following form:","KP = − ∑","xi∈P [∑","yi p̃(yi|xi) ∑","e∈yi log w(e, xi) − log Z(xi)] (12) and according to equation (1) and (3) the gradient of KP can be written as:","∂KP","∂λj = ∑","xi∈P ∂ p̃(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi)","∂λj","= ∑","xi∈P [ ∑","yi p̃(yi|xi) ∑","e∈yi fj(e, xi)","− ∑","yi pλ(yi|xi) ∑","e∈yi fj(e, xi)]","(13)","According to equation (9), p̃(y|x) can also be factored into the multiplication of the weight of each edge, so both KP and its gradient can be calculated by running the O(n3",") inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979; Paskin, 2001) for projective parsing. For non-projective parsing, the analogy to the inside algorithm is the O(n3",") matrix-tree algorithm based on Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree Theorem, which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant (Koo et al., 2007; Smith and Smith, 2007). The gradient of a determinant may be computed by matrix inversion, so evaluating the gradient again has the same O(n3",") complexity as evaluating the function.","The second item (KU ) of the K′","function in equation (11) is the Shannon entropy of the posterior distribution over parsing trees, and can be written into the following form:","KU = − ∑","xi∈U [∑","yi pλ(yi|xi) ∑","e∈yi log w(e, xi) − log Z(xi)] (14) and the gradient of KU is in the following:","∂KU","∂λj = ∑","xi∈U ∂pλ(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi)","∂λj","= − ∑ yi pλ(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi)Fj (yi, xi)","+ ( ∑ yi pλ(yi|xi) log pλ(yi|xi))","· ( ∑ yi pλ(yi|xi)Fj (yi, xi)) (15) 1340 #sents/#tokens training dev test Version 1.0 de 2,200/30,460 800/12,215 1,000/16,339 es 3,345/94,232 370/10,191 300/8,295 fr 3,312/74,979 366/8,071 300/6,950 ko 5,308/62,378 588/6,545 298/2,917 sv 4,447/66,631","493/9,312 1,219/20,376 Version 2.0 de 14,118/26,4906 800/12,215 1,000/16,339 es 14,138/37,5180 1,569/40,950 300/8,295 fr 14,511/35,1233 1,611/38,328 300/6,950 it 6,389/14,9145 400/9,541 400/9,187 ko 5437/60,621 603/6,438 299/2,631 pt 9,600/23,9012 1,200/29,873 1,198/29,438 sv 4,447/66,631 493/9,312 1,219/20,376 Table 1: Data statistics of two versions of Google Universal Treebanks for the target languages. Similar with the calculation of KP , KU can also be computed by running the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979; Paskin, 2001) for projective parsing. For the gradient of KU , both the two multipliers of the second item in equation (15) can be computed using the same inside-outside algorithm. For the first item in equation (15), an O(n3",") dynamic programming algorithm that is closely related to the forward-backward algorithm (Mann and McCallum, 2007) for the entropy regularized CRF (Jiao et al., 2006) can be used for projective parsing. For non-projective parsing, however, the runtime rises to O(n4","). In this paper, we focus on projective parsing. 2.4 Summary of Our Approach To summarize the description in the previous sections, our approach is performed in the following steps:","1. Train an English parsing model pλE (y|x), which is used to estimate the transferring distribution p̃(y|x).","2.

(ii) Large amounts of parallel text with English on one side. We select target languages based on the availability of these resources. The monolingual treebanks in our experiments are from the Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013), for the reason that the treebanks of different languages in Google Universal Dependency Treebanks have consistent syntactic representations.","The parallel data come from the Europarl corpus version 7 (Koehn, 2005) and Kaist Corpus4",". Taking the intersection of languages in the two kinds of resources yields the following seven languages: French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.","The treebanks from CoNLL shared-tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007) appear to be another reasonable choice. However, previous studies (McDonald et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013) have demonstrated that a homogeneous representation is criti-cal for multilingual language technologies that require consistent cross-lingual analysis for downstream components, and the heterogenous representations used in CoNLL shared-tasks treebanks weaken any conclusion that can be drawn. 4 http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/","index.php/Corpus10 1341 DTP DTP† PTP† -U +U OR de 58.50 58.46 69.21 73.72 74.01 78.64 es 68.07 68.72 72.57 75.32 75.60 82.56 fr 70.14 71.13 74.60 76.65 76.93 83.69 ko 42.37 43.57 53.72 59.72 59.94 89.85 sv 70.56 70.59 75.87 78.91 79.27 85.59 Ave 61.93 62.49 69.19 72.86 73.15 84.67 Table 3: UAS for two versions of our approach, together with baseline and oracle systems on Google Universal Treebanks version 1.0. “Ave” is the macro-average across the five languages.","For comparison with previous studies, nevertheless, we also run experiments on CoNLL treebanks (see Section 4.4 for more details). We evaluate our approach on three target languages from CoNLL shared task treebanks, which do not appear in Google Universal Treebanks. The three languages are Danish, Dutch and Greek. So totally we have ten target languages. The parallel data for these three languages are also from the Europarl corpus version 7. 3.2 Word Alignments In our approach, word alignments for the parallel text are required. We perform word alignments with the open source GIZA++ toolkit5",". The parallel corpus was preprocessed in standard ways, selecting sentences with the length in the range from 3 to 100. Then we run GIZA++ with the default setting to generate word alignments in both directions. We then make the intersection of the word alignments of two directions to generate one-to-one alignments. 3.3 Part-of-Speech Tagging Several features in our parsing model involve part-of-speech (POS) tags of the input sentences. The set of POS tags needs to be consistent across languages and treebanks. For this reason we use the universal POS tag set of Petrov et al. (2011). This set consists of the following 12 coarsegrained tags: NOUN (nouns), VERB (verbs), ADJ (adjectives), ADV (adverbs), PRON (pronouns), DET (determiners), ADP (prepositions or postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), PUNC (punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all for other categories such as abbreviations or foreign words).","POS tags are not available for parallel data in the Europarl and Kaist corpus, so we need to pro-","5","https://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/ DTP† PTP† -U +U OR de 58.56 69.77 73.92 74.30 81.65 es 68.72 73.22 75.21 75.53 83.92 fr 71.13 74.75 76.14 76.53 83.51 it 70.74 76.08 77.55 77.74 85.47 ko 38.55 43.34 59.71 59.89 90.42 pt 69.82 74.59 76.30 76.65 85.67 sv 70.59 75.87 78.91 79.27 85.59 Ave 64.02 69.66 73.96 74.27 85.18 Table 4: UAS for two versions of our approach, together with baseline and oracle systems on Google Universal Treebanks version 2.0. “Ave” is the macro-average across the seven languages. vide the POS tags for these data.

For the purpose of evaluation of our approach and comparison with previous work, we need to exploit the gold POS tags to train the POS taggers. As part-of-speech tags are also a form of syntactic analysis, this assumption weakens the applicability of our approach. Fortunately, some recently proposed POS taggers, such as the POS tagger of Das and Petrov (2011), rely only on labeled training data for English and the same kind of parallel text in our approach.

We train our parsing model with different numbers of parallel sentences to analyze the influence of the amount of parallel data on the parsing performance of our approach. The parallel data sets contain 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 parallel sentences, respectively. We randomly extract parallel sentences from each corpora, and smaller data sets are subsets of larger ones. Table 2 shows the number of tokens in the parallel data used in the experiments. 4.2 System performance and comparison on Google Universal Treebanks For the comparison of parsing performance, we run experiments on the following systems:","DTP: The direct transfer parser (DTP) proposed by McDonald et al. (2011), who train a delexicalized parser on English labeled training data with no lexical features, then apply this parser to parse target languages directly. It is based on the transition-based dependency parsing paradigm (Nivre, 2008). We directly cite the results reported in McDonald et al. (2013). In addition to their original results, we also report results by reimplementing the direct transfer parser based on the first-order projective dependency parsing model (McDonald et al., 2005a) (DTP†).","PTP The projected transfer parser (PTP) de-scribed in McDonald et al. (2011). The results of the projected transfer parser re-implemented by us is marked as “PTP†”.","-U: Our approach training on only parallel data without unlabeled data for the target language. The parallel data set for each language contains 20,000 sentences.","+U: Our approach training on both parallel and unlabeled data. The parallel data sets are the ones contains 20,000 sentences.","OR: the supervised first-order projective dependency parsing model (McDonald et al., 2005a), trained on the original treebanks with maximum likelihood estimation (equation 6). One may regard this system as an oracle of transfer parsing.","Parsing accuracy is measured with unlabeled attachment score (UAS): the percentage of words with the correct head.","Table 3 and Table 4 shows the parsing results of our approach, together with the results of the baseline systems and the oracle, on version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Universal Treebanks, respectively. Our approaches significantly outperform all the baseline systems across all the seven target languages. For the results on Google Universal Treebanks version 1.0, the improvement on average over the projected transfer paper (PTP†) is 3.96% 1343 and up to 6.22% for Korean and 4.80% for German. For the other three languages, the improve-ments are remarkable, too — 2.33% for French, 3.03% for Spanish and 3.40% for Swedish. By adding entropy regularization from unlabeled data, our full model achieves average improvement of 0.29% over the “-U” setting. Moreover, our approach considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised dependency parsers, whose average UAS is 84.67%. For the results on treebanks version 2.0, we can get similar observation and draw the same conclusion. 4.3 Effect of the Amount of Parallel Text Table 5 illustrates the UAS of our approach trained on different amounts of parallel data, together with the results of the projected transfer parser re-implemented by us (PTP†). We run two versions of our approach for each of the parallel data sets, one with unlabeled data (+U) and the other without them (-U). From table 5 we can get three observations. First, even the parsers trained with only 500 parallel sentences achieve considerably high parsing accuracies (average 70.10% for version 1.0 and 71.59% for version 2.0). This demonstrates that our approach does not rely on a large amount of parallel data. Second, when gradually increasing the amount of parallel data, the parsing performance continues improving. Third, entropy regularization with unlabeled data makes modest improvement on parsing performance over the parsers without unlabeled data. This proves the effectiveness of the entropy regularization from unlabeled data. 4.4 Experiments on CoNLL Treebanks To make a thorough empirical comparison with previous studies, we also evaluate our system without unlabeled data (-U) on treebanks from CoNLL shared task on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007). To facilitate comparison, we use the same eight Indo-European languages as target languages: Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish, and same experimental setup as McDonald et al. (2011). We report both the results of the direct transfer and projected transfer parsers directly cited from McDonald et al. (2011) (DTP and PTP) and re-implemented by us (DTP†and PTP†).","Table 6 gives the results comparing the model without unlabeled data (-U) presented in this work DMV DTP DTP† PTP PTP† -U OR da 33.4 45.9 46.8 48.2 50.0 50.1 87.1 de 18.0 47.2 46.0 50.9 52.4 57.3 87.0 el 39.9 63.9 62.9 66.8 65.3 67.4 82.3 es 28.5 53.3 54.4 55.8 59.9 60.3 83.6 it 43.1 57.7 59.9 60.8 63.4 64.0 83.9 nl 38.5 60.8 60.7 67.8 66.5 68.2 78.2 pt 20.1 69.2 71.1 71.3 74.8 75.1 87.2 sv 44.0 58.3 60.3 61.3 62.8 66.7 88.0 Ave 33.2 57.0 57.8 60.4 61.9 63.6 84.7 Table 6: Parsing results on treebanks from CoNLL shared tasks for eight target languages.

The results of unsupervised DMV model (Klein and Manning, 2004) are from Table 1 of McDonald et al. (2011). Our approach outperforms all these baseline systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the eight languages.","In order to compare with more previous methods, we also report parsing performance on sentences of length 10 or less after punctuation has been removed. Table 7 shows the results of our system and the results of baseline systems. “USR†” is the weakly supervised system of Naseem et al. (2010). “PGI” is the phylogenetic grammar induction model of Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010). Both the results of the two systems are cited from Table 4 of McDonald et al. (2011).

It should be noted that the “NMG” system utilizes more than one helper languages.

Some systems’ results for certain target languages are not available as marked by —. 4.5.1 Non-Projective Parsing As mentioned in section 2.3, the runtime to compute KU and its gradient is O(n4","). One reasonable speedup, as presented in Smith and Eisner (2007), is to replace Shannon entropy with Rényi entropy. The Rényi entropy is parameterized by α:","Rα(p) = 1 1 − α log (∑","y p(y)α) (16) With Rényi entropy, the computation of KU and its gradient is O(n3","), even for non-projective case.","4.5.2 Higher-Order Models for Projective Parsing Our learning framework can be extended to higher-order dependency parsing models. For example, if we want to make our model capable of utilizing more contextual information, we can extend our transferring weight to higher-order parts:","w̃(pt",", xt","i) = {","wE(ps",", xs","i ),","if pt align −→ ps","wE(pt","delex, xs","i ), otherwise","(17) where p is a small part of tree y that has limited interactions. For projective parsing, several algorithms (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007; Koo and Collins, 2010; Ma and Zhao, 2012) have been proposed to solve the model training problems (calculation of objective function and gradient) for different factorizations. 4.5.3 IGT Data One possible direction to improve our approach is to replace parallel text with Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) (Lewis and Xia, 2010), which is a semi-structured data type encoding more syntactic information than parallel data. By using IGT Data, not only can we obtain more accurate word alignments, but also extract useful cross-lingual information for the resource-poor language."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we propose an unsupervised projective dependency parsing approach for resource-poor languages, using existing resources from a resource-rich source language. By presenting a model training framework, our approach can utilize parallel text to estimate transferring distribution with the help of a well-developed resource-rich language dependency parser, and use unlabeled data as entropy regularization. The experimental results on three data sets across ten target languages show that our approach achieves significant improvement over previous studies."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. BCS-0748919.
