        "Twitter becomes one of the most popular social networking sites, which allows the users to read and post messages (i.e. tweets) up to 140 characters. Among the great varieties of topics, people in Twitter tend to express their opinions for the brands, celebrities, products and public events. As a result, it attracts much attention to estimate the crowd’s sentiments in Twitter.",
        "For the tweets, our task is to classify their sentiments for a given target as positive, negative, and neutral. People may mention several entities (or targets) in one tweet, which affects the availabilities for most of existing methods. For example, the tweet “ @ballmer: windows phone is better than ios!” has three targets (@ballmer, windows phone, and ios). The user expresses neutral, positive, and negative sentiments for them, respectively. If target information is ignored, it is difficult to obtain the correct sentiment for a specified target. For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al. (2011)",
        "∗",
        "Contribution during internship at Microsoft Research. show that about 40% of errors are caused by not considering the targets in classification.",
        "The features used in traditional learning-based methods (Pang et al., 2002; Nakagawa et al., 2010) are independent to the targets, hence the results are computed despite what the targets are. Hu and Liu (2004) regard the features of products as targets, and sentiments for them are heuristically determined by the dominant opinion words. Jiang et al. (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets.",
        "In this paper, we mainly focus on integrating target information with Recursive Neural Network (RNN) to leverage the ability of deep learning models. The neural models use distributed representation (Hinton, 1986; Rumelhart et al., 1986; Bengio et al., 2003) to automatically learn features for target-dependent sentiment classification. RNN utilizes the recursive structure of text, and it has achieved state-of-the-art sentiment analysis results for movie review dataset (Socher et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013). The recursive neural models employ the semantic composition functions, which enables them to handle the complex compositionalities in sentiment analysis.",
        "Specifically, we propose a framework which learns to propagate the sentiments of words towards the target depending on context and syntactic structure. We employ a novel adaptive multi-compositionality layer in recursive neural network, which is named as AdaRNN (Dong et al., 2014). It consists of more than one composition functions, and we model the adaptive sentiment propagations as learning distributions over these composition functions. We automatically learn the composition functions and how to select them from supervisions, instead of choosing them heuristically or by hand-crafted rules. AdaRNN 49 determines how to propagate the sentiments towards the target and handles the negation or in-tensification phenomena (Taboada et al., 2011) in sentiment analysis. In addition, we introduce a manually annotated dataset, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The experimental results suggest that our approach yields better performances than the baseline methods."

Adaptive Recursive Neural Network is proposed to propagate the sentiments of words to the target node. We model the adaptive sentiment propagations as semantic compositions. The computation process is conducted in a bottom-up manner, and the vector representations are computed recursively. After we obtain the representation of target node, a classifier is used to predict the sentiment label according to the vector.",
        "In Section 3.1, we show how to build recursive structure for target using the dependency parsing results. In Section 3.2, we propose Adaptive Recursive Neural Network and use it for target-dependent sentiment analysis. 3.1 Build Recursive Structure The dependency tree indicates the dependency relations between words. As described above, we propagate the sentiments of words to the target. Hence the target is placed at the root node to combine with its connected words recursively. The dependency relation types are remained to guide the sentiment propagations in our model.

        "As illustrated in the Algorithm 1, we recursively convert the dependency tree starting from the target node. We find all the words connected to the target, and these words are combined with target node by certain order. Every combination is considered as once propagation of sentiments. If the target is head of the connected words, the target vector is combined as the right node; if otherwise, it is combined as the left node. This ensures the 50 child nodes in a certain order. We use two rules to determine the order of combinations: (1) the words whose head is the target in dependency tree are first combined, and then the rest of connected words are combined; (2) if the first rule cannot determine the order, the connected words are sorted by their positions in sentence from right to left. Notably, the conversion is performed recursively for the connected words and the dependency relation types are remained. Figure 2 shows the converted results for different targets in one sentence. 3.2 AdaRNN: Adaptive Recursive Neural Network RNN employs one global matrix to linearly combine the elements of vectors. Sometimes it is challenging to obtain a single powerful function to model the semantic composition, which motivates us to propose AdaRNN. The basic idea of AdaRNN is to use more than one composition functions and adaptively select them depending on the linguistic tags and the combined vectors. The model learns to propagate the sentiments of words by using the different composition functions.",
        "Figure 2 shows the computation process for the example sentence “ windows is better than ios”, where the user expresses positive sentiment towards windows and negative sentiment to ios. For the targets, the order of compositions and the dependency types are different. AdaRNN adaptively selects the composition functions g1 . . . gC depending on the child vectors and the linguistic types. Thus it is able to determine how to propagate the sentiments of words towards the target.",

This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al., 2011) used to extract the target-dependent features.

Further, the results of SVM-conn illustrate that using the words which have paths to target as bag-of-words features does not perform well.",

Although the dependency results are also not precise enough, the composition selection is automatically learned from data.
