We propose a probabilistic approach to generating code-mixed text as an L2 technique for increasing retention in adult lexical learning through reading. Our model that takes as input a bilingual dictionary and an English text, and generates a code-switched text that optimizes a defined “learnability” metric by construct-ing a factor graph over lexical mentions.

Yet, it is not uncommon to find yourself surrounded by speakers of a foreign language and instinctively pick up words and phrases without ever seeing the defini-tion in your native tongue. Hearing “pass le sale please” at the dinner table from your in-laws visiting from abroad, is unlikely to make you think twice about passing the salt. Humans are extraordinarily good at inferring meaning from context, whether this context is your physical surrounding, or the surrounding text in the paragraph of the word that you don’t yet understand.","Recently, a novel method of L2 language teaching had been shown effective in improving adult lexical acquisition rate and retention 1",". This tech-","1","authors’ unpublished work nique relies on a phenomenon that elicits a natural simulation of L1-like vocabulary learning in adults — significantly closer to L1 learning for L2 learners than any model studied previously. By in-fusing foreign words into text in the learner’s native tongue into low-surprisal contexts, the lexical acquisition process is facilitated naturally and non-obtrusively. Incidentally, this phenomenon occurs “in the wild” and is termed code-switching or code-mixing, and refers to the linguistic pattern of bilingual speakers swapping words and phrases between two languages during speech. While this phenomenon had received significant attention from both a socio-linguistic (Milroy and Muysken, 1995) and theoretical linguistic perspectives (Belazi et al., 1994; Bhatt, 1997) (including some computational studies), only recently has it been hypothesizes that “code-switching” is a marking of bilingual proficiency, rather than deficiency (Genesee, 2001).","Until recently it was widely believed that incidental lexical acquisition through reading can only occur for words that occur at sufficient density in a single text, so as to elicit the “noticing” effect needed for lexical acquisition to occur (Cobb, 2007). Recent neurophysiological findings, how-ever, indicate that even a single incidental exposure to a novel word in a sufficiently constrained context is sufficient to trigger an early integra-tion of the word in the brain’s semantic network (Borovsky et al., 2012).","An approach explored in this paper, and motivated by the above findings, exploits “constrain-ing” contexts in text to introduce novel words. A state-of-the-art approach for generating such text is based on an expert annotator whose job is to decide which words to “switch out” with novel foreign words (from hereon we will refer to the “switched out” word as the source word and to the “switched in” word as the target word). Consequently the process is labor-intensive and leads to 562 a “one size fits all solution” that is insensitive to the learner’s skill level or vocabulary proficiency. This limitation is also cited in literature as a significant roadblock to the widespread adaptation of graded reading series (Hill, 2008). A reading-based tool that follows the same principle, i.e. by systematic exposure of a learner to an incrementally more challenging text, will result in more effective learning (Lantolf and Appel, 1994).","To address the above limitation, we develop an approach for automatically generating such “code-switched” text with an explicit goal of maximizing the lexical acquisition rate in adults. Our method is based on a global optimization approach that incorporates a “knowledge model” of a user with the content of the text, to generate a sequence of lexical “switches”. To facilitate the selection of “switch points”, we learn a discriminative model for predicting switch point locations on a corpus that we collect for this purpose (and release to the community). Below is a high-level outline of this paper.","• We formalize our approach within a probabilistic graphical model framework, inference in which yields “code-switched” text that maximizes a surrogate to the acquisition rate objective.","• We compare this global method to several baseline techniques, including the strong “high-frequency” baseline.","• We analyze the operating range in which our model is effective and motivate the nearfuture extension of this approach with the proposed improvements."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Our proposed approach to the computational generation of code-switched text, for the purpose of L2 pedagogy, is influenced by a number of fields that studied aspects of this phenomenon from distinct perspectives. In this section, we briefly describe a motivation from the areas of socio- and psycho- linguistics and language pedagogy research that indicate the promise of this approach. 2.1 Code-switching as a natural phenomenon Code-switching (or code-mixing) is a widely studied phenomenon that received significant attention over the course of the last three decades, across the disciplines of sociolinguistics, theoretical and psycholinguistics and even literary and cultural studies (predominantly in the domain of Spanish-English code-switching) (Lipski, 2005).","Code-switching that occurs naturally in bilingual populations, and especially in children, has for a long time been considered a marking of incompetency in the second language. A more recent view on this phenomenon, however, suggests that due to the underlying syntactic complexity of code-switching, code-switching is actually a marking of bilingual fluency (Genesee, 2001). More recently, the idea of employing code-switching in the classroom, in a form of conversation-based exercises, has attracted the attention of multiple researchers and educators (Moodley, 2010; Macaro, 2005), yielding promis-ing results in an elementary school study in South-Africa.","2.2 Computational Approaches to Code-switching Additionally, there has been a limited number of studies of the computational approaches to code-switching, and in particular code-switched text generation. Solorio and Liu (2008), record and transcribe a corpus of Spanish-English code-mixed conversation to train a generative model (Naive Bayes) for the task of predicting code-switch points in conversation. Additionally they test their trained model in its ability to generate code-switched text with convincing results. Build-ing on their work, (Adel et al., 2012) employ additional features and a recurrent network language model for modeling code-switching in conversational speech. Adel and collegues (2011) propose a statistical machine translation-based approach for generating code-switched text. We note, how-ever, that the primary goal of these methods is in the faithful modeling of the natural phenomenon of code-switching in bilingual populations, and not as a tool for language teaching. While useful in generating coherent, syntactically constrained code-switched texts in its own right, none of these methods explicitly consider code-switching as a vehicle for teaching language, and thus do not take on an optimization-based view with an objective of improving lexical acquisition through the reading of the generated text. More recently, and concurrently with our work, Google’s Language Immersion app employs the principle of 563 code-switching for language pedagogy, by generating code-switched web content, and allowing its users to tune it to their skill level. It does not, how-ever, seem to model the user explicitly, nor is it clear if it performs any optimization in generating the text, as no studies have been published to date.","2.3 Computational Approaches to Sentence Simplification Although not explicitly for teaching language, computational approaches that facilitate accessibility to texts that might otherwise be too difficult for its readers, either due to physical or learning disabilities, or language barriers, are relevant. In the recent work of (Kauchak, 2013), for example demonstrates an approach to increasing readability of texts by learning from unsimplified texts. Approaches in this area span methods for simplify-ing lexis (Yatskar et al., 2010; Biran et al., 2011), syntax (Siddharthan, 2006; Siddharthan et al., 2004), discourse properties (Hutchinson, 2005), and making technical terminology more accessible to non-experts (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007). While the resulting texts are of great potential aid to language learners and may implicitly improve upon a reader’s language proficiency, they do not explicitly attempt to promote learning as an objective in generating the simplified text. 2.4 Recent Neurophysiological findings Evidence for the potential effectiveness of code-switching for language acquisition, stem from the recent findings of (Borovsky et al., 2012), who have shown that even a single exposure to a novel word in a constrained context, results in the inte-gration of the word within your existing semantic base, as indicated by a change in the N400 electrophysiological response recorded from the subjects’ scalps. N400 ERP marker has been found to correlate with the semantic “expectedness” of a word (Kutas and Hillyard, 1984), and is believed to be an early indicator of word learning. Further-more, recent work of (Frank et al., 2013), show that word surprisal predicts N400, providing concrete motivation for artificial manipulation of text to explicitly elicit word learning through natural reading, directly motivating our approach. Prior to the above findings, it was widely believed that for evoking “incidental” word learning through reading alone, the word must appear with sufficiently high frequency within the text, such as to elicit the “noticing” effect — a prerequisite to lexical acquisition (Schmidt and Schmidt, 1995; Cobb, 2007)."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["3.1 Overview The formulation of our model is primarily motivated by two hypotheses that have been validated experimentally in the cognitive science literature. We re-state these hypotheses in the language of “surprisal”:","1. Inserting a target word into a low surprisal context increases the rate of that word’s inte-gration into a learner’s lexicon.","2. Multiple exposures to the word in low surprisal contexts increases rate of that word’s integration.","Hypothesis 1 is supported by evidence from (Borovsky et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2013), and hypothesis 2 is supported by evidence from (Schmidt and Schmidt, 1995). We adopt the term “low-surprisal” context to identify contexts (e.g. ngrams) that are highly predictive of the target word (e.g. trailing word in the n-gram). The motivation stems from the recent evidence (Frank et al., 2013) that low-surprisal contexts affect the N400 response and thus correlate with word acquisition. To realize a “code-switched” mixture that adheres maximally to the above postulates, it is self-evident that a non-trivial optimization problem must be solved. For example, naively selecting a few words that appear in low-surprisal contexts may facilitate their acquisition, but at the expense of other words within the same context that may appear in a larger number of low-surprisal contexts further in the text.","To address this problem, we approach it with a formulation of a factor graph that takes global structure of the text into account. Factor graph for-malism allows us to capture local features of individual contexts, such as lexical and syntactic surprisal, while inducing dependencies between consequent “switching decisions” in the text. Maximizing likelihood of the joint probability under the factorization of this graph yields an optimal sequence of these “switching decisions” in the entirety of the text. Maximizing joint likelihood, as we will show in the next section, is a surrogate to maximizing the probability of the learner acquir-ing novel words through the process of reading the generated text. 564 wi Known + Constrained Unknown + Constrained Unknown + Unconstrained Known + Unconstrained . . . w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w|V | KNOW DON ’ T  KNOW θi k Meaning of malhela?

Probabilistic learner model (PLM) provides the current value of the belief in the learner’s knowledge of any given word. Local contextual model provides the value of the belief in learning the word from the context alone. Upon exposure of the learner to the word in the given context, PLM is updated with the posterior belief in the user’s knowledge of the word. 3.2 Language Learner Model A simplified model of the learner, that we shall term a Probabilistic Learner Model (PLM) serves as a basis for our approach. PLM is a model of a learner’s lexical knowledge at any given time. PLM models the learner as a vector of independent Bernoulli distributions, where each component represents a probability of the learner know-ing the corresponding word. We motivate a probabilistic approach by taking the perspective of measuring our belief in the learner’s knowledge of any given word, rather than the learner’s uncertainty in own knowledge. Formally, we can fully specify this model for learner i as follows:","Ui = (πi 0, πi 1, . . . , πi","|V |) (1)","where V is the vocabulary set — identical across all users, and πi","j is our degree of belief in the learner i’s knowledge of a target word wj ∈ V . Statistical estimation techniques exist for estimating an individual’s vocabulary size, such as (Bhat and Sproat, 2009; Beglar, 2010), and can be di-565 rectly employed for estimating the parameters of this model as our prior belief about user i’s knowledge.","The primary motivation behind a probabilistic user model, is to provide a mechanism for updating these probabilities as the user progresses through her reading. Maximizing the parameters of the PLM under a given finite span of code-switched text, thus, provides a handle for generating optimal code-switched content. Additionally, a probabilistic approach allows for a natural inte-gration of the user model with the uncertainty in other components of the system, such as uncertainty in determining the degree of constraint imposed by the context, and in bitext alignment. 3.3 Model overview At the high level, as illustrated in Figure 1, our approach integrates the model of the learner (PLM) with the local contextual features to update the PLM parameters incrementally as the learner progresses through the text. The fundamental as-sumption behind our approach is that the learner’s knowledge of a given word after observing it in a sentence is a function of 1) the learner’s previous knowledge of the word, prior to observing it in a given sentence and 2) a degree of constraint that a given context imposes on the meaning of the novel word, and is directly related to the surprisal of novel word in that context. Broadly, as the learner progresses from one sentence to the next, exposing herself to more novel words, the updated parameters of the language model in turn guide the selection of new “switch-points” for replacing source words with the target foreign words. In practice, however, this process is carried out implicitly and off-line by optimizing the estimated progress of the learner’s PLM, without dynamic feedback. Next, we describe the model in detail. 3.4 Switching Factor Graph Model To aid in the specification of the factor graph structure, we introduce new terminology. Because the PLM is updated progressively, we will refer to the parameters of the PLM for a given word wi after observing its kth","appearance (instance) in the text, as the learner’s state of knowledge of that word, and denote it as a binary random variable zi","k.","P (zi k = 1) =    Probability that word wi ∈ V is understood on kth","exposure","Without explicit testing of the user, this variable is hidden. We can view the prior learning model as the parameters of the vector of random variables (z0","0, z1","0, . . . z|V |","0 ).","The key to our approach is in how the parameters of these hidden variables are updated from repeated exposures to words in various contexts. Intuitively, an update to the parameter of zi","k from zi k−1 occurs after the learner observes word wi in a context (this may be an n-gram, an entire sentence or paragraph containing wi, but we will restrict our attention to fixed-length n-grams). In-tuitively an update to the parameter of zi","k−1 will depend on how “constrained” the meaning of wi is in the given context. We will refer to it as the “learnability”, denoted by Lk","i , of word wi on its kth","appearance, given its context. Formally, we will define “learnability” as follows:","P (Li","k = 1|wi , w\\i",", z\\i","k ) =","P (constrained(wi) = 1|w) ∏ i̸=j P (zj","k = 1) (2)","where w\\i","represents the set of words that comprise the context window of wi, not including wi, and z\\i","k are the states corresponding to each of the words in w\\i",". P (constrained(wi) = 1|w) is a real value (scaled between 0 and 1) that represents the degree of constraint imposed on the meaning of word wi by its context. This value comes from a binary prediction model trained to predict the “predictability” of a word in its context, and is based on the dataset that we collected (described later in the paper). Generally, this value may come directly from the surprisal quantity given by a language model, or may incorporate additional features that are found informative in predicting the constraint on the word. Finally, the quantity is weighted by the parameters of the state variables corresponding to the words other than wi contained in the context. This encodes an intuition that a degree of predictability of a given word given its context is related to the learner’s knowledge of the other words in that context. If, for example, in the sentence “pass me the salt and pepper, please”, both “salt” and “pepper” are substituted with their foreign translations that the learner is unlikely to know, it’s equally unlikely that she will learn them after being exposed to this context, as the context itself will not offer sufficient 566 information for both words to be inferred simultaneously. On the other hand, substituting “salt” and “pepper” individually, is likely to make it much easier to infer the meaning of the other."]},{"title":"z","paragraphs":["i k−1"]},{"title":"z","paragraphs":["i k"]},{"title":"Lik","paragraphs":["Figure 2: A noisy-OR combination of the learner’s previous state of knowledge of the word zi","k−1 and the word’s “learnability” in the observed context Li k The updated parameter of zi","k is obtained from a","noisy-OR combination of the parameters of zi","k−1","and Li k:","P (zi","k = 1|zi","k−1, Li","k) =","1 − [1 − P (Li k = 1)][1 − P (zk−1 = 1)]","A noisy-OR-based CPD provides a convenient and tractable approximation in capturing the in-tended intuition: updated state of knowledge of a given word will increase if the word is observed in a “good” context, or if the learner already knows the word.","Combining Equation 2 for each word in the context using the noisy-OR, the updated state for word wi will now be conditioned on zi","k−1, z\\i","k , wk. Because of the dependence of each z in the context on all other hidden variables in that context, we can capture the dependence using a single factor per context, with all of the z variables taking part in a clique, whose dimension is the size of the context.","We will now introduce a dual interpretation of the z variables: as “switching” variables that decide whether a given word will be replaced with its translation in the foreign language. If, for example, all of the words have high probability of being known by a learner, than maximizing the joint likelihood of the model will result in most of the words “switched-out” — a desired result. For an arbitrary prior PLM and the input text, maximizing joint likelihood will result in the selection of “switched-out” words that have the highest final probability of being “known” by the learner. 3.5 Inference The problem of selecting “switch-points” reduces to the problem of inference in the resulting factor graph. Unfortunately, without a fairly strong constraint on the collocation of switched words, the resulting graph will contain loops, requiring techniques of approximate inference. To find the optimal settings of the z variables, we apply the loopy max-sum algorithm. While variants of loopy belief propagation, in general, are not guaranteed to converge, we found that the convergence does in-deed occur in our experiments. 3.6 Predicting “predictable” words We carried out experiments to determine which words are likely to be inferred from their context. The collected data-set is then used to train a logistic regression classifier to predict which words are likely to be easily inferred from their context. We believe that this dataset may also be useful to researchers in studying related phenomena, and thus make it publicly available.","For this task, we focus only on the following context features for predicting the “predictability” of words: n-gram probability, vector-space similarity score, coreferring mentions. N-gram probability and vector-space similarity 2","score are all computed within a fixed-size window of the word (trigrams using Microsoft N-gram service). Coreference feature is a binary feature which indicates whether the word has a co-referring mention in a 3-sentence window preceding a given context (obtained using Stanford’s CoreNLP package). We train L2-regularized logistic regression to predict a binary label L ∈ {Constrained, Unconstrained} using a crowd-sourced corpus described below. 3.7 Corpus Construction For collecting data about which words are likely to be “predicted” given their content, we developed an Amazon Mechanical Turk task that presented turkers with excerpts of a short story (English translation of “The Man who Repented” by","2","we employ C&W word embeddings from http:// metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/ 567 wi wj wi wi wj wj wk wi S 1 S 2 S 3 S 4 S 5 S 6"]},{"title":"Original Text Factor GraphMapping","paragraphs":["f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 zi 0 zi 1 zi 2 zi 3zj","0 zj 1 zj 2 zk","0 Figure 3: Sequence of sentences in the text (left) is mapped into a factor graph, whose nodes correspond to specific occurences of individual words, connected in a clique corresponding to a context in which the word occurs.

Turkers were asked to select the sentence that “made the most sense”. An example of the sentences presented during the test: Example 1 ✓ My edzino loves to go shopping every weekend.

Gener-ating code-switched text by replacing high frequency content words, thus, in general is a simple and viable approach for generating effective reading-based L2 curriculum aids. However, this method is fundamentally less flexible than the optimization-based method proposed in this paper, for several reasons:","• The optimization-based method explicitly models the learner and thus generates code-switched text progressively more fit for a given individual, even across a sequence of multiple texts. A frequency-based baseline alone would generate content at approximately the same level of difficulty consistently, with the pattern that words that tend to have high frequency in the natural language in general to be the ones that are “switched-out” most often.","• An optimization-based approach is able to elicit higher recall in low frequency words, as the mechanism for their selection is driven by the context in which these words appear, rather than frequency alone, favoring those that are learned more readily through context. Moreover, the proposed method in this paper is extensible to more sophisticated learner models, with a potential to surpass the results presented here. Another worthwhile applica-tion of this method is as a nested component within a larger optimization-based tool, that in addition to generating code-switched text as demonstrated here, aids in selecting content (such as popular books) as units in the code-switched curriculum."]},{"title":"7 Future Work","paragraphs":["In this work we demonstrated a pilot implementation of a model-based, optimization-based approach to content generation for assisting in the reading-based L2 language acquisition. Our approach is based on static optimization, and while it would, in theory progress in difficulty with more reading, its open-loop nature precludes it from maintaining an accurate model of the learner in the long-term. For generating effecting L2 content, it is important that the user be kept in a “zone of proximal development” — a tight region where the level of the taught content is at just the right difficulty. Maintaining an accurate internal model of the learner is the single most important requirement for achieving this functionality. Closed-loop learning, with active user feedback is, thus, going to be functionally critical component of any system of this type that is designed to function in the long-term.","Additionally, our approach is currently a proof-of-concept of an automated method for generating content for assisted L2 acquisition, and is limited to artificial language and only isolated lexical items. The next step would be to integrate bitext alignment across texts in two natural languages, inevitably introducing another stochastic component into the pipeline. Extending this method to larger units, like chunks and simple grammar is another important avenue along which we are taking this work. Early results from concurrent research indicate that “code-switched based” method proposed here is also effective in eliciting acquisition of multi-word chunks."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Heike Adel, Ngoc Thang Vu, Franziska Kraus, Tim Schlippe, Haizhou Li, and Tanja Schultz. 2012.
