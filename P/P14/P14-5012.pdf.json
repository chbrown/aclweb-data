        "In this demonstration we present WoSIT, an API for Word Sense Induction (WSI) algorithms. The toolkit provides implementations of existing graph-based WSI algorithms, but can also be extended with new algorithms. The main mission of WoSIT is to provide a framework for the extrinsic evaluation of WSI algorithms, also within end-user applications such as Web search result clustering and diversification."

        "The Web is by far the world’s largest information archive, whose content – made up of billions of Web pages – is growing exponentially. Unfortunately the retrieval of any given piece of information is an arduous task which challenges even prominent search engines such as those developed by Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft. Even today, such systems still find themselves up against the lexical ambiguity issue, that is, the linguistic property due to which a single word may convey different meanings.",
        "It has been estimated that around 4% of Web queries and 16% of the most frequent queries are ambiguous (Sanderson, 2008). A major issue as-sociated with the lexical ambiguity phenomenon on the Web is the low number of query words submitted by Web users to search engines. A possible solution to this issue is the diversification of search results obtained by maximizing the dissimilarity of the top-ranking Web pages returned to the user (Agrawal et al., 2009; Ashwin Swaminathan and Kirovski, 2009). Another solution consists of clustering Web search results by way of clustering engines such as Carrot1",
        "and Yippy2",
        "and presenting them to the user grouped by topic.",

        "http://yippy.com",
        "Diversification and Web clustering algorithms, however, do not perform any semantic analysis of search results, clustering them solely on the basis of their lexical similarity. Recently, it has been shown that the automatic acquisition of the meanings of a word of interest, a task referred to as Word Sense Induction, can be successfully integrated into search result clustering and diversification (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013) so as to outperform non-semantic state-of-the-art Web clustering systems.",
        "In this demonstration we describe a new toolkit for Word Sense Induction, called WoSIT, which i) provides ready implementations of existing WSI algorithms; ii) can be extended with additional WSI algorithms; iii) enables the integration of WSI algorithms into search result clustering and diversification, thereby providing an extrinsic evaluation tool. As a result the toolkit enables the objective comparison of WSI algorithms within an end-user application in terms of the degree of diversification of the search results of a given ambiguous query."

        "In Figure 1 we show the workflow of the WoSIT toolkit, composed of three main phases: WSI; semantically-enhanced search result clustering and diversification; evaluation. Given a target query q whose meanings we want to automatically acquire, the toolkit first builds a graph forq, obtained either from a co-occurrence database, or constructed programmatically by using any user-provided input. The co-occurrence graph is then input to a WSI algorithm, chosen from among those available in the toolkit or implemented by the user. As a result, a set of word clusters is produced. This concludes the first phase of the WoSIT workflow. Then, the word clusters produced are used for assigning meanings to the search results returned by a search engine for the query q, i.e. search result disambiguation.

Finally, during the third phase, we apply the evaluation module which performs an evaluation of the search result clustering quality and the diversification performance.",
        "We now describe in detail the three main phases of WoSIT. 2.1 Word Sense Induction The first phase of WoSIT consists of the automatic identification of the senses of a query of interest, i.e. the task of Word Sense Induction. Although WoSIT enables the integration of custom implementations which can potentially work with any WSI paradigm, the toolkit provides ready-to-use implementations of several graph-based algorithms that work with word co-occurrences. All these algorithms carry out WSI in two steps: co-occurrence graph construction (Section 2.1.1) and discovery of word senses (Section 2.1.2). 2.1.1 Co-occurrence graph construction Given a target query q, we build a co-occurrence graph Gq = (V, E) such that V is the set of words co-occurring with q and E is the set of undirected edges, each denoting a co-occurrence between pairs of words in V . In Figure 2 we show an example of a co-occurrence graph for the target word excalibur.",
        "WoSIT enables the creation of the co-occurrence graph either programmatically, by adding edges and vertices according to any user-specific algorithm, or starting from the statistics for co-occurring words obtained from a co-occurrence database (created, e.g., from a text corpus, as was done by Di Marco and Navigli (2013)). In either case, weights for edges have to be provided in terms of the correlation strength between pairs of words (e.g. using Dice, Jaccard or other co-occurrence measures).",
        "The information about the co-occurrence database, e.g. a MySQL database, is provided programmatically or via parameters in the properties configuration file (db.properties). The co-occurrence database has to follow a given schema provided in the toolkit documentation. An additional configuration file (wosit.properties) also allows the user to specify additional constraints, e.g. the minimum weight value of co-occurrence (the wordGraph.minWeight parameter) to be added as edges to the graph.",
        "The graphs produced can also be saved to binary (i.e. serialized) or text file: g.saveToSer(fileName); g = WordGraph.loadFromSer(fileName); g.saveToTxt(fileName); g = WordGraph.loadFromTxt(fileName);",
        "We are now ready to provide our co-occurrence graph, created with just a few lines of code, as input to a WSI algorithm, as will be explained in the next section. 2.1.2 Discovery of Word Senses Once the co-occurrence graph for the query q is built, it can be input to any WSI algorithm which extends the GraphClusteringAlgorithm class in the toolkit. WoSIT comes with a number of ready-to-use such algorithms, among which: 68 Car Limousine King Arthur Excalibur Film Fantasy Book 0.02 0.015 0.025 0.005 0.04 0.006 0.007 0.01 0.013 0.012 0.02 Figure 2: Example of a co-occurrence graph for the word excalibur.",
        "• Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree (B-MST) (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013), an extension of a WSI algorithm based on the calculation of a Maximum Spanning Tree (Di Marco and Navigli, 2011) aimed at balancing the number of co-occurrences in each sense cluster.",
        "• HyperLex (Véronis, 2004), an algorithm which identifies hubs in co-occurrence graphs, thereby identifying basic meanings for the input query.",
        "• Chinese Whispers (Biemann, 2006), a randomized algorithm which partitions nodes by means of the iterative transfer of word sense information across the co-occurrence graph (Biemann, 2006).",
        "• Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++) (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013), an extension of the SquaT algorithm (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010) which exploits three cyclic graph patterns to determine and discard those vertices (or edges) with weak degree of connectivity in the graph.",
        "We also provide an implementation of a word clustering algorithm, i.e. Lin98 (Lin, 1998), which does not rely on co-occurrence graphs, but just on the word co-occurrence information to it-eratively refine word clusters on the basis of their “semantic” relationships.",
        "A programmatic example of use of the B-MST WSI algorithm is as follows: BMST mst = new BMST(g); mst.makeClustering(); Clustering wordClusters =",
        "mst.getClustering(); where g is a co-occurrence graph created as explained in Section 2.1.1, provided as input to the constructor of the algorithm’s class. The makeClustering method implements the induction algorithm and creates the word clusters, which can then be retrieved calling the getClustering method. As a result an instance of the Clustering class is provided.",
        "As mentioned above, WoSIT also enables the creation of custom WSI implementations. This can be done by extending the GraphClusteringAlgorihm abstract class. The new algorithm just has to implement two methods: public void makeClustering(); public Clustering getClustering();",
        "As a result, the new algorithm is readily integrated into the WoSIT toolkit.",
        "2.2 Semantically-enhanced Search Result Clustering and Diversification We now move to the use of the induced senses of our target query q within an application, i.e. search result clustering and diversification.

        "List<Snippet> snippets = clustering.diversify(sorter);",
        "The diversify method returns a flat list of snippet results obtained according to the Sorter object provided in input. The Sorter abstract class is designed to rerank the snippet clusters according to some predefined rule. For instance, the CardinalitySorter class, included in the toolkit, sorts the clusters according to the size of each cluster. Once a sorting order has been established, an element from each snippet cluster is added to an initially-empty list; next, a second element from each cluster is added, and so on, until all snippets are added to the list.",
        "The sorting rules implemented in the toolkit are:",
        "• CardinalitySorter: sorts the clusters according to their size, i.e. the number of vertices in the cluster;",
        "• MeanSimilaritySorter: sorts the clusters according to the average association score between the snippets in the cluster and the backing word cluster (defined by the selected association metrics).",
        "Notably, the end user can then implement his or her own custom sorting procedure by simply extending the Sorter class. 2.2.1 Search Result Datasets The framework comes with two search result datasets of ambiguous queries: the AMBI-ENT+MORESQUE dataset made available by Bernardini et al. (2009) and Navigli and Crisafulli (2010), respectively, and the SemEval-2013-Task11 dataset.3",

This component, called the WSI Evaluator, takes as input the snippet clusters obtained for a given query together with the fully annotated search result dataset, as described in the previous section. Two kinds of evaluations are carried out, described in what follows. 70 1 Dataset searchResults = Dataset.getInstance(); 2 DBConfiguration db = DBConfiguration.getInstance(); 3 for(String targetWord : dataset.getQueries()) 4 { 5 WordGraph g = WordGraph.createWordGraph(targetWord, searchResults, db); 6 BMST mst = new BMST(g); 7 mst.makeClustering(); 8 SnippetAssociator snippetAssociator = SnippetAssociator.getInstance(); 9 SnippetClustering snippetClustering = snippetAssociator.associateSnippet( 10 targetWord, searchResults, mst.getClustering(), AssociationMetric.WORD_OVERLAP); 11 snippetClustering.export(\"output/outputMST.txt\", true); 12 } 13 WSIEvaluator.evaluate(searchResults, \"output/outputMST.txt\"); Figure 3: An example of evaluation code for the B-MST clustering algorithm. 2.3.1 Evaluation of the clustering quality The quality of the output produced by semantically-enhanced search result clustering is evaluated in terms of Rand Index (Rand, 1971, RI), Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985, ARI), Jaccard Index (JI) and, finally, precision and recall as done by Crabtree et al. (2005), together with their F1 harmonic mean. 2.3.2 Evaluation of the clustering diversity To evaluate the snippet clustering diversity the measures of S-recall@K and S-precision@r (Zhai et al., 2003) are calculated. These measures determine how many different meanings of a query are covered in the top-ranking results shown to the user. We calculate these measures on the output of the three different association metrics illustrated in Section 2.2."
