However, every Chinese word inputted into computer or cellphone cannot be typed through one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly, but has to go through an IME as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard. An IME is an essential software interface that maps Chinese characters into English letter combinations.

Pinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character (based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin) , using Latin letters as its syllable notation. For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character “爱”(love) is “ài”. Most characters usually have unique pinyin representations, while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways, so they may have multiple pinyin representations. The advantage of pinyin IME is that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters so that it is simple and easy to learn. But there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-character mapping. Modern pinyin IMEs mostly use a “sentence-based” decoding technique (Chen and Lee, 2000) to alleviate the ambiguities. “Sentence based” means that IME generates a sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs with respect to certain statistical criteria. 1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking Written in Chinese characters but not alphabets, spell checking for Chinese language is quite different from the same task for other languages. Since Chinese characters are entered via IME, those user-made typos do not immediately lead to spelling errors. When a user types a wrong letter, IME will be very likely to fail to generate the expected Chinese character sequence. Normally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error and then make corrections, which usually means doing a bunch of extra operations like cursor 1512 movement, deletion and re-typing. Thus there are two separated sub-tasks for Chinese spell checking: 1. typo checking for user typed pinyin sequences which should be a built-in module in IME, and 2. spell checking for Chinese texts in its narrow sense, which is typically a module of word processing applications (Yang et al., 2012b). These two terms are often confused especially in IME related works such as (Chen and Lee, 2000) and (Wu et al., 2009).","Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs. The user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character. This may be a very common situation since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese, among which being spoken languages, six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin. With the boom of smart-phones, pinyin typos worsen due to the limited size of soft keyboard, and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen. However, existing practical IMEs only provide small patches to deal with typos such as Fuzzy Pinyin (Wu and Chen, 2004) and other language specific errors (Zheng et al., 2011b).","Typo checking and correction has an important impact on IME performance. When IME fails to correct a typo and generate the expected sentence, the user will have to take much extra effort to move the cursor back to the mistyped letter and correct it, which leads to very poor user experience (Jia and Zhao, 2013)."]},{"title":"2 Related Works","paragraphs":["The very first approach for Chinese input with typo correction was made by (Chen and Lee, 2000), which was also the initial attempt of “sentence-based” IME. The idea of “statistical input method” was proposed by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and using Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) algorithm to decode the sequence. They solved the typo correction problem by decomposing the conditional probability P (H|P ) of Chinese character sequence H given pinyin sequence P into a language model P (wi|wi−1) and a typing model P (pi|wi). The typing model that was estimated on real user input data was for typo correction. However, real user input data can be very noisy and not very convenient to obtain. As we will propose a joint model in this paper, such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach.","(Zheng et al., 2011a) developed an IME system with typo correction called CHIME using noisy channel error model and language-specific features. However their model depended on a very strong assumption that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user. This assumption does not really hold in modern “sentence-based” IMEs. We release this assumption since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly.","Besides the common HMM approach for PTC conversion, there are also various methods such as: support vector machine (Jiang et al., 2007), max-imum entropy (ME) model (Wang et al., 2006), conditional random field (CRF) (Li et al., 2009) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yang et al., 2012a; Wang et al., 2013c; Zhang and Zhao, 2013), etc.","Spell checking or typo checking was first proposed for English (Peterson, 1980). (Mays et al., 1991) addressed that spell checking should be done within a context, i.e., a sentence or a long phrase with a certain meaning, instead of only in one word. A recent spell correction work is (Li et al., 2006), where a distributional similarity was introduced for spell correction of web queries.","Early attempts for Chinese spelling checking could date back to (Chang, 1994) where character tables for similar shape, pronunciation, mean-ing, and input-method-code characters were proposed. More recently, the 7th SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing (Yu et al., 2013) held a shared task on Chinese spell checking. Various approaches were made for the task including language model (LM) based methods (Chen et al., 2013), ME model (Han and Chang, 2013), CRF (Wang et al., 2013d; Wang et al., 2013a), SMT (Chiu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), and graph model (Jia et al., 2013), etc."]},{"title":"3 Pinyin Input Method Model","paragraphs":["3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence It is a rather long journey from the first English letter typed on the keyboard to finally a completed Chinese sentence generated by IME. We will first take an overview of the entire process.","The average length of pinyin syllables is about 3 letters. There are about 410 pinyin syllables used in the current pinyin system. Each pinyin sylla-1513 ble has a bunch of corresponding Chinese characters which share the same pronunciation represented by the syllable. The number of those homophones ranges from 1 to over 300. Chinese characters then form words. But word in Chinese is a rather vague concept. Without word delimiters, linguists have argued on what a Chinese word really is for a long time and that is why there is always a primary word segmentation treatment in most Chinese language processing tasks (Zhao et al., 2006; Huang and Zhao, 2007; Zhao and Kit, 2008; Zhao et al., 2010; Zhao and Kit, 2011; Zhao et al., 2013). A Chinese word may contain from 1 to over 10 characters due to different word segmentation conventions. Figure 1 demonstrates the relationship of pinyin and word, from pinyin letters “nihao” to the word “你好 (hello)”. Typically, an IME takes the pinyin input, segments it into syllables, looks up corresponding words in a dictionary and generates a sentence with the candidate words. nihao 你好 ni hao 好你 Pinyin syllables Chinese characters Pinyin word Chinese word n i h a o Pinyin characters Figure 1: Relationship of pinyin and words","3.2 Pinyin Segmentation and Typo Correction Non-Chinese users may feel confused or even surprised if they know that when typing pinyin through an IME, Chinese IME users will never enter delimiters such as “Space” key to segment either pinyin syllables or pinyin words, but just input the entire un-segmented pinyin sequence. For example, if one wants to input “你好世界 (Hello world)”, he will just type “nihaoshijie” instead of segmented pinyin sequence “ni hao shi jie”. Nevertheless, pinyin syllable segmentation is a much easier problem compared to Chinese word segmentation. Since pinyin syllables have a very limited vocabulary and follow a set of regularities strictly, it is convenient to perform pinyin syllable segmentation by using rules. But as the pinyin input is not segmented, it is nearly impossible to adopt previous spell checking methods for English to pinyin typo checking, although techniques for English spell checking have been well developed. A bit confusing but interesting, pinyin typo correction and segmentation come as two sides of one problem: when a pinyin sequence is mistyped, it is unlikely to be correctly segmented; when it is segmented in an awkward way, it is likely to be mistyped.","Inspired by (Yang et al., 2012b) and (Jia et al., 2013), we adopt the graph model for Chinese spell checking for pinyin segmentation and typo correction, which is based on the shortest path word segmentation algorithm (Casey and Lecolinet, 1996). The model has two major steps: segmentation and correction. 3.2.1 Pinyin Segmentation The shortest path segmentation algorithm is based on the idea that a reasonable segmentation should minimize the number of segmented units. For a pinyin sequence p1p2 . . . pL, where pi is a letter, first a directed acyclic graph (DAG) GS = (V, E) is built for pinyin segmentation step. The vertex set V consists of the following parts: • Virtual start vertex S0 and end vertex SE; • Possible legal syllables fetched from dictionary Dp according to the input pinyin sequence: {Si,j|Si,j = pi . . . pj ∈ Dp};","• The letter itself as a fallback no matter if it is a legal pinyin syllable or not: {Si|Si = pi}. The vertex weights wS are all set to 0. The edges are from a syllable to all syllables next to it: E = {E(Si,j → Sj+1,k)|Si,j, Sj+1,k ∈ V}. The edge weight the negative logarithm of conditional probability P (Sj+1,k|Si,j) that a syllable Si,j is followed by Sj+1,k, which is give by a bigram language model of pinyin syllables: WE(Si,j→Sj+1,k) = − log P (Sj+1,k|Si,j) The shortest path P ∗","on the graph is the path P with the least sum of weights:","P ∗ = arg min (v,E)∈G∧(v,E)∈P ∑","v wv + ∑ E WE. 1514 Computing the shortest path from S0 to SE on GS yields the best segmentation. This is the single source shortest path (SSSP) problem on DAG which has an efficient algorithm by preprocessing the DAG with topology sort, then traversing vertices and edges in topological order. It has the time complexity of O(|V| + |E|). For example, one in-tends to input “你好世界 (Hello world)” by typing “nihaoshijie”, but mistyped as “mihaoshijiw”. The graph for this input is shown in Figure 2. The shortest path, i.e., the best segmentation is “mi hao shi ji w”. We will continue to use this example in the rest of this paper. m i h a o s h i j i w ha hao ao shi ji mi Figure 2: Graph model for pinyin segmentation 3.2.2 Pinyin Typo Correction Next in the correction step, for the segmented pinyin sequence S1, S2, . . . , SM , a graph Gc is constructed to perform typo correction. The vertex set V consists of the following parts:","• Virtual start vertex S′","0 and end vertex S′","E with vertex weights of 0;","• All possible syllables similar to original syllable in Gs. If the adjacent syllables can be merged into a legal syllable, the merged syllable is also added into V:","{S′","i,j|S′ i,j = S′","i . . . S′","j ∈ Dp, S′ k ∼ Sk, k = i ≤ j}, where the similarity ∼ is measured in Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966). Syllables with Levenshtein distance under a certain threshold are considered as similar: L(Si, Sj) < T ↔ Si ∼ Sj. The vertex weight is the Levenshtein distance multiply by a normalization parameter:","wS′ i,j = β j ∑","k−i L(S′ k, Sk). Similar to Gs, the edges are from one syllable to all syllables next to it and edge weights are the conditional probabilities between them. Computing the shortest path from S′","0 to S′","E on Gc yields the best typo correction result. In addition, the result has been segmented so far. Considering our running example, the graph Gc is shown in Figure 3, and the typo correction result is “mi hao shi jie”. w hao shi ji jie mi ti ni ma hai huo pao shu sai zhi jia ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... a e ... shuai ju Figure 3: Graph model for pinyin typo correction","Merely using the above model, the typo correction result is not satisfying yet, no matter how much effort is paid. The major reason is that the basic semantic unit of Chinese language is actu-ally word (tough vaguely defined) which is usually composed of several characters. Thus the conditional probability between characters does not make much sense. In addition, a pinyin syllable usually maps to dozens or even hundreds of corresponding homophonic characters, which makes the conditional probability between syllables much more noisy. However, using pinyin words instead of syllables is not a wise choice because pinyin word segmentation is not so easy a task as syllable segmentation. To make typo correction better, we consider to integrate it with PTC conversion using a joint model.","3.3 Hidden Markov Model for Pinyin-to-Chinese Conversion PTC conversion has long been viewed as a decoding problem using HMM. We continue to follow this formalization. The best Chinese character sequence W ∗","for a given pinyin syllable sequence S is the one with the highest conditional probability P (W |S) that","W ∗ = arg max","W P (W |S)","= arg max W P (W )P (S|W )","P (S)","= arg max W P (W )P (S|W )","= arg max","w1,ww,...,wM ∏","wi P (wi|wi−1) ∏","wi P (si|wi) 1515 In the HMM for pinyin IME, observation states are pinyin syllables, hidden states are Chinese words, emission probability is P (si|wi), and transition probability is P (wi|wi−1). Note the transition probability is the conditional probability between words instead of characters. PTC conversion is to decode the Chinese word sequence from the pinyin sequence. The Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) is used for the decoding.","The shortest path algorithm for typo correction and Viterbi algorithm for PTC conversion are very closely related. It has been strictly proven by (For-ney, 1973) that the sequence decoding problem on HMM is formally identical to finding a shortest path on a certain graph, which can be constructed in the following manner.","Consider a first order HMM with all possible observations O = {o1, o2, . . . , oM }, hidden states S = {s1, s2, . . . , sN }, a special start state s0, emission probabilities (Esi,ok ) = P (ok|si), transition probabilities (Tsi,sj ) = P (sj|si), and start probabilities (Ssi) = P (si|s0). For an observation sequence of T time periods Y = {y1, y2, . . . , yT |yt ∈ O, t = 1, . . . , T }, the decoding problem is to find the best corresponding hidden state sequence X∗","with the highest probability, i.e.,","X∗","= arg max x1,xt∈S Sx1Ex1,y1 T","∏","t=2 Ext,ytTxt−1,xt. (1)","Then we will construct a DAG G = (V, E) upon the HMM. The vertex set V includes:","• Virtual start vertex v0 and end vertex vE with vertex weight of 0;","• Normal vertices vxt, where t = 1, . . . , T , and ∀xt ∈ S. The vertex weight is the negative logarithm of emission probability:","wvx t = − log Ext,yt. The edge set E includes:","• Edges from the start vertex E(v0 → vx1) with edge weight","WE(v0→vx 1) = − log Sx1, where ∀x1 ∈ S;","• Edges to the end vertex E(vxT → vE) with vertex weights of 0;","• Edges between adjacent time periods E(vxt−1 → vxt) with edge weight","WE(vx t−1→vx","t) = − log Txt−1,xt, where t = 2, . . . , T , and ∀xt, xt−1 ∈ S. The shortest path P ∗","from v0 to vE is the one with the least sum of vertex and edge weights, i.e.,","P ∗","= arg min","vx","t∈V T ∑ t=1 (wvx","t + WE(vx","t−1→vx","t))","= arg min vx 1,vx","t∈V{− log Sx1 − log Ex1,y1 + T ∑ t=2 (− log Ext,yt − log Txt−1,xt)}","= arg max vx 1,vx","t∈V Sx1Ex1,y1 T ∏ t=2 Ext,ytTxt−1,xt. (2)","The optimization goal of P ∗","in Equation (2) is","identical to that of X∗","in Equation (1). 3.4 Joint Graph Model For Pinyin IME Given HMM decoding problem is identical to SSSP problem on DAG, we propose a joint graph model for PTC conversion with typo correction. The joint graph model aims to find the global optimal for both PTC conversion and typo correction on the entire input pinyin sequence. The graph G = (V, E) is constructed based on graph Gc for typo correction in Section 3.2. The vertex set V consists of the following parts:","• Virtual start vertex V0 and end vertex VE with vertex weight of 0;","• Adjacent pinyin syllables in Gc are merged into pinyin words. Corresponding Chinese words are fetched from a PTC dictionary Dc, which is a dictionary maps pinyin words to Chinese words, and added as vertices:","{Vi,j|∀Vi,j ∈ Dc[S′ i . . . S′","j], i ≤ j}; The vertex weight consists of two parts: 1. the vertex weights of syllables in Gc, and 2. the emission probability: wVi,j =β j ∑","k=i L(S′ k, Sk)","− γ log P (S′ i . . . S′","j|Vi,j); 1516 If the corresponding pinyin syllables in Gc have an edge between them, the vertices in G also have an edge: E = {E(Vi,j → Vj+1,k)|E(Si,j → Sj+1,k) ∈ Gc}. The edge weights are the negative logarithm of the transition probabilities: WE(Vi,j→Vj+1,k) = − log P (Vj+1,k|Vi,j) Although the model is formulated on first order HMM, i.e., the LM used for transition probability is a bigram one, it is easy to extend the model to take advantage of higher order n-gram LM, by tracking longer history while traversing the graph.","Computing the shortest path from V0 to VE on G yields the best pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction result. Considering our running example, the graph G is shown in Figure 4. ni’hao w hao shi ji jie mi ti ni ma hai huo pao shu sai zhi jia a e shuai ju mi’huo 你 好. . . zhi'ji shi'jie","接姐节. . .","你呢呢. . .","米迷. . .","饿额. . .","啊阿. . .","家加. . .","吗嘛妈. . .","跑泡. . .","好好豪. . .","或活火. . .","还海. . .","只之. . .","提题. . .","世事. . .","束书数. . .","赛塞鳃. . . 迷 惑. . . 至 极. . .","帅甩摔. . .","句局. . .","及几. . . 世 界. . .

According to our empirical statistics, when setting threshold T = 2, for a sentence of M characters, the joint graph will have |V| = M × 1, 000, and |E| = M × 1, 000, 000. 3.5 K-Shortest Paths To reduce the scale of graph G, we filter graph Gc by searching its K-shortest paths first to get G′","c and construct G on top of G′","c. Figure 5 shows the 3-shortest paths filtered graph G′","c and Figure 6 shows the corresponding G for our running example.

The heap is implemented as a priority queue of size K sorted according to path length that should support efficient push and pop operations. Fibonacci heap (Fredman and Tarjan, 1987) is adopted for the heap implementation since it has a push complexity of O(1) which is better than the O(K) for other heap structures.","Another benefit provided by K-shortest paths is that it can be used for generating N -best candidates of PTC conversion, which may be helpful for further performance improvement."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["4.1 Corpora, Tools and Experiment Settings The corpus for evaluation is the one provided in (Yang et al., 2012a), which is originally extracted from the People’s Daily corpus and labeled with pinyin.

Maximum match-ing word segmentation is used with a large word vocabulary V extracted from web data provided by (Wang et al., 2013b). The pinyin part is segmented according to the Chinese part. This vocabulary V also serves as the PTC dictionary. The original vocabulary is not labeled with pinyin, thus we use the PTC dictionary of sunpinyin1","which is an open source Chinese pinyin IME, to label the 1 http://code.google.com/p/sunpinyin/ 1517 vocabulary V with pinyin.

We follow the so-called term Max Input Unit (MIU), the longest consecutive Chinese character sequence proposed by (Jia and Zhao, 2013).

The baseline system takes a pinyin input sequence, segments it into syllables, and then converts it to Chinese character sequence.","The pinyin syllable segmentation already has very high (over 98%) accuracy with a trigram LM using improved Kneser-Ney smoothing. According to our empirical observation, emission probabilities are mostly 1 since most Chinese words have unique pronunciation. So in this step we set γ = 0.

The typo rate is set according to previous Human-Computer In-teraction (HCI) studies. Due to few works have been done on modeling Chinese text entry, we have to refer to those corresponding results on English (Wobbrock and Myers, 2006; MacKenzie and Soukoreff, 2002; Clarkson et al., 2005), which show that the average typo rate is about 2%. (Zheng et al., 2011a) performed an experiment that 2,000 sentences of 11,968 Chinese words were entered by 5 native speakers. The collected data consists of 775 mistyped pinyin words caused by one edit operation, and 85 caused by two edit operations. As we observe on T that the average pinyin word length is 5.24, then typo rate in the experiment of (Zheng et al., 2011a) can be roughly estimated as: 775 + 85 × 2 11968 × 5.24 = 1.51%, which is similar to the conclusion on English. Thus we generate corpora from D with typo rate of 0% (0-P), 2% (2-P), and 5% (5-P) to evaluate the system.","According to (Zheng et al., 2011a) most mistyped pinyin words are caused by one edit operation.

Since sunpinyin does not have typo correction module and performs much poorer than our baseline system, we do not include it in the comparison. Though no direct proofs can be found to indicate if Google Input Tool has an in-dependent typo correction component, its outputs show that such a component is unlikely available.","Since Google Input Tool has to be accessed through a web interface and the network connec-tion cannot be guaranteed. we only take a subset of 10K sentences of T to perform the experiments, and the results are shown in Table 3.","The scores reported in (Zheng et al., 2011a) are not listed in Table 4 since the data set is different.

This model finds a joint global optimal for typo correction and PTC conversion on the entire input pinyin sequence. The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products. In addition, the joint model is efficient enough for practical use. 1520"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Richard G. Casey and Eric Lecolinet. 1996.
