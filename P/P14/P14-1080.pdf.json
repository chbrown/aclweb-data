        "Transitional expressions provide glue that holds ideas together in a text and enhance the logical organization, which together help improve readability of a text. However, in most current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, the outputs of compound-complex sentences still lack proper transitional expressions. As a result, the translations are often hard to read and understand. To address this issue, we propose two novel models to encourage generating such transitional expressions by introducing the source compound-complex sentence structure (CSS). Our models include a CSS-based translation model, which generates new CSS-based translation rules, and a generative transfer model, which encourages producing transitional expressions during decoding. The two models are integrat-ed into a hierarchical phrase-based translation system to evaluate their effectiveness. The experimental results show that significant improvements are achieved on various test data meanwhile the translations are more cohesive and smooth."

        "During the last decade, great progress has been made on statistical machine translation (SMT) models. However, these translations still suffer from poor readability, especially translations of compound-complex sentences. One of the main reasons may be that most existing models concentrate more on producing well-translated local sentence fragments, but largely ignore global cohesion between the fragments. Generally, cohesion, including lexical and grammatical cohesion, contributes much to the understandability and smoothness of a text.",
        "Recently, researchers have begun addressing the lexical cohesion of SMT (Gong et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011; Wong and Kit, 2012; Xiong, 2013). These efforts focus mainly on the cooccurrence of lexical items in a similar environment. Grammatical cohesion1",
        "(Halliday and Hassan, 1976) in SMT has been little mentioned in previous work. Translations without grammatical cohesion is hard to read, mostly due to loss of cohesive and transitional expressions between two sentence fragments. Thus, generating transitional expressions is necessary for achieving grammatical cohesion. However, it is not easy to produce such transitional expressions in SMT. As an example, consider the Chinese-to-English translation in Figure 1. Source Chinese sentence: [尽管 减轻 污染 的 呼声 不断 ,]1 [ 公众     Although reduce pollution of calls continue ,      public    日渐  愤怒 ,]2 [污染  还是 变得  更   糟糕                          growing angry ,    pollution still become more worse    了 ,]3 [越发 显出    环保                    的 紧迫性 。]4 already , more show environment protection of urgent .

        "Fortunately, the functional relationships between two neighboring source sub-sentences provide us with a good perspective and the inspiration to generate those transitional phrases. Figure 1 shows that the first and the second Chinese sub-sentences form a parallel relation. Thus, even though there is no distinct connective word at the beginning of the second source sub-sentence, a good translator is still able to insert or generate an “and” as a connection word to make the target translation more cohesive."

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to generate target transitional expressions for SMT grammatical cohesion by introducing the functional relationships of source sentences. In this work, we propose two models. One is a new translation model that is utilized to generate new translation rules combined with the information of source functional relationships. The other is a generative transfer model that encourages producing transitional phrases during decoding. Our experimental results on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrate that the translation readability is greatly improved by introducing the cohesive information.",

In this representation, the relationship R is the most important factor because different relationships directly reflect different cohesive expressions. In addition, the children’s positions always play a strong role in choosing cohesive expressions because transitional expressions vary for children with different positions. For example, when translating the last child of a parallel relation, we always use word “and” as the transitional expression seen in Figure 3, but we will not use it for the first child of a parallel relation. Therefore, in the training process we just keep the information of relationships and children’s positions when converting Despite frequent calls for cutting pollution , and growing public anger , <Parallel @B> 尽管 减轻 污染 的 呼声 不断 ,     <Parallel @E> 公众 日渐 愤怒 , parallel 尽管 减轻 污染 的 呼声 不断 , 公众 日渐 愤怒 ,",

B (Beginning) represents the first child of a relationship, E (End) means the last child of a relationship, and M (Middle) represents all the middle children.",
        "Under this agreement, the original Chinese CSS-based tree will be converted to a new tagged-flattened string. Note the converting example from Figure 3(a) to Figure 3(b): node parallel-[(1,1), (2,2)] (see Figure 2) is converted to a flat string. Its first child is represented as <parallel, @B> with the semantic span, while the last child is <parallel, @E> with the corresponding semantic span.",
        "We then perform word alignment on the modified bilingual sentences, and extract the new translation rules based on the new alignment, as shown in Figure 3(b) to Figure 3(c). Now the newly extracted rule “<parallel, @E > [X] 日渐 ||| and growing [X] ” is tagged with cohesive information. Thus, if the similar relationship parallel occurs in the test source sentence, this type of rule is more likely to be chosen to generate the cohesive word “and” during decoding because it is more discriminating than the original rules ([X] 日渐 ||| and growing [X]). The conditional probabilities of the new translation rules are calculat-ed following (Chiang, 2005). 3.2 CSS-based Transfer model In general, according to formula (3), the translation quality based on the log-linear model is related tightly with the features chosen. Most translation systems adopt the features from a translation model, a language model, and sometimes a reordering model. To give a bonus to generating cohesive expressions during decoding, we have designed a special additional feature. The additional feature is represented as a probability cal-culated by a transfer model.",

The expansion process will be repeated until there is no such word. For example, if we take the CSS and the alignment in Figure 3(a) for training, the left frontier of the second child will be expanded from “growing” to “and”.

Thus, during decoding, if we add the probability generated by the transfer model of ( | )P CSSw as a feature in 853 formula (3), it will certainly contribute to select-ing more cohesive candidates. 3.3 Elementary-Unit Cohesion Constraint As mentioned in Section 3.2, in the transfer model, the transitional phrases are expected to occur at the left frontier of a projected span on target side. In fact, this depends on the assumption that the projected translations of any two disjoint source semantic spans are also disjoint to keep their own semantic integrity. We call this assumption the integrity assumption. This assumption is intuitive and supported by statistics. After analyzing 1,007 golden aligned Chinese-English sentence-pairs, we find that approximately 90% of the pairs comply with the assumption. However, in real automatically aligned noisy data, the ratio of complying pairs reduces to 71%4",
        ". Two projected translations that violate the integrity assumption may mutually overlap, which causes our confusion on where to extract the transitional phrases. In this case, extracted transitional phrases are likely to be wrong. To increase the chance of extracting correct transitional phrases, the alignment results must be modified to reduce the impact of incorrect alignment. We propose a dynamic cleaning method to ensure that the most expressive transitional phrases fall in the accessible extraction range before training the transfer model. 3.3.1 EUC and non-EUC As we have defined in Section 2, the minimal semantic span is called elementary unit (eu). If the source eu and its projected target span comply with the integrity assumption, we say that such an eu and its projected span have Elementary-Unit-Cohesion (EUC). We define EUC formally as follows.",

        "To test the effectiveness of the proposed models, we have compared the translation quality of different integration strategies. First, we adopted only the tagged-flattened rules in the hierarchical translation system. Next, we added the log probability generated by the transfer model as a feature into the baseline features. The baseline features include bi-directional phrase translation probabilities, bi-directional lexical translation probabilities, the BTG re-ordering features, and the language model feature. The tri-gram left-frontier phrase was adopted in the experiment. Then the probability generated by the transfer model with EUC constraint is added. Finally, we incorporated the tagged-flattened rules and the additional transfer model feature together.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of these different in-tegrated strategies. In Table 3, almost all BLEU scores are improved, no matter what strategy is used. In particular, the best performance marked in bold is as high as 1.24, 0.94, and 0.82 BLEU points, respectively, over the baseline system on NIST04, CWMT08 Development, and CWMT08 Evaluation data. The strategy of “TFS+ Flattened Rule” is the most stable. Meanwhile the “Flattened Rule” achieves better performance than “TFS”. The merits of “Flattened Rule” are two-fold: 1) In training process, the new word alignment upon modified sentence pairs can align transitional expressions to flattened CSS tags; 2) In decoding process, the CSS-based rules are more discriminating than the original rules, which is more flexible than “TFS”. From the table, we cannot conclude that the EUC constraint will certainly promote translation quality, but the transfer model performs better with the constraint on most testing sets.",
        "4.4 Analysis of Different Effects of Different N-grams As mentioned in Section 4.3, we have noted the effectiveness of tri-gram transfer model, which means 2n  in formula (7). In fact, the lengths of common transitional expressions vary from one word to several words. To evaluate the effects of different n-grams for our proposed transfer model, we compared the uni-/bi-/tri-gram transfer models in SMT, and illustrate the results in Fig-Relation Left-frontier phrases (tri-gram) parallel as well as; at the same; ... progressive but will also; in addition to;... causal therefore , the; for this reason; as a result; because it is; so it is;... condition as long as; only when the... hypothesis if we do; if it is; if the us; ... alternative regardless of whether;... purpose it is necessary; further promote the ;... explanation that is ,; the first is; first is the;... adversative however , the ; but it is; ... flowing this is a; which is an; ... consequence so that the; to ensure that...

We observe that compared to the baseline, our approach has obvious advantages on translating the implicit relations, due to generating translational expressions on target side. Moreover, with the transitional expressions, cohesion of the entire translation improves. Notably, the transitional expressions in this work like “including, there are, the core of which” are not linguistic conjunctions. We would like to call them “generalized” conjunctions, because they tie semantic fragments together, analogously to linguistic conjunctions."

        "Improving cohesion for complex sentences or discourse translation has attracted much attention in recent years. Such research efforts can be roughly divided into two groups: 1) research on lexical cohesion, which mainly contributes to the selection of generated target words; 2) efforts to improve the grammatical cohesion, such as disambiguation of references and connectives.",
        "In lexical cohesion work, (Gong et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011; Wong and Kit, 2012) built discourse-based models to ensure lexical cohesion or consistency. In (Xiong et al., 2013a), three different features were designed to capture the lexical cohesion for document-level machine translation. (Xiong et al., 2013b) incorporated lexical-chain-based models (Morris and Hirst, 1991) into machine translation. They generated the target lexical chains based on the source  Figure 6.

        "Limited work has been conducted on grammatical cohesion. (Marcu et al., 2000) designed a discourse structure transfer module, but it focused on converting the semantic structure rather than actual translation. (Tu et al., 2013b) provid-ed a Rhetorical-Structure-Theory-based tree-to-string translation method for complex sentences with explicit relations inspired by (Marcu et al., 2000), but their models worked only for explicit functional relations, and they were concerned mainly with the translation integrity of semantic span rather than cohesion. (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012) used sense-labeled discourse connectives for machine translation from English to French. They added the labels assigned to connectives as an additional input to an SMT system, but their experimental results show that the improvements under the evaluation metric of BLEU were not significant. (Nagard and Koehn, 2010) addresses the problems of reference or anaphora resolution inspired by work of Mitkov et al. (1995).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to exploit the source functional relationship to generate the target transitional expressions for grammatical cohesion, and we have successfully incorporated the proposed models into an SMT system with significant improve-ment of BLEU metrics."

      "title": "6 Conclusion",
      "paragraphs": [
        "In this paper, we focus on capturing cohesion information to enhance the grammatical cohesion of machine translation. By taking the source CSS into consideration, we build bridges to connect the source functional relationships in CSS to target transitional expressions; such a process is very similar to human translating. Our contributions can be summarized as: 1) the new translation rules are more discriminative and sensitive to cohesive information by converting the source string into a CSS-based tagged-flattened string; 2) the new additional features embedded in the log-linear model can encourage the decoder to produce transitional expressions. The experimental results show that significant improvements have been achieved on various test data, meanwhile the translations are more cohesive and smooth, which together demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.",
        "In the future, we will extend our methods to other translation models, such as the syntax-based model, to study how to further improve the performance of SMT systems. Besides, more language pairs with various linguistic structures will be taken into consideration."
