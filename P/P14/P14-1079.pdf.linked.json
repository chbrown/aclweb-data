To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimension-s of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Relation Extraction (RE) is the process of generating structured relation knowledge from unstructured natural language texts.

We extract diverse textual features from all those relation mentions and combine them into a rich feature vector labeled by the relation names (President-of and Born-in) to produce a weak training corpus for relation classification.","This paradigm is promising to generate large-scale training corpora automatically. However, it comes up against three technical challeges:","• Sparse features. As we cannot tell what kinds of features are effective in advance, we have to use NLP toolkits, such as Stanford CoreNLP10",", to extract a variety of textual features, e.g., named entity tags, part-of-speech tags and lexicalized dependency paths. Unfortunately, most of them appear only once in the training corpus, and hence leading to very sparse features.","• Noisy features. Not all relation mentions express the corresponding relation instances. For example, the second relation mention in Figure 1 does not explicitly describe any relation instance, so features extracted from this sentence can be noisy. Such analogous cases commonly exist in feature extraction. • Incomplete labels. Similar to noisy fea-9 The sentences that contain the given entity pair are called","relation mentions. 10 http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtml tures, the generated labels can be incomplete. For example, the fourth relation mention in Figure 1 should have been labeled by the relation Senate-of. However, the incomplete knowledge base does not contain the corresponding relation instance (Senate-of(Barack Obama, U.S.)). Therefore, the distant supervision paradigm may generate incomplete labeling corpora. In essence, distantly supervised relation extraction is an incomplete multi-label classification task with sparse and noisy features.","In this paper, we formulate the relation-extraction task from a novel perspective of using matrix completion with low rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant supervision. More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels. In such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank. The rationale of this assumption is that noisy features and incomplete labels are semantically correlated. The low-rank factorization of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers the low-dimensional representation of de-correlation for features and labels. 840","We contribute two optimization models, DRM-C11","-b and DRMC-1, aiming at exploiting the sparsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simultaneously. Moreover, the logistic cost function is integrated in our models to reduce the influence of noisy features and incomplete labels, due to that it is suitable for binary variables. We also modify the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm (Ma et al., 2011) to find the global optimum.","Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our noise-tolerant approaches outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of feature sparsity, and our approaches consistently achieve better performance than compared methods under different sparsity degrees."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The idea of distant supervision was firstly proposed in the field of bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999). Snow et al. (2004) used WordNet as the knowledge base to discover more hpyernym/hyponym relations between entities from news articles. However, either bioinformatic database or WordNet is maintained by a few experts, thus hardly kept up-to-date.","As we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models that can automatically extract relation instances from large-scale online natural language corpora without hand-labeled annotation. Mintz et al. (2009) adopt-ed Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008; Bollacker et al., 2007), a large-scale crowdsourcing knowledge base online which contains billions of relation instances and thousands of relation names, to distantly supervise Wikipedia corpus. The basic alignment assumption of this work is that if a pair of entities participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these entities are labeled by that relation name. Then we can extract a variety of textual features and learn a multi-class logistic regression classifier. Inspired by multi-instance learning (Maron and Lozano-Pérez, 1998), Riedel et al. (2010) relaxed the strong assumption and replaced all sentences with at least one sentence. Hoffmann et al. (2011) pointed out that many entity pairs have more than one relation. They extend-11 It is the abbreviation for Distant supervision for Relation","extraction with Matrix Completion ed the multi-instance learning framework (Riedel et al., 2010) to the multi-label circumstance. Surdeanu et al. (2012) proposed a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for relation extraction, which jointly modeled all the sentences in texts and all labels in knowledge bases for a given entity pair. Other literatures (Takamatsu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) addressed more specific issues, like how to construct the negative class in learning or how to adopt more information, such as name entity tags, to improve the performance.","Our work is more relevant to Riedel et al.’s (2013) which considered the task as a matrix factorization problem. Their approach is composed of several models, such as PCA (Collins et al., 2001) and collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008). However, they did not concern about the data noise brought by the basic assumption of distant supervision."]},{"title":"3 Model","paragraphs":["We apply a new technique in the field of applied mathematics, i.e., low-rank matrix completion with convex optimization. The breakthrough work on this topic was made by Candès and Recht (2009) who proved that most low-rank matrices can be perfectly recovered from an incomplete set of entries. This promising theory has been successfully applied on many active research areas, such as computer vision (Cabral et al., 2011), recommender system (Rennie and Srebro, 2005) and system controlling (Fazel et al., 2001). Our models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al. (2010), which formulated the multi-label transductive learning as a matrix completion problem. The new framework for classification enhances the robustness to data noise by penalizing different cost functions for features and labels. 3.1 Formulation Suppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d-dimensional textual features, and t labels (relations), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al. (2009). Let Xtrain ∈ Rn×d","and Ytrain ∈ Rn×t","denote the feature matrix and the label matrix for training, respectively.

Then we can predict the label matrix Ytest ∈ Rm×t","of m testing items with respect to the feature matrix Xtest ∈ Rm×d",". Let","Z = [ Xtrain Ytrain Xtest Ytest ]",". This linear classification problem can be transformed into completing the unobservable entries in Ytest by means of the observable entries in Xtrain, Ytrain and Xtest, based on the assumption that the rank of matrix Z ∈ R(n+m)×(d+t)","is low. The model can be written as,","arg min Z∈R(n+m)×(d+t) rank(Z) s.t. ∀(i, j) ∈ ΩX , zij = xij, (1 ≤ i ≤ n + m, 1 ≤ j ≤ d), ∀(i, j) ∈ ΩY , zi(j+d) = yij, (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ t), (2) where we use ΩX to represent the index set of observable feature entries in Xtrain and Xtest, and ΩY to denote the index set of observable label entries in Ytrain.","Formula (2) is usually impractical for real problems as the entries in the matrix Z are corrupted by noise.

To tolerate the noise entries in the error matrix E, we minimize the cost functions Cx and Cy for features and labels respectively, rather than using the hard constraints in Formula (2).

The first dataset12",", NYT’10, was developed by Riedel et al. (2010), and also used by Hoffmann et al. (2011) and Surdeanu et al. (2012). Three kinds of features, namely, lexical, syntactic and named entity tag features, were extracted from relation mentions. The second dataset13",", NYT’13, was also released by Riedel et al. (2013), in which they only regarded the lexicalized dependency path between two entities as features. Table 1 shows that the two datasets differ in some main attributes. More specifically, NYT’10 contains much higher dimensional features than NYT’13, whereas fewer training and testing items. 5.2 Parameter setting In this part, we address the issue of setting parameters: the trade-off weights μ and λ, the step sizes τz and τb, and the decay parameter ημ.","We set λ = 1 to make the contribution of the cost function terms for feature and label matrices equal in Formulae (3) and (4). μ is assigned by a series of values obeying μk+1 = max(μkημ, μF ). 12 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ 13 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/data-univSchema/ We follow the suggestion in (Goldberg et al., 2010) that μ starts at σ1ημ, and σ1 is the largest singular value of the matrix Z. We set ημ = 0.01. The final value ofμ, namely μF , is equal to 0.01. Ma et al. (2011) revealed that as long as the non-negative step sizes satisfy τz < min( 4|ΩY |","λ , |ΩX |) and τb < 4|ΩY |","λ(n+m) , the FPC algorithm will guarantee to converge to a global optimum. Therefore, we set τz = τb = 0.5 to satisfy the above constraints on both two datasets. 5.3 Rank estimation Even though the FPC algorithm converges in iterative fashion, the value of ε varying with different datasets is difficult to be decided. In practice, we record the rank of matrix Z at each round of iteration until it converges at a rather small threshold ε = 10−4",". The reason is that we suppose the optimal low-rank representation of the matrix Z conveys the truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation between the features and the corresponding labels.","We use the five-fold cross validation on the validation set and evaluate the performance on each fold with different ranks.

In this section, we discuss how our approaches tackle these natural flaws.","Due to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high. Figure 5 demonstrates that the ranks of data matrices are approximately 2,000 for the initial optimization of DRMC-b and DRMC-1. However, those high ranks result in poor performance. As the ranks decline before approaching the optimum, the performance gradually improves, implying that our approaches filter the noise in data and keep the principal information for classification via recovering the underlying low-rank data matrix.","Furthermore, we discuss the influence of the feature sparsity for our approaches and the state-846 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.122 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","0.1","0.2 0.3","0.4","0.5 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   Mintz−09 MultiR−11 MIML−12 MIML−at−least−one−12 DRMC−1(Rank=17) DRMC−b(Rank=43) 0","0.2","0.4","0.6","0.8 1 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   DRMC−1(Rank=2148) DRMC−b(Rank=2291) DRMC−1(Rank=1285) DRMC−b(Rank=1448) DRMC−1(Rank=404) DRMC−b(Rank=489) DRMC−1(Rank=17) DRMC−b(Rank=43) 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.122 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","0.1","0.2 0.3","0.4","0.5 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   Mintz−09 MultiR−11 MIML−12 MIML−at−least−one−12 DRMC−1(Rank=17) DRMC−b(Rank=46) 0","0.2","0.4","0.6","0.8 1 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   DRMC−1(Rank=2539) DRMC−b(Rank=2730) DRMC−1(Rank=1447) DRMC−b(Rank=1644) DRMC−1(Rank=433) DRMC−b(Rank=531) DRMC−1(Rank=17) DRMC−b(Rank=46) 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","100","200 300","400","500 0.124 0.126 0.128 0.13 0.132 0.134 0.136 0.138 0.14 Rank Average−F1   Fold 1 Fold 2 Fold 3 Fold 4 Fold 5 0","0.1","0.2 0.3","0.4","0.5 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   Mintz−09 MultiR−11 MIML−12 MIML−at−least−one−12 DRMC−1(Rank=16) DRMC−b(Rank=51) 0","0.2","0.4","0.6","0.8 1 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 Recall Precision   DRMC−1(Rank=3186) DRMC−b(Rank=3444) DRMC−1(Rank=1728) DRMC−b(Rank=1991) DRMC−1(Rank=489) DRMC−b(Rank=602) DRMC−1(Rank=16) DRMC−b(Rank=51) Figure 6: Feature sparsity discussion on NYT’10 testing set.

We relax the feature filtering threshold (θ = 4, 3, 2) in Surdeanu et al.’s (2012) open source program to generate more sparse features from NYT’10 dataset. Figure 6 shows that our approaches consistently outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods with diverse feature sparsity degrees. Table 2 also lists the range of optimal rank for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 with different θ. We observe that for each approach, the optimal range is relatively stable. In other words, for each approach, the amount of truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation keeps constant for the same dataset, which, to some extent, explains the reason why our approaches are robust to sparse features."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we contributed two noise-tolerant optimization models17",", DRMC-b and DRMC-1, for distantly supervised relation extraction task from a novel perspective.

Exper-17 The source code can be downloaded from https://","github.com/nlpgeek/DRMC/tree/master iments demonstrated that the low-rank representation of the feature-label matrix can exploit the underlying semantic correlated information for relation classification and is effective to overcome the difficulties incurred by sparse and noisy features and incomplete labels, so that we achieved significant improvements on performance.","Our proposed models also leave open question-s for distantly supervised relation extraction task. First, they can not process new coming testing items efficiently, as we have to reconstruct the data matrix containing not only the testing items but also all the training items for relation classification, and compute in iterative fashion again. Second, the volume of the datasets we adopt are relatively small. For the future work, we plan to improve our models so that they will be capable of incremental learning on large-scale datasets (Chang, 2011)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work is supported by National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program) under Grant 2013CB329304, National Science Founda-tion of China (NSFC) under Grant No.61373075. 847"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Nguyen Bach and Sameer Badaskar. 2007.
