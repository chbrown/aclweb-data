        "Update summarization is a form of multi-document summarization where a document set must be summarized in the context of other documents assumed to be known. Efficient update summarization must focus on identifying new information and avoiding repetition of known information. In Query-focused summarization, the task is to produce a summary as an answer to a given query. We introduce a new task, Query-Chain Summarization, which combines aspects of the two previous tasks: starting from a given document set, increasingly specific queries are considered, and a new summary is produced at each step. This process models exploratory search: a user explores a new topic by submitting a sequence of queries, inspecting a summary of the result set and phrasing a new query at each step. We present a novel dataset comprising 22 query-chains sessions of length up to 3 with 3 matching human summaries each in the consumer-health domain. Our analysis demonstrates that summaries produced in the context of such exploratory process are different from informative summaries. We present an algorithm for Query-Chain Summarization based on a new LDA topic model variant. Evaluation indicates the algorithm improves on strong baselines."

        "In the past 10 years, the general objective of text summarization has been refined into more specific tasks. Such summarization tasks include: (i) Generic Multi Document Summarization: aims at summarizing a cluster of topically related documents, such as the top results of a search engine query; (ii) in Update Summarization, a set of documents is summarized while assuming the user has already read a summary of earlier documents on the same topic; (iii) in Query-Focused Summarization, the summary of a documents set is produced to convey an informative answer in the context of a specific query. The importance of these specialized tasks is that they help us distinguish criteria that lead to the selection of content in a summary: centrality, novelty, relevance, and techniques to avoid redundancy.",
        "We present in this paper a variant summarization task which combines the two aspects of update and query-focused summarization. The task is related to exploratory search (Marchionini, 2006). In contrast to classical information seeking, in exploratory search, the user is uncertain about the information available, and aims at learning and understanding a new topic (White and Roth, 2009). In typical exploratory search behavior, a user posts a series of queries, and based on information gathered at each step, decides how to further explore a set of documents. The metaphor of berrypicking introduced in (Bates, 1989) captures this interactive process. At each step, the user may zoom in to a more specific information need, zoom out to a more general query, or pan sideways, in order to investigate a new aspect of the topic.",
        "We define Query-Chain Focused Summarization as follows: for each query in an exploratory search session, we aim to extract a summary that answers the information need of the user, in a manner similar to Query-Focused Summarization, while not repeating information already provided in previous steps, in a manner similar to Update Summarization. In contrast to query-focused summarization, the context of a sum-913 mary is not a single query, but the set of queries that led to the current step, their result sets and the corresponding summaries.",
        "We have constructed a novel dataset of Query-Sets with matching manual summarizations in the consumer health domain (Cline and Haynes, 2001). Queries are extracted from PubMed search logs (Dogan et al., 2009). We have analyzed this manual dataset and confirm that summaries written in the context of berry-picking are markedly different from those written for similar queries on the same document set, but without the query-chain context.",
        "We have adapted well-known multi-document algorithms to the task, and present baseline algorithms based on LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), KLSum and TopicSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). We introduce a new algorithm to address the task of Query-Chain Focused Summarization, based on a new LDA topic model variant, and present an evaluation which demonstrates it improves on these baselines.",
        "The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 formulates the task of Query-Chain Focused Summarization. Section 3 reviews related work. In Section 4, we describe the data collection process and the resulting dataset. We then present our algorithm, as well as the baseline algorithms used for evaluation. We conclude with evaluation and discussion."

        "We first review the closely related tasks of Update Summarization and Query-Focused Summarization. We also review key summarization algorithms that we have selected as baseline and adapted to the QCFS task.",
        "Update Summarization focuses on identifying new information relative to a previous body of information, modeled as a set of documents. It has been introduced in shared tasks in DUC 2007 and TAC 2008. This task consists of producing a multi-document summary for a document set on a specific topic, and then a multi-document summary for a different set of articles on the same topic published at later dates. This task helps us understand how update summaries identified and focused on new information while reducing redundancy compared to the original summaries.",
        "The TAC 2008 dataset includes 48 sets of 20 documents, each cluster split in two subsets of 10 documents (called A and B). Subset B documents were more recent. Original summaries were generated for the A subsets and update summaries were then produced for the B subsets. Human summaries and candidate systems are evaluated using the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). For automatic evaluation, ROUGE (Lin, 2004) variants have been proposed (Conroy et al., 2011). In contrast to this setup, QCFS distinguishes the subsets of documents considered at each step of the process by facets of the underlying topic, and not by chronology. In addition, the document subsets are not identified as part of the task in QCFS (as opposed to the explicit split in A and B subsets in Update Summarization).",
        "Most systems working on Update Summarization have focused on removing redundancy. DualSum (Delort and Alfonseca, 2012) is notable in attempting to directly model novelty using a specialized topic-model to distinguish words expressing background information and those introducing new information in each document.",
        "In Query-Focused Summarization (QFS), the task consists of identifying information in a document set that is most relevant to a given query. 914 This differs from generic summarization, where one attempts to identify central information. QFS helps us distinguish models of relevance and centrality. Unfortunately, detailed analysis of the datasets produced for QFS indicates that these two notions are not strongly distinguished in practice: (Gupta et al., 2007) observed that in QFS datasets, up to 57% of the words in the document sets were closely related to the query (through simple query expansion). They note that as a consequence, a generic summarizer forms a strong baseline for such biased QFS tasks.",
        "We address this limitation of existing QFS datasets in our definition of QCFS: we identify a chain of at least 3 related queries which focus on different facets of the same central topic and require the generation of distinct summaries for each query, with little repetition across the steps.",
        "A specific evaluation aspect of QFS measures responsiveness (how well the summary answers the specific query). QFS must rely on Information Retrieval techniques to overcome the scarceness of the query to establish relevance. As evidenced since (Daume and Marcu, 2006), Bayesian techniques have proven effective at this task: we construct a latent topic model on the basis of the document set and the query. This topic model effectively serves as a query expansion mechanism, which helps assess the relevance of individual sentences to the original query.",
        "In recent years, three major techniques have emerged to perform multi-document summarization: graph-based methods such as LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) for multi document summarization and Biased-LexRank (Otterbacher et al., 2008) for query focused summarization, language model methods such as KLSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and variants of KLSum based on topic models such as BayesSum (Daume and Marcu, 2006) and TopicSum (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "LexRank is a stochastic graph-based method for computing the relative importance of textual units in a natural text. The LexRank algorithm builds a weighted graph � = (�, �) where each vertex in � is a linguistic unit (in our case sentences) and each weighted edge in � is a measure of similarity between the nodes. In our implementation, we model similarity by computing the cosine distance between the �� × I�� vectors representing each node. After the graph is generated, the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) is used to determine the most central linguistic units in the graph. To generate a summary we use the � most central lexical units, until the length of the target summary is reached. This method has no explicit control to avoid redundancy among the selected sentences, and the original algorithm does not address update or query-focused variants. Biased-LexRank (Otterbacher et al., 2008) makes LexRank sensitive to the query by introducing a prior belief about the ranking of the nodes in the graph, which reflects the similarity of sentences to the query. PageRank spreads the query similarity of a vertex to its close neighbors, so that we rank higher sentences that are similar to other sentences which are similar to the query. As a result, Biased-LexRank overcomes the lexical sparseness of the query and obtained state of the art results on the DUC 2005 dataset.",
        "KLSum adopts a language model approach to compute relevance: the documents in the input set are modeled as a distribution over words (the original algorithm uses a unigram distribution over the bag of words in documents D). KLSum is a sentence extraction algorithm: it searches for a subset of the sentences in D with a unigram distribution as similar as possible to that of the overall collection D, but with a limited length. The algorithm uses Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence ��(�||�) = ∑ log� (�(�)",
        "�(�))�(�) to compute the similarity of the distributions. It searches for �∗",
        "= argmin|�|<���(�D||��). This search is performed in a greedy manner, adding sentences one by one to S until the length L is reached, and choosing the best sentence as measured by KLdivergence at each step. The original method has no update or query focusing capability, but as a general modeling framework it is easy to adapt to a wide range of specific tasks.",
        "TopicSum uses an LDA-like topic model (Blei et al. 2003) to classify words from a number of document sets (each set discussing a different topic) as either general non-content words, topic specific words and document specific word (this category refers to words that are specific to the writer and not shared across the document set). After the words are classified, the algorithm uses a KLSum variant to find the summary that best matches the unigram distribution of topic specific words. This method improves the results of 915 KLSum but it also has no update summary or query answering capabilities."

        "We now describe how we have constructed a dataset to evaluate QCFS algorithms, which we are publishing freely. We selected to build our dataset in the Consumer Health domain, a popular domain in the web (Cline and Haynes 2001) providing medical information at various levels of complexity, ranging from layman and up to expert information, because consumer health illustrates the need for exploratory search. The PubMed repository, while primarily serving the academic community, is also used by laymen to ask health related questions. The PubMed query logs (Dogan et al., 2009) provide user queries with timestamps and anonymized user identifica-tion. They are publically available and include over 600K queries per day. In this dataset, Dogan and Murray found that query reformulation (typical of exploratory search) is quite frequent: \"In our dataset, 47% of all queries are followed by a new subsequent query. These users did not select any abstract or full text views from the result set. We make an operational assumption that these users’ intent was to modify their search by reformulating their query.\" We used these logs to extract laymen queries relating to four topics: Asthma, Lung Cancer, Obesity and Alzheimer’s disease. We extracted a single day query log. From these, we extracted sessions which contained the terms “Asthma”, “Lung Cancer”, “Obesity” or “Alzheimer”. Sessions containing search tags (such as “[Author]”) were removed to reduce the number of academic searches. The sessions were then manually examined and used to create zoom-in query chains of length 3 at most.

A child's weight status is determined using an age- and sex-specific percentile for BMI rather than the BMI categories used for adults because children's body composition varies as they age and varies between boys and girls. For children and adolescents (aged 2-19 years): Overweight is defined as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex. Obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex. BMI is not a perfect measure, but rather a helpful indicator. It doesn't consider things like being muscular or having a larger than average body frame and because growth patterns vary greatly among children. As a result, doctors also factor a child's growth and development into consideration when screening for overweight and obesity. Obesity screening of adults using BMI may be less accurate for adults, due to the coarseness of the measurement: Heavily muscled athletes may have a high BMI, as many women who enter menopause, who tend to gain weight due to increased water retention. Q2: body mass index The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape based on an individual's mass and height. Devised in the mid-1800s by Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing \"social physics\", it is defined as an individual's body mass divided by the square of their height, the units being kg/m2̂. BMI was explicitly cited as being appropriate for population studies, and inappropriate for individual diagnosis. BMI provides a simple measure of a person's thickness, allowing health professionals to discuss over-weight and underweight problems more objectively with their patients. However, BMI has become controversial because many people, including physicians, have come to rely on its apparent authority for medical diagnosis. However, it was originally meant to be used as a simple means of classifying sedentary individuals, or rather, populations, with an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value settings are as follows: (...). Nick Korevaar (a mathematics lecturer from the University of Utah) suggests that instead of squaring the body height or cubing the body height, it would be more appropriate to use an exponent of between 2.3 and 2.7 (as originally noted by Quetelet). Q3: BMI Validity BMI has become controversial because many people, including physicians, have come to rely on its apparent numerical authority for medical diagnosis, but that was never the BMI's purpose; it is meant to be used as a simple means of classifying sedentary populations with an average body composition. In an article published in the July edi-tion of 1972 of the Journal of Chronic Diseases, Ancel Keys explicitly cited BMI as being appropriate for population studies, but inappropriate for individual diagnosis. These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories While BMI is a simple, inexpensive method of screening for weight categories, it is not a good diagnostic tool: It does not take into account age, gender, or muscle mass.

For example, when we summarize the documents that were retrieved as a result to the first query, we calculate the unigram distribution in the same manner as we did in Focused KLSum; but for the second query, we calculate the unigram distribution as if all the sentences we selected for the previous summary were selected for the current query too, with a damping factor.

        "����e(�, �) = ����e��ca�(�, �) + �",
        "∗ �������(�, �) + �",
        "∗ ���U���(�, �)",
        "Where:",
        "���(�1, �2) = ∑ (�A��(�i�(��1 , ��2",
        ")",
        "�i�(��1 , ��1",
        "))I��(��1",
        "))�",
        "∑ I��(��1",
        ")� Instead of using the cosine distance, in order to incorporate advanced word/term similarity functions. For lexical terms, we used the identity function, for Wikipedia term we used Wikiminer (Milne, 2007), and for UMLS we used Ted Pedersen UMLS similarity function (McInnes et al., 2009). Finally, instead of PageRank, we used SimRank (Haveliwala, 2002) to identify the nodes most similar to the query node and not only the central sentences in the graph."

        "We presented a new summarization task tailored for the needs of exploratory search system. This task combines elements of question answering by sentence extraction with those of update summarization. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a new summarization task that corresponds to exploratory search behavior and the contribution of a novel dataset containing human summaries. This dataset is annotated with Wikipedia and UMLS terms for over 30% of the to-kens. We controlled that the summaries cover only part of the input document sets (and are, therefore, properly focused) and sensitive to the position of the queries in the chain.",

        "This paper concentrated on “zoom in” query chains, other user actions such as “zoom out” or “switch topic” were left to future work. This paper concentrated on “zoom in” query chains, other user actions such as “zoom out” or “switch topic” were left to future work. The task remains extremely challenging, and we hope the dataset availability will allow further research to refine our understanding of topic-sensitive summarization and redundancy control. In future work, we will attempt to derive a task-specific evaluation metric that exploits the structure of the chains to better assess relevance, redundancy and contrast.
