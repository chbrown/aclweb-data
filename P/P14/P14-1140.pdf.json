        "Deep Neural Network (DNN), which essential-ly is a multi-layer neural network, has re-gained more and more attentions these years. With the efficient training methods, such as (Hinton et al., 2006), DNN is widely applied to speech and image processing, and has achieved breakthrough results (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Dahl et al., 2012).",
        "Applying DNN to natural language processing (NLP), representation or embedding of words is usually learnt first. Word embedding is a dense, low dimensional, real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector represents a latent aspect of the word, and captures its syntactic and semantic properties (Bengio et al., 2006). Word embedding is usually learnt from large amount of monolingual corpus at first, and then fine tuned for special distinct tasks. Collobert et al. (2011) propose a multi-task learning framework with DNN for various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labelling. Recurrent neural networks are leveraged to learn language model, and they keep the history information circularly inside the network for arbitrarily long time (Mikolov et al., 2010). Recursive neural networks, which have the ability to generate a tree structured output, are applied to natural language parsing (Socher et al., 2011), and they are extended to recursive neural tensor networks to explore the compositional aspect of semantics (Socher et al., 2013).",
        "DNN is also introduced to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to learn several components or features of conventional framework, including word alignment, language modelling, translation modelling and distortion modelling. Yang et al. (2013) adapt and extend the CD-DNN-HMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method to HMM-based word alignment model. In their work, bilingual word embedding is trained to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are utilized to model context information. Auli et al. (2013) propose a joint language and translation model, based on a recurrent neural network. Their model predicts a target word, with an unbounded history of both source and target words. Liu et al. (2013) propose an additive neural network for SMT decoding. Word embedding is used as the input to learn translation confidence score, which is combined with commonly used features in the conventional log-linear model. For distortion modeling, Li et al. (2013) use recursive auto encoders to make full use of the entire merging phrase pairs, going beyond the boundary words with a maximum entropy classifier (Xiong et al., 2006). 1491",

To generate the translation candidates in a commonly used bottom-up manner, recursive neural networks are naturally adopt-ed to build the tree structure. In recursive neural networks, all the representations of nodes are generated based on their child nodes, and it is difficult to integrate additional global information, such as language model and distortion model. In order to integrate these crucial information for better translation prediction, we combine recurrent neural networks into the recursive neural networks, so that we can use global information to generate the next hidden state, and select the better translation candidate.",

So as to model the translation confidence for a translation phrase pair, we initialize the phrase pair embedding by leveraging the sparse features and recurrent neural network. The sparse features are phrase pairs in translation table, and recurrent neural network is utilized to learn a smoothed translation score with the source and target side information. We conduct experiments on a Chinese-to-English translation task to test our proposed methods, and we get about 1.5 BLEU points improvement, compared with a state-of-the-art baseline system.",

In their work, initial word embedding is firstly trained with a huge mono-lingual corpus, then the word embedding is adapted and fine tuned bilingually in a context-depended DNN HMM framework. Word embeddings capturing lexical translation information and surrounding words modeling context information are leveraged to improve the word alignment performance. Unfortunately, the better word alignment result generated by this model, cannot bring significant performance improvement on a end-to-end SMT evaluation task.",

(2013) extend the recurrent neural network language model, in order to use both the source and target side information to scoring translation candidates. In their work, not only the target word embedding is used as the input of the network, but also the embedding of the source word, which is aligned to the current target word. To tackle the large search space due to the weak independence assumption, a lattice algorithm is proposed to rerank the n-best translation candidates, generated by a given SMT decoder.",
        "Liu et al. (2013) propose an additive neural network for SMT decoding. RNNLM (Mikolov et al., 2010) is firstly used to generate the source and target word embeddings, which are fed into a one-hidden-layer neural network to get a translation confidence score. Together with other commonly used features, the translation confidence score is integrated into a conventional log-linear model. The parameters are optimized with development data set using mini-batch conjugate sub-gradient method and a regularized ranking loss.",
        "DNN is also brought into the distortion modeling. Going beyond the previous work using boundary words for distortion modeling in BTG-based SMT decoder, Li et al. (2013) propose to apply recursive auto-encoder to make full use of the entire merged blocks. The recursive auto-encoder is trained with reordering examples extracted from word-aligned bilingual sentences. Given the representations of the smaller phrase pairs, recursive auto-encoder can generate the representation of the parent phrase pair with a re-ordering confidence score. The combination of reconstruction error and re-ordering error is used to be the objective function for the model training. 1492"

        "NN in detail in Section 3.3. 3.1 Recurrent Neural Network Recurrent neural network is usually used for sequence processing, such as language model (Mikolov et al., 2010). Commonly used sequence processing methods, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and n-gram language model, only use a limited history for the prediction. In HMM, the previous state is used as the history, and for n-gram language model (for example n equals to 3), the history is the previous two words. Recurrent neural network is proposed to use unbounded history information, and it has recurrent connections on hidden states, so that history information can be used circularly inside the network for arbitrarily long time. � � � ht−1 �t ht �t Figure 1: Recurrent neural network",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the network contains three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer is a concatenation of ht−1 and xt, where ht−1 is a real-valued vector, which is the history information from time 0 to t − 1. xt is the embedding of the input word at time t . Word embedding xt is integrated with previous history ht−1 to generate the current hidden layer, which is a new history vector ht . Based on ht , we can predict the probability of the next word, which forms the output layer yt . The new history ht is used for the future prediction, and updated with new information from word embedding xt recurrently. 3.2 Recursive Neural Network In addition to the sequential structure above, tree structure is also usually constructed in various NLP tasks, such as parsing and SMT decoding. To generate a tree structure, recursive neural networks are introduced for natural language parsing (Socher et al., 2011). Similar with recurrent neural networks, recursive neural networks can also use unbounded history information from the sub-tree rooted at the current node. The commonly used binary recursive neural networks generate the representation of the parent node, with the representations of two child nodes as the input. s[�,�] s[�,�] s[�,�] � �[�,�] Figure 2: Recursive neural network",

        "is the representation of the parent node, which could be a N P or V P node, and it is also the representation of the whole sub-tree covering from l to n . 3.3 Recursive Recurrent Neural Network Word embedding xt is integrated as new input information in recurrent neural networks for each prediction, but in recursive neural networks, no additional input information is used except the two representation vectors of the child nodes. However, some global information , which cannot be generated by the child representations, is crucial 1493 for SMT performance, such as language model score and distortion model score.

Forced decoding performs sentence pair segmen-tation using the same translation system as decoding. For each sentence pair in the training data, SMT decoder is applied to the source side, and any candidate which is not the partial sub-string of the target sentence is removed from the n-best list during decoding. From the forced decoding result, we can get the ideal derivation tree in the decoder’s search space, and extract positive/oracle translation candidates. 1495 4.3 Supervised Global Training The supervised local training uses the nodes/samples in the derivation tree of forced decoding to update the model, and the trained model tends to over-fit to local decisions. In this subsec-tion, a supervised global training is proposed to tune the model according to the final translation performance of the whole source sentence.",

Due to the inexac-t search nature of SMT decoding, search errors may inevitably break theoretical properties, and the final translation results may be not suitable for model training. To handle this problem, we use early update strategy for the supervised global training. Early update is testified to be useful for SMT training with large scale features (Yu et al., 2013). Instead of updating the model using the final translation results, early update approach optimizes the model, when the oracle translation candidate is pruned from the n-best list, meaning that, the model is updated once it performs a unrecoverable mistake. Back propagation is performed along the tree structure, and the phrase pair embeddings of the leaf nodess are updated.",

For each term, we have a vector with length 20 as parameters, so there are 20 × 500K parameters totally. But for source-target word pair, we may only have 7M bilingual corpus for training (taking IWSLT data set as an example), and there are 20 ×(500K)2 parameters to be tuned. For phrase pairs, the situation becomes even worse, especially when the limitation of word count in phrase pairs is relaxed. It is very difficult to learn the phrase pair embedding brute-forcedly as word embedding is learnt (Mikolov et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011), since we may not have enough training data.",
        "A simple approach to construct phrase pair embedding is to use the average of the embeddings of the words in the phrase pair. One problem is that, word embedding may not be able to model the translation relationship between source and target phrases at phrase level, since some phrases cannot be decomposed. For example, the meaning of ”hot dog” is not the composition of the meanings of the words ”hot” and ”dog”. In this section, we split the phrase pair embedding into two parts to model the translation confidence directly: translation confidence with sparse features and translation confidence with recurrent neural network. We first get two translation confidence vectors separately using sparse features and recurrent neural network, and then concatenate them to be the phrase pair embedding. We call it translation confidence based phrase pair embedding (TCBPPE). 1496 5.1 Translation Confidence with Sparse Features Large scale feature training has drawn more attentions these years (Liang et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2013). Instead of integrating the sparse features directly into the log-linear model, we use them as the input to learn a phrase pair embedding. For the top 200,000 frequent translation pairs, each of them is a feature in itself, and a special feature is added for all the infrequent ones.",

The features of the baseline are commonly used features as standard BTG decoder, such as translation probabilities, lexical weights, language model, word penalty and distortion probabilities. All these commonly used features are used as recurrent input vector x in our R2",

We first train the source and target word embeddings separately using large monolingual data, following (Collobert et al., 2011). Using monolingual word embedding as the initialization, we fine tune them to get bilingual word embedding (Yang et al., 2013).",

Therefore, the length of the phrase pair embedding is 20 × 4 = 80 .",

        "Word embedding can model translation relationship at word level, but it may not be powerful to model the phrase pair respondents at phrasal level, since the meaning of some phrases cannot be decomposed into the meaning of words. And also, translation task is difference from other NLP tasks, that, it is more important to model the translation confidence directly (the confidence of one target phrase as a translation of the source phrase), and our TCBPPE is designed for such purpose. 6.3 Effects of Global Recurrent Input Vector In order to compare R2",

TCBPPE based method drops about 3 BLEU points on both development and test data sets. When we remove the recurrent input vectors, the representations of recursive network are generated with the child nodes, and it does not integrate global information, such as language model and distortion model, which are crucial to the performance of SMT. 6.4 Sparse Features and Recurrent Network Features To test the contributions of sparse features and recurrent network features, we first remove all the recurrent network features to train and test our R2",
