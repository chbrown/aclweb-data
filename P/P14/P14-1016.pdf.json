        "While user attribute extraction on social media has received considerable attention, existing approaches, mostly supervised, encounter great difficulty in obtaining gold standard data and are therefore limited to predicting unary predicates (e.g., gender). In this paper, we present a weaklysupervised approach to user profile extraction from Twitter. Users’ profiles from social media websites such as Facebook or Google Plus are used as a distant source of supervision for extraction of their attributes from user-generated text. In addition to traditional linguistic features used in distant supervision for information extraction, our approach also takes into account network information, a unique opportunity offered by social media. We test our algorithm on three attribute domains: spouse, education and job; experimental results demonstrate our approach is able to make accurate predictions for users’ attributes based on their tweets.1"

        "Although profiles exist in an easy-to-use, structured data format, they are often sparsely populated; users rarely fully complete their online profiles. Additionally, some social networking services such as Twitter don’t support this type of structured profile data. It is therefore difficult to obtain a reasonably comprehensive profile of a user, or a reasonably complete facet of information (say, education level) for a class of users. While many users do not explicitly list all their personal information in their online profile, their user generated content often contains strong evidence to suggest many types of user attributes, for example education, spouse, and employment (See Table 1). Can one use such information to infer more details? In particular, can one exploit indirect clues from an unstructured data source like Twitter to obtain rich, structured user profiles?",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically extract Facebook-style pro-165 files directly from users’ tweets, thus making user profile data available in a structured format for upstream applications. We view user profile inference as a structured prediction task where both text and network information are incorporated. Concretely, we cast user profile prediction as binary relation extraction (Brin, 1999), e.g., SPOUSE(Useri, Userj), EDUCATION(Useri, Entityj) and EMPLOYER(Useri, Entityj). Inspired by the concept of distant supervision, we collect training tweets by matching attribute ground truth from an outside “knowledge base” such as Facebook or Google Plus.",
        "One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the first large-scale dataset on three general Twitter user profile domains (i.e., EDUCATION, JOB, SPOUSE). Experiments demonstrate that by simultaneously harnessing both text features and network information, our approach is able to make accurate user profile predictions. We are optimistic that our approach can easily be applied to further user attributes such as HOBBIES and INTERESTS (MOVIES, BOOKS, SPORTS or STARS), RELIGION, HOMETOWN, LIVING LOCA-TION, FAMILY MEMBERS and so on, where training data can be obtained by matching ground truth retrieved from multiple types of online social media such as Facebook, Google Plus, or LinkedIn. Our contributions are as follows:",
        "• We cast user profile prediction as an information extraction task.",

        "While user profile inference from social media has received considerable attention (Al Zamal et al., 2012; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Rao et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2011), most previous work has treated this as a classification task where the goal is to predict unary predicates describing attributes of the user. Examples include gender (Ciot et al., 2013; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012), age (Rao et al., 2010), or political polarity (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011).",
        "A significant challenge that has limited previous efforts in this area is the lack of available training data. For example, researchers obtain training data by employing workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually identify users’ gender from profile pictures (Ciot et al., 2013). This approach is appropriate for attributes such as gender with a small numbers of possible values (e.g., male or female), for which the values can be directly identified. However for attributes such as spouse or education there are many possible values, making it impossible to manually search for gold standard answers within a large number of tweets which may or may not contain sufficient evidence.",
        "Also related is the Twitter user timeline extraction algorithm of Li and Cardie (2013). This work is not focused on user attribute extraction, however. Distant Supervision Distant supervision, also known as weak supervision, is a method for learning to extract relations from text using ground truth from an existing database as a source of supervision. Rather than relying on mention-level annotations, which are expensive and time consuming to generate, distant supervision leverages readily available structured data sources as a weak source of supervision for relation extraction from related text corpora (Craven et al., 1999). For example, suppose r(e1, e2) = IsIn(P aris, F rance) is a ground tuple in the database and s =“Paris is the capital of France” contains synonyms for both “Paris” and “France”, then we assume that s may express the fact r(e1, e2) in some way and can be used as positive training examples. In addition to the wide use in text entity relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012), distant supervision has been applied to multiple 166 Figure 1: Illustration of Goolge Plus “knowledge base”. fields such as protein relation extraction (Craven et al., 1999; Ravikumar et al., 2012), event extraction from Twitter (Benson et al., 2011), sentiment analysis (Go et al., 2009) and Wikipedia infobox generation (Wu and Weld, 2007). Homophily Online social media offers a rich source of network information. McPherson et al. (2001) discovered that people sharing more attributes such as background or hobby have a higher chance of becoming friends in social media. This property, known as HOMOPHILY (summarized by the proverb “birds of a feather flock together”) (Al Zamal et al., 2012) has been widely applied to community detection (Yang and Leskovec, 2013) and friend recommendation (Guy et al., 2010) on social media. In the user attribute extraction literature, researchers have considered neighborhood context to boost inference accuracy (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Al Zamal et al., 2012), where information about the degree of their connectivity to their pre-labeled users is included in the feature vectors. A related algorithm by Mislove et al. (2010) crawled Facebook profiles of 4,000 Rice University students and alumni and in-ferred attributes such as major and year of matriculation purely based on network information. Mislove’s work does not consider the users’ text stream, however. As we demonstrate below, relying solely on network information is not enough to enable inference about attributes."

Note that the number of positive entities (3,121) is greater than the number of users as (1) one user can have multiple spouses at different periods of time (2) multiple entities may point to the same individual, e.g., BarackObama, Barack Obama and Barack."

Features we explore also include whether Ci’s twitter ID appears in e’s corpus. 4.3 Training We separately trained three classifiers regarding the three attributes. All variables are observed during training; we therefore take a feature-based approach to learning structure prediction models inspired by structure compilation (Liang et al., 2008). In our setting, a subset of the features (those based on network information) are computed based on predictions that will need to be made at test time, but are observed during training. This simplified approach to learning avoids expensive inference; at test time, however, we still need to jointly predict the best attribute values for friends as is described in section 4.4. 4.4 Inference Job and Education Our inference algorithm for Job/Education is performed on two settings, depending on whether neighbor information is 169 observed (NEIGH-OBSERVED) or latent (NEIGH-LATENT). Real world applications, where network information can be partly retrieved from all types of social networks, can always falls in between.",

The objective function for joint inference would be difficult to optimize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale to network of the size we consider. Instead, we use a sieve-based greedy search approach to inference (shown in Figure 3) inspired by recent work on coreference resolution (Raghunathan et al., 2010). Attributes are initialized using only text features, maximizing Ψtext(e, Xi), and ignoring network information. Then for each user we iteratively reestimate their profile given both their text features and network features (computed based on the current predictions made for their friends) which provide additional evidence.",
        "In this way, highly confident predictions will be made strictly from text in the first round, then the network can either support or contradict low confidence predictions as more decisions are made. This process continues until no changes are made at which point the algorithm terminates. We empirically found it to work well in practice.

        "• Only-Text: A simplified version of our algorithm where network/neighbor influence is ignored. Classifier is trained and tested only based on text features.",
        "• NELL: For Job and Education, candidate is selected as attribute value once it matches bag of words in the list of universities or companies borrowed from NELL. For Education, the list is extended by alias identification based on Freebase. For Job, we also fetch the name abbreviations15",
        ". NELL is only implemented for Education and Job attribute. For each setting from each approach, we report the (P)recision, (R)ecall and (F)1-score. For LOCAL setting, we report the performance for both entity-level prediction (Entity) and posting-level prediction (Tweet). Results for Education, Job and Spouse from different approaches appear in Table 4, 5 and 6 respectively. Local or Global For horizontal comparison, we observe that GLOBAL obtains a higher Precision score but a lower Recall than LOCAL(ENTITY). This can be explained by the fact that LOCAL(U) sets zk",
        "i,e = 1 once one posting x ∈ Le",
        "i is identified as attribute related, while GLOBAL tend to be more meticulous by considering the conjunctive feature space from all postings. Homophile effect In agreement with our expectation, NEIGH-OBSERVED performs better than NEIGH-LATENT since erroneous predictions in 15 http://www.abbreviations.com/ NEIGH-LATENT setting will have negative influence on further prediction during the greedy search process. Both NEIGH-OBSERVED and NEIGH-LATENT where network information is harnessed, perform better than Only-Text, which the prediction is made independently on user’s text features. The improvement of NEIGH-OBSERVED over Only-Text is 22.7% and 6.4% regarding F1 score for Education and Job respectively, which further illustrate the usefulness of making use of Homophile effect for attribute inference on online social media. It is also interesting to note the improvement much more significant in Education inference than Job inference. This is in accord with what we find in Section 5.2, where education network exhibits stronger HOMOPHILE property than Job network, enabling a significant benefit for education inference, but limited for job inference.",
        "Spouse prediction also benefits from neighboring effect and the improvement is about 12% for LOCAL(ENTITY) setting. Unlike Education and Job prediction, for which in NEIGH-OBSERVED setting all neighboring variables are observed, network variables are hidden during spouse prediction. By considering network information, the model benefits from evident clues offered by tweet corpus of user e’s spouse when making prediction for e, but also suffers when erroneous decision are made and then used for downstream predictions. NELL Baseline Notably, NELL achieves high-est Recall score for Education inference. It is also worth noting that most of education mentions that NELL fails to retrieve are those in-volve irregular spellings, such as HarvardUniv and Cornell U, which means Recall score for NELL baseline would be even higher if these irregular spellings are recognized in a more sophisticated system. The reason for such high recall is that as our ground truths are obtained from Google plus, the users from which are mostly affiliated with decent schools found in NELL dictionary. However, the high recall from NELL is sacrificed at precision, as users can mention school entities in many of situations, such as paying a visit or reporting some relevant news. NELL will erroneously classify these cases as attribute mentions.",
        "NELL does not work out for Job, with a fairly poor 0.0156 F1 score for LOCAL(ENTITY) and 0.163 for LOCAL(TWEET).

Vertical Comparison: Education, Job and Spouse Job prediction turned out to be much more difficult than Education, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. Explanations are as follows: (1) Job contains a much greater diversity of mentions than Education. Education inference can benefit a lot from the dictionary relevant feature which Job may not. (2) Education mentions are usually associated with clear evidence such as homework, exams, studies, cafeteria or books, while situations are much more complicated for job as vocabularies are usually specific for different types of jobs. (3) The boundary between a user working in and a fun for a specific operation is usually ambiguous. For example, a Google engineer may constantly update information about outcome products of Google, so does a big fun. If the aforementioned engineer barely tweets about working conditions or colleagues (which might still be ambiguous), his tweet collection, which contains many of mentions about outcomes of Google product, will be significantly similar to tweets published by a Google fun. Such nuisance can be partly solved by the consideration of network information, but not totally.",
        "The relatively high F1 score for spouse prediction is largely caused by the great many of nonindividual related entities in the dataset, the identification of which would be relatively simpler. A deeper look at the result shows that the classifier frequently makes wrong decisions for entities such as userID and name entities. Significant as some spouse relevant features are, such as love, husband, child, in most circumstances, spouse mentions are extremely hard to recognize. For example, in tweets “Check this out, @alancross, it’s awesome bit.ly/1bnjYHh.” or “Happy Birth-day @alancross !”. alancross can reasonably be any option among current user’s friend, colleague, parents, child or spouse. Repeated mentions add no confidence. Although we can identify alancross as spouse attribute once it jointly appear with other strong spouse indicators, they are still many cases where they never co-appear. How to integrate more useful side information for spouse recognition constitutes our future work."
