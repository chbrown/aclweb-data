        "Many problems in natural language processing can be viewed as stochastically mapping one string to another: e.g., transliteration, pronuncia-tion modeling, phonology, morphology, spelling correction, and text normalization. Ristad and Yianilos (1998) describe how to train the parameters of a stochastic editing process that moves through the input string x from left to right, transforming it into the output string y. In this paper we generalize this process so that the edit probabilities are conditioned on input and output context.",
        "We further show how to model the conditional distribution p(y | x) as a probabilistic finite-state transducer (PFST), which can be easily combined with other transducers or grammars for particular applications. We contrast our probabilistic transducers with the more general framework of weighted finite-state transducers (WFST), explain-ing why our restriction provides computational advantages when reasoning about unknown strings.",
        "Constructing the finite-state transducer is tricky, so we give the explicit construction for use by others. We describe how to train its parameters when the contextual edit probabilities are given by a log-linear model. We provide a library for training both PFSTs and WFSTs that works with OpenFST (Allauzen et al., 2007), and we illustrate its use with simple experiments on typos, which demonstrate the benefit of context."

        "Consider a stochastic edit process that reads input string x while writing output string y. Having read the prefixx0:i and written the prefixy0:j, the process must stochastically choose one of the following 2|Σy| + 1 edit operations: • DELETE: Read xi+1 but write nothing. • INSERT(t) for some t ∈ Σy: Write yj+1 = t without reading anything. • SUBST(t) for some t ∈ Σy: Read xi+1 and write yj+1 = t. Note that the traditional COPY operation is obtained as SUBST(xi+1). In the special case where xi+1 = EOS, the choices are instead INSERT(t) and HALT (where the latter may be viewed as copying the EOS symbol).",

        "Note that the probability cannot be conditioned on right output context because those characters have not yet been chosen. Ordinary stochastic edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998) is simply the case (N1, N2, N3) = (0, 1, 0), while Bouchard-Côté et al. (2007) used roughly (1, 2, 0).",

It is a finite directed multigraph where each arc is labeled with an input in Σx ∪ {ε}, an output in Σy ∪{ε}, and a probability in [0, 1]. (ε is the empty string.)

The canonical case of this involves an loop q → q with input label ε and probability 1.) We take the first two conditions to be part of the definition of a PFST. The final condition requires our PFST to be “tight” in the same sense as a PCFG (Chi and Geman, 1998), although the tightness conditions for a PCFG are more complex.

However, we give a more efficient design where in the course of reaching qC , the PFST has already read s and indeed the entire right input context C2 = xi:(i+N2). So our PFST’s input and output actions are “out of sync”: its read head is N2 characters ahead of its write head.
