        "Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) is a framework of natural language semantics with easy-to-process structures as well as strict semantics. In this paper, we equip the DCS framework with logical inference, by defining abstract denotations as an abstraction of the computing process of denotations in original DCS. An inference engine is built to achieve inference on abstract denotations. Furthermore, we propose a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference, by combining our framework with the idea of tree transformation.

        "Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) provides an intuitive way to model semantics of questions, by using simple dependency-like trees (Liang et al., 2011). It is expressive enough to represent complex natural language queries on a relational database, yet simple enough to be latently learned from question-answer pairs. In this paper, we equip DCS with logical inference, which, in one point of view, is “the best way of testing an NLP system’s semantic capacity” (Cooper et al., 1996).",
        "It should be noted that, however, a framework primarily designed for question answering is not readily suited for logical inference. Because, answers returned by a query depend on the specific database, but implication is independent of any databases. For example, answers to the question “ What books are read by students?”, should always be a subset of answers to “ What books are ever read by anyone?”, no matter how we store the data of students and how many records of books are there in our database.",
        "Thus, our first step is to fix a notation which abstracts the calculation process of DCS trees, so as to clarify its meaning without the aid of any exist-ing database. The idea is to borrow a minimal set of operators from relational algebra (Codd, 1970), which is already able to formulate the calculation in DCS and define abstract denotation, which is an abstraction of the computation of denotations guided by DCS trees. Meanings of sentences then can be represented by primary relations among abstract denotations. This formulation keeps the simpleness and computability of DCS trees mostly unaffected; for example, our semantic calculation for DCS trees is parallel to the denotation computation in original DCS.",
        "An inference engine is built to handle inference on abstract denotations. Moreover, to compensate the lack of background knowledge in practical inference, we combine our framework with the idea of tree transformation (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), to propose a way of generating knowledge in logical representation from entailment rules (Szpektor et al., 2007), which are by now typically considered as syntactic rewriting rules.",
        "We test our system on FraCaS (Cooper et al., 1996) and PASCAL RTE datasets (Dagan et al., 2006). The experiments show: (i) a competitive performance on FraCaS dataset; (ii) a big impact of our automatically generated on-the-fly knowledge in achieving high recall for a logic-based RTE system; and (iii) a result that outperforms state-of-the-art RTE system on RTE5 data.

Table 1: Databases of student, book, and read 2.1 DCS trees DCS trees has been proposed to represent natural language semantics with a structure similar to dependency trees (Liang et al., 2011) (Figure 1). For the sentence “ students read books”, imagine a database consists of three tables, namely, a set of students, a set of books, and a set of “reading” events (Table 1). The DCS tree in Figure 1 is in-terpreted as a command for querying these tables, obtaining “reading” entries whose “ SUBJ” field is student and whose “ OBJ” field is book. The result is a set {John reads Ulysses, . . .}, which is called a denotation.",
        "DCS trees can be extended to represent linguistic phenomena such as quantification and coreference, with additional markers introducing additional operations on tables. Figure 2 shows an example with a quantifier “every”, which is marked as “ ⊂” on the edge (love)OBJ-ARG(dog) and in-terpreted as a division operator qOBJ",

        "The strict semantics of DCS trees brings us the idea of applying DCS to logical inference. This is not trivial, however, because DCS works under the assumption that databases are explicitly available. Obviously this is unrealistic for logical inference on unrestricted texts, because we cannot prepare a database for everything in the world. This fact fairly restricts the applicable tasks of DCS.",
        "Our solution is to redefine DCS trees without the aid of any databases, by considering each node of a DCS tree as a content word in a sentence (but may no longer be a table in a specific database), while each edge represents semantic relations between two words.

        ". To formulate the database querying process defined by a DCS tree, we provide formal semantics to DCS trees by employing relational algebra (Codd, 1970) for representing the query. As described below, we represent meanings of sentences with abstract denotations, and logical relations among sentences are computed as relations among their abstract denotations. In this way, we can perform inference over formulas of relational algebra, without computing database entries explicitly. 2.2 Abstract denotations Abstract denotations are formulas constructed from a minimal set of relational algebra (Codd, 1970) operators, which is already able to formulate the database queries defined by DCS trees.",
        "For example, the semantics of “ students read books” is given by the abstract denotation: F1 = read ∩ (studentSUBJ × bookOBJ), where read, student and book denote sets represented by these words respectively, and wr represents the set w considered as the domain of the semantic role r (e.g. bookOBJ is the set of books considered as objects). The operators ∩ and × represent intersection and Cartesian product respectively, both borrowed from relational algebra. It is not hard to see the abstract denotation denotes the intersection of the “ reading” set (as illustrated by the “ read” table in Table 1) with the product of “ student” set and “ book” set, which results in the same denotation as computed by the DCS tree in Figure 1, i.e. {John reads Ulysses, . . .}.

An abstract denotation is then defined as finite applications of functions on either constants or other abstract denotations. 2.3 Statements As the semantics of DCS trees is formulated by abstract denotations, the meanings of declarative sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations. Statements are declarations of some relations among abstract denotations, for which we consider the following set relations: Non-emptiness A ̸= ∅: the set A is not empty. Subsumption A ⊂ B: set A is subsumed by B.3 Roughly speaking, the relations correspond to the logical concepts satisfiability and entailment.",

In this logical system, we treat abstract denotations as terms and statements as atomic sentences, which are far more easier to handle than first order predicate logic (FOL) formulas. Furthermore, all implemented axioms are horn clauses, hence we can employ forward-chaining, which is very efficient. 2.5 Extensions Further extensions of our framework are made to deal with additional linguistic phenomena, as briefly explained below. Negation To deal with negation in our forwardchaining inference engine, we introduce one more relation on abstract denotations, namely disjointness A ∥ B, meaning that A and B are disjoint sets. Using disjointness we implemented two types of negations: (i) atomic negation, for each content word w we allow negation w̄ of that word, characterized by the property w ∥ w̄; and (ii) root negation, for a DCS tree T and its denotation [[T ]], the negation of T is represented by T ∥ T , meaning that T = ∅ in its effect.

In the current system, we implement (i) superlatives, e.g. shighest(mountain ∩ (WARG × AsiaMOD)) (the highest mountain in Asia) and (ii) numerics, e.g. stwo(pet ∩ fish) (two pet fish), where sf is a selection marker. Selection operators are implemented as markers assigned to abstract denotations, with specially designed axioms. For example superlatives satisfy the following property: A ⊂ B & shighest(B) ⊂ A ⇒ shighest(B) = shighest(A). New rules can be added if necessary. Coreference We use Stanford CoreNLP to resolve coreferences (Raghunathan et al., 2010), whereas coreference is implemented as a special type of selection. If a node σ in a DCS tree T be-longs to a mention cluster m, we take the abstract denotation [[Tσ]] and make a selection sm([[Tσ]]), which is regarded as the abstract denotation of that mention. Then all selections of the same mention cluster are declared to be equal."

        "6. Convert accepted path alignments into statements on abstract denotations, use them in logical inference as new knowledge, and try to prove H again. 3.1 Generating path alignments On-the-fly knowledge is generated by aligning paths in DCS trees. A path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node. For example, Figure 5 shows DCS trees of the following sentences (a simplified pair from RTE2-dev): T: Tropical storm Debby is blamed for deaths. H: A storm has caused loss of life. The germ OBJ(blame) and germ ARG(death) in DCS tree of T are joined by the underscored path. Two paths are aligned if the joined germs are aligned, and we impose constraints on aligned germs to inhibit meaningless alignments, as described below. 3.2 Aligning germs by logical clues Two germs are aligned if they are both at leaf nodes (e.g. ARG(death) in T and ARG(life) in H, Figure 5), or they already have part of their meanings in common, by some logical clues. 83  storm T : H : ARG blame deathDebbyARG ARGOBJ stormARG ARG IOBJ tropicalARG MOD cause loss life ARGSUBJ ARGMOD OBJ Figure 5: Aligned paths (underscored by the solid lines) and aligned germs (joined by the dotted line)",
        "To formulate this properly, we define the abstract denotation of a germ, which, intuitively, represents the meaning of the germ in the specific sentence. The abstract denotation of a germ is defined in a top-down manner: for the root node ρ of a DCS tree T , we define its denotation [[ρ]]T as the denotation of the entire tree [[T ]]; for a non-root node τ and its parent node σ, let the edge (σ, τ ) be labeled by semantic roles (r, r′",
        "), then define [[τ ]]T = [[Tτ ]] ∩ (ιr′(πr([[σ]]T )) × WRτ \\r′). Now for a germ r(σ), the denotation is defined as the projection of the denotation of node σ onto the specific semantic roler: [[r(σ)]]T = πr([[σ]]T ).",
        "For example, the abstract denotation of germ ARG(book) in Figure 1 is defined asπARG(book ∩ πOBJ(read ∩ (studentSUBJ × bookOBJ))), meaning “ books read by students”. Similarly, denotation of germ OBJ(blame) in T of Figure 5 indicates the object of “ blame” as in the sentence “ Tropical storm Debby is blamed for death”, which is a tropical storm, is Debby, etc. Technically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values (Liang et al., 2011) of that variable.",
        "The logical clue to align germs is: if there exists an abstract denotation, other than W , that is a superset of both abstract denotations of two germs, then the two germs can be aligned. A simple example is that ARG(storm) in T can be aligned to ARG(storm) in H, because their denotations have a common superset other than W , namely πARG(storm). A more complicated example is that OBJ(blame) and SUBJ(cause) can be aligned, because inference can induce [[OBJ(blame)]]T = [[ARG(Debby)]]T = [[ARG(storm)]]T, as well as [[SUBJ(cause)]]H = [[ARG(storm)]]H, so they also have the common superset πARG(storm). However, for example, logical clues can avoid aligning ARG(storm) to ARG(loss), which is obviously  T : T' : What is tropical storm, Debby, and is blamed for death ]][[ What is tropical storm, Debby,",
        "and cause loss of life ]][[⊂ blame deathDebbyARG ARGOBJ stormARG ARG IOBJ tropicalARG MOD cause loss life ARGSUBJ ARGMOD OBJ DebbyARG stormARG ARG tropicalARG MOD Figure 6: Tree transformation and generated on-the-fly knowledge (subsumption of denotations shown above the trees) meaningless. 3.3 Scoring path alignments by similarity Aligned paths are evaluated by a similarity score, for which we use distributional similarity of the words that appear in the paths (§4.1). Only path alignments with high similarity scores can be accepted. Also, we only accept paths of length ≤ 5, to prevent too long paths to be aligned. 3.4 Applying path alignments Accepted aligned paths are converted into statements, which are used as new knowledge. The conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs. For example, to apply the aligned path pair generated in Figure 5, we use it to transform T into a new tree T’ (Figure 6), and then the aligned germs, OBJ(blame) in T and SUBJ(cause) in T’, will generate the on-the-fly knowledge: [[OBJ(blame)]]T ⊂ [[SUBJ(cause)]]T’.",
        "Similar to the tree transformation based approach to RTE (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), this process can also utilize lexical-syntactic entailment rules (Szpektor et al., 2007). Furthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by transformed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are preserved: in Figure 6, though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule “ X is blamed for death → X causes loss of life”, the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby. Hence, the process can also be used to generate knowledge from context sensitive rules (Melamud et al., 2013), which are known to have higher quality (Pantel et al., 2007; Clark and Harrison, 2009).",
        "However, it should be noted that using on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference is not a trivial 84 task. For example, the FOL formula of the rule “ X is blamed for death → X causes loss of life” is: ∀x; (∃a; blame(x, a) & death(a)) → (∃b, c; cause(x, b) & loss(b, c) & lif e(c)), which is not a horn clause. The FOL formula for the context-preserved rule in Figure 6 is even more involved. Still, it can be efficiently treated by our inference engine because as a statement, the formula [[OBJ(blame)]]T ⊂ [[SUBJ(cause)]]T’ is an atomic sentence, more than a horn clause."

Lewis13 70 50 MacCartney07 84.1 - MacCartney08 97.7 - Our Sys. 79.5 80.0 Table 4: Accuracy (%) on FraCaS the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system without on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal semantics. To obtain the three-valued output (i.e. yes, no, and unknown), we output “ yes” if H is proven, or try to prove the negation of H if H is not proven. To negate H, we use the root negation as described in §2.5. If the negation of H is proven, we output “ no”, otherwise we output “ unknown”.",
        "The result is shown in Table 4. Since our system uses an off-the-shelf dependency parser, and semantic representations are obtained from simple rule-based conversion from dependency trees, there will be only one (right or wrong) interpretation in face of ambiguous sentences. Still, our system outperforms Lewis and Steedman (2013)’s probabilistic CCG-parser. Compared to MacCartney and Manning (2007) and MacCartney and Manning (2008), our system does not need a pretrained alignment model, and it improves by making multi-sentence inferences. To sum up, the result shows that DCS is good at handling universal quantifiers and negations.",
        "Most errors are due to wrongly generated DCS trees (e.g. wrongly assigned semantic roles) or unimplemented quantifier triggers (e.g. “neither”) or generalized quantifiers (e.g. “at least a few”). These could be addressed by future work. 4.3 Experiments on PASCAL RTE datasets On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005), so on-the-fly knowledge is crucial in this setting. We test the effect of on-the-fly knowledge on RTE2, RTE3, RTE4 and RTE5 datasets, and compare our system with other approaches. 4.3.1 Impact of on-the-fly knowledge Results on test data are shown in Table 5. When only primary knowledge is used in inference (the first row), recalls are actually very low; After we activate the on-the-fly knowledge, recalls jump to over 50%, with a moderate fall of precision. As a result, accuracies significantly increase. 85",

Bos06 (Bos and Markert, 2006) is a hybrid system combining deep features from a theorem prover and a model builder, together with shallow features such as lexical overlap and text length. MacCartney08 (MacCartney and Manning, 2008) uses natural logic to calculate inference relations between two superficially aligned sentences. Clark08 (Clark and Harrison, 2008) is a logic-based system utilizing various resources including WordNet and DIRT paraphrases (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and is tolerant to partially unproven H sentences in some degree. All of the three systems pursue a logical approach, while combining various techniques to achieve robustness. The result shows that our system has comparable performance. On the other hand, Wang10 (Wang and Manning, 2010) learns a tree-edit model from training data, and captures entailment relation by tree edit distance. Stern11 (Stern and Dagan, 2011) and Stern12 (Stern et al., 2012) extend this framework to utilize entailment rules as tree transformations. These are more tailored systems using machine learning with many handcrafted features. Still, our unsupervised system outperforms the state-of-the-art on RTE5 dataset. 4.3.3 Analysis Summing up test data from RTE2 to RTE5, Figure 7 shows the proportion of all proven pairs and their precision. Less than 5% pairs can be proven primarily, with a precision of 77%. Over 40% pairs can be proven by one piece of on-the-fly knowledge, yet pairs do exist in which more than 2 pieces are necessary. The precisions of 1 and 2 pieces on-the-fly knowledge application are over  0 1 2 >=3",

As a comparison, Dinu and Wang (2009) studied the proportion of proven pairs and precision by applying DIRT rules to tree skeletons in RTE2 and RTE3 data. The proportion is 8% with precision 65% on RTE2, and proportion 6% with precision 72% on RTE3. Applied by our logical system, the noisy on-the-fly knowledge can achieve a precision comparable to higher quality resources such as DIRT.",
        "A major type of error is caused by the ignorance of semantic roles in calculation of similarity scores. For example, though “ Italy beats Kazakhstan” is not primarily proven from “ Italy is defeated by Kazakhstan”, our system does produce the path alignment “ SUBJ(beat)OBJ ≈ OBJ(defeat)SUBJ” with a high similarity score. The impact of such errors depends on the data making methodology, though. It lowers precisions in RTE2 and RTE3 data, particularly in “IE” sub-task (where precisions drop under 0.5). On the other hand, it occurs less often in “IR” subtask.",
        "Finally, to see if we “get lucky” on RTE5 data in the choice of word vectors and thresholds, we change the thresholds from 0.1 to 0.7 and draw the precision-recall curve, using two types of word vectors, Mikolov13 and Turian10. As shown in Figure 8, though the precision drops for Turian10, both curves show the pattern that our system keeps gaining recall while maintaining precision to a certain level. Not too much “magic” in Mikolov13 actually: for over 80% pairs, every node in DCS tree of H can be covered by a path of length ≤ 5 that 86  0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 Mikolov13 Turian10 Recall P r e c i s i o n Figure 8: Precision-Recall curve. has a corresponding path of length ≤ 5 in T with a similarity score > 0.4."

      "paragraphs": [
        "We have presented a method of deriving abstract denotation from DCS trees, which enables logical inference on DCS, and we developed a textual inference system based on the framework. Experimental results have shown the power of the representation that allows both strict inference as on FraCaS data and robust reasoning as on RTE data.",
        "Exploration of an appropriate meaning representation for querying and reasoning on knowledge bases has a long history. Description logic, being less expressive than FOL but featuring more efficient reasoning, is used as a theory base for Semantic Web (W3C, 2012). Ideas similar to our framework, including the use of sets in a representation that benefits efficient reasoning, are also found in description logic and knowledge representation community (Baader et al., 2003; Sowa, 2000; Sukkarieh, 2003). To our knowledge, how-ever, their applications to logical inference beyond the use for database querying have not been much explored in the context of NLP.",
        "The pursue of a logic more suitable for natural language inference is not new. For instance, MacCartney and Manning (2008) has implemented a model of natural logic (Lakoff, 1970). While being computationally efficient, various inference patterns are out of the scope of their system.",
        "Much work has been done in mapping natural language into database queries (Cai and Yates, 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Poon, 2013). Among these, the (λ-)DCS (Liang et al., 2011; Berant et al., 2013) framework defines algorithms that transparently map a labeled tree to a database querying procedure. Essentially, this is because DCS trees restrict the querying process to a very limited subset of possible operations. Our main contribution, the abstract denotation of DCS trees, can thus be considered as an attempt to characterize a fragment of FOL that is suited for both natural language inference and transparent syntax-semantics mapping, through the choice of operations and relations on sets.",
        "We have demonstrated the utility of logical inference on DCS through the RTE task. A wide variety of strategies tackling the RTE task have been investigated (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010), including the comparison of surface strings (Jijkoun and De Rijke, 2005), syntactic and semantic structures (Haghighi et al., 2005; Snow et al., 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2009; Burchardt et al., 2009; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Wang and Manning, 2010), semantic vectors (Erk and Padó, 2009) and logical representations (Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al., 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005). Acquisition of basic knowledge for RTE is also a huge stream of research (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Sudo et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Fujita et al., 2012; Weisman et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2013). These previous works include various techniques for acquir-ing and incorporating different kinds of linguistic and world knowledge, and further fight against the knowledge bottleneck problem, e.g. by back-off to shallower representations.",
        "Logic-based RTE systems employ various approaches to bridge knowledge gaps. Bos and Markert (2005) proposes features from a model builder; Raina et al. (2005) proposes an abduction process; Tatu and Moldovan (2006) shows handcrafted rules could drastically improve the performance of a logic-based RTE system.",
        "As such, our current RTE system is at a proof-of-concept stage, in that many of the above techniques are yet to be implemented. Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize that it already shows performance competitive to state-of-the-art systems on one data set (RTE5). Other directions of our future work include further exploitation of the new semantic representation. For example, since abstract denotations are readily suited for data querying, they can be used to verify newly generated assumptions by fact search in a database. This may open a way towards a hybrid approach to RTE wherein logical inference is intermingled with large scale database querying.
