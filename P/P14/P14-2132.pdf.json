        "Recent work has sparked new interest in type-supervised part-of-speech tagging, a data setting in which no labeled sentences are available, but the set of allowed tags is known for each word type. This paper describes observational initialization, a novel technique for initializing EM when training a type-supervised HMM tagger. Our initializer allocates probability mass to unambiguous transitions in an unlabeled corpus, generating token-level observations from type-level supervision. Experimentally, observational initialization gives state-of-the-art type-supervised tagging accuracy, providing an error reduction of 56% over uniform initialization on the Penn English Treebank."

        "For many languages, there exist comprehensive dictionaries that list the possible parts-of-speech for each word type, but there are no corpora labeled with the part-of-speech of each token in context. Type-supervised tagging (Merialdo, 1994) explores this scenario; a model is provided with type-level information, such as the fact that “only” can be an adjective, adverb, or conjunction, but not any token-level information about which in-stances of “only” in a corpus are adjectives. Recent research has focused on using type-level supervision to infer token-level tags. For instance, Li et al. (2012) derive type-level supervision from Wiktionary, Das and Petrov (2011) and Täckström et al. (2013) project type-level tag sets across languages, and Garrette and Baldridge (2013) solicit type-level annotations directly from speakers. In all of these efforts, a probabilistic sequence model is trained to disambiguate token-level tags that are",

        "A hidden Markov model (HMM) can be used to disambiguate tags of individual tokens by maximizing corpus likelihood using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Our approach is motivated by a suite of oracle experiments that demonstrate the effect of initialization on the final tagging accuracy of an EM-trained HMM tagger. We show that initializing EM with accurate transition model parameters is sufficient to guide learning toward a high-accuracy final model.",
        "Inspired by this finding, we introduce observational initialization, which is a simple method to heuristically estimate transition parameters for a corpus using type-level supervision. Transi-tion probabilities are estimated from unambiguous consecutive tag pairs that arise when two consecutive words each have only a single allowed tag. These unambiguous word pairs can be tagged correctly without any statistical inference. Initializing EM with the relative frequency of these unambiguous pairs improves tagging accuracy dramatically over uniform initialization, reducing errors by 56% in English and 29% in German. This efficient and data-driven approach gives the best reported tagging accuracy for type-supervised sequence models, outperforming the minimized model of Ravi and Knight (2009), the Bayesian LDA-based model of Toutanova and Johnson (2008), and an HMM trained with language-specific initialization described by Goldberg et al. (2008)."

For example, before running a document clustering algorithm on a fixed corpus of documents, it may be useful to tag each word with its most likely part-of-speech in context, disambiguating the lexical features in a bag-of-words representation. In corpus analysis or genre detection, it may be useful to determine for a fixed corpus the most common part-of-speech for each word type, which could be inferred by tagging each word with its most likely part-of-speech. In both cases, the set of sentences to tag is known in advance of learning."

The Bayesian HMM model predicts tag sequences via Gibbs sampling, integrating out model parameters. The Bayesian LDA-based model of Toutanova and Johnson (2008) models ambiguity classes of words, which allows information shar-ing among words in the tag dictionary. In addition, it incorporates morphology features and a sparse prior of tags for a word. Inference approximations are required to predict tags, integrating out model parameters.",
        "Ravi and Knight (2009) employs integer linear programming to select a minimal set of parameters that can generate the test sentences, followed by EM to set parameter values. This technique requires the additional information of which sentences will be used for evaluation, and its scalabil-ity is limited. In addition, this work used a subset of the WSJ Penn Treebank for training and selecting a tag dictionary. This restriction actually tends to improve performance, because a smaller tag dictionary further constrains model optimiza-tion. We compare directly to their training set, kindly provided to us by the authors.",

(2008) is most similar to the current work, in that it estimates maximum likelihood parameters of an HMM using EM, but starting with a wellchosen initialization with language specific linguistic knowledge. That work estimates emission distributions using a combination of suffix morphology rules and corpus context counts.",
