        "We introduce the problem of generation in distributional semantics: Given a distributional vector representing some meaning, how can we generate the phrase that best expresses that meaning? We motivate this novel challenge on theoretical and practical grounds and propose a simple data-driven approach to the estimation of generation functions. We test this in a monolingual scenario (paraphrase generation) as well as in a cross-lingual setting (translation by synthesizing adjective-noun phrase vectors in English and generating the equivalent expressions in Italian)."

        "Distributional methods for semantics approximate the meaning of linguistic expressions with vectors that summarize the contexts in which they occur in large samples of text. This has been a very successful approach to lexical semantics (Erk, 2012), where semantic relatedness is assessed by compar-ing vectors. Recently these methods have been extended to phrases and sentences by means of composition operations (see Baroni (2013) for an overview). For example, given the vectors representing red and car, composition derives a vector that approximates the meaning of red car.",
        "However, the link between language and meaning is, obviously, bidirectional: As message recipients we are exposed to a linguistic expression and we must compute its meaning (the synthesis problem). As message producers we start from the meaning we want to communicate (a “thought”) and we must encode it into a word sequence (the generation problem). If distributional semantics is to be considered a proper semantic theory, then it must deal not only with synthesis (going from words to vectors), but also with generation (from vectors to words).",
        "Besides these theoretical considerations, phrase generation from vectors has many useful applications. We can, for example, synthesize the vector representing the meaning of a phrase or sentence, and then generate alternative phrases or sentences from this vector to accomplish true paraphrase generation (as opposed to paraphrase detection or ranking of candidate paraphrases).",
        "Generation can be even more useful when the source vector comes from another modality or language. Recent work on grounding language in vision shows that it is possible to represent images and linguistic expressions in a common vector-based semantic space (Frome et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013). Given a vector representing an image, generation can be used to productively construct phrases or sentences that describe the image (as opposed to simply retrieving an existing description from a set of candidates). Translation is another potential application of the generation framework: Given a semantic space shared between two or more languages, one can compose a word sequence in one language and generate translations in another, with the shared semantic vector space functioning as interlingua.",
        "Distributional semantics assumes a lexicon of atomic expressions (that, for simplicity, we take to be words), each associated to a vector. Thus, at the single-word level, the problem of generation is solved by a trivial generation-by-synthesis approach: Given an arbitrary target vector, “generate” the corresponding word by searching through the lexicon for the word with the closest vector to the target. This is however unfeasible for larger expressions: Given n vocabulary elements, this approach requires checking nk",
        "phrases of length k. This becomes prohibitive already for relatively short phrases, as reasonably-sized vocabularies do not go below tens of thousands of words. The search space for 3-word phrases in a 10K-word vocabulary is already in the order of trillions. In 624 this paper, we introduce a more direct approach to phrase generation, inspired by the work in compositional distributional semantics. In short, we revert the composition process and we propose a framework of data-induced, syntax-dependent functions that decompose a single vector into a vector sequence. The generated vectors can then be efficiently matched against those in the lexicon or fed to the decomposition system again to produce longer phrases recursively."

        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly and systematically pursue the generation problem in distributional semantics. Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) use top-level, composed distributed representations of sentences to guide generation in a machine translation setting. More precisely, they condition the target language model on the composed representation (addition of word vectors) of the source language sentence.",
        "Andreas and Ghahramani (2013) discuss the the issue of generating language from vectors and present a probabilistic generative model for distributional vectors. However, their emphasis is on reversing the generative story in order to derive composed meaning representations from word sequences. The theoretical generating capabilities of the methods they propose are briefly exemplified, but not fully explored or tested.",
        "Socher et al. (2011) come closest to our target problem. They introduce a bidirectional language-to-meaning model for compositional distributional semantics that is similar in spirit to ours. However, we present a clearer decoupling of synthesis and generation and we use different (and simpler) training methods and objective functions. More-over, Socher and colleagues do not train separate decomposition rules for different syntactic configurations, so it is not clear how they would be able to control the generation of different output structures. Finally, the potential for generation is only addressed in passing, by presenting a few cases where the generated sequence has the same syntactic structure of the input sequence."

      "paragraphs": [
        "We start by presenting the familiar synthesis setting, focusing on two-word phrases. We then introduce generation for the same structures. Finally, we show how synthesis and generation of longer phrases is handled by recursive extension of the two-word case. We assume a lexicon L, that is, a bi-directional look-up table containing a list of words Lw linked to a matrix Lv of vectors. Both synthesis and generation involve a trivial lexicon look-up step to retrieve vectors associated to words and vice versa: We ignore it in the exposi-tion below. 3.1 Synthesis To construct the vector representing a two-word phrase, we must compose the vectors associated to the input words. More formally, similarly to Mitchell and Lapata (2008), we define a syntax-dependent composition function yielding a phrase vector ⃗p: ⃗p = fcompR(⃗u, ⃗v) where ⃗u and ⃗v are the vector representations associated to words u and v. fcompR : Rd",
        "× Rd",
        "→ Rd (for d the dimensionality of vectors) is a composition function specific to the syntactic relationR holding between the two words.1",
        "Although we are not bound to a specific composition model, throughout this paper we use the method proposed by Guevara (2010) and Zanzotto et al. (2010) which defines composition as application of linear transformations to the two constituents followed by summing the resulting vectors: fcompR(⃗u, ⃗v) = W1⃗u + W2⃗v. We will further use the following equivalent formulation: fcompR(⃗u, ⃗v) = WR[⃗u; ⃗v] where WR ∈ Rd×2d",
        "and [⃗u; ⃗v] is the vertical concatenation of the two vectors (using Matlab notation). Following Guevara, we learn WR using examples of word and phrase vectors directly extracted from the corpus (for the rest of the paper, we refer to these phrase vectors extracted non-compositionally from the corpus as observed vectors). To estimate, for example, the weights in the WAN (adjective-noun) matrix, we use the corpus-extracted vectors of the words in tuples such as ⟨red, car, red.car⟩, ⟨evil, cat, evil.cat⟩, etc. Given a set of training examples stacked into matrices U , V (the constituent vectors) and P (the corresponding observed vectors), we estimate WR by solving the least-squares regression problem: 1",

        "We use the approximation of observed phrase vectors as objective because these vectors can provide direct evidence of the polysemous behaviour of words: For example, the corpus-observed vectors of green jacket and green politician reflect how the meaning of green is affected by its occurrence with different nouns. Moreover, it has been shown that for two-word phrases, despite their relatively low frequency, such corpus-observed representations are still difficult to outperform in phrase similarity tasks (Dinu et al., 2013; Turney, 2012). 3.2 Generation Generation of a two-word sequence from a vector proceeds in two steps: decomposition of the phrase vectors into two constituent vectors, and search for the nearest neighbours of each constituent vector in Lv (the lexical matrix) in order to retrieve the corresponding words from Lw. Decomposition We define a syntax-dependent decomposition function: [⃗u; ⃗v] = fdecompR(⃗p)",

        "where the matrix WR is a given composition function for the same relation R. Training with observed phrases, as in eq. (2), should be better at capturing the idiosyncrasies of the actual distribution of phrases in the corpus and it is more robust by being independent from the availability and quality of composition functions. On the other hand, if the goal is to revert as faithfully as possible the composition process and retrieve the original constituents (e.g., in a different modality or a different language), then the objective in eq. (3) is more motivated. Nearest neighbour search We retrieve the nearest neighbours of each constituent vector ⃗u obtained by decomposition by applying a search function s: NN⃗u = s(⃗u, Lv, t) where NN⃗u is a list containing the t nearest neighours of ⃗u from Lv, the lexical vectors. Depending on the task, t might be set to 1 to retrieve just one word sequence, or to larger values to retrieve t alternatives. The similarity measure used to determine the nearest neighbours is another parameter of the search function; we omit it here as we only experiment with the standard cosine measure (Turney and Pantel, 2010).2 3.3 Recursive (de)composition Extension to longer sequences is straightforward if we assume binary tree representations as syntactic structures. In synthesis, the top-level vector can be obtained by applying composition functions recursively. For example, the vector of big red car would be obtained as: fcompAN( ⃗big, fcomp AN( ⃗red, ⃗car)), where fcomp",
        "AN is the composition function for adjective-noun phrase combinations. Conversely, for generation, we decompose the phrase vector with fdecompAN. The first vector is used for retrieving the nearest adjective from the lexicon, while the second vector is further decomposed.",

        "In our empirical part, we focus on noun phrase generation. A noun phrase can be a single noun or a noun with one or more modifiers, where a modifier can be an adjective or a prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase is in turn composed of a preposition and a noun phrase. We learn two composition (and corresponding decomposition) functions: one for modifier-noun phrases, trained on adjective-noun (AN) pairs, and a second one for prepositional phrases, trained on preposition-noun (PN) combinations. For the rest of this section we describe the construction of the vector spaces and the (de)composition function learning procedure.

(2013a) for details). We also implement a standard count-based bag-of-words distributional space (Turney and Pantel, 2010) which counts occurrences of a target word with other words within a symmetric window of size 5.

For the decomposition function in eq. (3), we replace the observed phrase vectors with those composed with fcompR(⃗u, ⃗v), where fcompR is the previously estimated composition function for relation R. Composition function performance Since the experiments below also use composed vectors as input to the generation process, it is important to provide independent evidence that the composition model is of high quality. This is indeed the case: We tested our composition approach on the task of retrieving observed AN and PN vectors, based on their composed vectors (similarly to Baroni and Zamparelli (2010), we want to retrieve the observed red.car vector using fcompAN(red, car)). We obtain excellent results, with minimum accuracy of 0.23 (chance level <0.0001). We also test on the AN-N paraphrasing test set used in Dinu et al. (2013) (in turn adapting Turney (2012)).

      "paragraphs": [
        "We start with testing one-step decomposition by generating two-word phrases. A first straightforward evaluation consists in decomposing a phrase vector into the correct constituent words. For this purpose, we randomly select (and consequently remove) from the training sets 200 phrases of each type (AN and PN) and apply decomposition operations to 1) their corpus-observed vectors and 2) their composed representations. We generate two words by returning the nearest neighbours (with appropriate POS tags) of the two vectors produced by the decomposition functions. Table 2 reports generation accuracy, i.e., the proportion of times in which we retrieved the correct constituents. The search space consists of the top most frequent 20K nouns, 20K adjectives and 25 prepositions respectively, leading to chance accuracy <0.0001 for nouns and adjectives and <0.05 for prepositions. We obtain relatively high accuracy, with cbow vectors consistently outperforming count ones. Decomposing composed rather than observed phrase representations is easier, which is to be expected given that composed representations are obtained with a simpler, linear model. Most of the errors consist in generating synonyms (hard case→difficult case, true cost → actual cost) or related phrases (stereo speakers→omni-directional sound).",

Compositional distributional semantic systems are often evaluated on phrase and sentence paraphrasing data sets (Blacoe and Lapata, 2012; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Socher et al., 2011; Turney, 2012). However, these experiments assume a pre-compiled list of candidate paraphrases, and the task is to rank correct paraphrases above foils (paraphrase ranking) or to decide, for a given pair, if the two phrases/sentences are mutual paraphrases (paraphrase detection). Here, instead, we do not assume a given set of candidates: For example, in N→AN paraphrasing, any of 20K2",

Other interesting errors consist of decomposing a noun into two words which both have the same meaning as the noun, generating for example religion → religious religions. We observe moreover that sometimes the decomposition reflects selectional preference effects, by generating adjectives that denote typical properties of the noun to be paraphrased (e.g., animosity is a (political, personal,...) hostility or a fridge is a (big, large, small,...) refrigerator). This effect could be exploited for tasks such as property-based concept description (Kelly et al., 2012). 5.2 Recursive decomposition We continue by testing generation through recursive decomposition on the task of generating noun-preposition-noun (NPN) paraphrases of adjective-nouns (AN) phrases. We introduce a dataset containing 192 AN-NPN pairs (such as pre-election promises→ promises before election), which was created by the second author and additionally corrected by an English native speaker. The data set was created by analyzing a list of randomly selected frequent ANs. 49 further ANs (with adjectives such as amazing and great) were judged not NPN-paraphrasable and were used for the experiment reported in Section 7. The paraphrased subset focuses on preposition diversity and on including prepositions which are rich in semantic content and relevant to paraphrasing the AN. This has led to excluding of, which in most cases has the purely syntactic function of connecting the two nouns. The data set contains the following 14 prepositions: after, against, at, before, between, by, for, from, in, on, per, under, with, without.8",

        "For observed phrase vector training, accuracy and rank are well above chance for all constituents (random accuracy 0.00005 for nouns and 0.04 for prepositions, corresponding median ranks: 10K, 12). Preposition generation is clearly a more difficult task. This is due at least in part to their highly ambiguous and broad semantics, and the way in which they interact with the nouns. For example, cable through ocean in Table 5 is a reasonable paraphrase of undersea cable despite the gold preposition being under. Other than several cases which are acceptable paraphrases but not in the gold standard, phrases related in meaning but not synonymous are the most common error (overcast skies → skies in sunshine). We also observe that often the A and N meanings are not fully separated when decomposing and “traces” of the adjective or of the original noun meaning can be found in both generated nouns (for example nearby school → schools after school). To a lesser degree, this might be desirable as a disambiguation-in-context effect as, for example, in underground cavern, in secret would not be a context-appropriate paraphrase of underground."

Creation of cross-lingual vector spaces A common semantic space is required in order to map words and phrases across languages.

We opt for a very simple yet accurate method (Klementiev et al., 2012; Rapp, 1999) in which a bilingual dictionary is used to identify a set of shared dimensions across spaces and the vectors of both languages are projected into the subspace defined by these (Sub-space Projection - SP).

As the cbow dimensions do not correspond to words, we align the cbow spaces by using a small dictionary to learn a linear map which transforms the English vectors into Italian ones as done in Mikolov et al. (2013b). This method (Translation Matrix - TM) is applicable to both cbow and count spaces. We tune the parameters (TM or SP for count and dictionary size 5K or 25K for both spaces) on a standard task of translating English words into Italian. We obtain TM-5K for cbow and SP-25K for count as optimal settings. The two methods perform similarly for low frequency words while cbow-TM-5K significantly outperformscount-SP-25K for high frequency words. Our results for the cbow-TM-5K setting are similar to those reported by Mikolov et al. (2013b). Cross-lingual decomposition training Training proceeds as in the monolingual case, this time concatenating the training data sets and estimating a single (de)-composition function for the two languages in the shared semantic space. We train both on observed phrase representations (eq. 2) and on composed phrase representations (eq. 3).

        "In Section 3.2 we have defined a search function s returning a list of lexical nearest neighbours for a constituent vector produced by decomposition. Together with the neighbours, this function can naturally return their similarity score (in our case, the cosine). We call the score associated to the top neighbour the generation confidence: if this score is low, the vector has no good match in the lexicon. We observe significant Spearman correlations between the generation confidence of a constituent and its quality (e.g., accuracy, inverse rank) in all the experiments. For example, for the AN(En)→AN(It) experiment, the correlations between the confidence scores and the inverse ranks for As and Ns, for both cbow and count vectors, range between 0.34 (p < 1e−28",
        ") and 0.42. In the translation experiments, we can use this to automatically determine a subset on which we can translate with very high accuracy. Table 9 shows AN-AN accuracies and coverage when translating only if confidence is above a certain threshold.",
        "Throughout this paper we have assumed that the syntactic structure of the phrase to be generated is given. In future work we will exploit the correlation between confidence and quality for the purpose of eliminating this assumption. As a concrete example, we can use confidence scores to distinguish the two subsets of the AN-NPN dataset introduced in Section 5: the ANs which are paraphrasable with an NPN from those that do not",

We assign an AN to the NPN-paraphrasable class if the mean confidence of the PN expansion in its attempted N(PN) decomposition is above a certain threshold. We plot the ROC curve in Figure 1. We obtain a significant AUC of 0.71."

      "title": "8 Conclusion",
      "paragraphs": [
        "In this paper we have outlined a framework for the task of generation with distributional semantic models. We proposed a simple but effective approach to reverting the composition process to obtain meaningful reformulations of phrases through a synthesis-generation process.",
        "For future work we would like to experiment with more complex models for (de-)composition in order to improve the performance on the tasks we used in this paper. Following this, we 631 would like to extend the framework to handle arbitrary phrases, including making (confidence-based) choices on the syntactic structure of the phrase to be generated, which we have assumed to be given throughout this paper.",
        "In terms of applications, we believe that the line of research in machine translation that is currently focusing on replacing parallel resources with large amounts of monolingual text provides an interesting setup to test our methods. For example, Klementiev et al. (2012) reconstruct phrase tables based on phrase similarity scores in semantic space. However, they resort to scoring phrase pairs extracted from an aligned parallel corpus, as they do not have a method to freely generate these. Similarly, in the recent work on common vector spaces for the representation of images and text, the current emphasis is on retrieving existing captions (Socher et al., 2014) and not actual generation of image descriptions.",
        "From a more theoretical point of view, our work fills an important gap in distributional semantics, making it a bidirectional theory of the connection between language and meaning. We can now translate linguistic strings into vector “thoughts”, and the latter into their most appropriate linguistic expression. Several neuroscientific studies suggest that thoughts are represented in the brain by patterns of activation over broad neural areas, and vectors are a natural way to encode such patterns (Haxby et al., 2001; Huth et al., 2012). Some research has already established a connection between neural and distributional semantic vector spaces (Mitchell et al., 2008; Murphy et al., 2012). Generation might be the missing link to powerful computational models that take the neural footprint of a thought as input and produce its linguistic expression."
