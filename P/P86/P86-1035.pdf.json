Hobbs, William Croft, Todd Davies, Douglas Edwards, and Kenneth Laws","Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In the TACITUS project for using commonsense knowledge in the understanding of texts about mechanical devices and their failures, we have been developing various commonsense theories that are needed to mediate between the way we talk about the behavior of such devices and causal models of their operation. Of central importance in this effort is the axiomatization of what might be called \"commonsense metaphysics\". This includes a number of areas that figure in virtually every domain of discourse, such as scalar notions, granularity, time, space, material, physical objects, causality, functionality, force, and shape. Our approach to lexical semantics is then to construct core theories of each of these areas, and then to define, or at least characterize, a large number of lexical items in terms provided by the core theories. In the TACITUS system, processes for solving pragmatics problems posed by a text will use the knowledge base consisting of these theories in conjunction with the logical forms of the sentences in the text to produce an interpretation. In this paper we do not stress these interpretation processes; this is another, important aspect of the TACITUS project, and it will be described in subsequent papers.","This work represents a convergence of research in lexical semantics in linguistics and efforts in AI to encode commonsense knowledge. Lexical semanticists over the years have developed formalisms of increasing adequacy for encoding word meaning, progressing from simple sets of features (Katz and Fodor, 1963) to notations for predicate-argument structure (Lakoff, 1972; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976), but the early attempts still limited access to world knowledge and assumed only very restricted sorts of processing. Workers in computational linguistics introduced inference (Rieger, 1974; Schank, 1975) and other complex cognitive processes (Herskovits, 1982) into our understanding of the role of word meaning. Recently, linguists have given greater attention to the cognitive processes that would operate on their representations (e.g., Talmy, 1983; Croft, 1986). Independently, in AI an effort arose to encode large amounts of commonsense knowledge (Hayes, 1979; Hobbs and Moore, 1985; Hobbs et al. 1985). The research reported here represents a convergence of these various developments. By developing core theories of several fundamental phenomena and defining lexical items within these theories, using the full power of predicate calculus, we are able to cope with complex-ities of word meaning that have hitherto escaped lexical semanticists, within a framework that gives full scope to the planning and reasoning processes that manipulate representations of word meaning.","In constructing the core theories we are attempting to adhere to several methodological principles.","I. One should aim for characterization of concepts, rather than definition. One cannot generally expect to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a concept. The most we can hope for is to find a number of necessary conditions and a number of sufficient conditions. This amounts to saying that a great many predicates are primitive, but primitives that are highly interrelated with the rest of the knowledge base.","2. One should determine the minimal structure necessary for a concept to make sense. In efforts to axiomatize some area, there are two positions one may take, exemplified by set theory and by group theory. In axiomatizing set theory, one attempts to capture exactly some concept one has strong intuitions about. If the axiomatization turns out to have unexpected models, this exposes an in-adequacy. In group theory, by contrast, one characterizes an abstract class of structures. If there turn out to be unexpected models, this is a serendipitous discovery of a new phenomenon that we can reason about using an old theory. The pervasive character of metaphor in natural language discourse shows that our commonsense theories of the world ought to be much more like group theory than set theory. By seeking minimal structures in axiomatizing concepts, we optimize the possibilities of using the theories in metaphorical and analogical contexts. This principle is illustrated below in the section on regions. One consequence of this principle is that our approach will seem more syntactic than semantic. We have concentrated more on 231 specifying axioms than on constructing models. Our view is that the chief role of models in our effort is for proving the consistency and independence of sets of axioms, and for showing their adequacy. As an example of the last point, many of the spatial and temporal theories we construct are intended at least to have Euclidean space or the real numbers as one model, and a subclass of graph-theoretical structures as other models.","3. A balance must be struck between attempting to cover all cases and aiming only for the prototypical cases. In general, we have tried to cover as many cases as possible with an elegant axiomatization, in line with the two previous principles, but where the formalization begins to look baroque, we assume that higher processes will suspend some inferences in the marginal cases. We assume that inferences will be drawn in a controlled fashion. Thus, every outr~, highly context-dependent counterexample need not be accounted for, and to a certain extent, definitions can be geared specifically for a prototype.","4. Where competing ontologies suggest themselves in a domain, one should attempt to construct a theory that accommodates both. Rather than commit oneself to adopt-ing one set of primitives rather than another, one should show how each set of primitives can be characterized in terms of the other. Generally, each of the ontologies is useful for different purposes, and it is convenient to be able to appeal to both. Our treatment of time illustrates this.","5. The theories one constructs should be richer in axioms than in theorems. In mathematics, one expects to state half a dozen axioms and prove dozens of theorems from them. In encoding commonsense knowledge it seems to be just the opposite. The theorems we seek to prove on the basis of these axioms are theorems about specific situations which are to be interpreted, in particular, theorems about a text that the system is attempting to understand.","6. One should avoid falling into \"black holes\". There are a few \"mysterious\" concepts which crop up repeatedly in the formalization of commonsense metaphysics. Among these are \"relevant\" (that is, relevant to the task at hand) and \"normative\" (or conforming to some norm or pattern). To insist upon giving a satisfactory analysis of these before using them in analyzing other concepts is to cross the event horizon that separates lexical semantics from philosophy. On the other hand, our experience suggests that to avoid their use entirely is crippling; the lexical semantics of a wide variety of other terms depends upon them. Instead, we have decided to leave them minimally analyzed for the moment and use them without scruple in the analysis of other commonsense concepts. This approach will allow us to accumulate many examples of the use of these mysterious concepts, and in the end, contribute to their successfill analysis. The use of these concepts appears below in the discussions of the words \"immediately\", \"sample\", and \"operate\".","We chose as an initial target problem to encode the commonsense knowledge that underlies the concept of \"wear\", as in a part of a device wearing out. Our aim was to define \"wear\" in terms of predicates characterized elsewhere in the knowledge base and to infer consequences of wear. For something to wear, we decided, is for it to lose imperceptible bits of material from its surface due to abrasive action over time. One goal,which we have not yet achieved, is to be able to prove as a theorem that since the shape of a part of a mechanical device is often functional and since loss of material can result in a change of shape, wear of a part of a device can result in the failure of the device as a whole. In addition, as we have proceded, we have characterized a number of words found in a set of target texts, as it has become possible.","We are encoding the knowledge as axioms in, what is for the most part a first-order logic, described in ttobbs (1985a), although quantification over predicates is some-times convenient.

Our approach is a generalization of this, because much more complex requirements can be placed on the arguments. Consider, for example, the verb \"range\". If z ranges from y to z, there must be a scale s that includes y and z, and z must be a set of entities that are located at various places on the scale: This can be represented as follows:","range(x, y, z) : (3 s)scate(e) ̂y G s Az E e A set(x) A(Vu)[u G z D (qv)v E s A at(u,v)]"]},{"title":"3 The Knowledge Base","paragraphs":["3.1 Sets and Granularity At the foundation of the knowledge base is an axiomatization of set theory.

Intuitively, if enough events occur that are imperceptible at the coarser grain g2 but perceptible at the finer grain gl, then the aggregate will eventually be perceptible at the coarser grain. This is an important property in phenomena subject to the Heap Paradox. Wear, for instance, eventually has significant consequences."]},{"title":"3.2 Scales","paragraphs":["A great many of the most common words in English have scales as their subject matter. This includes many prepositions, the most common adverbs, comparatives, and many abstract verbs. When spatial vocabulary is used metaphorically, it is generally the scalar aspect of space that carries over to the target domain. A scale is defined as a set of elements, together with a partial ordering and a granularity (or an indistinguishability relation). The partial ordering and the indistinguishability relation are consistent with each other: (Vx, y,z)x < y A y~ z D x < z V z ,~ z It is useful to have an adjacency relation between points on a scale, and there are a number of ways we could introduce it. We could simply take it to be primitive; in a scale having a distance function, we could define two points to be adjacent when the distance between them is less than some ~; finally, we could define adjacency in terms of the grain-size: (V x, y, e)adj(x, y, e) ---"]},{"title":"(3 z)z ~ z ̂z ~ y ̂~[x ~ y],","paragraphs":["Two important possible properties of scales are connectedness and denseness.

In our target texts, the phrase \"high usage\" occurs. Usage is a set of using events, and the verticality requirement on \"high\" forces us to coerce the phrase into \"a high or large number of using events\". Combining this with an axiom that says tb~t the use of a mechanical device involves the likelihood of abrasive events, as defined below, and with the definition of \"wear\" in terms of abrasive events, we should be able to conclude the likelihood of wear. 3.3 Time: Two Ontologies There are two possible ontologies for time. In the first, the one most acceptable to the mathematically minded, there is a time line, which is a scale having some topological structure. We can stipulate the time line to be linearly ordered (although it is not in approaches that build ignorance of relative times into the representation of time (e.g., Hobbs, 1974) nor in approaches using branching futures (e.g., McDermott, 1985)), and we can stipulate it to be dense (although it is not in the situation calculus).

The change ontology is exhibited in most verbs, and in temporal clausal connectives. The universal presence of both classes of lexical items and grammatical markers in natural languages requires a theory which can accommodate both ontologies, illustrating the importance of methodological principle 4.","Among temporal connectives, the word \"while\" presents interesting problems.

In addition, in spaces in which orientation is defined, forces can have an orientation, and a version of the Parallelogram of Forces Law can be encoded. Finally, force interacts with shape in ways characterized by words like \"stretch\", \"compress\", \"bend\", \"twist\", and \"shear\". 3.6.3 Systems and Functionality An important concept is the notion of a \"system\", which is a set of entities, a set of their properties, and a set of relations among them. A common kind of system is one in which the entities are events and conditions and the relations are causal and enabling relations. A mechanical device can be described as such a system--in a sense, in terms of the plan it executes in its operation. The"]},{"title":"function","paragraphs":["of various parts and of conditions of those parts is then the role they play in this system, or plan.","The intransitive sense of \"operate\", as in The diesel was operating. involves systems and functionality. If an entity x operates, then there must be a larger system s of which x is a part. The entity x itself is a system with parts. These parts undergo normative state changes, thereby causing x to undergo normative state changes, thereby causing x to produce an effect with a normative function in the larger system s. The concept of \"normative\" is discussed below. 3.6.4 Shape We have been approaching the problem of characterizing shape from a number of different angles. The classical treatment of shape is via the notion of \"similarity\" in Euclidean geometry, and in Hilbert's formal reconstruction of Euclidean geometry (Hilbert, 1902) the key primitive concept seems to be that of \"congruent angles\". Therefore, we first sought to develop a theory of \"orientation\". The shape of an object can then be characterized in terms of changes in orientation of a tangent as one moves about on the surface of the object, as is done in vision research (e.g., Zahn and Roskies, 1972). In all of this, since \"shape\" can be used loosely and metaphorically, one question we are asking is whether some minimal, abstract structure can be found in which the notion of \"shape\" makes sense. Consider, for instance, a graph in which one scale is discrete, or even unordered. Accordingly, we have been examining a number of examples, asking when it seems right ~.o say two structures have different shapes.","We have also examined the interactions of shape and functionality (cf. Davis, 1984). What seems to be crucial is how the shape of an obstacle constrains the motion of a substance or of an object of a particular shape (cf. Shoham, 1985). Thus, a funnel concentrates the flow of a liquid, and similarly, a wedge concentrates force. A box pushed against a ridge in the floor will topple, and a wheel is a limiting case of continuous toppling. 3.7 Hitting, Abrasion, Wear, and Related Concepts For x to hit y is for x to move into contact with y with some force.","The basic scenario for an abrasive event is that there is an impinging bit of material m which hits an object o and by doing so removes a pointlike bit of material b0 from the surface of o:"]},{"title":"abr-event'(e,","paragraphs":["m, o, b0) :"]},{"title":"material(m) A topologieally.invariant(o) (re, m, o, bo)abr-event'(e, m, o, bo) =--- (3 t, b, s, bo, el, e,, es)at(e, t) ̂consists-of(o, b, t) ̂surface(s, b) ̂particle(bo, s) ̂change'(e, el, e~) ̂attached'(el, bo, b) ̂not'(e2, el) A cause(es, e) ̂hit'(es, m, bo)","paragraphs":["After the abrasive event, the pointlike bit b0 is no longer a part of the object o: 237 (re,"]},{"title":"m, o, bo, el, e2, t2)abr-event'(e, m, o,","paragraphs":["b0)"]},{"title":"A change'(e, el, ez) ̂attaehed'(el, bo, b) ̂not'(e2, el) A at(ez, tz) A consists-of(o, bz, tz) D -~part(bo, bz)","paragraphs":["It is necessary to state this explicitly since objects and bits of material can be discontinuous.","An abrasion is a large number of abrasive events widely distributed through some nonpointlike region on the surface of an object: (Ve,"]},{"title":"m, o}abrade'(e, m, o) -","paragraphs":["(:lbs)[(¥e,)[e, e e ::)"]},{"title":"(3 bo)bo e bs ̂abr-evenr(el, m, o, bo)] (̂Vb, s,t)[at(e,t) ̂consists-of(o, b, t) A surface(s, b) D (B r)subregion(r, s) A widely-distributed(bs,","paragraphs":["r)]]","Wear can occur by means of a large collection of abrasive events distributed over time as well as space (so that there may be no time at which enough abrasive events occur to count as an abrasion).

If z is distributed in y, then y is a system and z is a set of entities which are located at components of y. For the distribution to be wide, most of the elements of a partition of y determined independently of the distribution must contain components which have elements of x at them.","The word \"w~ar\" is one of a large class of other events involving cumulative, gradual loss of material - events described by words like \"chip\", \"corrode\", \"file\", \"erode\", \"rub\", \"sand\", \"grind\", \"weather\", \"rust\", \"tarnish\", \"eat away\", \"rot\", and \"decay\". All of these lexical items can now be defined as variations on the definition of \"wear\", since we have built up the axiomatizations underlying \"wear\". We are now in a position to characterize the entire class. We will illustrate this by defining two different types of variants of \"wear\" - \"chip\" and \"corrode\".","\"Chip\" differs from \"wear\" in three ways: the bit of material removed in one abrasive event is larger {it need not be point-like}, it need not happen because of a material hitting against the object, and \"chip\" does not require (though it does permit} a large collection of such events: one can say that some object is chipped if there is only one chip in it.

We do not pretend to have solved these problems. But for each of these concepts we do have the beginnings of an account that can play a role in analysis, if not yet in implementation.","Our view of relevance, briefly stated, is that something is relevant to some goal if it is a part of a plan to achieve that goal. [A formal treatment of a similar view is given in Davies and Russell, 1986.) We can illustrate this with an example involving the word \"sample\". If a bit of material z is a sample of another bit of material y, then x is a part of y, and moreover, there are"]},{"title":"relevant","paragraphs":["properties p and q such that it is believed that if p is true of x then q is true of y. That is, looking at the properties of the sample tells us something important about the properties of the whole. Frequently, p and q are the same property. In our target texts, the following sentence occurs: 238","We retained an oil sample for future inspection. The oil in the sample is a part of the total lube oil in the lube oil system, and it is believed that a property of the sample, such as \"contaminated with metal particles\", will be true of all of the lube oil as well, and that this will give information about possible wear on the bearings. It is therefore relevant to the goal of maintaining the machinery in good working order.","We have arrived at the following provisional account of what it means to be \"normative\". For an entity to exhibit a normative condition or behavior, it must first of all be a component of a larger system. This system has structure in the form of relations among its components. A pattern is a property of the system, namely, the property of a subset of these stuctural relations holding. A norm is a pattern which is established either by conventional stipula-tion or by statistical regularity. An entity is behaving in a normative fashion if it is a component of a system and in-stantiates a norm within that system. The word \"operate\" given above illustrates this. When we say that an engine is operating, we have in mind a larger system, the device the engine drives, to which the engine may bear various possible relations. A subset of these relations is stipulated to be the norm--the way it is supposed to work. We say it is operating when it is instantiating this norm."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["The research we have been engaged in has forced us to explicate a complex set of commonsense concepts. Since we have done it in as general a fashion as possible, we may expect that it will be possible to axiomatize a large number of other areas, including areas unrelated to mechanical devices, building on this foundation. The very fact that we have been able to characterize words as diverse as \"range\", \"immediately\", \"brittle\", \"operate\" and \"wear\" shows the promise of this approach."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The research reported here was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Omce of Naval Research contract N00014-85-C-0013.
