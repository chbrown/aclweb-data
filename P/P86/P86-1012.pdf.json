We characterize the reduction rules capable of generating context-sensitive languages as those having a partial combination rule and a combination rule in the reverse direction. We show that any categorial language is a permutation of some context-free language, thus inheriting properties dependent on symbol counting only. We compare some of their properties with other contemporary formalisms. INTRODUCTION","Categorial grammars have recently been the topic of renewed interest, stemming in part from their use as the underlying formalism in Montague grammar. While the original categorial grammars were early shown to be equivalent to context-free grammars, 1, 2, 3 modifications to the formalism have led to systems both more and less powerful than context-free grammars.","Motivated by linguistic considerations, Ades and Steedman 4 introduced categorial grammars with some additional cancellation rules. Full cancellation rules correspond to application of functions to arguments. Their partial cancellation rules correspond to functional composition. The new backward combination rule is motivated by the need to treat preposed elements. They also modified the formalism by making category symbols parenthesis-free, treating them in general as governed by a convention of association to the left, but violating this convention in certain of the rules.","This treatment of categorial grammar suggests a family of eategorial systems, differing in the set of cancellation rules that are allowed. Earlier, we began a study of the mathematical properties of that family of systems, s showing that some members are fully equivalent to context-free grammars, while others yield only a subset of the context-free languages, or a super-set of them.","In this paper we continue with these investigations. We characterize the rule systems that can obtain context-sensitive languages, and compare the sets of categorial ]ar~guages with the context-free languages. Finally, we discuss the linguistic relevance of these results, and compare categorial grammars with TAG systems i, this regard.","A categorial grammar under a set R of reduction rules is a quadruple CGR (VT, VA, S, F), whose elements are defined as follows: VT is a finite set of morphemes. VA is a finite set of atomic category symbols. S EVA is a distinguished element of VA. To define F, we must first define CA, the set of category symbols. CA is given by:i) ifAEVA,thenA ECA;ii) ifX EUA and A EVA, then X/A ECA; andiii) nothing elselsin CA . F is the lexicon, a function from VT to 2 ea such that for every aEVT, F(a) is finite. We often write CGR to denote a categorial grammar with rule set R, when the elements of the quadruple are known.","Notation: Morphemes are denoted by a, b; morpheme strings by u,v,w. The symbols S,A,B,C denote atomic category symbols, and U. V, X, Y denote arbitrary (complex) category symbols. Complex category symbols whose left-most symbol is S (symbols \"headed\" by S) are denoted by Xs, Ys. Strings of category symbols are denoted by z, y.","The language of a categorial grammar is determined in part by the set R of reduction rules. This set can include any subset of the following five rules. In each statement, A EVA, and U/A,A/U,A/V, VIA E CA.","(1) (F Rule) The string of category symbols U/A A can be replaced by U. We write: U/A A---*U;","(2) (FP Rule) The string U/A A/V can be replaced by U /V. Wewrite: U /A A/V-*U/V;","(3) (B Rule) The string A V/A can be replaced by U. We write:A U/A~U;","(4) (Bs Rule) Same as B rule, except that U is headed by S.","(5) (BP Rule) The string A/U V/A can be replaced by V/U. We write: A/U V/A--*V/U.","If XY ---,Z by the F-rule , XY is called an F-redex. Similarly, for the other four rules. Any one of them may simply be called a redex.","The reduction relation determined by a subset of these rules is denoted by => and defined by: if X Y --* Z by one of the rules of R, then for any a, /~ in CA* , aXY/3 >aZ/3. The reflexive and transitive closure of the relation -> is =>*. A morpheme string w=wlu,~\" \"'w, is accepted by CGR(VT, VA,S,F) if there is a category string z = X1X2 \"\" • X, such that XiEF(w,) for each i=l,2,'--n, and x =>* S. The language L(CGR) accepted by CGR(VT, VA,S,F) is the set of all morpheme strings that are accepted. 75 I. NON-CONTEXT-FREE CATEGORIAL LANGUAGES","In this section we present a characterization theorem for the categorial systems that generate only context-free languages.","First, we introduce a lexicon FEQ that we will show has the property that for any choice R of metarules any string in L(CGR) has equal numbers of a,b, and c. We define the lexicon FEQ as FEQ (a ) = {A }, FEQ(b) = {BI, F~Q(c) ={C/A/C/B, C/D}, FEQ (d ) {D}, FEQ(e)={S/A/C/B}.","We will also make use of two languages on the alphabet {a,b,e,d, e} Ll={a\"db \"e c ~ In >/1 },and LEQ = {w ! #a = #b = #c >1 1,#d =#e = 1}.","A lemma shows that with any set R of rules the lexicon FEQ yields a subset of LEQ. Lemma","1 Let G be -any categorial grammar, CGR(VT,VA,S,FEQ), where VT ={a,b,c,d,e}, VA = {S,A,B,C,D}, with R~{F,FP,B,BP}. Then"]},{"title":"L (C)CL~Q.","paragraphs":["Proof Let z = X IX 2...X~ = > *S. Let w = wl...w. be a corresponding morpheme string. To differentiate between the occurrence of a symbol as a head and otherwise, write C/A/C/B = CA -1C-1B-1' S /A /C /B = SA-1C-1B -1 and C /D = CD -1. For any rule system R, a redex is two adjacent categories, the tail of one matching the head of the other, and is reduced to a single category after cancelling the matching symbols. Since all occurrences of A must cancel to yield a reduction to S, #A = #A -1. This holds for all atomic categories except S, for which #S = #S-l+l. This lexicon has the property that any derivable category symbol, either has exactly one S and is S-headed or does not have an occurrence of S. Hence in x, #S = 1, i.e., w has exactly one e. Let the number of occurrences in x of C/A/C/B and C/D be p and q respectively. ]t follows that #C = p +q, #C -1 = p +1. Hence q = 1 and w ha.~ exactly one d. Each occurrence of C/A/C/B introduces oneA-landB-1. Sincew has one e, #A-1 = #B-J = p +1. Hence #A = #B = p +1. Since for each A ,B and C in z there must be exactly onea,b and c,#a =#b =#c. []","We show next that in the restricted ease where R contains only the two rules FP and B s , the language L 1 is obtained. Lemma 2 Let CG R be the categorial grammar with lexicon FEQ and rule set R = {FP ,Bs }. Then L (CGR ) = L1.","Proof Any x EL 1 has a unique parse of the form (Bs FP ) n Bs Bs ~, and hence L 1CL (CG R ). Conversely, any x having a parse must have exactly one e. Further, all b's and c's can appear only on the left and right of e respectively. Any derivable category having an A has the form S/(A/)\" U where U does not have any A. Thus all A's appear consecutively on the left of the e. For the rightmost e,F(c) = C/D. A d must be in between a's and b's. By lemma 1, #(a)=#(b) =# (c). Thus x = a n db n ec\" , for some n. Hence L 1 = L (CGR). []","The next lemma shows that no language intermediate to L1 and LEQ can be context-free. It really does not involve eategorial grammar at all. Lemma 3 If L 1C.L C-LEQ, then L is not context-free.","Proof Suppose L is context-free. Since L contains L1, it has arbitrarily long strings of the form a '~ b db\"e c\". Let k and K be pumping lemma constants. Choose n >max(K,k). This string, if pumped, yields a string not in LEQ, hence we have a contradiction. []","Corollary Let {FP ,Bs }~R. Then there is a non-","context-free language L ( CGR ).","Proof Use the lexicon FEQ. Then by lemma 1","L(CGR)~LEQ. But{FP,Bs}~R,soLI~L(CGR). []","The following theorem summarizes the results by characterizing the rule sets that can be used to generate context sensitive languages. Main Theorem A categorial system with rule set R can generate a context-sensitive language if and only if R contains a partial combination rule and a combination rule in the reverse direction.","Proof The \"if\" part follows for {FP,Bs }by lemmas 1, 2, and 3. It follows for {BP ,F } by symmetry. For the \"only if\" part, first note that any unidirectional system (system with rules that are all forward, or all backward) can generate only context-free languages. 5 The only remaining cases are {F ,B } and {FP ,BP 1. The first generates only context free languages. 5 The second generates only the empty language, since no atomic symbol can be derived using only these two rules. II. CATEGORIAL LANGUAGES ARE PERMUTA-TIONS OF CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES","Let VT = {a l, a2 \"-.,ak }. A Parikh mapping 6 v/is a mapping from morpheme strings to vectors such that x~(w) = (#al,#a2 ..... #a k). u is a permutation of v iff ~(u)=~(v). Let ~P(L~={W(w)IwEL}, A language L is a permutation of L iff ~(L ) = xC(L). We define a rotation as follows. In the parse tree for u E L, at any node corresponding to a B redex or BP-redex exchange its left and right subtrees, obtaining an F-redex or an FP-redex. Let v the resulting terminal string. We say that u has been transformed into v by rotation.","We now obtain results that are helpful in showing that certain languages eannol be generated by. categorial grammars. First we show that, every categorial language is a permutation of a context free language. This will enable us to show that properties of context-free languages that depend only on the symbol counts must also hold of categorial languages. Theorem Let R c: {F, FP, B, BP}. Then there exists a LCF such that ¢(L (CGR)) = ¢(LcF), where LcF is context free.","Proof Let x eL"]},{"title":"(CGR).","paragraphs":["In its parse tree at each node corresponding to a B-redex or a BP-redex perform a rotation, so that it becomes a F -redex or a FP -redex.

Hence the set of such y obtained as a permutation of some x is the same as L (CGRt), which is context free, 5 i.e., L ( CGR I) = LCF .

TAG languages are closed under homomorphisms and thus the categorial language L4(2) is not a TAG language. TAG languages exhibit only limited cross serial dependencies. Thus, though TAG Languages and CG languages share some properties like linear growth, semilinearity, generation of all context-free languages, limited context sensitive power, and Parikh boundedness, they are different in their generative capacities.","Acknowledgements We would like to thank Weiguo Wang and Dawei Dai for helpful discussions.
