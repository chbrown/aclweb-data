Kashket Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","Massachusetts Institute of Technology 545 Technology Square, room 823","Cambridge, MA 02139 ABSTRACT","Free-word order languages have long posed significant problems for standard parsing algorithms. This paper reports on an implemented parser, based on Government-Binding theory (GB) (Chomsky, 1981, 1982), for a particular free-word order language, Warlpiri, an aboriginal language of central Australia. The parser is explicitly designed to transparently mirror the principles of GB.","The operation of this parsing system is quite different in character from that of a rule-based parsing system, ~"]},{"title":"e.g.,","paragraphs":["a context-free parsing method. In this system, phrases are constructed via principles of selection, case-marking, case-assignment, and argument-linking, rather than by phrasal rules.","The output of the parser for a sample Warlpiri sentence of four words in length is given. The parser was executed on each of the 23 other permutations of the sentence, and it output equivalent parses, thereby demonstrating its ability to correctly handle the highly scrambled sentences found in Warlpiri. INTRODUCTION","Basing a parser on Government-Binding theory has led to a design that is quite different from traditional algorithms. 1 The parser presented here operates in two stages, lexical and syntactic. Each stage is carried out by the same parsing engine. The lexical parser projects each constituent lexical item (morpheme) according to information in its associated lexical entries. Lexical parsing is highly data-driven from entries in the lexicon, in keeping with GB. Lexical parses returned by the first stage are then handed over to the second stage, the syntactic parser, as input, where they are further projected and combined to form the final phrase marker.","Before plunging into the parser itself, a sample Warlpiri sentence is presented. Following this, the theory of argument"]},{"title":"(i.e.,","paragraphs":["NP) identification is given, in order to show how its substantive linguistic principles may be used directly in parsing.

Case is used to identify syntactic arguments and to link them to their syntactic predicates {e.g., verbal, nominal and in-finitival). There are three such cases in Warlpiri: ergative, absolutive and dative.","Argument identification is effected by four subsystems involving case: selection, case-marking, case-assignment, and argument-linking. Only maximal projections (e.g., NP and VP, in English) are eligible to be arguments. In order","~Barton (1985) has written a morphological analyzer that breaks down Warlpiri words in their constituent morphemes. We have connected both parsers so that the user is able to enter sentences in a less stilted form. Input (2), however, is given directly to the main parser, bypassing Barton's analyzer.","ZThis analysis of Warlpiri comes from several sources, and from the helpful assistance of Mary Laughren. See, for example, (Laughren, 1978; Nash, 1980; Hale, 1983). 60 P"]},{"title":"kurdu- ku THE LEXICON","paragraphs":["The actions for performing argument identification~ as well as the data on which they operate, are stored for each lexical item in the lexicon• The part of the lexicon necessary to parse sentence (2) is given in figure 2.

That is, it must qualify to be selected by a case-marker, marked for its case, assigned its ease, and then linked to an argument slot demanding that case.","Selection is a directed action that, for Warlpiri, may take the category preceding it as its object. This follows from the setting of the head parameter of GB: Warlpiri is a head-final language• Selection involves a co-projection of the selector and its object, where both categories are projected one level• For example, the tensed element, rni, selects verbs, and then co-projects to form the combined \"inflected verb\" category• An example is presented below• The other three events occur under the undirected structural relation of siblinghood.

CONJUGATION stands for the conjugation class of the verb; in Warlpiri there are five conjugation classes. SELECT takes a list of two arguments.

The second argument is the list of data that the prospective object must match in order to be selected.

The associated value consists of the information that is stored within a category, namely, data and actions. Only the information that is lexically determined, such as person and number for pronouns, is stored in the lexicon.","There is another class of lexical information, lexical rules, which applies across categories. For example, all verbs in Warlpiri with an agent 0-role assign ergative case. Since this case-assignment is a feature of all verbs, it would not be appropriate to store the action in each verbal entry; instead, it stated once as a rule. These rules are represented straightforwardly as a list of pattern-action pairs. After lexical look-up is performed, the list of rules is applied.

An array is used in lieu of a set because the precedence information is needed sometimes,"]},{"title":"i.e.,","paragraphs":["when selecting a category, as above.","These two structures contain all of the necessary structural relations for parsing. However, in the interests of explicit representation and speeding up the parser somewhat, two auxiliary structures are employed. The"]},{"title":"argument set","paragraphs":["points to all of the categories in the phrase-marker that may serve as arguments to predicates. Only maximal projections may be entered in this set, in keeping with X-theory. Note that a maximal projection may serve as an argument of more than one predi(:ate, so that a category is never removed from the argument set. The second auxiliary structure is the"]},{"title":"set of unsatis- fied predicates,","paragraphs":["which points to all of the categories in the phrase-marker that have unexecuted actions. Unlike the argument set, when the actions of a predicate are executed, the category is removed from the set.","The phrase-marker contains all of the structural relations required by GB; however, there is much more information that must be represented in the output of the parser. This information is stored in the feature-value lists associated with each category. There are two kinds of features: data and actions. There may be any number of data and actions, as dictated by GB; that is, the representation does not constrain the data and actions. The actions of a category are found by performing a look-up in its feature-value list. On the other hand, the data for a category are found by collecting the data for itself and each of the sub-categories in its projection in a recursive manner. This is done because data are not percolated up projections.","The list of actions is not completely determined. Selection, case-marking, case-assignment, and argument linking are represented as actions (el. the discussion of case, above). It should be noted that these are the only actions available to the lexicon writer. Actions do not consist of arbitrary code that may be executed, such as when an arc is traversed in an ATN system. The supplied actions, as derived from GB, should provide a comprehensive set of linguistically relevant operations needed to parse any sentence of the target language.","Although the list of data types is not yet complete, a few have already proved necessary, such as person and number information for nominal categories. The list of 0roles for which a predicate subcategorizes is also stored as data for the category. THE PARSING ENGINE","The parsing engine is the core of both the lexical and the syntactic parsers. Therefore, their operations can be described at the same time. The syntactic parser is just the parsing engine that accepts sentences"]},{"title":"(i.e.,","paragraphs":["lists of words) as input, and returns syntactic phrase-markers as output. The lexical parser is just the parsing engine that accepts words"]},{"title":"(i.e.,","paragraphs":["lists of morphemes) as input, and returns lexical phrase-markers as output.","The engine loops through each component of the input, performing two computations. First it calls its subordinate parser"]},{"title":"(e.g.,","paragraphs":["the lexical parser is the subordinate parser of the syntactic parser) to parse the component, yielding a phrase-marker. (The subordinate parser for the lexical parser performs a look-up of the morpheme in the lexicon.) In the second computation, the set of unsatisfied predicates is traversed to see if any of the predicates' actions can 52 apply. This is where selection, case-marking, projection, and so on, are performed.","Note that there is no possible ambiguity during the identification of arguments with their predicates. This stems from the fact that selection may only apply to the (single) category preceding the predicate category, and that each of the subsequent actions may only apply serially. This assumes single-noun noun phrases. In the next version of the parser, multiple-noun noun phrases will be tackled. However, the addition of word stress information will serve to disambiguate noun grouping.","There may be ambiguity in the parsing of the morphemes. That is, there may be more than one entry for a single morpheme. The details of this disambiguation are not clear. One possible solution is to split the parsing process into one process for each entry, and to let each daughter process continue on its own. This solution, however, is rather brute-force and does not take advantage of the limited ambiguity of multiple lexical entries. For the moment, the parser will assume that only unambiguous morphemes are given to it.","After the loop is complete, the engine performs default actions. One example is the selection for and marking of absolutive case. In Warlpiri, the absolutive case-marker is not phonologically overt. The absolutive case-marker is left as a default, where, if a noun has not been marked for a case upon completion of lexical parsing, absolutive case is marked. This is how"]},{"title":"karli","paragraphs":["is parsed in sentence (2); see figures 6 and 7, below.","The next operation of the engine is to check the wellformedness of the parse. For both the lexical parser and the syntactic parser, one condition is that the phrase-marker consist of a single tree,"]},{"title":"i.e.,","paragraphs":["that all constituents have been linked into a single structure. This condition subsumes the Case Filter of GB. In order for a noun phrase to be linked to its predicate it must have received case; any noun phrase that has not received case will not be linked to the projection of the predicate, and the phrase-marker will not consist of a single tree.","The last operation percolates unexecuted actions to the root of the phrase-marker, for use at the next higher level of parsing. For example, the assignment of both ergative case and absolutive case in the verb"]},{"title":"puntarni","paragraphs":["are not executed at the lexical level of parsing.

One more note: the PROJECTION? field is true when the category's parent is a member of its projection, and false when it isn't.

The representations (e.g., the lexicon and phrase-markers) and algorithms (e.g., projection, undirected case-marking, and the directed selection) employed are faithful to the linguistic theory on which they are based. This system, while quite unlike a rule-based parser, seems to have the potential to correctly analyze a substantial range of linguistic phenomena. Because the parser is based on linguistic principles it should be more flexible and extendible than rule-based systems. Furthermore, such a parser may be changed more easily when there are changes in the linguistic theory on which it is based. These properties give the class of principle-based parsers greater promise to ultimately parse full-fledged natural language input.
