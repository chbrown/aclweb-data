One particular kind of ambiguity that has received little attention so far is whether it is the speaker or the third party to whom a description in an opaque third-party attitude report should be attributed.

The same is true of certain other complications of opaque contexts that are of special relevance to systems that use explicit representations of knowledge and belief. In particular, the interaction between intensional ambiguities 192 and the beliefs of agents has not been studied. The present work is a first step towards rectifying this. 2. Attributing descriptions Previous linguistic systems that dealt with opaque contexts, such as that of Montague (1973), have taken a God's-eye view, in the sense that the speaker and listener are assumed to have perfect knowledge, as are, in certain ways, the people of whom they speak. No account is taken of the limits of the knowledge or beliefs of the agents involved.","To see that beliefs are a complicating factor, consider the following sentence, usually considered to be two ways ambiguous -- transparent or opaque: (8) Nadia wants a dog like Ross's. These ambiguities, however, cross with an ambiguity as to which agent the description"]},{"title":"a dog like Ross's","paragraphs":["is to be attributed: to the speaker, or to Nadia (the agent of the verb of the sentence).

Desperately wanting to keep up with canine fashion, Nadia declares her intent to copy him. Whatever dog Ross has at any given time, Nadia wants to have the same kind.

Extensional readings always seem to refer to the present time. 2 Thus, there are at 2It may be objected that an extensional future-application reading is also possible. This would be like (14), except that Nadia has some particular dog in mind for the cosmetic alterations. If we allow Nadia to use this method repeatedly upon a particular dog, then an extensional reading corresponding to (15) would be 193 least seven readings for Nadia wants a dog like Ross 's. 3 3. Other intensional ambiguities and inference failures There are other kinds of intension-related inference failures besides those mentioned in the previous sec-tions. For example, some opaque contexts forbid inferences from postmodifier deletion, while others permit it. Both readings of (16) entail the less specific (17) (which preserves the ambiguity of (16)):","(16) Nadia is advertising for a penguin that she hasn't already met. (17) Nudia is advertising for a penguin. However, the same cannot be done with (18):","(18) Nadia would hate for there to be a penguin that she hasn't already met. (19) =]~Nazlia would hate for there to be a penguin. 4","The examples above have all involved explicit or implicit propositional attitudes and such contexts are apparently necessary for ambiguities of attribution of description and the associated possible inference failure and for problems of postmodifier deletion. However, there are many other kinds of context in which other intension-related ambiguities and inference failures can occur. For example, existential generalization can also fail in contexts of similarity and possibility: (20) Nadia is dressed like a creature from outer space. (21) =~There is a creature from outer space whom derived. That is, Nadia wants her particular dog to once or repeatedly become like Ross's dog. However, we don't see these readings as distinct from (14) and (15); Nadia's desire is clearly towards the goal of having a dog that matches a particular description, rather than towards that of owning a particular dog. 3Hofstadter, Clossman, and Meredith (1982) analyze a similar sentence for the case where the speaker and the agent are the same, I want the fastest car in the world, and derive five readings where we predict four. However, their two extensional readings are identical in our analysis, as they differ only in how many separate descriptions the agent has for the entity. 4This example is based on one of Fodor's (1980: 188). Fodor claims that postmodifier deletion is never valid in an opaque context; as example (17) shows, this claim is too strong. The problem in (19) seems to be that would hate means wants not, and the deletion is invalid in the scope of a negation. Nadia is dressed like.","(22) It is possible that a creature from outer space could interrupt your lecture at the most inconvenient moment.","(23) =/~ There is a creature from outer space who could possibly interrupt your lecture at the most inconvenient moment.","The kind of semantic irregularities that we are discussing are thus found in a large and syntactically diverse set of linguistic constructs. (See Fawcett (1985) for a long list, with discussion and examples.) Many seem to display idiosyncratic semantic features that could necessitate a broad range of operators in a representation, destroying any apparent homogeneity of the class. It is our suggestion, however, that these constructs can be processed in a uniform way. We argue that the diversity among the constructs can be accounted for by evaluating descriptors according to intensionality, agents, time, and states of affairs. Introducing the concept of a descriptor preserves the homogeneity of the class, while the dimensions along which descriptors may vary provide enough detail to differentiate among the particular semantics of the constructs. 4. The descriptor representation In this section we introduce a representation designed to capture the different possible readings of opaque constructions. In developing the representation, we have tried to move away from previous approaches to intensionality, such as that of Montague (1973), which use truth conditions and meaning postulates, and which take no account of the beliefs or knowledge of agents. Influenced by recent work on situation semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983, Lespe'rance 1986) and belief logics, we have aimed for a more 'common-sense' approach.","In the representation, we take an intension to be a finite representation of those properties that characterize membership in a class, and by a descriptor we mean a non-empty subset of the elements of an intension (in practice, often identical to the e0mplete intension). A descriptor provides access either to the intension of which it is a part or to its extension. This eliminates the need of explicitly listing all the known properties of an entity; only properties 194 relevant to the discourse situation are mentioned.","The representation is described in detail in Fawcett (1985); below we give a short description of the main points, and some examples of its use.","The representation is based on conventional temporal modal logic.

Usually the argument positions of the predication will be filled by bound variables or constants, introduced previously in the term-list. However, within temporal operator or agent scopes, argument positions may instead contain quantified terms.

This reflects observations of Moore (1981) and others that determiners rarely have a direct correlation with the existential and universal quantifiers of first-order logic. In many of the meaning representations used with logic grammars (Dahl (1981), for example), determiners provide the basic structure of the meaning representation formula. The determiners are translated into quantifiers and are all left-extraposed (to be later scoped relative to one another on the basis of some reasonably simple set of rules). As a result, the main predication of a clause will always be nested in the rightmost predication position.","Another approach focuses more on the main verbs by first translating them into predicates, and subsequently finding appropriate fillers for their arguments that contain the necessary quantifiers. However, this does not allow a convenient way to represent relative scoping ambiguities. Montague combines the two approaches. All quantifiers introduce two predicates: a restriction predicate and a main predication as in kR kP (3z (R{z} AND P{z})), which translates the determiner a.","Our approach is a compromise. Quantified terms consist of a variable and restriction, but do not incorporate the main predication. All quantified terms (except those that are opaque with respect to time or agent) are left-extraposed and assimilated into a single list structure followed by a single main predication. 5.

In sentences of propositional attitude, certain descriptors can be substituted for, provided the content of the proposition, relative to the speaker and the hearer, is not affected.
