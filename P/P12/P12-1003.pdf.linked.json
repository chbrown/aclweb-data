Since ad-hoc manual translation can represent a significant investment in time and money, a prior assesment of the amount of training data required to achieve a satisfactory accuracy level can be very useful. In this work, we show how to predict what the learning curve would look like if we were to manually translate increasing amounts of data. We consider two scenarios, 1) Monolingual samples in the source and target languages are available and 2) An additional small amount of parallel corpus is also available. We propose methods for predicting learning curves in both these scenarios."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Parallel data in the domain of interest is the key resource when training a statistical machine translation (SMT) system for a specific business purpose. In many cases it is possible to allocate some budget for manually translating a limited sample of relevant documents, be it via professional translation services or through increasingly fashionable crowdsourcing. However, it is often difficult to predict how much training data will be required to achieve satisfactory translation accuracy, preventing sound provisional budgetting. This prediction, or more generally the prediction of the learning curve of an SMT system as a function of available in-domain parallel data, is the objective of this paper.","We consider two scenarios, representative of realistic situations. 1. In the first scenario (S1), the SMT developer is given only monolingual source and target samples from the relevant domain, and a small test parallel corpus. ∗ This research was carried out during an internship at Xerox","Research Centre Europe.","2. In the second scenario (S2), an additional small seed parallel corpus is given that can be used to train small in-domain models and measure (with some variance) the evaluation score at a few points on the initial portion of the learning curve. In both cases, the task consists in predicting an evaluation score (BLEU, throughout this work) on the test corpus as a function of the size of a subset of the source sample, assuming that we could have it manually translated and use the resulting bilingual corpus for training.","In this paper we provide the following contributions:","1. An extensive study across six parametric function families, empirically establishing that a certain three-parameter power-law family is well suited for modeling learning curves for the Moses SMT system when the evaluation score is BLEU. Our methodology can be easily generalized to other systems and evaluation scores (Section 3);","2. A method for inferring learning curves based on features computed from the resources available in scenario S1, suitable for both the scenarios described above (S1) and (S2) (Section 4);","3. A method for extrapolating the learning curve from a few measurements, suitable for scenario S2 (Section 5);","4. A method for combining the two approaches above, achieving on S2 better prediction accuracy than either of the two in isolation (Section 6).","In this study we limit tuning to the mixing parameters of the Moses log-linear model through MERT, keeping all meta-parameters (e.g. maximum phrase length, maximum allowed distortion, etc.) at their default values. One can expect further tweaking to lead to performance improvements, but this was a 22 necessary simplification in order to execute the tests on a sufficiently large scale.","Our experiments involve 30 distinct language pair and domain combinations and 96 different learning curves. They show that without any parallel data we can predict the expected translation accuracy at 75K segments within an error of 6 BLEU points (Table 4), while using a seed training corpus of 10K segments narrows this error to within 1.5 points (Table 6)."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Learning curves are routinely used to illustrate how the performance of experimental methods depend on the amount of training data used. In the SMT area, Koehn et al. (2003) used learning curves to compare performance for various meta-parameter settings such as maximum phrase length, while Turchi et al. (2008) extensively studied the be-haviour of learning curves under a number of test conditions on Spanish-English. In Birch et al. (2008), the authors examined corpus features that contribute most to the machine translation performance. Their results showed that the most predictive features were the morphological complexity of the languages, their linguistic relatedness and their word-order divergence; in our work, we make use of these features, among others, for predicting translation accuracy (Section 4).","In a Machine Learning context, Perlich et al. (2003) used learning curves for predicting maximum performance bounds of learning algorithms and to compare them. In Gu et al. (2001), the learning curves of two classification algorithms were modelled for eight different large data sets. This work uses similar a priori knowledge for restricting the form of learning curves as ours (see Section 3), and also similar empirical evaluation criteria for comparing curve families with one another. While both application and performance metric in our work are different, we arrive at a similar conclusion that a power law family of the form y = c − a x−α","is a good model of the learning curves.","Learning curves are also frequently used for determining empirically the number of iterations for an incremental learning procedure.","The crucial difference in our work is that in the previous cases, learning curves are plotted a posteriori i.e. once the labelled data has become available and the training has been performed, whereas in our work the learning curve itself is the object of the prediction. Our goal is to learn to predict what the learning curve will be a priori without having to label the data at all (S1), or through labelling only a very small amount of it (S2).","In this respect, the academic field of Computational Learning Theory has a similar goal, since it strives to identify bounds to performance measures1",", typically including a dependency on the training sample size. We take a purely empirical approach in this work, and obtain useful estimations for a case like SMT, where the complexity of the mapping between the input and the output prevents tight theoretical analysis."]},{"title":"3 Selecting a parametric family of curves","paragraphs":["The first step in our approach consists in selecting a suitable family of shapes for the learning curves that we want to produce in the two scenarios being considered.","We formulate the problem as follows. For a certain bilingual test dataset d, we consider a set of observations Od = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)...(xn, yn)}, where yi is the performance on d (measured using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) of a translation model trained on a parallel corpus of size xi. The corpus size xi is measured in terms of the number of segments (sentences) present in the parallel corpus.","We consider such observations to be generated by a regression model of the form: yi = F (xi; θ) + εi 1 ≤ i ≤ n (1) where F is a function depending on a vector parameter θ which depends on d, and εi is Gaussian noise of constant variance.","Based on our prior knowledge of the problem, we limit the search for a suitable F to families that satisfies the following conditions- monotonically increasing, concave and bounded. The first condition just says that more training data is better. The second condition expresses a notion of “diminishing returns”, namely that a given amount of additional training data is more advantageous when added to a small rather than to a big amount of initial data. The last condition is related to our use of BLEU — which is bounded by 1 — as a performance measure; It should be noted that some growth patterns which are sometimes proposed, such as a logarithmic regime of the form y ≃ a + b log x, are not 1 More often to a loss, which is equivalent. 23 compatible with this constraint.","We consider six possible families of functions satisfying these conditions, which are listed in Table 1.

The only available parallel resource is a very small test corpus. Our objective is to predict the evolution of the BLEU score on the given test set as a function of the size of a random subset of the training data that we manually translate4",". The intuition behind this is that the source-side and target-side monolingual data already convey significant information about the difficulty of the translation task.","We proceed in the following way. We first train models to predict the BLEU score at m anchor sizes s1, . . . , sm, based on a set of features globally characterizing the configuration of interest. We restrict our attention to linear models:","μj = wj⊤ φ, j ∈ {1 . . . m} where wj is a vector of feature weights specific to predicting at anchor size j, and φ is a vector of size-independent configuration features, detailed below. We then perform inference using these models to predict the BLEU score at each anchor, for the test case of interest. We finally estimate the parameters of the learning curve by weighted least squares regression using the anchor predictions.","Anchor sizes can be chosen rather arbitrarily, but must satisfy the following two constraints:","1. They must be three or more in number in order to allow fitting the tri-parameter curve.","2. They should be spread as much as possible along the range of sample size. For our experiments, we take m = 3, with anchors at 10K, 75K and 500K segments.","The feature vector φ consists of the following features:","1. General properties: number and average length of sentences in the (source) test set.","2. Average length of tokens in the (source) test set and in the monolingual source language corpus. 3. Lexical diversity features: (a) type-token ratios for n-grams of order 1 to","5 in the monolingual corpus of both source","and target languages (b) perplexity of language models of order 2","to 5 derived from the monolingual source","corpus computed on the source side of the","test corpus.","4","We specify that it is a random sample as opposed to a subset","deliberately chosen to maximize learning effectiveness. While","there are clear ties between our present work and active learn-","ing, we prefer to keep these two aspects distinct at this stage,","and intend to explore this connection in future work. 25","4. Features capturing divergence between languages in the pair:","(a) average ratio of source/target sentence lengths in the test set.","(b) ratio of type-token ratios of orders 1 to 5 in the monolingual corpus of both source and target languages.","5. Word-order divergence: The divergence in the word-order between the source and the target languages can be captured using the part-of-speech (pos) tag sequences across languages. We use cross-entropy measure to capture similarity between the n-gram distributions of the pos tags in the monolingual corpora of the two languages. The order of the n-grams ranges between n = 2, 4 . . . 12 in order to account for long distance reordering between languages. The pos tags for the languages are mapped to a reduced set of twelve pos tags (Petrov et al., 2012) in order to account for differences in tagsets used across languages. These features capture our intuition that translation is going to be harder if the language in the domain is highly variable and if the source and target languages diverge more in terms of morphology and word-order.","The weights wj are estimated from data. The training data for fitting these linear models is obtained in the following way. For each configuration (combination of language pair and domain) c and test set t in Table 2, a gold curve is fitted using the selected tri-parameter power-law family using a fine grid of corpus sizes. This is available as a byproduct of the experiments for comparing different parametric families described in Section 3. We then compute the value of the gold curves at the m anchor sizes: we thus have m “gold” vectors μ1, . . . , μm with accurate estimates of BLEU at the anchor sizes5",". We construct the design matrix Φ with one column for each feature vector φct corresponding to each combination of training configurationc and test set t.","We then estimate weights wj using Ridge regression (L2","regularization):","wj = arg min w","||Φ⊤","w − μj||2","+ C||w||2","(3)","5","Computing these values from the gold curve rather than directly from the observations has the advantage of smoothing the observed values and also does not assume that observations at the anchor sizes are always directly available. where the regularization parameter C is chosen by cross-validation. We also run experiments using Lasso (L1",") regularization (Tibshirani, 1994) instead of Ridge. As baseline, we take a constant mean model predicting, for each anchor size sj, the average of all the μjct.","We do not assume the difficulty of predicting BLEU at all anchor points to be the same. To allow for this, we use (non-regularized) weighted least-squares to fit a curve from our parametric family through the m anchor points6",". Following (Croarkin and Tobias, 2006, Section 4.4.5.2), the anchor confidence is set to be the inverse of the cross-validated mean square residuals: ωj = ( 1 N ∑ c∈S ∑ t∈Tc","(φ⊤ ctw \\c j − μjct)2 )−1 (4) where w","\\c","j are the feature weights obtained by the regression above on all training configurations except c, μjct is the gold value at anchor j for training/test combination c, t, and N is the total number of such combinations7",".

We identified a suitable parametric family for modeling learning curves via an extensive empirical comparison. We described an inference method that requires a minimal initial investment in the form of only a small parallel test dataset. For the cases where a slightly larger in-domain “seed” parallel corpus is available, we introduced an extrapolation method and a combined method yielding highprecision predictions: using models trained on up to 20K sentence pairs we can predict performance on a given test set with a root mean squared error in the order of 1 BLEU point at 75K sentence pairs, and in the order of 2-4 BLEU points at 500K. Consider-ing that variations in the order of 1 BLEU point on a same test dataset can be observed simply due to the instability of the standard MERT parameter tuning algorithm (Foster and Kuhn, 2009; Clark et al., 2011), we believe our results to be close to what can be achieved in principle. Note that by using gold curves as labels instead of actual measures we implicitly average across many rounds of MERT (14 for each curve), greatly attenuating the impact of the instability in the optimization procedure due to randomness.","For enabling this work we trained a multitude of instances of the same phrase-based SMT system on 30 distinct combinations of language-pair and domain, each with fourteen distinct training sets of increasing size and tested these instances on multiple in-domain datasets, generating 96 learning curves. BLEU measurements for all 96 learning curves along with the gold curves and feature values used for inferring the learning curves are available as additional material to this submission.","We believe that it should be possible to use in-sights from this paper in an active learning setting, to select, from an available monolingual source, a subset of a given size for manual translation, in such a way at to yield the highest performance, and we plan to extend our work in this direction. 29"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Alexandra Birch, Miles Osborne, and Philipp Koehn. 2008.
