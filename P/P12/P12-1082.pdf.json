This de-ficiency provokes attachment errors in the parsers trained on such data. We propose in this paper to compute lexical affinities, on large corpora, for specific lexico-syntactic configurations that are hard to disambiguate and introduce the new information in a parser. Experiments on the French Treebank showed a relative decrease of the error rate of 7.1% Labeled Accuracy Score yielding the best parsing results on this treebank."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Probabilistic parsers are usually trained on treebanks composed of few thousands sentences. While this amount of data seems reasonable for learning syntactic phenomena and, to some extent, very frequent lexical phenomena involving closed parts of speech (POS), it proves inadequate when modeling lexical dependencies between open POS, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. This fact was first recognized by (Bikel, 2004) who showed that bilexical dependencies were barely used in Michael Collins’ parser.","The work reported in this paper aims at a better modeling of such phenomena by using a raw corpus that is several orders of magnitude larger than the treebank used for training the parser. The raw corpus is first parsed and the computedlexical affinities between lemmas, in specific lexico-syntactic configurations, are then injected back in the parser. Two outcomes are expected from this procedure, the first is, as mentioned above, a better modeling of bilexical dependencies and the second is a method to adapt a parser to new domains.","The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some work on the same topic and highlights their differences with ours. In section 3, we describe the parser that we use in our experiments and give a detailed description of the frequent attachment errors. Section 4 describes how lexical affinities between lemmas are calculated and their impact is then evaluated with respect to the attachment errors made by the parser. Section 5 describes three ways to in-tegrate the lexical affinities in the parser and reports the results obtained with the three methods."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Coping with lexical sparsity of treebanks using raw corpora has been an active direction of research for many years.","One simple and effective way to tackle this problem is to put together words that share, in a large raw corpus, similar linear contexts, into word clusters. The word occurrences of the training treebank are then replaced by their cluster identifier and a new parser is trained on the transformed treebank. Using such techniques (Koo et al., 2008) report significative improvement on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and so do (Candito and Seddah, 2010; Candito and Crabbé, 2009) on the French Treebank (Abeillé et al., 2003).","Another series of papers (Volk, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2005; Pitler et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011) directly model word co-occurrences. Co-occurrences of pairs of words are first collected in a 777 raw corpus or internet n-grams. Based on the counts produced, lexical affinity scores are computed. The detection of pairs of words co-occurrences is generally very simple, it is either based on the direct adjacency of the words in the string or their co-occurrence in a window of a few words. (Bansal and Klein, 2011; Nakov and Hearst, 2005) rely on the same sort of techniques but use more sophisticated patterns, based on simple paraphrase rules, for identifying co-occurrences.","Our work departs from those approaches by the fact that we do not extract the lexical information directly on a raw corpus, but we first parse it and then extract the co-occurrences on the parse trees, based on some predetermined lexico-syntactic patterns. The first reason for this choice is that the linguistic phenomena that we are interested in, such as as PP attachment, coordination, verb subject and object can range over long distances, beyond what is generally taken into account when working on limited windows. The second reason for this choice was to show that the performances that the NLP community has reached on parsing, combined with the use of confidence measures allow to use parsers to extract accurate lexico-syntactic information, beyond what can be found in limited annotated corpora.","Our work can also be compared with self training approaches to parsing (McClosky et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2009; Steedman et al., 2003; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007) where a parser is first trained on a treebank and then used to parse a large raw corpus. The parses produced are then added to the initial treebank and a new parser is trained. The main difference between these approaches and ours is that we do not directly add the output of the parser to the training corpus, but extract precise lexical information that is then re-injected in the parser. In the self training approach, (Chen et al., 2009) is quite close to our work: instead of adding new parses to the treebank, the occurrence of simple interesting subtrees are detected in the parses and introduced as new features in the parser.","The way we introduce lexical affinity measures in the parser, in 5.1, shares some ideas with (Anguiano and Candito, 2011), who modify some attachments in the parser output, based on lexical information. The main difference is that we only take attachments that appear in an n-best parse list into account, while they consider the first best parse and compute all potential alternative attachments, that may not actually occur in the n-best forests."]},{"title":"3 The Parser","paragraphs":["The parser used in this work is the second order graph based parser (McDonald et al., 2005; Kübler et al., 2009) implementation of (Bohnet, 2010).

The third one displays the accuracy for this type of dependency (the number of dependencies of this type correctly analyzed by the parser divided by the total number of dependencies of this type).

The numerical value 0.23 accounts for how much eat and oyster like to co-occur in the verb-object configuration.

The context (∗, g)","∗","→ (∗, d), for example is very generic but does not model a precise linguistic phenomenon, as selectional preferences of a verb, for example. Moreover, configurations need to be error-prone. In the perspective of increasing a parser performances, there is no point in computing lexical affinity scores between words that appear in a configuration for which 779 the parser never makes mistakes.","The creation of the lexical resource is a three stage process. The first step is the definition of configurations, the second one is the collection of raw counts from the machine parsed corpora and the third one is the computation of lexical affinities based on the raw counts. The three steps are described in the following subsection while the evaluation of the created resource is reported in subsection 4.2. 4.1 Computing Lexical Affinities A set of 9 configurations have been defined. Their selection is a manual process based on the analysis of the errors made by the parser, described in section 3, as well as on the linguistic phenomena they model. The list of the 9 configurations is described in Table 4. As one can see on this table, configurations are usually simple, made up of one or two dependencies. Linguistically, configurations OBJ and SBJ concern subject and object attachments, configuration ADJ is related to attachments of adjectives to nouns and configurations NdeN, VdeN, VaN, and NaN indicate prepositional attachments. We have restricted ourselves here to two common French prepositions à and de. Configurations NcN and VcV deal respectively with noun and verb coordination.

We are now in a position to compute the score s(C, lg, ld). This score should reflect the tendency of lg and ld to appear together in configuration C. It should be maximal if whenever lg occurs as the governor of configuration C, the dependent position is occupied by ld and, symmetrically, if whenever ld occurs as the dependent of configuration C, the governor position is occupied by lg. A function that conforms such a behavior is the following: s(C, lg, ld) = 1 2 ( C(C, lg, ld) C(C, lg, ∗) + C(C, lg, ld) C(C, ∗, ld) )","it takes its values between 0 (lg and ld never co-occur) and 1 (g and d always co-occur). This function is close to pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990) but takes its values between 0 and 1. 4.2 Evaluation Lexical affinities were computed on three corpora of slightly different genres. The first one, is a collection of news report of the French press agency Agence France Presse, the second is a collection of newspaper articles from a local French newspaper : l’Est Républicain. The third one is a collection of articles from the French Wikipedia. The size of the different corpora are detailed in table 5. The corpus was first POS tagged, lemmatized and parsed in order to get the 50 best parses for every sentence. Then the lexical resource was built, based on the 9 configurations described in table 4.","The lexical resource has been evaluated on FTB DEV with respect to two measures: coverage 780 and correction rate, described in the next two sections. 4.2.1 Coverage","Coverage measures the instantiated configurations present in the evaluation corpus that are in the resource. The results are presented in table 6. Every line represents a configuration, the second column indicates the number of different instantiations of this configuration in the evaluation corpus, the third one indicates the number of instantiated configurations that were actually found in the lexical resource and the fourth column shows the coverage for this configuration, which is the ratio third column over the second.

Given a word d present in a sentence S and a configurationC, the set of all potential governors of d in configuration C, in all the n-best parses produced by the parser is computed. This set is noted G = {g1, . . . , gj}. Let us note GL the element of G that maximizes the lexical affinity score. When the lexical resource gives no score to any of the elements of G, GL is left unspecified.","Ideally, G should not be the set of governors in the n-best parses but the set of all possible governors for d in sentence S. Since we have no simple way to compute the latter, we will content ourselves with the former as an approximation of the latter.","Let us note GH the governor of d in the (first) best parse produced and GR the governor of d in the correct parse. CR measures the effect of replacing GH with GL.","We have represented in table 7 the different scenarios that can happen when comparing GH , GR and GL. GL = GR or GL unspec.

In scenario CC, the lexical affinity score was compatible with the choice of the parser or the lexical resource did not select any candidate. In scenario CE, the lexical resource introduced an error. In scenarios EC and EE, the parser made an error. In EC, the error was corrected by the lexical resource while in EE, it wasn’t. Either because the lexical resource candidate was not the correct governor or it was unspecified. The last case, NA, indicates that the correct governor does not appear in any of the n-best parses. Technically this case could be integrated in EE (an error made by the parser was not corrected by the lexical resource) but we chose to keep it apart 781 since it represents a case where the right solution could not be found in the n-best parse list (the correct governor is not a member of set G).","Let’s note nS the number of occurrences of scenario S for a given configuration.

Results for PP attachments VdeN, VaN and NaN are quite good (a CR of 75% for a given configuration, as VdeN indicates that the number of errors on such a configuration is decreased by25%). It is interesting to note that the parser behaves quite badly on these attachments: their accuracy (as reported in table 3) is, respectively 74.68, 69.1 and 70.64. Lexical affinity helps in such cases. On the other hand, some attachments like configuration ADJ and NdeN, for which the parser showed very good accuracy (96.6 and 92.2) show very poor performances. In such cases, taking into account lexical affinity creates new errors. 1","One can note, that contrary to coverage, CR does not measure a characteristic of the lexical resource alone, but the lexical resource combined with a parser.","On average, using the lexical resource with this simple strategy of systematically replacing GH with GL allows to decrease by 20% the errors made on our 9 configurations and by 2.5% the global error rate of the parser. 4.3 Filtering Data with Ambiguity Threshold The data used to extract counts is noisy: it contains errors made by the parser. Ideally, we would like to take into account only non ambiguous sentences, for which the parser outputs a single parse hypothesis, hopefully the good one. Such an approach is obviously doomed to fail since almost every sentence will be associated to several parses. Another solution would be to select sentences for which the parser has a high confidence, using confidence measures as proposed in (Sánchez-Sáez et al., 2009; Hwa, 2004). But since we are only interested in some parts of sentences (usually one attachment), we don’t need high confidence for the whole sentence. We have instead used a parameter, defined on single dependencies, called the ambiguity measure.","Given the n best parses of a sentence and a dependency δ, present in at least one of the n best parses, let us note C(δ) the number of occurrences of δ in the n best parse set. We note AM (δ) the ambiguity measure associated to δ. It is computed as follows: AM (δ) = 1 −","C(δ)","n","An ambiguity measure of 0 indicates that δ is non ambiguous in the set of the n best parses (the word that constitutes the dependent in δ is attached to the word that constitutes the governor in δ in all the n-best analyses). When n gets large enough this measure approximates the non ambiguity of a dependency in a given sentence.","Ambiguity measure is used to filter the data when counting the number of occurrences of a configuration: only occurrences that are made of dependencies δ such that AM (δ) ≤ τ are taken into account. τ is called the ambiguity threshold.","The results of coverage and CR given above were computed for τ equal to 1, which means that, when collecting counts, all the dependencies are taken into account whatever their ambiguity is. Table 9 shows coverage and CR for different values of τ . As expected, coverage decreases with τ . But, interest-782 ingly, decreasing τ , from 1 down to 0.2 has a positive influence on CR.

The first two are post-processing methods, that take as input the n-best parses produced by the parser and modify some attachments with respect to the information given by the lexical resource. The third method in-troduces the lexical affinity scores as new features in the parsing model. The three methods are described in 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. They are evaluated in 5.4. 5.1 Post Processing Method The post processing method is quite simple. It is very close to the method that was used to compute the Correction Rate of the lexical resource, in 4.2.2: it takes as input the n-best parses produced by the parser and, for every configuration occurrence C found in the first best parse, the set (G) of all potential governors of C, in the n-best parses, is computed and among them, the word that maximizes the lexical affinity score (GL) is identified.","Once GL is identified, one can replace the choice of the parser (GH ) with GL. This method is quite crude since it does not take into account the confidence the parser has in the solution proposed. We observed, in 4.2.2 that CR was very low for configurations for which the parser achieves good accuracy. In order to introduce the parser confidence in the final choice of a governor, we compute C(GH ) and C(GL) which respectively represent the number of times GH and GL appear as the governor of configuration C. The choice of the final governor, noted Ĝ, depends on the ratio of C(GH ) and C(GL). The complete selection strategy is the following: 1. if GH = GL or GL is unspecified, Ĝ = GH . 2. if GH ̸= GL, Ĝ is determined as follows: Ĝ = { GH if C(GH) C(GL) > α","GL otherwise where α is a coefficient that is optimized on the development data set.","We have reported, in table 10 the values of CR, for the 9 different features, using this strategy, for τ = 1. We do not report the values of CR for other values of τ since they are very close to each other. The table shows several noticeable facts. First, the new strategy performs much better than the former one (crudely replacing GH by GL), the value of CR increased from 0.2 to 0.4, which means that the errors made on the nine configurations are now decreased by 40%. Second, CR is now positive for every configuration: the number of errors is decreased for every configuration. Conf. OBJ SUJ ADJ NdeN VdeN CR 0.45 0.46 0.14 0.05 0.73 Conf.

But it has an important drawback: it creates inconsistent parses. Recall that the parser we are using is based on a second order model, which means that the score of a dependency depends on some neighboring ones. Since with the post processing method only a subset of the dependencies are modified, the resulting parse is inconsistent: the score of some dependencies is computed on the basis of other dependencies that have been modified. 783","In order to compute a new optimal parse tree that preserves the modified dependencies, we have used a technique proposed in (Mirroshandel and Nasr, 2011) that modifies the scoring function of the parser in such a way that the dependencies that we want to keep in the parser output get better scores than all competing dependencies.","The double parsing method is therefore a three stage method. First, sentence S is parsed, producing the n-best parses. Then, the post processing method is used, modifying the first best parse. Let’s note D the set of dependencies that were changed in this process. In the last stage, a new parse is produced, that preserves D. 5.3 Feature Based Method In the feature based method, new features are added to the parser that rely on lexical affinity scores. These features are of the following form: ⟨C, lg, ld, δC (s)⟩, where C is a configuration number, s is the lexical affinity score (s = s(C, lg, ld)) and δc(·) is a discretization function.","Discretization of the lexical affinity scores is necessary in order to fight against data sparseness. In this work, we have used Weka software (Hall et al., 2009) to discretize the scores with unsupervised binning. Binning is a simple process which divides the range of possible values a parameter can take into subranges called bins. Two methods are implemented in Weka to find the optimal number of bins: equal-frequency and equal-width. In equal-frequency binning, the range of possible values are divided into k bins, each of which holds the same number of instances. In equal-width binning, which is the method we have used, the range are divided into k subranges of the same size. The optimal number of bins is the one that minimizes the entropy of the data. Weka computes different number of bins for different configurations, ranging from 4 to 10. The number of new features added to the parser is equal to ∑","C B(C) where C is a configuration and","B(C) is the number of bins for configurationC. 5.4 Evaluation The three methods described above have been evaluated on FTB TEST. Results are reported in table 11. The three methods outperformed the baseline (the state of the art parser for French which is a second order graph based method) (Bohnet, 2010). The best performances were obtained by the Double Parsing method that achieved a labeled relative error reduc-tion of 7, 1% on predicted POS tags, yielding the best parsing results on the French Treebank. It performs better than the Post Processing method, which means that the second parsing stage corrects some inconsistencies introduced in the Post Processing method. The performances of the Feature Based method are disappointing, it achieves an error reduc-tion of 1.4%. This result is not easy to interpret. It is probably due to the limited number of new features introduced in the parser. These new features probably have a hard time competing with the large number of other features in the training process.","pred.

We have proposed in this paper one method to compute lexical affinity scores as well as three ways to introduce this new information in a parser. Experiments on a French corpus showed a relative decrease of the error rate of 7.1% Labeled Accuracy Score."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work has been funded by the French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, through the projects SEQUOIA (ANR-08-EMER-013) and EDYLEX (ANR-08-CORD-009). 784"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A.
