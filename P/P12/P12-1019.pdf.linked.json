However, these language models can be difficult to use in practice because of the time required to generate features for rescoring a large hypothesis set. In this work, we propose substructure sharing, which saves duplicate work in processing hypothesis sets with redundant hypothesis structures. We apply substructure sharing to a dependency parser and part of speech tagger to obtain significant speedups, and further improve the accuracy of these tools through up-training. When using these improved tools in a language model for speech recognition, we obtain significant speed improvements with both N -best and hill climbing rescoring, and show that up-training leads to WER reduction."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Language models (LM) are crucial components in tasks that require the generation of coherent natural language text, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). While traditional LMs use word n-grams, where the n − 1 previous words predict the next word, newer models integrate long-span information in making decisions. For example, incorporating long-distance dependencies and syntactic structure can help the LM better predict words by complementing the predictive power of n-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Collins et al., 2005; Filimonov and Harper, 2009; Kuo et al., 2009).","The long-distance dependencies can be modeled in either a generative or a discriminative framework. Discriminative models, which directly distinguish correct from incorrect hypothesis, are particularly attractive because they allow the inclusion of arbitrary features (Kuo et al., 2002; Roark et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2005); these models with syntactic information have obtained state of the art results.","However, both generative and discriminative LMs with long-span dependencies can be slow, for they often cannot work directly with lattices and require rescoring large N -best lists (Khudanpur and Wu, 2000; Collins et al., 2005; Kuo et al., 2009). For discriminative models, this limitation applies to training as well. Moreover, the non-local features used in rescoring are usually extracted via auxiliary tools – which in the case of syntactic features include part of speech taggers and parsers – from a set of ASR system hypotheses. Separately applying auxiliary tools to each N -best list hypothesis leads to major inefficiencies as many hypotheses differ only slightly.","Recent work on hill climbing algorithms for ASR lattice rescoring iteratively searches for a higher-scoring hypothesis in a local neighborhood of the current-best hypothesis, leading to a much more efficient algorithm in terms of the number, N , of hypotheses evaluated (Rastrow et al., 2011b); the idea also leads to a discriminative hill climbing training algorithm (Rastrow et al., 2011a). Even so, the reliance on auxiliary tools slow LM application to the point of being impractical for real time systems. While faster auxiliary tools are an option, they are usually less accurate.","In this paper, we propose a general modifica-175 tion to the decoders used in auxiliary tools to utilize the commonalities among the set of generated hypotheses. The key idea is to share substructure states in transition based structured prediction algorithms, i.e. algorithms where final structures are composed of a sequence of multiple individual decisions. We demonstrate our approach on a local Perceptron based part of speech tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2011) and a shift reduce dependency parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), yielding significantly faster tagging and parsing of ASR hypotheses. While these simpler structured prediction models are faster, we compensate for the model’s simplicity through up-training (Petrov et al., 2010), yielding auxiliary tools that are both fast and accurate. The result is significant speed improvements and a reduction in word error rate (WER) for both N -best list and the already fast hill climbing rescoring. The net result is arguably the first syntactic LM fast enough to be used in a real time ASR system."]},{"title":"2 Syntactic Language Models","paragraphs":["There have been several approaches to include syntactic information in both generative and discriminative language models.","For generative LMs, the syntactic information must be part of the generative process. Structured language modeling incorporates syntactic parse trees to identify the head words in a hypothesis for modeling dependencies beyond n-grams. Chelba and Jelinek (2000) extract the two previous exposed head words at each position in a hypothesis, along with their non-terminal tags, and use them as context for computing the probability of the current position. Khudanpur and Wu (2000) exploit such syntactic head word dependencies as features in a maximum entropy framework. Kuo et al. (2009) integrate syntactic features into a neural network LM for Arabic speech recognition.","Discriminative models are more flexible since they can include arbitrary features, allowing for a wider range of long-span syntactic dependencies. Additionally, discriminative models are directly trained to resolve the acoustic confusion in the decoded hypotheses of an ASR system. This flexibility and training regime translate into better performance. Collins et al. (2005) uses the Perceptron algorithm to train a global linear discriminative model which incorporates long-span features, such as head-to-head dependencies and part of speech tags. Our Language Model. We work with a discriminative LM with long-span dependencies. We use a global linear model with Perceptron training. We rescore the hypotheses (lattices) generated by the ASR decoder—in a framework most similar to that of Rastrow et al. (2011a).","The LM score S(w, a) for each hypothesis w of a speech utterance with acoustic sequence a is based on the baseline ASR system score b(w, a) (initial n-gram LM score and the acoustic score) and α0, the weight assigned to the baseline score.1","The score is defined as:","S(w, a) = α0 · b(w, a) + F (w, s1 , . . . , sm",") = α0 · b(w, a) + d ∑ i=1","αi · Φi(w, s1 , . . . , sm",") where F is the discriminative LM’s score for the hypothesis w, and s1",", . . . , sm","are candidate syntactic structures associated with w, as discussed below. Since we use a linear model, the score is a weighted linear combination of the count of activated features of the word sequence w and its associated structures: Φi(w, s1",", . . . , sm","). Perceptron training learns the parameters α. The baseline score b(w, a) can be a feature, yielding the dot product notation: S(w, a) = ⟨α, Φ(a, w, s1",", . . . , sm",")⟩ Our LM uses features from the dependency tree and part of speech (POS) tag sequence. We use the method described in Kuo et al. (2009) to identify the two previous exposed head words, h−2, h−1, at each position i in the input hypothesis and include the following syntactic based features into our LM: 1. (h−2.w ◦ h−1.w ◦ wi) , (h−1.w ◦ wi) , (wi) 2. (h−2.t ◦ h−1.t ◦ ti) , (h−1.t ◦ ti) , (ti) , (tiwi) where h.w and h.t denote the word identity and the POS tag of the corresponding exposed head word. 2.1 Hill Climbing Rescoring We adopt the so called hill climbing framework of Rastrow et al. (2011b) to improve both training and rescoring time as much as possible by reducing the","1","We tune α0 on development data (Collins et al., 2005). 176 number N of explored hypotheses. We summarize it below for completeness.","Given a speech utterance’s lattice L from a first pass ASR decoder, the neighborhood N (w, i) of a hypothesis w = w1 w2 . . . wn at position i is defined as the set of all paths in the lattice that may be obtained by editing wi: deleting it, substituting it, or inserting a word to its left. In other words, it is the “distance-1-at-position i” neighborhood of w. Given a position i in a word sequence w, all hypotheses in N (w, i) are rescored using the long-span model and the hypothesis ŵ′","(i) with the highest score becomes the new w. The process is repeated with a new position – scanned left to right – until w = ŵ′","(1) = . . . = ŵ′","(n), i.e. when w itself is the highest scoring hypothesis in all its 1-neighborhoods, and can not be furthered improved using the model. Incorporating this into training yields a discriminative hill climbing algorithm (Rastrow et al., 2011a)."]},{"title":"3 Incorporating Syntactic Structures","paragraphs":["Long-span models – generative or discriminative, N -best or hill climbing – rely on auxiliary tools, such as a POS tagger or a parser, for extracting features for each hypothesis during rescoring, and during training for discriminative models.

For each hypothesis, we apply an external tool (e.g. parser) to generate associated structures s1","i , . . . , sm","i (e.g. dependencies.) These are then passed to the language model along with the word sequence for scoring. 3.1 Substructure Sharing While long-span LMs have been empirically shown to improve WER over n-gram LMs, the computational burden prohibits long-span LMs in practice, particularly in real-time systems. A major complexity factor is due to processing 100s or 1000s of hypotheses for each speech utterance, even during hill climbing, each of which must be POS tagged and parsed. However, the candidate hypotheses of an utterance share equivalent substructures, especially in hill climbing methods due to the locality present in the neighborhood generation. Figure 1 demonstrates such repetition in an N -best list (N =10) and a hill climbing neighborhood hypothesis set for a speech utterance from broadcast news. For example, the word “ENDORSE” occurs within the same local context in all hypotheses and should receive the same part of speech tag in each case. Processing each hypothesis separately wastes time.","We propose a general algorithmic approach to reduce the complexity of processing a hypothesis set by sharing common substructures among the hypotheses. Critically, unlike many lattice parsing algorithms, our approach is general and produces exact output. We first present our approach and then demonstrate its generality by applying it to a dependency parser and part of speech tagger.","We work with structured prediction models that produce output from a series of local decisions: a transition model. We begin in initial state π0 and terminate in a possible final state πf . All states along the way are chosen from the possible states Π. A transition (or action) ω ∈ Ω advances the decoder from state to state, where the transition ωi changes the state from πi to πi+1. The sequence of states {π0 . . . πi, πi+1 . . . πf } can be mapped to an output (the model’s prediction.) The choice of action ω is given by a learning algorithm, such as a maximum-entropy classifier, support vector machine or Perceptron, trained on labeled data. Given the previous k actions up to πi, the classifier g : Π × Ωk","→ R|Ω|","assigns a score to each possible action, which we can interpret as a probability: pg(ωi|πi, ωi−1ωi−2 . . . ωi−k). These actions are applied to transition to new states πi+1. We note that state definitions can encode the k previous actions, which simplifies the probability to pg(ωi|πi).

Features are conjoined with actions for multi-class classification, so pg(ωi|πi) = pg(f (π) ◦ ωi), where ◦ is a conjunc-tion operation. In this way, states can be summarized by features.","Equivalent states are defined as two states π and π′","with an identical feature representation:","π ≡ π′ iff f (π) = f (π′",") If two states are equivalent, then g imposes the same distribution over actions. We can benefit from this substructure redundancy, both within and between hypotheses, by saving these distributions in memory, sharing a distribution computed just once across equivalent states. A similar idea of equivalent states is used by Huang and Sagae (2010), except they use equivalence to facilitate dynamic programming for shift-reduce parsing, whereas we generalize it for improving the processing time of similar hypotheses in general models. Following Huang and Sagae, we define kernel features as the smallest set of atomic features f̃ (π) such that,","f̃ (π) = f̃ (π′ ) ⇒ π ≡ π′",". (2) Equivalent distributions are stored in a hash table H : Π → Ω × R; the hash keys are the states and the values are distributions2","over actions: {ω, p","g(ω|π)}. 2 For pure greedy search (deterministic search) we need only","retain the best action, since the distribution is only used in prob-","abilistic search, such as beam search or best-first algorithms. H caches equivalent states in a hypothesis set and resets for each new utterance. For each state, we first check H for equivalent states before computing the action distribution; each cache hit reduces decoding time. Distributing hypotheses wi across different CPU threads is another way to obtain speedups, and we can still benefit from substructure sharing by storing H in shared memory. We use h(π) =","∑|f̃(π)|","i=1 int( f̃i(π)) as the hash function, where int( f̃i(π)) is an integer mapping of the ith","kernel feature. For integer typed features the mapping is trivial, for string typed features (e.g. a POS tag identity) we use a mapping of the corresponding vocabulary to integers. We empirically found that this hash function is very effective and yielded very few collisions.","To apply substructure sharing to a transition based model, we need only define the set of states Π (in-cluding π0 and πf ), actions Ω and kernel feature functions f̃ . The resulting speedup depends on the amount of substructure duplication among the hypotheses, which we will show is significant for ASR lattice rescoring. Note that our algorithm is not an approximation; we obtain the same output {s","j","i } as","we would without any sharing. We now apply this","algorithm to dependency parsing and POS tagging. 3.2 Dependency Parsing We use the best-first probabilistic shift-reduce dependency parser of Sagae and Tsujii (2007), a transition-based parser (Kübler et al., 2009) with a MaxEnt classifier. Dependency trees are built by processing the words left-to-right and the classifier assigns a distribution over the actions at each step.

(s0 is the top tree) and Q are words in the input word sequence. The initial state is π0 = {∅, {w0, w1, . . .}}, and final states occur when Q is empty and S contains a single tree (the output).","Ω is determined by the set of dependency labels r ∈ R and one of three transition types:","• Shift: remove the head of Q (wj) and place it on the top of S as a singleton tree (only wj.)","• Reduce-Leftr: replace the top two trees in S (s0 and s1) with a tree formed by making the root of s1 a dependent of the root of s0 with label r.","• Reduce-Rightr: same as Reduce-Leftr except reverses s0 and s1. Table 1 shows the kernel features used in our dependency parser. See Sagae and Tsujii (2007) for a complete list of features.","Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) observed that parsing time is dominated by feature extraction and score calculation. Substructure sharing reduces these steps for equivalent states, which are persistent throughout a candidate set. Note that there are far fewer kernel features than total features, hence the hash function calculation is very fast.","We summarize substructure sharing for dependency parsing in Algorithm 1. We extend the definition of states to be {S, Q, p} where p denotes the score of the state: the probability of the action sequence that resulted in the current state.

(2011), a transition based model with a Perceptron and a lookahead heuristic process. The tagger processes w left to right. States are defined as πi = {ci, w}: a sequence of assigned tags up to wi (ci = t1t2 . . . ti−1) and the word sequence w. Ω is defined simply as the set of possible POS tags (T ) that can be applied. The final state is reached once all the positions are tagged. For f we use the features of Tsuruoka et al. (2011). The kernel features are f̃ (πi) = {ti−2, ti−1, wi−2, wi−1, wi, wi+1, wi+2}. While the tagger extracts prefix and suffix features, it suffices to look at wi for determining state equivalence. The tagger is deterministic (greedy) in that it only considers the best tag at each step, so we do not store scores. However, this tagger uses a depth-","3","Sagae and Tsujii (2007) use a beam strategy to increase speed.

Using more complex models with higher accuracy is impractical because they are slow. Instead, we seek to improve the accuracy of our fast tools.","To achieve this goal we use up-training, in which a more complex model is used to improve the accuracy of a simpler model. We are given two models, M1 and M2, as well as a large collection of unlabeled text. Model M1 is slow but very accurate while M2 is fast but obtains lower accuracy. Up-training applies M1 to tag the unlabeled data, which is then used as training data for M2. Like self-training, a model is retrained on automatic output, but here the output comes form a more accurate model. Petrov et al. (2010) used up-training as a domain adaptation technique: a constituent parser – which is more robust to domain changes – was used to label a new domain, and a fast dependency parser","5","Tsuruoka et al.

We use a similar idea where our goal is to recover the accuracy lost from using simpler models. Note that while up-training uses two models, it differs from co-training since we care about improving only one model (M2). Additionally, the models can vary in different ways. For example, they could be the same algorithm with different pruning methods, which can lead to faster but less accurate models.","We apply up-training to improve the accuracy of both our fast POS tagger and dependency parser. We parse a large corpus of text with a very accurate but very slow constituent parser and use the resulting data to up-train our tools. We will demonstrate empirically that up-training improves these fast models to yield better WER results."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["The idea of efficiently processing a hypothesis set is similar to “lattice-parsing”, in which a parser consider an entire lattice at once (Hall, 2005; Cheppalier et al., 1999). These methods typically constrain the parsing space using heuristics, which are often model specific. In other words, they search in the joint space of word sequences present in the lattice and their syntactic analyses; they are not guaranteed to produce a syntactic analysis for all hypotheses. In contrast, substructure sharing is a general purpose method that we have applied to two different algorithms. The output is identical to processing each hypothesis separately and output is generated for each hypothesis. Hall (Hall, 2005) uses a lattice parsing strategy which aims to compute the marginal probabilities of all word sequences in the lattice by summing over syntactic analyses of each word sequence. The parser sums over multiple parses of a word sequence implicitly. The lattice parser therefore, is itself a language model. In contrast, our tools are completely separated from the ASR system, which allows the system to create whatever features are needed. This independence means our tools are useful for other tasks, such as machine translation. These differences make substructure sharing a more attractive option for efficient algorithms.","While Huang and Sagae (2010) use the notion of “equivalent states”, they do so for dynamic programming in a shift-reduce parser to broaden the search space. In contrast, we use the idea to identify sub-180 structures across inputs, where our goal is efficient parsing in general. Additionally, we extend the definition of equivalent states to general transition based structured prediction models, and demonstrate applications beyond parsing as well as the novel setting of hypothesis set parsing."]},{"title":"6 Experiments","paragraphs":["Our ASR system is based on the 2007 IBM Speech transcription system for the GALE Distilla-tion Go/No-go Evaluation (Chen et al., 2006) with state of the art discriminative acoustic models.

Furthermore, we achieve improved performance through up-training. The result is a large speedup in rescoring time, even on top of the already fast hill climbing framework, and reductions in WER from up-training. Our results make long-span syntactic LMs practical for real-time ASR, and can potentially impact machine translation decoding as well."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to Kenji Sagae for sharing his shift-reduce dependency parser and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments. 182"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["C.
