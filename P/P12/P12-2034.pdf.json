Most are based on dictionary-based word counting using LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2007) (e.g., Hancock et al. (2007), Vrij et al. (2007)), while some recent ones explored the use of machine learning techniques using simple lexico-syntactic patterns, such as n-grams and part-of-speech (POS) tags (Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009), Ott et al. (2011)). These previous studies unveil interesting correlations between certain lexical items or categories with deception that may not be readily apparent to human judges. For instance, the work of Ott et al. (2011) in the hotel review domain results in very insightful observations that deceptive reviewers tend to use verbs and personal pronouns (e.g., “I”, “my”) more often, while truthful reviewers tend to use more of nouns, adjectives, prepositions. In parallel to these shallow lexical patterns, might there be deep syntactic structures that are lurking in deceptive writing?","This paper investigates syntactic stylometry for deception detection, adding a somewhat unconventional angle to prior literature. Over four different datasets spanning from the product review domain to the essay domain, we find that features driven from Context Free Grammar (CFG) parse trees consistently improve the detection performance over several baselines that are based only on shallow lexico-syntactic features. Our results improve the best published result on the hotel review data of Ott et al. (2011) reaching 91.2% accuracy with 14% error reduction. We also achieve substantial improvement over the essay data of Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009), obtaining upto 85.0% accuracy."]},{"title":"2 Four Datasets","paragraphs":["To explore different types of deceptive writing, we consider the following four datasets spanning from the product review to the essay domain: I.

We collect 400 filtered reviews and 400 displayed reviews for 35 Italian restaurants with average ratings in the range of [3.5, 4.0]. Class labels are based on the meta data, which tells us whether each review is filtered by Yelp’s automated review filtering system or not. We expect that filtered reviews roughly correspond to deceptive reviews, and displayed reviews to truthful ones, but not with-out considerable noise.

Essays: Introduced in Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009), this corpus contains truthful and deceptive essays collected using Amazon Mechanic Turk for the following three topics: “Abortion” (100 essays per class), “Best Friend” (98 essays per class), and “Death Penalty” (98 essays per class)."]},{"title":"3 Feature Encoding Words","paragraphs":["Previous work has shown that bag-of-words are effective in detecting domain-specific deception (Ott et al., 2011; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009). We consider unigram, bigram, and the union of the two as features. Shallow Syntax As has been used in many previous studies in stylometry (e.g., Argamon-Engelson et al. (1998), Zhao and Zobel (2007)), we utilize part-of-speech (POS) tags to encode shallow syntactic information. Note that Ott et al. (2011) found that even though POS tags are effective in detecting fake product reviews, they are not as effective as words. Therefore, we strengthen POS features with unigram features. Deep syntax We experiment with four different encodings of production rules based on the Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) parse trees as follows:","• r: unlexicalized production rules (i.e., all production rules except for those with terminal nodes), e.g., NP2 → NP3 SBAR.","• r∗: lexicalized production rules (i.e., all production rules), e.g., PRP → “you”.","• r̂: unlexicalized production rules combined with the grandparent node, e.g., NP2 ̂VP 172","TripAdvisor Yelp Essay","Gold Heur Abort BstFr Death","unigram 88.4 74.4 59.9 70.0 77.0 67.4","words bigram 85.8 71.5 60.7 71.5 79.5 55.5 uni + bigram 89.6 73.8 60.1 72.0 81.5 65.5","pos(n=1) + unigram 87.4 74.0 62.0 70.0 80.0 66.5","shallow syntax pos(n=2) + unigram 88.6 74.6 59.0 67.0 82.0 66.5","+words pos(n=3) + unigram 88.6 74.6 59.3 67.0 82.0 66.5","r 78.5 65.3 56.9 62 67.5 55.5","deep syntax r̂ 74.8 65.3 56.5 58.5 65.5 56.0","r∗ 89.4 74.0 64.0 70.1 77.5 66.0","r̂∗ 90.4 75 63.5 71.0 78 67.5 r + unigram 89.0 74.3 62.3 76.5 82.0 69.0","deep syntax r̂ + unigram 88.5 74.3 62.5 77.0 81.5 70.5","+words r∗ + unigram 90.3 75.4 64.3 74.0 85.0 71.5 r̂∗ + unigram 91.2 76.6 62.1 76.0 84.5 71.0 Table 2: Deception Detection Accuracy (%). 1 → NP3 SBAR.","• r̂∗: lexicalized production rules (i.e., all production rules) combined with the grandparent node, e.g., PRPN̂P 4 → “you”."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["For all classification tasks, we use SVM classifier, 80% of data for training and 20% for testing, with 5-fold cross validation.2","All features are encoded as tf-idf values. We use Berkeley PCFG parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) to parse sentences. Table 2 presents the classification performance using various features across four different datasets introduced earlier.3 4.1 TripAdvisor–Gold We first discuss the results for the TripAdvisor– Gold dataset shown in Table 2. As reported in Ott et al. (2011), bag-of-words features achieve surprisingly high performance, reaching upto 89.6% accuracy. Deep syntactic features, encoded as r̂∗ slightly improves this performance, achieving 90.4% accuracy. When these syntactic features are combined with unigram features, we attain the best performance of 91.2% accuracy, 2 We use LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) with L2-","regulization, parameter optimized over the 80% training","data (3 folds for training, 1 fold for testing). 3 Numbers in italic are classification results reported","in Ott et al. (2011) and Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009). yielding 14% error reduction over the word-only features.","Given the power of word-based features, one might wonder, whether the PCFG driven features are being useful only due to their lexical production rules. To address such doubts, we include experiments with unlexicalized rules, r and r̂. These features achieve 78.5% and 74.8% accuracy respectively, which are significantly higher than that of a random baseline (∼50.0%), confirming statistical differences in deep syntactic structures. See Section 4.4 for concrete exemplary rules.","Another question one might have is whether the performance gain of PCFG features are mostly from local sequences of POS tags, indirectly encoded in the production rules. Comparing the performance of [shallow syntax+words] and [deep syntax+words] in Table 2, we find statistical evidence that deep syntax based features offer information that are not available in simple POS sequences. 4.2 TripAdvisor–Heuristic & Yelp The performance is generally lower than that of the previous dataset, due to the noisy nature of these datasets. Nevertheless, we find similar trends as those seen in the TripAdvisor–Gold dataset, with respect to the relative performance differences across different approaches.

In sum, these results indicate the existence of the statistical signals hidden in deep syntax even in real product reviews with noisy gold standards. 4.3 Essay Finally in Table 2, the last dataset Essay confirms the similar trends again, that the deep syntactic features consistently improve the performance over several baselines based only on shallow lexico-syntactic features. The final results, reaching accuracy as high as 85%, substantially outperform what has been previously reported in Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009). How robust are the syntactic cues in the cross topic setting? Table 4 compares the results of Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009) and ours, demonstrating that syntactic features achieve substantially and surprisingly more robust results. 4.4 Discriminative Production Rules To give more concrete insights, we provide 10 most discriminative unlexicalized production rules (augmented with the grand parent node) for each class in Table 1. We order the rules based on the feature weights assigned by LIBLINEAR classifier. Notice that the two production rules in bolds — [SBARN̂P → S] and [NP V̂P → NP SBAR] — are parts of the parse tree shown in Figure 1, whose sentence is taken from an actual fake review.

Interestingly, we find more frequent use of VP, SBAR (clause introduced by subordinating conjunction), and WHADVP in deceptive reviews than truthful reviews."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Much of the previous work for detecting deceptive product reviews focused on related, but slightly different problems, e.g., detecting duplicate reviews or review spams (e.g., Jindal and Liu (2008), Lim et al. (2010), Mukherjee et al. (2011), Jindal et al. (2010)) due to notable difficulty in obtaining gold standard labels.4","The Yelp data we explored in this work shares a similar spirit in that gold standard labels are harvested from existing meta data, which are not guaranteed to align well with true hidden labels as to deceptive v.s. truthful reviews. Two previous work obtained more precise gold standard labels by hiring Amazon turkers to write deceptive articles (e.g., Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009), Ott et al. (2011)), both of which have been examined in this study with respect to their syntactic characteristics. Although we are not aware of any prior work that dealt with syntactic cues in deceptive writing directly, prior work on hedge detection (e.g., Greene and Resnik (2009), Li et al. (2010)) relates to our findings."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We investigated syntactic stylometry for deception detection, adding a somewhat unconventional angle to previous studies.
