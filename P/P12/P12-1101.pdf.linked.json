At the same time, because n-gram language models only condition on a local window of linear word-level context, they are poor models of long-range syntactic dependencies. Although several lines of work have proposed generative syntactic language models that improve on n-gram models for moderate amounts of data (Chelba, 1997; Xu et al., 2002; Charniak, 2001; Hall, 2004; Roark, 2004), these models have only recently been scaled to the impressive amounts of data routinely used by n-gram language models (Tan et al., 2011).","In this paper, we describe a generative, syntactic language model that conditions on local context treelets1","in a parse tree, backing off to smaller treelets as necessary. Our model can be trained simply by collecting counts and using the same smoothing techniques normally applied to n-gram models (Kneser and Ney, 1995), enabling us to apply techniques developed for scaling n-gram models out of the box (Brants et al., 2007; Pauls and Klein, 2011). The simplicity of our training procedure allows us to train a model on a billion tokens of data in a matter of hours on a single machine, which compares favorably to the more involved training algorithm of Tan et al. (2011), who use a two-pass EM training algorithm that takes several days on several hundred CPUs using similar amounts of data.","The simplicity of our approach also contrasts with recent work on language modeling with tree substitution grammars (Post and Gildea, 2009), where larger treelet contexts are incorporated by using so-phisticated priors to learn a segmentation of parse trees. Such an approach implicitly assumes that a “correct” segmentation exists, but it is not clear that this is true in practice. Instead, we build upon the success of n-gram language models, which do not assume a segmentation and instead score all overlapping contexts.","We evaluate our model in terms of perplexity, and show that we achieve the same performance as a state-of-the-art n-gram model. We also evaluate our model on several grammaticality tasks proposed in 1 We borrow the term treelet from Quirk et al.

This type of smoothing is both highly robust and easy to implement, requiring only the collection of counts from data.","We would like to apply the same smoothing techniques to distributions over rule yields in a constituency tree, conditioned on contexts consisting of previously generated treelets (rules, nodes, etc.). Formally, let T be a constituency tree consisting of context-free rules of the form r = P → C1 · · · Cd, where P is the parent symbol of rule r and Cd","1 = C1 . . . Cd are its children. We wish to assign probabilities to trees2 2 A distribution over trees also induces a distribution over","sentences wl","1 given by p(wl","1) = P","T:s(T)=wl 1 p(T ), where p(T ) = ∏ r∈T","p(Cd 1 |h) where the conditioning context h is some portion of the already-generated parts of the tree. In this paper, we assume that the children of a rule are expanded from left to right, so that when generating the yield Cd 1 , all treelets above and left of the parent P are available. Note that a raw PCFG would condition only on P , i.e. h = P .","As in the n-gram case, we would like to pick h to be large enough to capture relevant dependencies, but small enough that we can obtain meaningful estimates from data. We start with a straightforward choice of context: we condition on P , as well as the rule r′","that generated P , as shown in in Figure 1(b).","Conditioning on the parent rule r′","allows us to capture several important dependencies. First, it captures both P and its parent P ′",", which predicts the distribution over child symbols far better than just P (Johnson, 1998). Second, it captures posi-tional effects. For example, subject and object noun phrases (NPs) have different distributions (Klein and Manning, 2003), and the position of an NP relative to a verb is a good indicator of this distinction. Finally, the generation of words at preterminals can condition on siblings, allowing the model to capture, for example, verb subcategorization frames.","We should be clear that we are not the first s(T ) is the terminal yield of T . 960 to use back-off-based smoothing for syntactic language modeling – such techniques have been applied to models that condition on head-word contexts (Charniak, 2001; Roark, 2004; Zhang, 2009). Parent rule context has also been employed in translation (Vaswani et al., 2011). However, to our knowledge, we are the first to apply these techniques for language modeling on large amounts of data. 2.1 Lexical context Although it is tempting to think that we can replace the left-to-right generation of n-gram models with the purely top-down generation of typical PCFGs, in practice, words are often highly predictive of the words that follow them – indeed, n-gram models would be terrible language models if this were not the case. To capture linear effects, we extend the context for terminal (lexical) productions to include the previous two words w−2 and w−1 in the sentence in addition to r′","; see Figure 1(c) for a depiction. This allows us to capture collocations and other lexical correlations. 2.2 Backing off","As with n-gram models, counts for rule yields con-","ditioned on r′","are sparse, and we must choose an ap-","propriate back-off strategy. We handle terminal and","non-terminal productions slightly differently. For non-terminal productions, we back off from","r′ to P and its parent P ′",", and then to just P .","That is, we back off from a rule-annotated gram-","mar p(Cd","1 |P, P ′",", r′",") to a parent-annotated gram-","mar (Johnson, 1998) p(Cd","1 |P, P ′","), then to a raw PCFG p(Cd","1 |P ). In order to generalize to unseen rule yields Cd","1 , we further back off from the basic PCFG probability p(Cd","1 |P ) to p(Ci|Ci−1","i−3 , P ), a 4-gram model over symbols C conditioned on P , interpolated with an unconditional 4-gram model p(Ci|Ci−1","i−3 ). In other words, we back off from a raw PCFG to λ d ∏ i=1","p(Ci|Ci−1 i−3 , P ) + (1 − λ) d ∏ i=1","p(Ci|Ci−1 i−3 ) where λ = 0.9 is an interpolation constant.","For terminal (i.e lexical) productions, we first remove lexical context, backing off from p(w|P, R, r′",", w−1, w−2) to p(w|P, R, r′",", w−1) and then p(w|P, R, r′","). From there, we back off to p(w|P, R) where R is the sibling immediately to the right of P , then to a raw PCFG p(w|P ), and finally to a unigram distribution. We chose this scheme because p(w|P, R) allows, for example, a verb to be generated conditioned on the non-terminal category of the argument it takes (since arguments usually immediately follow verbs). We depict these two back-off schemes pictorially in Figure 1(b) and (c). 2.3 Estimation Estimating the probabilities in our model can be done very simply using the same techniques (in fact, the same code) used to estimate n-gram language models. Our model requires estimates of four distributions: p(Cd","1 |P, P ′",", r′","), p(w|P, R, r′",", w−1, w−2), p(Ci|Ci−1","i−n+1, P ), and p(Ci|Ci−1","i−n+1). In each case, we require empirical counts of treelet tuples in the same way that we require counts of word tuples for estimating n-gram language models.","There is one additional hurdle in the estimation of our model: while there exist corpora with human-annotated constituency parses like the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), these corpora are quite small – on the order of millions of tokens – and we cannot gather nearly as many counts as we can for ngrams, for which billions or even trillions (Brants et al., 2007) of tokens are available on the Web. However, we can use one of several high-quality constituency parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Petrov et al., 2006) to automatically generate parses. These parses may contain errors, but not all parsing errors are problematic for our model, since we only care about the sentences generated by our model and not the parses themselves. We show in our experiments that the addition of data with automatic parses does improve the performance of our language models across a range of tasks."]},{"title":"3 Tree Transformations","paragraphs":["In the previous section, we described how to condition on rich parse context to better capture the distribution of English trees.

Note that we have not shown head tag annotations on preterminals because in that case, the head tag is the preterminal itself. number of transformations of Treebank constituency parses that allow us to capture such dependencies. We list the annotations and deletions in the order in which they are performed. A sample transformed tree is shown in Figure 2. Temporal NPs Following Klein and Manning (2003), we attempt to annotate temporal noun phrases. Although the Penn Treebank annotates temporal NPs, most off-the-shelf parsers do not retain these tags, and we do not assume their presence. Instead, we mark any noun that is the head of a NP-TMP constituent at least once in the Treebank as a temporal noun, so for example today would be tagged as NNT and months would be tagged as NNTS. Head Annotations We annotate every non-terminal or preterminal with its head word if the head is a closed-class word3","and with its head tag otherwise. Klein and Manning (2003) used head tag annotation extensively, though they applied their splits much more selectively. NP Flattening We delete NPs dominated by other NPs, unless the child NPs are in coordination or apposition. These NPs typically occur when nouns are modified by PPs, as in (NP (NP (NN stock) (NNS sales)) (PP (IN by) (NNS traders))). By removing the dominated NP, we allow the production NNS→sales to condition on the presence of a modifying PP (here a PP head-annotated with by). Number Annotations Numbers are divided into five classes: CD-YR for numbers that consist of four digits (which are usually years); CD-NM for entirely numeric numbers; CD-DC for numbers that have a decimal; CD-","3","We define the following to be closed class words: any punctuation; all inflections of the verbs do, be, and have; and any word tagged with IN, WDT, PDT, WP, WP$, TO, WRB, RP, DT, SYM, EX, POS, PRP, AUX, or CC. MX for numbers that mix letters and digits; and CD-AL for numbers that are entirely alphabetic. SBAR Flattening We remove any sentential (S) nodes immediately dominated by an SBAR. S nodes under SBAR have very distinct distributions from other sentential nodes, mostly due to empty subjects and/or objects. VP Flattening We remove any VPs immediately dominating a VP, unless it is conjoined with another VP. In the Treebank, chains of verbs (e.g. will be going) have a separate VP for each verb. By flattening such structures, we allow the main verb and its arguments to condition on the whole chain of verbs. This effect is particularly important for passive constructions. Gapped Sentence Annotation Collins (1999) and Klein and Manning (2003) annotate nodes which have empty subjects. Because we only assume the presence of automatically derived parses, which do not produce the empty elements in the original Treebank, we must identify such elements on our own. We use a very simple procedure: we annotate all S or SBAR nodes that have a VP before any NPs. Parent Annotation We annotate all VPs with their parent symbol. Because our treelet model already conditions on the parent, this has the effect of allowing verbs to condition on their grandparents. This was important for VPs under SBAR nodes, which often have empty objects. We also parent-annotated any child of the ROOT. Unary Deletion We remove all unary productions except the root and preterminal productions, keeping only the bottom-most symbol. Because we are not interested in the internal labels of the trees, unaries are largely a nuisance, and their removal brings many symbols into the context of others."]},{"title":"4 Scoring a Sentence","paragraphs":["Computing the probability of a sentence wl","1 under our model requires summing over all possible parses of wl","1.

For training data, we constructed a large treebank by concatenating the WSJ and Brown portions of the Penn Treebank, the 50K BLLIP training sentences from Post (2011), and the AFP and APW portions of English Gigaword version 3 (Graff, 2003), total-ing about 1.3 billion tokens. We used the human-annotated parses for the sentences in the Penn Treebank, but parsed the Gigaword and BLLIP sentences with the Berkeley Parser. Hereafter, we refer to this training data as our 1B corpus. We used Section 0 of the WSJ as our test corpus. Results are shown in Table 2.

Unlike Model 1, which generates each modifier head and symbol conditioned only on Ch, h, and P , we additionally condition on the previously generated modifier’s head and symbol and back off to Model 1. 963 Model Perplexity PCFG 1772 TREELET-TRANS 722 TREELET-RULE 329 TREELET 198† PCFG-LA 330** HEADLEX 299 5-GRAM 207† Table 2: Perplexity of several generative models on Section 0 of the WSJ.

PCFG-LA (marked with **) was only trained on the WSJ and Brown corpora because it does not scale to large amounts of data.","We used the Berkeley LM toolkit (Pauls and Klein, 2011), which implements Kneser-Ney smoothing, to estimate all back-off models for both n-gram and treelet models. To deal with unknown words, we use the following strategy: after the first 10000 sentences, whenever we see a new word in our training data, we replace it with a signature7 10% of the time.","Our model outperforms all other generative models, though the improvement over the n-gram model is not statistically significant. Note that because we use a k-best approximation for the sum over trees, all perplexities (except for PCFG-LA and 5-GRAM) are pessimistic bounds. 5.3 Classification of Pseudo-Negative Sentences We make use of three kinds of automatically generated pseudo-negative sentences previously proposed in the literature: Okanohara and Tsujii (2007) proposed generating pseudo-negative examples from a trigram language model; Foster et al. (2008) create “noisy” sentences by automatically inserting a single error into grammatical sentences with a script that randomly deletes, inserts, or misspells a word; and Och et al. (2004) and Cherry and Quirk (2008) both use the 1-best output of a machine translation system. Examples of these three types of pseudo-negative data are shown in Table 3. We evaluate our model’s ability to distinguish positive from pseudo-negative data, and compare against generative baselines and state-of-the-art discriminative methods.","7","We use signatures generated by the Berkeley Parser. These signatures capture surface features such as capitalization, presents of digits, and common suffixes. For example, the word vexing would be replaced with the signature UNK-ing. Noisy There was were many contributors. Trigram For years in dealer immediately . MT we must further steps . Table 3: Sample pseudo-negative sentences.","We would like to use our model to make grammaticality judgements, but as a generative model it can only provide us with probabilities. Simply thresholding generative probabilities, even with a separate threshold for each length, has been shown to be very ineffective for grammaticality judgements, both for n-gram and syntactic language models (Cherry and Quirk, 2008; Post, 2011). We used a simple measure for isolating the syntactic likelihood of a sentence: we take the log-probability under our model and subtract the log-probability under a unigram model, then normalize by the length of the sentence.8","This measure, which we call the syntactic log-odds ratio (SLR), is a crude way of “subtracting out” the semantic component of the generative probability, so that sentences that use rare words are not penalized for doing so. 5.3.1 Trigram Classification","To facilitate comparison with previous work, we used the same negative corpora as Post (2011) for trigram classification. They randomly selected 50K train, 3K development, and 3K positive test sentences from the BLLIP corpus, then trained a trigram model on 450K BLLIP sentences and generated 50K train, 3K development, and 3K negative sentences. We parsed the 50K positive training examples of Post (2011) with the Berkeley Parser and used the resulting treebank to train a treelet language model. We set an SLR threshold for each model on the 6K positive and negative development sentences.","Results are shown in Table 4. In addition to our generative baselines, we show results for the discriminative models reported in Cherry and Quirk (2008) and Post (2011). The former train a latent PCFG support vector machine for binary classification (LSVM). The latter report results for two binary classifiers: RERANK uses the reranking features of Charniak and Johnson (2005), and TSG uses","8","Och et al. (2004) also report using a parser probability nor-malized by the unigram probability (but not length), and did not find it effective.

The number reported for LSVM (marked with **) was evaluated on a different random split of the BLLIP corpus, and so is not directly comparable. indicator features extracted from a tree substitution grammar derivation of each sentence.","Our TREELET model performs nearly as well as the TSG method, and substantially outperforms the LSVM method, though the latter was not tested on the same random split. Interestingly, the TREELET-RULE baseline, which removes lexical context from our model, outperforms the full model. This is likely because the negative data is largely coherent at the trigram level (because it was generated from a trigram model), and the full model is much more sensitive to trigram coherence than the TREELET-RULE model. This also explains the poor performance of the 5-GRAM model.","We emphasize that the discriminative baselines are specifically trained to separate trigram text from natural English, while our model is trained on positive examples alone. Indeed, the methods in Post (2011) are simple binary classifiers, and it is not clear that these models would be properly calibrated for any other task, such as integration in a decoder.","One of the design goals of our system was that it be scalable.

In Table 4, we also show the performance of the generative models trained on our 1B corpus. All generative models improve, but TREELET-RULE remains the best, now outperforming the RERANK system, though of course it is likely that RERANK would improve if it could be scaled up to more training data. 5.3.2 “Noisy” Classification","We also evaluate the performance of our model on the task of distinguishing the noisy WSJ sentences of Foster et al. (2008) from their original versions. We use the noisy versions of Section 0 and 23 produced by their error-generating procedure. Because they only report classification results on Section 0, we used Section 23 to tune an SLR threshold, and tested our model on Section 0. We show the results of both independent and pairwise classification for the WSJ and 1B training sets in Table 5. Note that independent classification is much more difficult than for the trigram data, because sentences contain at most one change, which may not even result in an ungrammaticality. Again, our model outperforms the n-gram model for both types of classification, and achieves the same performance as the discriminative system of Foster et al. (2008), which is state-of-the-art for this data set. The TREELET-RULE system again slightly outperforms the full TREELET model at independent classification, though not at pairwise classification. This probably reflects the fact that semantic coherence can still influence the SLR score, despite our efforts to subtract it out. Because the TREELET model in-cludes lexical context, it is more sensitive to seman-965","French German Chinese 5-GRAM 44.8 37.8 60.0 TREELET 57.9 66.0 83.8 Table 6: Pairwise comparison accuracy of MT output against a reference translation for French, German, and Chinese. The BLEU scores for these outputs are 32.7, 27.8, and 20.8. This task becomes easier, at least for our TREELET model, as translation quality drops. Cherry and Quirk (2008) report an accuracy of 71.9% on a similar experiment with German a source language, though the translation system and training data were different so the numbers are not comparable. In particular, their translations had a lower BLEU score, making their task easier. tic coherence and thus more likely to misclassify semantically coherent but ungrammatical sentences. For pairwise comparisons, where semantic coherence is effectively held constant, such sentences are not problematic. 5.3.3 Machine Translation Classification","We follow Och et al. (2004) and Cherry and Quirk (2008) in evaluating our language models on their ability to distinguish the 1-best output of a machine translation system from a reference translation in a pairwise fashion. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the data used in those papers, so a direct comparison is not possible. Instead, we collected the English output of Moses (Hoang et al., 2007), using both French and German as source language, trained on the Europarl corpus used by WMT 2009.10","We also collected the output of Joshua (Li et al., 2009) trained on 500K sentences of GALE Chinese-English parallel newswire. We trained both our TREELET model and a 5-GRAM model on the union of our 1B corpus and the English sides of our parallel corpora.","In Table 6, we show the pairwise comparison accuracy (using SLR) on these three corpora. We see that our system prefers the reference much more often than the 5-GRAM language model.11","However, we also note that the easiness of the task is correlated with the quality of translations (as measured in BLEU score). This is not surprising – high-quality translations are often grammatical and even a per-10 http://www.statmt.org/wmt09 11 We note that the n-gram language model used by the MT","system was much smaller than the 5-GRAM model, as they were","only trained on the English sides of their parallel data. fect language model might not be able to differentiate such translations from their references. 5.4 Machine Translation Fluency We also carried out reranking experiments on 1000-best lists from Moses using our syntactic language model as a feature. We did not find that the use of our syntactic language model made any statistically significant increases in BLEU score. However, we noticed in general that the translations favored by our model were more fluent, a useful improvement to which BLEU is often insensitive. To confirm this, we carried out an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment where users from the United States were asked to compare translations using our TREELET language model as the language model feature to those using the 5-GRAM model.12","We had 1000 such translation pairs rated by 4 separate Turkers each. Although these two hypothesis sets had the same BLEU score (up to statistical significance), the Turkers preferred the output obtained using our syntactic language model 59% of the time, indicat-ing that our model had managed to pick out more fluent hypotheses that nonetheless were of the same BLEU score. This result was statistically significant with p < 0.001 using bootstrap resampling."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a simple syntactic language model that can be estimated using standard n-gram smoothing techniques on large amounts of data.

For each language model, we took k-best lists from the baseline system and replaced the baseline LM score with the new model’s score. We then retrained all feature weights with MERT on the tune set, and selected the 1-best output on the test set. 966"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Thorsten Brants, Ashok C.
