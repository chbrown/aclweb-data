We seek an algorithm that infers a set of real-world entities from mentions in a text, mapping each entity mention token to an entity, and discovers general categories of words used in names (e.g., titles and last names). Here, we use a probabilistic model to infer a structured representation of canonical forms of entity attributes through transductive learning from named entity mentions with a small number of seeds (see Table 1). The input is a collection of mentions found by a named entity recognizer, along with their contexts, and, following Eisenstein et al. (2011), the output is a table in which entities are rows (the number of which is not pre-specified) and attribute words are organized into columns.","This paper contributes a model that builds on the approach of Eisenstein et al. (2011), but also: • incorporates context of the mention to help with","disambiguation and to allow mentions that do not","share words to be merged liberally; • conditions against shape features, which improve","the assignment of words to columns; • is designed to explicitly handle some noise; and • is learned using elements of Bayesian inference","with conditional estimation (see §2).","We experiment with variations of our model, comparing it to a baseline clustering method and the model of Eisenstein et al. (2011), on two datasets, demonstrating improved performance over both at recovering a gold standard table. In a political blogs dataset, the mentions refer to political figures in the United States (e.g., Mrs. Obama and Michelle Obama). As a result, the model discovers parts of names—⟨Mrs., Michelle, Obama⟩— while simultaneously performing coreference resolution for named entity mentions. In the sports news dataset, the model is provided with named entity mentions of heterogenous types, and success here consists of identifying the correct team for every player (e.g., Kobe Bryant and Los Angeles Lakers). In this scenario, given a few seed examples, the model begins to identify simple relations among named entities (in addition to discovering attribute structures), since attributes are expressed as named entities across multiple mentions. We believe this adaptability is important, as the salience of different kinds of names and their usages vary considerably across domains. Bill Clinton Mr. George Bush Mr. W. Barack Obama Sen.

In our experiments these are obtained by running a named entity recognizer. The output is a table in which rows are understood to correspond to entities (types, not mention tokens) and columns are fields, each associated with an attribute or a part of it. Our approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model that generates the mentions, which are observed, and the table, which is mostly unobserved, similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011). Our learning procedure is a hybrid of Bayesian inference and conditional estimation. The generative story, depicted in Figure 1, is: • For each column j ∈ {1, . . . , C}:","◦ Draw a multinomial distribution φj over the vocabulary from a Dirichlet process: φj ∼ DP(αj, G0).

Fixing λ, μ, and α is essentially just “being Bayesian,” or fixing a hyperparameter based on prior beliefs. Fixing f is quite different; it is conditioning our model on some observable features of the data, in this case word shape features. We do this to avoid integrating over feature vector values. These choices highlight that the design of a probabilistic model can draw from both Bayesian and discriminative tools. Observing some of x as seeds (x̃) renders this approach transductive.","Exact inference in this model is intractable, so we resort to an approximate inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. The optimization of β can be described as “contrastive” estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), in which some as-pects of the data are conditioned against for computational convenience. The optimization of τ can be described as “empirical Bayesian” estimation (Morris, 1983) in which the parameters of a prior are fit to data. Our overall learning procedure is a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990)."]},{"title":"3 Learning and Inference","paragraphs":["Our learning procedure is an iterative algorithm consisting of two steps. In the E-step, we perform collapsed Gibbs sampling to obtain distributions over row and column indices for every mention, given the current value of the hyperparamaters. In the M-step, we obtain estimates for the hyperparameters, given the current posterior distributions. 3.1 E-step For the mth mention, we sample row index r, then for each word wml, we sample column index c. 3.1.1 Sampling Rows","Similar to Eisenstein et al. (2011), when we sample the row for a mention, we use Bayes’ rule and marginalize the columns. We further incorporate context information and a notion of noise. p(rm = r | . . .) ∝ p(rm = r | r−m, η) (∏ l","∑ c p(wml | x, rm = r, cml = c)) (∏ t p(smt | rm = r)) We consider each quantity in turn. Prior. The probability of drawing a row index follows a stick breaking distribution. This allows us to have an unbounded number of rows and let the model infer the optimal value from data. A standard marginalization of η gives us: p(rm = r | r−m, τ ) = { N−m r N+τ if N −m","r > 0 τ N+τ otherwise, where N is the number of mentions, Nr is the number of mentions assigned to row r, and N −m","r is the number of mentions assigned to row r, excluding m. Mention likelihood. In order to compute the likelihood of observing mentions in the dataset, we have to consider a few cases. If a cell in a table has already generated a word, it can only generate that word. This hard constraint was a key factor in the inference algorithm of Eisenstein et al. (2011); we speculate that softening it may reduce MCMC mix-ing time, so introduce a notion of noise. With probability ε = 10−10",", the cell can generate any word. If a cell has not generated any word, its probability still depends on other elements of the table. With base distribution G0,1","and marginalizing φ, we have:","p(wml | x, rm = r, cml = c, αc) = (1)    1 − ε if xrc = wml ε if xrc ̸∈ {wml, ∅} N−ml cw","N−ml c +αc if xrc = ∅ and Ncw > 0","G0(wml) αc","N−ml","c +αc if xrc = ∅ and Ncw = 0 where N −ml","c is the number of cells in column c that are not empty and N −ml","cw is the number of cells in column c that are set to the word wml; both counts excluding the current word under consideration. Context likelihood. It is important to be able to use context information to determine which row a mention should go into. As a novel extension, our model also uses surrounding words of a mention as its “context”—similar context words can encourage two mentions that do not share any words to be merged. We choose a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for our context distribution. For every row in the table, we have a multinomial distribution over context vocabulary θr from a Dirichlet prior λ.","1","We let G0 be a uniform distribution over the vocabulary. 687 Therefore, the probability of observing the tth context word for mention m is p(smt | rm = r, λ) = { N−mt rs +λs−1","N−mt r +P","v λv−V","if N −mt r > 0 λs−1P v λv−V otherwise, where N −mt","r is the number of context words of mentions assigned to row r, N −mt","rs is the number of context words of mentions assigned to row r that are smt, both excluding the current context word, and v ranges over the context vocabulary of size V . 3.1.2 Sampling Columns","Our column sampling procedure is novel to this work and substantially differs from that of Eisenstein et al. (2011). First, we note that when we sample column indices for each word in a mention, the row index for the mention r has already been sampled. Also, our model has interdependencies among column indices of a mention.2","Standard Gibbs sampling procedure breaks down these dependencies. For faster mixing, we experiment with first-order dependencies between columns when sampling column indices. This idea was suggested by Eisenstein et al. (2011, footnote 1) as a way to learn structure in name conventions. We suppressed this aspect of the model in Figure 1 for clarity.","We sample the column index c1 for the first word in the mention, marginalizing out probabilities of other words in the mention. After we sample the column index for the first word, we sample the column index c2 for the second word, fixing the previous word to be in column c1, and marginalizing out probabilities of c3, . . . , cL as before. We repeat the above procedure until we reach the last word in the mention. In practice, this can be done efficiently using backward probabilities computed via dynamic programming. This kind of blocked Gibbs sampling was proposed by Jensen et al. (1995) and used in NLP by Mochihashi et al. (2009). We have: p(cml = c | . . .) ∝ p(cml = c | f ml, β)p(cml = c | cml− = c−) (∑","c+ pb(cml = c | cml+ = c+) ) p(wml | x, rm = r, cml = c, αc), 2 As shown in Figure 1, column indices in a mention form","“v-structures” with the row index r. Since every wl is observed,","there is an active path that goes through all these nodes. where l− is the preceding word and c− is its sampled index, l+ is the following word and c+ is its possible index, and pb(·) are backward probabilities. Alternatively, we can perform standard Gibbs sampling and drop the dependencies between columns, which makes the model rely more heavily on the features. For completeness, we detail the computations. Featurized log linear distribution. Our model can use arbitrary features to choose a column index. These features are incorporated as a log-linear distribution, p(cml = c | f ml, β) = exp(β⊤","c fml)","P c′ exp(β⊤","c′fml) . The list of features used in our experiments is: 1{w is the first word in the mention}; 1{w ends with a period}; 1{w is the last word in the mention}; 1{w is a Roman numeral}; 1{w starts with an upper-case letter}; 1{w is an Arabic number}; 1{w ∈ {mr, mrs, ms, miss, dr, mdm} }; 1{w contains ≥ 1 punctuation symbol}; 1{w ∈ {jr, sr}}; 1{w ∈ {is, in, of, for}}; 1{w is a person entity}; 1{w is an organization entity}. Forward and backward probabilities. Since we introduce first-order dependencies between columns, we have forward and backward probabilities, as in HMMs. However, we always sample from left to right, so we do not need to marginalize ran-dom variables to the left of the current variable because their values are already sampled. Our transition probabilities are as follows: p(cml = c | cml− = c−) = N−m c −,c P","c′ − N−m c′","−,c , where N −m","c−,c is the number of times we observe transitions from column c− to c, excluding mention m. The forward and backward equations are simple (we omit them for space). Mention likelihood. Mention likelihood p(wml | x, rm = r, cml = c, αc) is identical to when we sample the row index (Eq. 1). 3.2 M-step In the M-step, we use gradient-based optimization routines, L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) and OWL-QN (Andrew and Gao, 2007) respectively, to maximize with respect to τ and β. 688 3.3 Implementation Details We ran Gibbs sampling for 500 iterations,3","discard-ing the first 200 for burn-in and averaging counts over every 10th sample to reduce autocorrelation.","For each word in a mention w, we introduced 12 binary features f for our featurized log-linear distribution (§3.1.2).","We then downcased all words in mentions for the purpose of defining the table and the mention words w. Ten context words (5 each to the left and right) define s for each mention token.","For non-convex optimization problems like ours, initialization is important. To guide the model to reach a good local optimum without many restarts, we manually initialized feature weights and put a prior on transition probabilities to reflect phenomena observed in the initial seeds. The initializer was constructed once and not tuned across experiments.4 The M-step was performed every 50 Gibbs sampling iterations. After inference, we filled each cell with the word that occurred at least 80% of the time in the averaged counts for the cell, if such a word existed."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We compare several variations of our model to Eisenstein et al. (2011) (the authors provided their implementation to us) and a clustering baseline. 4.1 Datasets We collected named entity mentions from two corpora: political blogs and sports news.

Association, National Football League, and Major League Baseball) in 2009. Due to the large size of the corpora, we uniformly sampled a subset of documents for each corpus and ran the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005), which tagged named entities mentions as person, location, and organization. We used named entity of type person from the political blogs corpus, while we are interested in person and organization entities for the sports news corpus. Mentions that appear less than five times are discarded. Table 2 summarizes statistics for both datasets of named entity mentions. Reference tables. We use Eisenstein et al.’s manually built 125-entity (282 vocabulary items) reference table for the politics dataset. Each entity in the table is represented by the set of all tokens that apppear in its references, and the tokens are placed in its correct column. For the sports data, we obtained a roster of all NBA, NFL, and MLB players in 2009. We built our sports reference table using the players’ names, teams and locations, to get 3,642 players and 15,932 vocabulary items. The gold standard table for the politics dataset is incomplete, whereas it is complete for the sports dataset. Seeds. Table 1 shows the seeds for both datasets. 4.2 Evaluation Scores We propose both a row evaluation to determine how well a model disambiguates entities and merges mentions of the same entity and a column evaluation to measure how well the model relates words used in different mentions. Both scores are new for this task.","The first step in evaluation is to find a maximum score bipartite matching between rows in the response and reference table.5","Given the response and","5","Treating each row as a set of words, we can optimize the matching using the Jonker and Volgenant (1987) algorithm. The column evaluation is identical, except that sets of words that are matched are defined by columns. We use the Jaccard similarity—for two sets A and B, |A∩B|","|A∪B| —for our similarity function, Sim(i, j). 689 reference tables, xres and xref , we can compute:","Sres = 1 |xres|","∑ i∈xres,j∈xref :Match(i,j)=1 Sim(i, j)","Sref = 1 |xref |","∑ i∈xres,j∈xref :Match(i,j)=1 Sim(i, j) where i and j denote rows, Match(i, j) is one if i and j are matched to each other in the optimal matching or zero otherwise. Sres is a precision-like score, and Sref is a recall-like score.6","Column evaluation is the same, but compares columns instead. 4.3 Baselines Our simple baseline is an agglomerative clustering algorithm that clusters mentions into entities using the single-linkage criterion. Initially, each unique mention forms its own cluster that we incrementally merge together to form rows in the table. This method requires a similarity score between two clusters. For the politics dataset, we follow Eisenstein et al. (2011) and use the string edit distance between mention strings in each cluster to define the score. For the sports dataset, since mentions contain person and organization named entity types, our score for clustering uses the Jaccard distance between context words of the mentions. However, such cluster-ings do not produce columns. Therefore, we first match words in mentions of type person against a regular expression to recognize entity attributes from a fixed set of titles and suffixes, and the first, middle and last names. We treat words in mentions of type organization as a single attribute.7","As we merge clusters together, we arrange words such that","6","Eisenstein et al. (2011) used precision and recall for their similarity function. Precision prefers a more compact response row (or column), which unfairly penalizes situations like those of our sports dataset, where rows are heterogeneous (e.g., in-cluding people and organizations). Consider a response table made up of two rows: ⟨Kobe, Bryant⟩ and ⟨Los, Angeles, Lakers⟩, and a reference table containing all NBA players and their team names, e.g., ⟨Kobe, Bryant, Los, Angeles, Lakers⟩. Evaluating with the precision similarity function, we will have perfect precision by matching the first row to the reference row for Kobe Bryant and the latter row to any Lakers player. The system is not rewarded for merging the two rows together, even if they are describing the same entity. Our evaluation scores, however, reward the system for accurately filling in more cells.","7","Note that the baseline system uses NER tags, list of titles and suffixes; which are also provided to our model through the features in §3.1.2. all words within a column belong to the same attribute, creating columns as necessary to accomodate multiple similar attributes as a result of merging. We can evaluate the tables produced by each step of the clustering to obtain the entire sequence of response-reference scores.","As a strong baseline, we also compare our approach with the original implementation of the model of Eisenstein et al. (2011), denoted by EEA. 4.4 Results For both the politics and sports dataset, we run the procedure in §3.3 three times and report the results. Politics. The results for the politics dataset are shown in Figure 2. Our model consistently outperformed both baselines. We also analyze how much each of our four main extensions (shape features, context information, noise, and first-order column dependencies) to EEA contributes to overall performance by ablating each in turn (also shown in Fig. 2). The best-performing complete model has 415 rows, of which 113 were matched to the reference table. Shape features are useful: remov-ing them was detrimental, and they work even better without column dependencies. Indeed, the best model did not have column dependencies. Remov-ing context features had a strong negative effect, though perhaps this could be overcome with a more carefully tuned initializer.","In row evaluation, the baseline system can achieve a high reference score by creating one entity row per unique string, but as it merges strings, the clusters encompass more word tokens, improving response score at the expense of reference score. With fewer clusters, there are fewer entities in the response table for matching and the response score suffers. Al-though we use the same seed table in both experiments, the results from EEA are below the baseline curve because it has the additional complexity of inferring the number of columns from data. Our model is simpler in this regard since it assumes that the number of columns is known (C = 6). In column evaluation, our method without column dependencies was best. Sports.

Similar to the previous dataset, our model is also substantially better in column evaluation, indicating that it mapped mention words into a coherent set of five columns. 4.5 Discussion The two datasets illustrate that our model adapts to somewhat different tasks, depending on its input. Furthermore, fixing C (unlike EEA) does appear to have benefits.","In the politics dataset, most of the mentions contain information about people. Therefore, besides canonicalizing named entities, the model also resolves within-document and cross-document coreference, since it assigned a row index for every mention. For example, our model learned that most mentions of John McCain, Sen. John McCain, Sen. McCain, and Mr. McCain refer to the same entity. Table 3 shows a few noteworthy entities from our complete model’s output table. Barack Obama Mr. Sen. Hussein Michelle Obama Mrs. Norm Coleman Sen. Sarah Palin Ms. John McCain Mr. Sen. Hussein Table 3: A small segment of the output table for the politics dataset, showing a few noteworthy correct (blue) and incorrect (red) examples. Black indicates seeds. Though Ms. is technically correct, there is variation in preferences and conventions. Our data include eight instances of Ms. Palin and none of Mrs. Palin or Mrs. Sarah Palin.","The first entity is an easy example since it only had to complete information provided in the seed table. The model found the correct gender-specific title for Barack Obama, Mr.. The rest of the examples were fully inferred from the data. The model was essentially correct for the second, third, and fourth entities. The last row illustrates a partially erroneous example, in which the model confused the middle name of John McCain, possibly because of a combination of a strong prior to reuse this row and the 691 Derek Jeter New York Ben Roethlisberger Pittsburgh Steelers Alex Rodriguez New York Yankees Michael Vick Philadelphia Eagles Kevin Garnett Los Angeles Lakers Dave Toub The Bears Table 4: A small segment of the output table for the sports dataset, showing a few noteworthy correct (blue) and incorrect (red) examples. Black indicates seed examples. introduction of a notion of noise.","In the sports dataset, persons and organizations are mentioned. Recall that success here consists of identifying the correct team for every player. The EEA model is not designed for this and performed poorly. Our model can do better, since it makes use of context information and features, and it can put a person and an organization in one row even though they do not share common words. Table 4 shows a few noteworthy entities from our complete model’s output.","Surprisingly, the model failed to infer that Derek Jeter plays for New York Yankees, although mentions of the organization New York Yankees can be found in our dataset. This is because the model did not see enough evidence to put them in the same row. However, it successfully inferred the missing information for Ben Roethlisberger. The next two rows show cases where our model successfully matched players with their teams and put each word token to its respective column. The most frequent error, by far, is illustrated in the fifth row, where a player is matched with a wrong team. Kevin Garnett plays for the Boston Celtics, not the Los Angeles Lakers. It shows that in some cases context information is not adequate, and a possible improvement might be obtained by providing more context to the model. The sixth row is interesting because Dave Toub is indeed affiliated with the Chicago Bears. However, when the model saw a mention token The Bears, it did not have any other columns to put the word token The, and decided to put it in the fourth column although it is not a location. If we added more columns, determiners could become another attribute of the entities that might go into one of these new columns."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been work that attempts to fill predefined templates using Bayesian nonparametrics (Haghighi and Klein, 2010) and automatically learns template structures using agglomerative clustering (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011).
