Specifically, we develop three infinite tree models, each of which enforces different independence as-sumptions, and for each model we define a simple direct assignment sampling inference procedure. We demonstrate the utility of our models by doing unsupervised learning of part-of-speech tags from treebank dependency skeleton structure, achieving an accuracy of 75.34%, and by doing unsupervised splitting of part-of-speech tags, which in-creases the accuracy of a generative dependency parser from 85.11% to 87.35%."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Model-based unsupervised learning techniques have historically lacked good methods for choosing the number of unseen components. For example, k-means or EM clustering require advance specifica-tion of the number of mixture components. But the introduction of nonparametric priors such as the Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) enabled develop-ment of infinite mixture models, in which the number of hidden components is not fixed, but emerges naturally from the training data (Antoniak, 1974).","Teh et al. (2006) proposed the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) as a way of applying the Dirichlet process (DP) to more complex model forms, so as to allow multiple, group-specific, infinite mixture models to share their mixture components. The closely related infinite hidden Markov model is an HMM in which the transitions are modeled using an HDP, enabling unsupervised learning of sequence models when the number of hidden states is unknown (Beal et al., 2002; Teh et al., 2006).","We extend this work by introducing the infinite tree model, which represents recursive branching structure over a potentially infinite set of hidden states. Such models are appropriate for the syntactic dependency structure of natural language. The hidden states represent word categories (“tags”), the observations they generate represent the words themselves, and the tree structure represents syntactic dependencies between pairs of tags.","To validate the model, we test unsupervised learning of tags conditioned on a given dependency tree structure. This is useful, because coarse-grained syntactic categories, such as those used in the Penn Treebank (PTB), make insufficient distinctions to be the basis of accurate syntactic parsing (Charniak, 1996). Hence, state-of-the-art parsers either supple-ment the part-of-speech (POS) tags with the lexical forms themselves (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000), manually split the tagset into a finer-grained one (Klein and Manning, 2003a), or learn finer grained tag distinctions using a heuristic learning procedure (Petrov et al., 2006). We demonstrate that the tags learned with our model are correlated with the PTB POS tags, and furthermore that they improve the accuracy of an automatic parser when used in training."]},{"title":"2 Finite Trees","paragraphs":["We begin by presenting three finite tree models, each with different independence assumptions.","272 C ρ πk H φk z1 z2 z3 x1 x2 x3 Figure 1: A graphical representation of the finite Bayesian tree model with independent children.

A word is then drawn from this topic and emitted by the document. 3.2 The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Let’s generalize our previous example to a corpus of documents. As before, we have a set of shared topics, but now each document has its own characteristic distribution over these topics. We represent topic distributions both locally (for each document) and globally (across all documents) by use of a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), which has a local DP for each document, in which the base measure is itself a draw from another, global, DP.","The complete HDP model is represented graphically in Figure 3(b). Like the DP, it has global broken stick β = (βk)∞","k=1 and topic specific word distribution parameters φ = (φk)∞","k=1, which are coindexed. It differs from the DP in that it also has local broken sticks πj for each group j (in our case documents). While the global stick β ∼ GEM(γ) is generated as before, the local sticks πj are distributed according to a DP with base measure β: πj ∼ DP(α0, β).","We illustrate this generation process in Figure 4. The upper unit line represents β, where the size of segment k represents the value of element βk, and the lower unit line represents πj ∼ DP(α0, β) for a particular group j. Each element of the lower stick was sampled from a particular element of the upper stick, and elements of the upper stick may be sampled multiple times or not at all; on average, larger elements will be sampled more often. Each element βk, as well as all elements of πj that were sampled from it, corresponds to a particular φk. Critically, several distinct πj can be sampled from the same βk and hence share φk; this is how components are shared among groups.","For concreteness, we show how to generate a corpus of documents from the HDP, generating one document at a time, and incrementally construct-ing our infinite objects. Initially we have βu = 1, φ = (), and πju = 1 for all j. We start with the first position of the first document and draw a local topic y11 ∼ π1, which will return u with probability 1. Because y11 = u we must make a draw from the base measure, β, which, because this is the first document, will also return u with probability 1. We must now break βu into β1 and βnew","u , and break π1u into π11 and πnew","1u in the same manner presented for the DP. Since π11 now corresponds to global topic 1, we sample the word x11 ∼ Multinomial(φ1). To sample each subsequent word i, we first sample the local topic y1i ∼ π1. If y1i ̸= u, and π1y1i corresponds to βk in the global stick, then we sample the word x1i ∼ Multinomial(φk). Once the first document has been sampled, subsequent documents are sampled in a similar manner; initially πju = 1 for document j, while β continues to grow as more documents are sampled."]},{"title":"4 Infinite Trees","paragraphs":["We now use the techniques from Section 3 to create infinite versions of each tree model from Section 2. 4.1 Independent Children The changes required to make the Bayesian independent children model infinite don’t affect its basic structure, as can be witnessed by comparing the graphical depiction of the infinite model in Figure 5 with that of the finite model in Figure 1.

Our solution is to construct a distribution Lk over lists of states from the distribution over individual states πk. The obvious approach is to sample the states at each position i.i.d.:","P((zt′ )t′","∈c(t)|π) = ∏ t′ ∈c(t) P(zt′ |π) = ∏","t′","∈c(t) πzt′ However, we want our model to be able to represent the fact that some child lists, ct, are more or less probable than the product of the individual child probabilities would indicate. To address this, we can sample a state-conditional distribution over child lists λk from a DP with Lk as a base measure.","6","The original iHMM paper (Beal et al., 2002) predates, and was the motivation for, the work presented in Teh et al. (2006), and is the origin of the term hierarchical Dirichlet process. However, they used the term to mean something slightly different than the HDP presented in Teh et al. (2006), and presented a sampling scheme for inference that was a heuristic approxima-tion of a Gibbs sampler. Thus, we augment the basic model given in the previous section with the variables ζ, Lk, and λk:","Lk|πk ∼ Deterministic, as described above","λk|ζ, Lk ∼ DP(ζ, Lk)","ct|λk ∼ λk An important consequence of defining Lk locally (instead of globally, using β instead of the πks) is that the model captures not only what sequences of children a state prefers, but also the individual children that state prefers; if a state gives high probability to some particular sequence of children, then it is likely to also give high probability to other sequences containing those same states, or a subset thereof. 4.3 Markov Children In the Markov children model, more copies of the variable π are needed, because each child state must be conditioned both on the parent state and on the state of the preceding child. We use a new set of variables πki, where π is determined by the parent state k and the state of the preceding sibling i.

Recall from Figure 4 that each state k has a local stick πk, each element of which corresponds to an element of β. In our sampling procedure, we only keep elements of πk and β which correspond to states observed in the data. We define the variable mjk to be the number of elements of the finite observed portion of πk which correspond to βj and njk to be the number of observations with state k whose parent’s state is j.","We also need a few model-specific counts.

To be clear, the input to our algorithm is the dependency structure skeleton of the corpus, but not the POS tags, and the output is a labeling of each of the words in the tree for word class. Since the model knows nothing about the POS annotation, the new classes have arbitrary integer names, and are not guaranteed to correlate with the POS tag definitions.

For all reported experiments, we set α0 = β = 10 and varied ρ.","We use several metrics to evaluate the word classes. First, we use the standard approach of greedily assigning each of the learned classes to the POS tag with which it has the greatest overlap, and then computing tagging accuracy (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006).8","Additionally, we compute the mutual information of the learned clusters with the gold tags, and we compute the cluster F-score (Ghosh, 2003).

We initialize the set of hidden states to the set of PTB tags, and then, during inference, constrain the sampling distribution over hidden state zt at each node t to include only states that are a refinement of the annotated PTB tag at that position. The output of this training procedure is a new annotation of the words in the PTB with the learned tags. We then compare the performance of a generative dependency parser trained on the new refined tags with one trained on the base PTB tag set.
