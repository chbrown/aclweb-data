They are compiled in nite-state machines. In this paper, we address the question of merging grammars using different partitionings into a single nite-state machine. A morphological description may then be obtained by parallel or sequential application of constraints expressed on different partition notions (e.g. morpheme, phoneme, grapheme). The theory of Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages, a well known semantics of parallel systems, provides a way of representing and compil-ing such a description."]},{"title":"1 Partition-Based Morphology","paragraphs":["Finite-State Morphology is based on the idea that regular relations are an appropriate formalism to describe the morphology of a natural language. Such a relation is a set of pairs, the rst component being an actual form called surface form, the second component being an abstract description of this form called lexical form. It is usually implemented by a nite-state transducer. Relations are not oriented, so the same transducer may be used both for analysis and generation. They may be non-deterministic, when the same form belongs to several pairs. Further-more, nite state machines have interesting properties, they are composable and efcient.","There are two main trends in Finite-State Morphology: rewrite-rule systems and two-level rule systems. Rewrite-rule systems describe the morphology of languages using contextual rewrite rules which are easily applied in cascade. Rules are compiled into nite-state transducers and merged using transducer composition (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).","The other important trend of Finite-State Morphology is Two-Level Morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983). In this approach, not only pairs of lexical and surface strings are related, but there is a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols. It means that the two strings of a given pair must have the same length. Whenever a symbol of one side does not have an actual counterpart in the other string, a special symbol 0 is inserted at the relevant position in order to fulll the same-length constraint. For example, the correspondence between the surface form spies and the morpheme concatenation spy+s is given as follows: s p y 0 + s s p i e 0 s Same-length relations are closed under intersection, so two-level grammars describe a system as the simultaneous application of local constraints.","A third approach, Partition-Based Morphology, consists in splitting the strings of a pair into the same number of substrings. The same-length constraint does not hold on symbols but on substrings. For example, spies and spy+s may be partitioned as follows: s p y + s s p ie ε s","The partition-based approach was rst proposed by (Black et al., 1987) and further improved by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993) and (Grimley-Evans et al.,","928 1996). It has been used to describe the morphology of Syriac (Kiraz, 2000), Akkadian (Barth·elemy, 2006) and Arabic Dialects (Habash et al., 2005). These works use multi-tape transducers instead of usual two tape transducers, describing a special case of n-ary relations instead of binary relations. Denition 1 Partitioned n-relation A partitioned n-relation is a set of nite sequences of string n-tuples. For instance, the n-tuple sequence of the example (spy, spies) given above is (s, s)(p, p)(y, ie)(+, ε)(s, s). Of course, all the partitioned n-relations are not recognizable using a nite-state machine. Grimley-Evans and al. propose a partition-based formalism with a strong restriction: the string n-tuples used in the sequences belong to a nite set of such n-tuples (the centers of context-restriction rules). They describe an algorithm which compiles a set of contextual rules describing a partitioned n-relation into an epsilon-free letter transducer. (Barth·elemy, 2005) proposed a more powerful framework, where the relations are dened by concatenating tuples of independent regular expressions and operations on partitioned n-relations such as intersection and complementation are considered.","In this paper, we propose to use Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages instead of partitioned relation as the semantics of partition-based morphological formalisms. The benets are twofold: rstly, there is an extension of the formal power which allows the combination of morphological description using different partitionings of forms. Secondly, the compilation of such languages into nite-state machines has been exhaustively studied. Their closure properties provide operations useful for morphological purposes.","They include the concatenation (for instance for compound words), the intersection used to merge local constraints, the union (modular lexicon), the composition (cascading descriptions, form recognition and generation), the projection (to extract one level of the relation), the complementation and set difference, used to compile contextual rules following the algorithms in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), (Grimley-Evans et al., 1996) and (Yli-Jyr¤a and Koskenniemi, 2004).","The use of the new semantics does not imply any change of the user-level formalisms, thanks to a straightforward homomorphism from partitioned n-relations to Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages."]},{"title":"2 Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages","paragraphs":["Within a given n-tuple, there is no meaningful order between symbols of the different levels. Mazurkiewicz trace languages is a theory which expresses partial ordering between symbols. They have been dened and studied in the realm of parallel computing. In this section, we recall their denition and some classical results. (Diekert and M·etivier, 1997) gives an exhaustive presentation on the subject with a detailed bibliography. It contains all the results mentioned here and refers to their original publication. 2.1 Denitions A Partially Commutative Monoid is dened on an alphabet Σ with an independence binary relation I over Σ × Σ which is symmetric and irreexive. Two independent symbols commute freely whereas non-independent symbols do not. I denes an equivalence relation ∼I on Σ∗",": two words are equivalent if one is the result of a series of commutation of pairs of successive symbols which belong to I.

A recognizable Trace Language may be implemented by a Finite-State Automaton.","929","A trace [x] is said to be connected if the dependence relation restricted to the alphabet of [x] is a connected graph. A trace language is connected if all its traces are connected.","A string x is said to be in lexicographic normal form if x is the smallest string of its equivalence class [x] with respect to the lexicographic ordering induced by an ordering on Σ. The set of strings in lexicographic normal form is written LexN F . This set is a regular language which is described by the following regular expression: LexN F = Σ∗","− ⋃","(a,b)∈I,a<b Σ∗","b(I(a))∗","aΣ∗ where I(a) denotes the set of symbols independent from a. Property 1 Let T ⊆ M (Σ, I) be a trace language. The following assertions are equivalent: • T is recognizable","• T is expressible as a rational expression where the Kleene star is used only on connected languages.","• The set M in(T ) = { x ∈ LexN F | [x] ∈ T } is a regular language over Σ∗",".","Recognizability is closely related to the notion of iterative factor, which is the language-level equivalent of a loop in a nite-state machine. If two symbols a and b such that a < b belong to a loop, and if the loop is traversed several times, then occurrences of a and b are interlaced. For such a string to be in lexicographic normal form, a dependent symbol must appear in the loop between b and a. 2.3 Operations and closure properties Recognizable trace languages are closed under intersection and union. Furthermore, Min(T1) ∪ Min(T2) = Min(T1 ∪T2) and Min(T1)∩Min(T2) = Min(T1 ∩ T2). It comes from the fact that intersection and union do not create new iterative factor. The property on lexicographic normal form comes from the fact that all the traces in the result of the operation belong to at least one of the operands which are in normal form.","Recognizable trace language are closed under concatenation. Concatenation do not create new iterative factors. The concatenation Min(T1)Min(T2) is not necessarily in lexicographic normal form. For instance, suppose that a > b. Then { [a]} .{ [b]} = { [ab]} , but Min({ [a]} ) = a, Min({ [b]} ) = b, and Min({ [ab]} ) = ba.","Recognizable trace languages are closed under complementation.","Recognizable Trace Languages are not closed under Kleene star. For instance, a < b, Min([ab]∗",") = an","bn","which is known not to be regular.","The projection on a subset S of Σ is the operation written πS, which deletes all the occurrences of symbols in Σ − S from the traces. Recognizable trace languages are not closed under projection. The reason is that the projection may delete symbols which makes the languages of loops connected."]},{"title":"3 Partitioned relations and trace languages","paragraphs":["It is possible to convert a partitioned relation into a trace language as follows:","• represent the partition boundaries using a symbol ω not in Σ.","• distinguish the symbols according to the component (tape) of the n-tuple they belong to. For this purpose, we will use a subscript. • dene the dependence relation D by:  ω is dependent from all the other symbols","symbols in Σ sharing the same subscript are mutually dependent whereas symbols having different subscript are mutually independent. For instance, the spy n-tuple sequence (s, s)(p, p)(y, ie)(+, ε)(s, s) is translated into the trace ωs1s2ωp1p2ωy1i2e2ω +1 ωs1s2ω. The gure 1 gives the partial order between symbols of this trace.","The dependence relation is intuitively sound. For instance, in the third n-tuple, there is a dependency between i and e which cannot be permuted, but there is no dependency between i (resp. e) and y: i is neither before nor after y. There are three equivalent permutations: y1i2e2, i2y1e2 and i2e2y1. In an implementation, one canonical representation must be chosen, in order to ensure that set operations, such as intersection, are correct. The notion of lexicographic normal form, based on any arbitrary but xed order on symbols, gives such a canonical form.","930"]},{"title":"tape 1tape 2 w s1s2 w wp1p2 i2 e2y1 w +1 w s1s2 w","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Partially ordered symbols","The compilation of the trace language into a nite-state automaton has been studied through the notion of recognizability. This automaton is very similar to an n-tape transducer. The Trace Language theory gives properties such as closure under intersection and soundness of the lexicographic normal form, which do not hold for usual transducers classes. It also provides a criterion to restrict the description of languages through regular expressions. This restriction is that the closure operator (Kleene star) must occur on connected languages only. In the translation of a partition-based regular expression, a star may appear either on a string of symbols of a given tape or on a string with at least one occurrence of ω.","Another benet of Mazurkiewicz trace languages with respect to partitioned relations is their ability to represent the segmentation of the same form using two different partitionings. The example of gure 2 uses two partitionings of the form spy+s, one based on the notion of morpheme, the other on the notion of phoneme. The notation <pos=noun> and <number=pl> stands for two single symbols. Flat feature structures over (small) nite domains are easily represented by a string of such symbols. N-tuples are not very convenient to represent such a system.","Partition-based formalism are especially adapted to express relations between different representation such as feature structures and afxes, with respect to two-level morphology which imposes an articial symbol-to-symbol mapping.","A multi-partitioned relation may be obtained by merging the translation of two partition-based grammars which share one or more common tapes.

We do not have a general solution to the problem but two partial so-lutions. Firstly, it is easy to test whether the result is actually in normal form or not.

Then, M in(T1.{ ωu} .T2) = M in(T1).M in(ωu).M in(T2).","The closure (Kleene star) operation creates a new iterative factor and therefore, the result may be a non recognizable trace language.

Furthermore, the result is in normal form.","So far, operations have operands and the result belonging to the same Multi-tape Monoid.

(Yli-Jyr¤a and Koskenniemi, 2004) is more general. 934 with an irrelevant one is sometimes difcult and in-elegant. For instance, describing vowel harmony using a partitioning based on morphemes takes necessarily several rules corresponding to the cases where the harmony is within a morpheme or across several morphemes.","Previous partition-based formalisms use a unique partitioning which is used in all the contextual rules. Our proposition is to use several partitionings in order to express constraints with the proper granularity. Typically, these partitionings correspond to the notions of morphemes, phonemes and graphemes.","Partition-based grammars have the same theoretical power as two-level morphology, which is the power of regular languages. It was designed to remain nite-state and closed under intersection. It is compiled in nite-state automata which are formally equivalent to the epsilon-free letter transducers used by two-level morphology. It is simply more easy to use in some cases, just like two-level rules are more convenient than simple regular expressions for some applications.","Partition-Based morphology is convenient whenever the different levels use very different representations, like feature structures and strings, or different writing systems (e.g. Japanese hiragana and transcription). Two-level rules on the other hand are convenient whenever the related strings are variants of the same representation like in the example (spy+s,spies). Note that multi-partition morphology may use a one-to-one correspondence as one of its partitionings, and therefore is compatible with usual two-level morphology.","With respect to rewrite rule systems, partition-based morphology gives better support to parallel rule application and context denition may involve several levels.
