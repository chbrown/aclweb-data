We give some background on LNRE models, discuss related software and the motivation for the toolkit, describe the implementation, and conclude with a complete sample session showing a typical LNRE analysis."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["As has been known at least since the seminal work of Zipf (1949), words and other type-rich linguistic populations are characterized by the fact that even the largest samples (corpora) do not contain in-stances of all types in the population. Consequently, the number and distribution of types in the available sample are not reliable estimators of the number and distribution of types in the population. Large-Number-of-Rare-Events (LNRE) models (Baayen, 2001) are a class of specialized statistical models that estimate the distribution of occurrence probabilities in such type-rich linguistic populations from our limited samples.","LNRE models have applications in many branches of linguistics and NLP. A typical use case is to predict the number of different types (the vocabulary size) in a larger sample or the whole population, based on the smaller sample available to the researcher. For example, one could use LNRE models to infer how many words a 5-year-old child knows in total, given a sample of her writing. LNRE models can also be used to quantify the relative productivity of two morphological processes (as illustrated below) or of two rival syntactic constructions by looking at their vocabulary growth rate as sample size increases. Practical NLP applications include making informed guesses about type counts in very large data sets (e.g., How many typos are there on the Internet?) and determining the “lexical richness” of texts belonging to different genres. Last but not least, LNRE models play an important role as a population model for Bayesian inference and Good-Turing frequency smoothing (Good, 1953).","However, with a few notable exceptions (such as the work by Baayen on morphological productivity), LNRE models are rarely if ever employed in linguistic research and NLP applications. We believe that this has to be attributed, at least in part, to the lack of easy-to-use but sophisticated LNRE modeling tools that are reliable and robust, scale up to large data sets, and can easily be integrated into the workflow of an experiment or application. We have developed the zipfR toolkit in order to remedy this situation."]},{"title":"2 LNRE models","paragraphs":["In the field of LNRE modeling, we are not interested in the frequencies or probabilities of individual word types (or types of other linguistic units), but rather in the distribution of such frequencies (in a sample) and probabilities (in the population). Consequently, the most important observations (in mathematical terminology, the statistics of interest) are the total number V (N ) of different types in a sample of N tokens (also called the vocabulary size) and the number Vm(N ) of types that occur exactly m times 29 in the sample. The set of values Vm(N ) for all frequency ranks m = 1, 2, 3, . . . is called a frequency spectrum and constitutes a sufficient statistic for the purpose of LNRE modeling.","A LNRE model M is a population model that specifies a certain distribution for the type probabilities in the population. This distribution can be linked to the observable values V (N ) and Vm(N ) by the standard assumption that the observed data are a random sample of size N from this population. It is most convenient mathematically to formulate a LNRE model in terms of a type density function g(π), defined over the range of possible type probabilities 0 < π < 1, such that","∫ b","a g(π) dπ is","the number of types with occurrence probabilities","in the range a ≤ π ≤ b.1","From the type density","function, expected values E [ V (N )] and E [ Vm(N )] can be calculated with relative ease (Baayen, 2001), especially for the most widely-used LNRE models, which are based on Zipf’s law and stipulate a power law function for g(π). These models are known as GIGP (Sichel, 1975), ZM and fZM (Evert, 2004). For example, the type density of the ZM and fZM models is given by g(π) :=","{ C · π−α−1","A ≤ π ≤ B 0 otherwise with parameters 0 < α < 1 and 0 ≤ A < B. Baayen (2001) also presents approximate equations for the variances Var [ V (N )] and Var","[","Vm(N )]",". In addition to such predictions for random samples, the type density g(π) can also be used as a Bayesian prior, where it is especially useful for probability estimation from low-frequency data.","Baayen (2001) suggests a number of models that calculate the expected frequency spectrum directly without an underlying population model. While these models can sometimes be fitted very well to an observed frequency spectrum, they do not interpret the corpus data as a random sample from a population and hence do not allow for generalizations. They also cannot be used as a prior distribution for Bayesian inference. For these reasons, we do not see","1","Since type probabilities are necessarily discrete, such a type density function can only give an approximation to the true distribution. However, the approximation is usually excellent for the low-probability types that are the center of interest for most applications of LNRE models. them as proper LNRE models and do not consider them useful for practical application."]},{"title":"3 Requirements and related software","paragraphs":["As pointed out in the previous section, most applications of LNRE models rely on equations for the expected values and variances of V (N ) and Vm(N ) in a sample of arbitrary size N . The required basic operations are: (i) parameter estimation, where the parameters of a LNRE model M are determined from a training sample of size N0 by comparing the expected frequency spectrum E[","Vm(N0)]","with the observed spectrum Vm(N0); (ii) goodness-of-fit evaluation based on the covariance matrix of V and Vm; (iii) interpolation and extrapolation of vocabulary growth, using the expectations E","[","V (N )]","; and (iv) prediction of the expected frequency spectrum for arbitrary sample size N . In addition, Bayesian inference requires access to the type density g(π) and distribution function G(a) =","∫ 1","a g(π) dπ, while random sampling from the population described by a LNRE model M is a prerequisite for Monte Carlo methods and simulation experiments.","Up to now, the only publicly available implementation of LNRE models has been the lexstats toolkit of Baayen (2001), which offers a wide range of models including advanced partition-adjusted versions and mixture models. While the toolkit supports the basic operations (i)–(iv) above, it does not give access to distribution functions or random samples (from the model distribution). It has not found widespread use among (computational) linguists, which we attribute to a number of limitations of the software: lexstats is a collection of commandline programs that can only be mastered with expert knowledge; an ad-hoc Tk-based graphical user in-terfaces simplifies basic operations, but is fully supported on the Linux platform only; the GUI also has only minimal functionality for visualization and data analysis; it has restrictive input options (making its use with languages other than English very cumbersome) and works reliably only for rather small data sets, well below the sizes now routinely encountered in linguistic research (cf. the problems reported in Evert and Baroni 2006); the standard parameter estimation methods are not very robust without extensive manual intervention, so lexstats cannot be used 30 as an off-the-shelf solution; and nearly all programs in the suite require interactive input, making it difficult to automate LNRE analyses."]},{"title":"4 Implementation","paragraphs":["First and foremost, zipfR was conceived and developed to overcome the limitations of the lexstats toolkit. We implemented zipfR as an add-on library for the popular statistical computing environment R (R Development Core Team, 2003). It can easily be installed (from the CRAN archive) and used off-the-shelf for standard LNRE modeling applications. It fully supports the basic operations (i)–(iv), calculation of distribution functions and random sampling, as discussed in the previous section. We have taken great care to offer robust parameter estimation, while allowing advanced users full control over the estimation procedure by selecting from a wide range of optimization techniques and cost functions. In addition, a broad range of data manipulation techniques for word frequency data are provided. The integration of zipfR within the R environment makes the full power of R available for visualization and further statistical analyses.","For the reasons outlined above, our software package only implements proper LNRE models. Currently, the GIGP, ZM and fZM models are supported. We decided not to implement another LNRE model available in lexstats, the lognormal model, be-cause of its numerical instability and poor performance in previous evaluation studies (Evert and Baroni, 2006).","More information about zipfR can be found on its homepage at http://purl.org/stefan.evert/zipfR/."]},{"title":"5 A sample session","paragraphs":["In this section, we use a typical application example to give a brief overview of the basic functionality of the zipfR toolkit. zipfR accepts a variety of input for-mats, the most common ones being type frequency lists (which, in the simplest case, can be newlinedelimited lists of frequency values) and tokenized (sub-)corpora (one word per line). Thus, as long as users can extract frequency data or at least tokenize the corpus of interest with other tools, they can perform all further analysis with zipfR.","Suppose that we want to compare the relative productivity of the Italian prefix ri- with that of the rarer prefix ultra- (roughly equivalent to English re-and ultra-, respectively), and that we have frequency lists of the word types containing the two prefixes.2 In our R session, we import the data, create frequency spectra for the two classes, and we plot the spectra to look at their frequency distribution (the output graph is shown in the left panel of Figure 1): ItaRi.tfl <- read.tfl(\"ri.txt\") ItaUltra.tfl <- read.tfl(\"ultra.txt\") ItaRi.spc <- tfl2spc(ItaRi.tfl) ItaUltra.spc <- tfl2spc(ItaUltra.tfl) > plot(ItaRi.spc,ItaUltra.spc, + legend=c(\"ri-\",\"ultra-\"))","We can then look at summary information about the distributions: > summary(ItaRi.spc) zipfR object for frequency spectrum Sample size: N = 1399898 Vocabulary size: V = 1098 Class sizes: Vm = 346 105 74 43 ... > summary(ItaUltra.spc) zipfR object for frequency spectrum Sample size: N = 3467 Vocabulary size: V = 523 Class sizes: Vm = 333 68 37 15 ...","We see that the ultra- sample is much smaller than the ri- sample, making a direct comparison of their vocabulary sizes problematic. Thus, we will use the fZM model (Evert, 2004) to estimate the parameters of the ultra- population (notice that the summary of an estimated model includes the parameters of the relevant distribution as well as goodness-of-fit information): > ItaUltra.fzm <- lnre(\"fzm\",ItaUltra.spc) > summary(ItaUltra.fzm) finite Zipf-Mandelbrot LNRE model.

This is confirmed by a visual comparison of vocabulary growth curves, that report changes in vocabulary size as sample size increases.
