These annotations include sentence segmentation into discourse units along with the linking of discourse units, both within and across sentence boundaries, into a labeled hierarchical structure. For example, the tree in Figure 1 shows a sentence-level discourse tree for the string “Prices have dropped but remain quite high, according to CEO Smith,” which has three discourse segments, each labeled with either “Nucleus” or “Satellite” depending on how central the segment is to the coherence of the text.","There are a number of corpora annotated with discourse structure, including the well-known RST Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002); the Discourse GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005); and the Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004). While the annotation approaches differ across these corpora, the requirement of sentence segmentation into Root",""," Nucleus","","","Nucleus","","","Prices have dropped","Satellite "," but remain quite high","Satellite "," according to CEO Smith Figure 1: Example Nucleus/Satellite labeled sentence-level discourse tree. sub-sentential discourse units is shared across all approaches. These resources have facilitated research into stochastic models and algorithms for automatic discourse structure annotation in recent years.","Using the RST Treebank as training and evaluation data, Soricut and Marcu (2003) demonstrated that their automatic sentence-level discourse parsing system could achieve near-human levels of accuracy, if it was provided with manual segmentations and manual parse trees. Manual segmentation was primarily responsible for this performance boost over their fully automatic system, thus making the case that automatic discourse segmentation is the primary impediment to high accuracy automatic sentence-level discourse structure annotation. Their models and algorithm – subsequently packaged to-gether into the publicly available SPADE discourse parser1","– make use of the output of the Charniak (2000) parser to derive syntactic indicator features for segmentation and discourse parsing.","Sporleder and Lapata (2005) also used the RST Treebank as training data for data-driven discourse parsing algorithms, though their focus, in contrast to Soricut and Marcu (2003), was to avoid context-free parsing and rely exclusively on features in their model that could be derived via finite-state chunkers and taggers. The annotations that they derive are dis-","1","http://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/spade/ 488 course “chunks”, i.e., sentence-level segmentation and non-hierarchical nucleus/span labeling of segments. They demonstrate that their models achieve comparable results to SPADE without the use of any context-free features. Once again, segmentation is the part of the process where the automatic algorithms most seriously underperform.","In this paper we take up the question posed by the results of Sporleder and Lapata (2005): how much, if any, accuracy reduction should we expect if we choose to use only finite-state derived features, rather than those derived from full context-free parses? If little accuracy is lost, as their results suggest, then it would make sense to avoid relatively expensive context-free parsing, particularly if the amount of text to be processed is large or if there are real-time processing constraints on the system. If, however, the accuracy loss is substantial, one might choose to avoid context-free parsing only in the most time-constrained scenarios.","While Sporleder and Lapata (2005) demonstrated that their finite-state system could perform as well as the SPADE system, which uses context-free parse trees, this does not directly answer the question of the utility of context-free derived features for this task. SPADE makes use of a particular kind of feature from the parse trees, and does not train a general classifier making use of other features beyond the parse-derived indicator features. As we shall show, its performance is not the highest that can be achieved via context-free parser derived features.","In this paper, we train a classifier using a general machine learning approach and a range of finite-state and context-free derived features. We investigate the impact on discourse segmentation performance when one feature set is used versus another, in such a way establishing the utility of features derived from context-free parses. In the course of so doing, we achieve the best reported performance on this task, an absolute F-score improvement of 5.0% over SPADE, which represents a more than 34% relative error rate reduction.","By focusing on segmentation, we provide an approach that is generally applicable to all of the various annotation approaches, given the similarities between the various sentence-level segmentation guidelines. Given that segmentation has been shown to be a primary impediment to high accuracy sentence-level discourse structure annotation, this represents a large step forward in our ability to automatically parse the discourse structure of text, whatever annotation approach we choose."]},{"title":"2 Methods 2.1 Data","paragraphs":["For our experiments we use the Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002), which we will denote RST-DT, a corpus annotated with discourse segmentation and relations according to Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). The RST-DT consists of 385 documents from the Wall Street Journal, about 176,000 words, which overlaps with the Penn Wall St. Journal (WSJ) Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).","The segmentation of sentences in the RST-DT is into clause-like units, known as elementary discourse units, or edus. We will use the two terms ‘edu’ and ‘segment’ interchangeably throughout the rest of the paper. Human agreement for this segmentation task is quite high, with agreement between two annotators at an F-score of 98.3 for unlabeled segmentation (Soricut and Marcu, 2003).","The RST-DT corpus annotates edu breaks, which typically include sentence boundaries, but sentence boundaries are not explicitly annotated in the corpus. To perform sentence-level processing and evaluation, we aligned the RST-DT documents to the same documents in the Penn WSJ Treebank, and used the sentence boundaries from that corpus.2","An additional benefit of this alignment is that the Penn WSJ Treebank tokenization is then available for parsing purposes. Simple minimum edit distance alignment effectively allowed for differences in punctuation representation (e.g., double quotes) and tokenization when deriving the optimal alignment.","The RST-DT corpus is partitioned into a training set of 347 documents and a test set of 38 documents. This test set consists of 991 sentences with 2,346 segments. For training purposes, we created a held-out development set by selecting every tenth sentence of the training set. This development set was used for feature development and for selecting the number of iterations used when training models. 2.2 Evaluation Previous research into RST-DT segmentation and parsing has focused on subsets of the 991 sentence test set during evaluation. Soricut and Marcu (2003)","2","A small number of document final parentheticals are in the RST-DT and not in the Penn WSJ Treebank, which our alignment approach takes into account. 489 omitted sentences that were not exactly spanned by a subtree of the treebank, so that they could focus on sentence-level discourse parsing. By our count, this eliminates 40 of the 991 sentences in the test set from consideration. Sporleder and Lapata (2005) went further and established a smaller subset of 608 sentences, which omitted sentences with only one segment, i.e., sentences which themselves are atomic edus.","Since the primary focus of this paper is on segmentation, there is no strong reason to omit any sentences from the test set, hence our results will evaluate on all 991 test sentences, with two exceptions. First, in Section 2.3, we compare SPADE results under our configuration with results from Sporleder and Lapata (2005) in order to establish comparability, and this is done on their 608 sentence subset. Second, in Section 3.2, we investigate feed-ing our segmentation into the SPADE system, in order to evaluate the impact of segmentation improvements on their sentence-level discourse parsing performance. For those trials, the 951 sentence subset from Soricut and Marcu (2003) is used. All other trials use the full 991 sentence test set.","Segmentation evaluation is done with precision, recall and F1-score of segmentation boundaries. Given a word string w1 . . . wk, we can index word boundaries from 0 to k, so that each word wi falls between boundaries i−1 and i. For sentence-based segmentation, indices 0 and k, representing the beginning and end of the string, are known to be segment boundaries. Hence Soricut and Marcu (2003) evaluate with respect to sentence internal segmentation boundaries, i.e., with indices j such that 0<j<k for a sentence of length k. Let g be the number of sentence-internal segmentation boundaries in the gold standard, t the number of sentence-internal segmentation boundaries in the system output, and m the number of correct sentence-internal segmentation boundaries in the system output. Then","P = m","t R = m","g and F 1 = 2P R","P +R = 2m","g+t","In Sporleder and Lapata (2005), they were primarily interested in labeled segmentation, where the segment initial boundary was labeled with the segment type. In such a scenario, the boundary at index 0 is no longer known, hence their evaluation included those boundaries, even when reporting unlabeled results. Thus, in section 2.3, for comparison with reported results in Sporleder and Lapata (2005), our F1-score is defined accordingly, i.e., seg-Segmentation system F1 Sporleder and Lapata best (reported) 88.40 SPADE","Sporleder and Lapata configuration (reported): 87.06","current configuration: 91.04 Table 1: Segmentation results on the Sporleder and Lapata (2005) data set, with accuracy defined to include sentence initial segmentation boundaries. mentation boundaries j such that 0 ≤ j < k.","In addition, we will report unlabeled bracketing precision, recall and F1-score, as defined in the PARSEVAL metrics (Black et al., 1991) and evaluated via the widely used evalb package. We also use evalb when reporting labeled and unlabeled discourse parsing results in Section 3.2. 2.3 Baseline SPADE setup The publicly available SPADE package, which encodes the approach in Soricut and Marcu (2003), is taken as the baseline for this paper. We made several modifications to the script from the default, which account for better baseline performance than is achieved with the default configuration. First, we modified the script to take given parse trees as input, rather than running the Charniak parser itself. This allowed us to make two modifications that improved performance: turning off tokenization in the Charniak parser, and reranking. The default script that comes with SPADE does not turn off tokenization inside of the parser, which leads to degraded performance when the input has already been tokenized in the Penn Treebank style. Secondly, Charniak and Johnson (2005) showed how reranking of the 50-best output of the Charniak (2000) parser gives substantial improvements in parsing accuracy. These two modifications to the Charniak parsing output used by the SPADE system lead to improvements in its performance compared to previously reported results.","Table 1 compares segmentation results of three systems on the Sporleder and Lapata (2005) 608 sentence subset of the evaluation data: (1) their best reported system; (2) the SPADE system results reported in that paper; and (3) the SPADE system results with our current configuration. The evaluation uses the unlabeled F1 measure as defined in that paper, which counts sentence initial boundaries in the scoring, as discussed in the previous section. As can be seen from these results, our improved configuration of SPADE gives us large improvements over the previously reported SPADE performance on this subset. As a result, we feel that we can use SPADE 490 as a very strong baseline for evaluation on the entire test set.","Additionally, we modified the SPADE script to allow us to provide our segmentations to the full discourse parsing that it performs, in order to evaluate the improvements to discourse parsing yielded by any improvements to segmentation. 2.4 Segmentation classifier For this paper, we trained a binary classifier, which was applied independently at each word wi in the string w1 . . . wk, to decide whether that word is the last in a segment. Note that wk is the last word in the string, and is hence ignored. We used a loglinear model with no Markov dependency between adjacent tags,3","and trained the parameters of the model with the perceptron algorithm, with averag-ing to control for over-training (Collins, 2002).","Let C={E, I} be the set of classes: segmentation boundary (E) or non-boundary (I). Let f (c, i, w1 . . . wk) be a function that takes as input a class value c, a word index i and the word string w1 . . . wk and returns a d-dimensional vector of feature values for that word index in that string with that class. For example, one feature might be (c = E, wi = the), which returns the value 1 when c = E and the current word is ‘the’, and returns 0 otherwise. Given a d-dimensional parameter vector φ, the output of the classifier is that class which maximizes the dot product between the feature and parameter vectors:","ĉ(i, w1 . . . wk) = argmax c∈C φ · f (c, i, w1 . . . wk) (1) In training, the weights in φ are initialized to 0. For m epochs (passes over the training data), for each word in the training data (except sentence final words), the model is updated. Let i be the current word position in string w1 . . . wk and suppose that there have been j−1 previous updates to the model parameters. Let c̄i be the true class label, and let ĉi be shorthand for ĉ(i, w1 . . . wk) in equation 1. Then the parameter vector φj at step j is updated as follows: φj = φj−1 − f(ĉ, i, w1 . . . wk) + f(c̄, i, w1 . . . wk) (2) As stated in Section 2.1, we reserved every tenth sentence as held-out data. After each pass over the training data, we evaluated the system performance","3","Because of the sparsity of boundary tags, Markov dependencies between tags buy no additional system accuracy. on this held-out data, and chose the model that optimized accuracy on that set. The averaged perceptron was used on held-out and evaluation sets. See Collins (2002) for more details on this approach. 2.5 Features To tease apart the utility of finite-state derived features and context-free derived features, we consider three feature sets: (1) basic finite-state features; (2) context-free features; and (3) finite-state approximation to context-free features. Note that every feature must include exactly one class label c in order to discriminate between classes in equation 1. Hence when presenting features, it can be assumed that the class label is part of the feature, even if it is not explicitly mentioned.","The three feature sets are not completely disjoint. We include simple position-based features in every system, defined as follows. Because edus are typically multi-word strings, it is less likely for a word near the beginning or end of a sentence to be at an edu boundary. Thus it is reasonable to expect the position within a sentence of a token to be a helpful feature. We created 101 indicator features, representing percentages from 0 to 100. For a string of length k, at position i, we round i/k to two decimal places and provide a value of 1 for the corresponding quantized position feature and 0 for the other position features. 2.5.1 Basic finite-state features Our baseline finite-state feature set includes simple tagger derived features, as well as features based on position in the string and n-grams4",". We annotate tag sequences onto the word sequence via a competitive discriminatively trained tagger (Hollingshead et al., 2005), trained for each of two kinds of tag sequences: part-of-speech (POS) tags and shallow parse tags. The shallow parse tags define non-hierarchical base constituents (“chunks”), as defined for the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). These can either be used as tag or chunk sequences. For example, the tree in Figure 2 represents a shallow (non-hierarchical) parse tree, with four base constituents. Each base constituent X begins with a word labeled with BX , which signifies that this word begins the constituent. All other words within a constituent X are labeled","4","We tried using a list of 311 cue phrases from Knott (1996) to define features, but did not derive any system improvement through this list, presumably because our simple n-gram features already capture many such lexical cues. 491","ROOT","   "," ","NP ","BNP DT the INP NN broker","VP ","BVP MD will IVP VBD sell","NP ","BNP DT the INP NNS stocks NP BNP NN tomorrow Figure 2: Tree representation of shallow parses, with B(egin) and I(nside) tags IX , and words outside of any base constituent are labeled O. In such a way, each word is labeled with both a POS-tag and a B/I/O tag.","For our three sequences (lexical, POS-tag and shallow tag), we define n-gram features surround-ing the potential discourse boundary. If the current word is wi, the hypothesized boundary will occur between wi and wi+1. For this boundary position, the 6-gram including the three words before and the three words after the boundary is included as a feature; additionally, all n-grams for n < 6 such that either wi or wi+1 (or both) is in the n-gram are included as features. In other words, all n-grams in a six word window of boundary position i are included as features, except those that include neither wi nor wi+1 in the n-gram. The identical feature templates are used with POS-tag and shallow tag sequences as well, to define tag n-gram features.","This feature set is very close to that used in Sporleder and Lapata (2005), but not identical. Their n-gram feature definitions were different (though similar), and they made use of cue phrases from Knott (1996). In addition, they used a rule-based clauser that we did not. Despite such differences, this feature set is quite close to what is described in that paper. 2.5.2 Context-free features To describe our context-free features, we first present how SPADE made use of context-free parse trees within their segmentation algorithm, since this forms the basis of our features. The SPADE features are based on productions extracted from full syntactic parses of the given sentence. The primary feature for a discourse boundary after word wi is based on the lowest constituent in the tree that spans words wm . . . wn such that m ≤ i < n. For example, in the parse tree schematic in Figure 3, the constituent labeled with A is the lowest constituent in the tree whose span crosses the potential discourse boundary after wi. The primary feature is the production","A","  "," ","B1 . . . Bj−1  ","C1 . . . Cn  . . . Ti wi Bj . . . Bm Figure 3: Parse tree schematic for describing context-free segmentation features that expands this constituent in the tree, with the proposed segmentation boundary marked, which in this case is: A → B1 . . . Bj−1||Bj . . . Bm, where || denotes the segmentation boundary. In SPADE, the production is lexicalized by the head words of each constituent, which are determined using standard head-percolation techniques. This feature is used to predict a boundary as follows: if the relative frequency estimate of a boundary given the production feature in the corpus is greater than 0.5, then a boundary is predicted; otherwise not. If the production has not been observed frequently enough, the lexicalization is removed and the relative frequency of a boundary given the unlexicalized production is used for prediction. If the observations of the unlexicalized production are also too sparse, then only the children adjacent to the boundary are maintained in the feature, e.g., A → ∗Bj−1||Bj∗ where ∗ represents zero or more categories. Further smoothing is used when even this is unobserved.","We use these features as the starting point for our context-free feature set: the lexicalized production A → B1 . . . Bj−1||Bj . . . Bm, as defined above for SPADE, is a feature in our model, as is the unlexicalized version of the production. As with the other features that we have described, this feature is used as an indicator feature in the classifier applied at the word wi preceding the hypothesized boundary. In addition to these full production features, we use the production with only children adjacent to the boundary, denoted by A → ∗Bj−1||Bj∗. This production is used in four ways: fully lexicalized; unlexicalized; only category Bj−1 lexicalized; and only category Bj lexicalized. We also use A → ∗Bj−2Bj−1||∗ and A → ∗||BjBj+1∗ features, both unlexicalized and with the boundary-adjacent category lexicalized. If there is no category Bj−2 or Bj+1, they are replaced with “N/A”.","In addition to these features, we fire the same features for all productions on the path from A down 492","Segment Boundary accuracy Bracketing accuracy Segmentation system Recall Precision F1 Recall Precision F1 SPADE 85.4 85.5 85.5 77.7 77.9 77.8 Classifier: Basic finite-state 81.5 83.3 82.4 73.6 74.5 74.0 Classifier: Full finite-state 84.1 87.9 86.0 78.0 80.0 79.0 Classifier: Context-free 84.7 91.1 87.8 80.3 83.7 82.0 Classifier: All features 89.7 91.3 90.5 84.9 85.8 85.3 Table 2: Segmentation results on all 991 sentences in the RST-DT test set. Segment boundary accuracy is for sentence internal boundaries only, following Soricut and Marcu (2003). Bracketing accuracy is for unlabeled flat bracketing of the same segments. While boundary accuracy correctly depicts segmentation results, the harsher flat bracketing metric better predicts discourse parsing performance. to the word wi. For these productions, the segmentation boundary || will occur after all children in the production, e.g., Bj−1 → C1 . . . Cn||, which is then used in both lexicalized and unlexicalized forms. For the feature with only categories adjacent to the boundary, we again use “N/A” to denote the fact that no category occurs to the right of the boundary: Bj−1 → ∗Cn||N/A. Once again, these are lexicalized as described above. 2.5.3 Finite-state approximation features An approximation to our context-free features can be made by using the shallow parse tree, as shown in Figure 2, in lieu of the full hierarchical parse tree. For example, if the current word was “sell” in the tree in Figure 2, the primary feature would be ROOT → NP VP||NP NP, and it would have an unlexicalized version and three lexicalized versions: the category immediately prior to the boundary lexicalized; the category immediately after the boundary lexicalized; and both lexicalized. For lexicalization, we choose the final word in the constituent as the lexical head for the constituent. This is a reasonable first approximation, because such typically left-headed categories as PP and VP lose their argu-ments in the shallow parse.","As a practical matter, we limit the number of categories in the flat production to 8 to the left and 8 to the right of the boundary. In a manner similar to the n-gram features that we defined in Section 2.5.1, we allow all combinations with less than 8 contiguous categories on each side, provided that at least one of the adjacent categories is included in the feature. Each feature has an unlexicalized and three lexicalized versions, as described above."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["We performed a number of experiments to determine the relative utility of features derived from full context-free syntactic parses and those derived solely from shallow finite-state tagging. Our primary concern is with intra-sentential discourse segmentation, but we are also interested in how much the improved segmentation helps discourse parsing.","The syntactic parser we use for all context-free syntactic parses used in either SPADE or our classifier is the Charniak parser with reranking, as described in Charniak and Johnson (2005). The Charniak parser and reranker were trained on the sections of the Penn Treebank not included in the RST-DT test set.","All statistical significance testing is done via the stratified shuffling test (Yeh, 2000). 3.1 Segmentation Table 2 presents segmentation results for SPADE and four versions of our classifier. The “Basic finite-state” system uses only finite-state sequence features as defined in Section 2.5.1, while the “Full finite-state” also includes the finite-state approximation features from Section 2.5.3. The “Context-free” system uses the SPADE-inspired features detailed in Section 2.5.2, but none of the features from Sections 2.5.1 or 2.5.3. Finally, the “All features” section includes features from all three sections.5","Note that the full finite-state system is considerably better than the basic finite-state system, demonstrating the utility of these approximations of the SPADE-like context-free features. The performance of the resulting “Full” finite-state system is not statistically significantly different from that of SPADE (p=0.193), despite no reliance on features derived from context-free parses.","The context-free features, however, even without any of the finite-state sequence features (even lexical n-grams) outperforms the best finite-state system by almost two percent absolute, and the system with all features improves on the best finite-state system by over four percent absolute. The system","5","In the “All features” condition, the finite-state approximation features defined in Section 2.5.3 only include a maximum of 3 children to the left and right of the boundary, versus a maximum of 8 for the “Full finite-state” system.

This large improvement demonstrates that the context-free features can provide a very large system improvement. 3.2 Discourse parsing It has been shown that accurate discourse segmentation within a sentence greatly improves the over-all parsing accuracy to near human levels (Soricut and Marcu, 2003). Given our improved segmentation results presented in the previous section, improvements would be expected in full sentence-level discourse parsing. To achieve this, we modified the SPADE script to accept our segmentations when building the fully hierarchical discourse tree. The results for three systems are presented in Table 3: SPADE, our “Full finite-state” system, and our system with all features. Results for unlabeled bracketing are presented, along with results for labeled bracketing, where the label is either Nucleus or Satellite, depending upon whether or not the node is more central (Nucleus) to the coherence of the text than its sibling(s) (Satellite). This label set has been shown to be of particular utility for indicating which segments are more important to include in an automatically created summary or compressed sentence (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005; Marcu, 1998; Marcu, 1999; Cristea et al., 2005).","Once again, the finite-state system does not perform statistically significantly different from SPADE on either labeled or unlabeled discourse parsing. Using all features, however, results in greater than 5% absolute accuracy improvement over both of these systems, which is significant, in all cases, at p < 0.001."]},{"title":"4 Discussion and future directions","paragraphs":["Our results show that context-free parse derived features are critical for achieving the highest level of accuracy in sentence-level discourse segmentation. Given that edus are by definition clause-like units, it is not surprising that accurate full syntactic parse trees provide highly relevant information unavailable from finite-state approaches. Adding context-free features to our best finite-state feature model reduces error in segmentation by 32.1%, an in-crease in absolute F-score of 4.5%. These increases are against a finite-state segmentation model that is powerful enough to be statistically indistinguishable from SPADE.","Our experiments also confirm that increased segmentation accuracy yields significantly better discourse parsing accuracy, as previously shown to be the case when providing reference segmentations to a parser (Soricut and Marcu, 2003). The segmentation reduction in error of 34.5% propagates to a 28.6% reduction in error for unlabeled discourse parse trees, and a 19.8% reduction in error for trees labeled with Nucleus and Satellite.","We have several key directions in which to continue this work. First, given that a general machine learning approach allowed us to improve upon SPADE’s segmentation performance, we also be-lieve that it will prove useful for improving full discourse parsing, both at the sentence level and beyond. For efficient inter-sentential discourse parsing, we see the need for an additional level of segmentation at the paragraph level. Whereas most sentences correspond to a well-formed subtree, Sporleder and Lascarides (2004) report that over 20% of the paragraph boundaries in the RST-DT do not correspond to a well-formed subtree in the human annotated discourse parse for that document. Therefore, to perform accurate and efficient parsing of the RST-DT at the paragraph level, the text should be segmented into paragraph-like segments that conform to the human-annotated subtree boundaries, just as sentences are segmented into edus.","We also intend to begin work on the other discourse annotated corpora. While most work on textual discourse parsing has made use of the RST-DT corpus, the Discourse GraphBank corpus provides a competing annotation that is not constrained to tree structures (Wolf and Gibson, 2005). Once accurate levels of segmentation and parsing for both corpora are attained, it will be possible to perform extrinsic evaluations to determine their relative utility for different NLP tasks. Recent work has shown promis-ing preliminary results for recognizing and labeling relations of GraphBank structures (Wellner et al., 2006), in the case that the algorithm is provided with 494 manually segmented sentences. Sentence-level segmentation in the GraphBank is very similar to that in the RST-DT, so our segmentation approach should work well for Discourse GraphBank style parsing.","The Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004), or PDTB, uses a relatively flat annotation of discourse structure, in contrast to the hierarchical structures found in the other two corpora. It contains annotations for discourse connectives and their argu-ments, where an argument can be as small as a nominalization or as large as several sentences. This approach obviates the need to create a set of discourse relations, but sentence internal segmentation is still a necessary step. Though segmentation in the PDTB tends to larger units than edus, our approach to segmentation should be straightforwardly applicable to their segmentation style."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to Caroline Sporleder and Mirella Lapata for their test data and helpful comments.
