The model takes into account source alternation patterns, so as to be able to align even sentences with low surface similarity. We demonstrate its ability to characterize text reuse in the Greek New Testament."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text reuse is the transformation of a source text into a target text in order to serve a different purpose. Past research has addressed a variety of text-reuse applications, including: journalists turning a news agency text into a newspaper story (Clough et al., 2002); editors adapting an encyclopedia entry to an abridged version (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003); and plagiarizers disguising their sources by removing surface similarities (Uzuner et al., 2005).","A common assumption in the recovery of text reuse is the conservation of some degree of lexical similarity from the source sentence to the derived sentence. A simple approach, then, is to dene a lexical similarity measure and estimate a score threshold; given a sentence in the target text, if the highest-scoring sentence in the source text is above the threshold, then the former is considered to be derived from the latter. Obviously, the effectiveness of this basic approach depends on the degree of lexical similarity: source sentences that are quoted verbatim are easier to identify than those that have been transformed by a skillful plagiarizer.","The crux of the question, therefore, is how to identify source sentences despite their lack of surface similarity to the derived sentences. Ancient literary texts, which are the focus of this paper, present some distinctive challenges in this respect. 1.1 Ancient Literary Texts Borrowed material embedded in the ow of a writer’s text is a common phenomenon in Antiquity. (van den Hoek, 1996). Ancient writers rarely acknowledged their sources. Due to the scarcity of books, they often needed to quote from memory, resulting in inexact quotations. Furthermore, they combined multiple sources, sometimes insert-ing new material or substantially paraphrasing their sources to suit their purpose. To compound the noise, the version of the source text available to us today might not be the same as the one originally consulted by the author. Before the age of the print-ing press, documents were susceptible to corruptions introduced by copyists.","Identifying the sources of ancient texts is useful in many ways. It helps establish their relative dates. It traces the evolution of ideas. The material quoted, left out or altered in a composition provides much insight into the agenda of its author. Among the more frequently quoted ancient books are the gospels in the New Testament. Three of them the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because of the substantial text reuse among them. 472 Target verses (English translation) Target verses (original Greek) Source verses (original Greek) Luke 9:30-33 Luke 9:30-33 Mark 9:4-5 (9:30) And, behold, (9:30) kai idou (9:4) kai flophthfle autois there talked with him two men, andres duo sunelaloun autflo flElias sun Mflousei kai which were Moses and Elias. hoitines flesan Mflousfles kai flElias flesan sullalountes tflo Iflesou (9:31) Who appeared in glory, ...

The Greek words with common stems in the target and source verses are bolded. The King James Version English translation is included for reference. § 1.2 comments on the text reuse in these verses. 1.2 Synoptic Gospels The nature of text reuse among the Synoptics spans a wide spectrum. On the one hand, some revered verses, such as the sayings of Jesus or the apostles, were preserved verbatim. Such is the case with Peter’s short speech in the second half of Luke 9:33 (see Table 1). On the other hand, unimportant de-tails may be deleted, and new information weaved in from other sources or oral traditions. For example, Luke often edits the introductions to new sections with the greatest independence (Taylor, 1972). To complicate matters, it is believed by some researchers that the version of the Gospel of Mark used by Luke was a more primitive version, customarily called Proto-Mark, which is no longer extant (Boismard, 1972). Continuing our example in Table 1, verses 9:31-32 have no obvious counterparts in the Gospel of Mark. Some researchers have attributed them to an earlier version of Mark (Boismard, 1972) or to Luke’s redactional tendencies (Bovon, 2002).","The result is that some verses bear little resemblance to their sources, due to extensive redaction, or to discrepancies between different versions of the source text. In the rst case, any surface similarity score alone is unlikely to be effective. In the second, even deep semantic analysis might not sufce. 1.3 Goals One property of text reuse that has not been explored in past research is source alternation patterns. For example, it is well known that sections of Luke derived from Mark and those of other origins are arranged in continuous blocks (Cadbury, 1920). This notion can be formalized with features on the blocks and order of the source sentences. The rst goal of this paper is to leverage source alternation patterns to optimize the global text reuse hypothesis.","Scholars of ancient texts tend to express their analyses qualitatively. We attempt to translate their insights into a quantitative model. To our best knowledge, this is the rst sentence-level, quantitative text-reuse model proposed for ancient texts. Our second goal is thus to bring a quantitative approach to source analysis of ancient texts."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work","paragraphs":["Text reuse is analyzed at the document level in (Clough et al., 2002), which classies newspaper articles as wholly, partially, or non-derived from a news agency text. The hapax legomena, and sentence alignment based on N -gram overlap, are found to be the most useful features.

(Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003) shows that the simple cosine similarity score can be effective when used in conjunction with paragraph clustering. A more detailed comparison with this work follows in § 4.2.","In the humanities, reused material in the writings of Plutarch (Helmbold and O’Neil, 1959) and Clement (van den Hoek, 1996) have been manually classied as quotations, reminiscences, references or paraphrases. Studies on the Synoptics have been limited to N -gram overlap, notably (Honor·e, 1968) and (Miyake et al., 2004).

In particular, we will consider the Gospel of Luke2","as the target text, and the Gospel of Mark as the source text.","We use a Greek New Testament corpus prepared by the Center for Computer Analysis of Texts at the University of Pennsylvania3",", based on the text variant from the United Bible Society. The text-reuse hypotheses (i.e., lists of verses deemed to be derived from Mark) of Franc‚ois Bovon (Bovon, 2002; Bovon, 2003) and Joachim Jeremias (Jeremias, 1966) are used. Table 2 presents our notations.","Luke 1:1 to 9:50 (Ltrain, 458 verses) Chapters 1 and 2, narratives of the births of Jesus and John the Baptist, are based on non-Markan sources. Verses 3:1 to 9:50 describe Jesus’ activities in Galilee, a substantial part of which is derived from Mark.","Luke Chapters 22 to 24 (Ltest, 179 verses) These","chapters, known as the Passion Narrative, serve","as our test text. Markan sources were behind","38% of the verses, according to Bovon, and 7%","according to Jeremias. 1 This theory (Streeter, 1930) is currently accepted by a ma-","jority of researchers. It guides our choice of experimental data,","but our model does not depend on its validity. 2 We do not consider the Gospel of Matthew or Q in this","study. Verses from Luke 9:51 to the end of chapter 21 are","also not considered, since their sources are difcult to ascertain","(Bovon, 2002). 3 Obtained through Peter Ballard (personal communication) 474"]},{"title":"4 Approach","paragraphs":["For each verse in the target text (a target verse), we would like to determine whether it is derived from a verse in the source text (a source verse) and, if so, which one.","Following the framework of global linear models in (Collins, 2002), we cast this task as learning a mapping F from input verses x ∈ X to a text-reuse hypothesis y ∈ Y ∪ { ε} . X is the set of verses in the target text. In our case, xtrain = (x1, . . . , x458) is the sequence of verses in Ltrain, and xtest is that of Ltest. Y is the set of verses in the source text. Say the sequence y = (y1, . . . , yn) is the text-reuse hypothesis for x = (x1, . . . , xn). If yi is ε, then xi is not derived from the source text; otherwise, yi is the source verse for xi. The set of candidates GEN(x) contains all possible sequences for y, and Θ is the parameter vector. The mapping F is thus:","F (x) = arg max y∈GEN(x) Φ(x, y) · Θ 4.1 Features Given the small amount of training data available4",", the feature space must be kept small to avoid overtting. Starting with the cosine similarity score as the baseline feature, we progressively enrich the model with the following features:","Cosine Similarity [Sim] Treating a target verse as a query to the set of source verses, we compute the cosine similarity, weighted with tf.idf, for each pair of source verse and target verse5",". This standard bag-of-words approach is appropriate for Greek, a relatively free word-order language. Figure 1 plots this feature on Luke and Mark. Non-derived verses are assigned a constant score in lieu of the cosine similarity. We will refer to this constant as the cosine threshold (C): when the Sim feature alone is used, the constant effectively acts as the threshold above which target verses are considered to be derived. If wi, wj are the vectors of words of a 4 Note that the training set consists of only one xtrain","the Gospel of Luke. Luke’s only other book, the Acts of the","Apostles, contains few identiable reused material. 5 A targert verse is also allowed to match two consecutive","source verses. target verse and a candidate source verse, then: sim(i, j) =","{ wi·wj ∥wi∥·∥wj∥ if derived C otherwise","Number of Blocks [Block] Luke can be viewed as alternating between Mark and non-Markan material, and he prefers to pick up alternatively entire blocks rather than isolated units. (Bovon, 2002) We will use the term Markan block to refer to a sequence of verses that are derived from Mark. A verse with a low cosine score, but positioned in the middle of a Markan block, is likely to be derived. Conversely, an isolated verse in the middle of a non-Markan block, even with a high cosine score, is unlikely to be so. The heavier the weight of this feature, the fewer blocks are preferred.","Source Proximity [Prox] When two derived verses are close to one another, their respective source verses are also likely to be close to one another; in other words, derived verses tend to form continuous blocks (Cadbury, 1920). We dene distance as the number of verses separating two verses. For each pair of consecutive target verses, we take the inverse of the distance between their source verses. This feature is thus intended to discourage a derived verse from being aligned with a source verse that shares some lexical similarities by chance, but is far away from other source verses in the Markan block.","Source Order [Order] Whenever Luke follows the Markan narrative in his own gospel he follows painstakingly the Markan order, and hence deviations in the order of the material must therefore be regarded as indications that Luke is not following Mark. (Jeremias, 1966). This feature is a binary function on two consecutive derived verses, indicating whether their source verses are in order. A positive weight for this feature would favor an alignment that respects the order of the source text.","In cases where there are no obvious source verses, such as Luke 9:30-31 in Table 1, the source order 475 and proximity would be disrupted. To mitigate this issue, we allow the Prox and Order features the option of skipping up to two verses within a Markan block in the target text. In our example, Luke 9:30 can skip to 9:32, preserving the source proximity and order between their source verses, Mark 9:4 and 9:5.","Another potential feature is the occurrence of function words characteristic of Luke (Rehkopf, 1959), along the same lines as in the study of the Federalist Papers (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964). These stylistic indicators, however, are unlikely to be as helpful on the sentence level as on the document level. Furthermore, Luke reworks [his sources] to an extent that, within his entire composition, the sources rarely come to light in their original independent form (Bovon, 2002). The signicance of the presence of these indicators, therefore, is diminished. 4.2 Discussion This model is both a simplication of and an extension to the one advocated in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003). On the one hand, we perform no paragraph clustering or mapping before sentence alignment. Ancient texts are rarely divided into paragraphs, nor are they likely to be large enough for statistical methods on clustering. Instead, we rely on the Prox feature to encourage source verses to stay close to each other in the alignment.","On the other hand, our model makes two extensions to the Micro Alignment step in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003). First, we add the Block and Prox features to capture source alternation patterns. Second, we place no hard restrictions on the reordering of the source text, opting instead for a soft preference for maintaining the source order through the Order feature. In contrast, deviation from the source order is limited to ips between two sentences in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), an assumption that is not valid in the Synoptics6",". 4.3 Evaluation Metric Our model can make two types of errors: source error, when it predicts a non-derived target verse to be derived, or vice versa; and alignment error, when","6","For example, Luke 6:12-19 transposes Mark 3:7-12 and Mark 3:13-19 (Bovon, 2002). it correctly predicts a target verse to be derived, but aligns it to the wrong source verse.","Correspondingly, we interpret the output of our model at two levels: as a binary output, i.e., the target verse is either derived or non-derived; or, as an alignment of the target verse to a source verse. We measure the precision and recall of the target verses at both levels, yielding two F-measures, Fsource and Falign7",".","Literary dependencies in the Synoptics are typically expressed as pairs of pericopes (short, coherent passages), for example, Luke 22:47-53 // Mark 14:43-52. Likewise, for Falign, we consider the output correct if the hypothesized source verse lies within the pericope8","."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["This section presents experiments for evaluating our text-reuse model. § 5.1 gives some implementation details. § 5.2 describes the training process, which uses text-reuse hypotheses of two different researchers (Ltrain.B and Ltrain.J ) on the same training text. The two resulting models thus represent two different opinions on how Luke re-used Mark; they then produce two hypotheses on the test text ( L̂test.B and L̂test.J ).","Evaluations of these hypotheses follow. In § 5.3, we compare them with the hypotheses of the same two researchers on the test text (Ltest.B and Ltest.J ). In § 5.3, we compare them with the hypotheses of seven other representative researchers (Neirynck, 1973). Ideally, when the model is trained on a particular researcher’s hypothesis on the train text, its hypothesis on the test text should be closest to the one proposed by the same researcher. 5.1 Implementation Suppose we align the ith","target verse to the kth source verse or to ε.

They are empirically optimized, accurate to 0.01, on the two training hypotheses listed in Table 2, yielding two models, B and J.","Table 3 shows the increasing accuracy of both models in describing the text reuse in Ltrain as more features are incorporated. The Block feature contributes most in predicting the block boundaries, as seen in the jump of Fsource from Sim to +Block. The Prox and Order features substantially improve the alignment, boosting the Falign from +Block to All.","Both models B and J t their respective hypotheses to very high degrees.

Due to their low similarity scores, the model was unable to decide if they belong to the end of the preceding pericope or to the beginning of the following one. 5.3 Test Results The two models trained in § 5.2, B and J, are intended to capture the characteristics of text reuse in Ltrain according to two different researchers. When applied on the test text, Ltest, they produce two hypotheses, L̂test.B and L̂test.J . Ideally, they should be similar to the hypotheses offered by the same researchers (namely, Ltest.B and Ltest.J ), and dissimilar to those by other researchers. We analyze the rst aspect in § 5.3, and the second aspect in § 5.3. Comparison with Bovon and Jeremias","Table 4 shows the output of B and J on Ltest. As more features are added, their output increasingly resemble Ltest.B and Ltest.J , as shown in Table 5.","Both L̂test.B and L̂test.J contain the same number of Markan blocks as the reference hypotheses proposed by the respective scholars. In both cases, the pericope Luke 22:24-30 is correctly assigned as non-derived, despite their relatively high cosine scores. This illustrates the effect of the Block feature.","As for source errors, both B and J mistakenly as-sign Luke 22:15-18 as Markan, attracted by the high similarity score of Luke 22:18 with Mark 14:25. B, in addition, attributes another pericope to Mark where Bovon does not. Despite the penalty of lower source proximity, it wrongly aligned Luke 23:37-38 to Mark 15:2, misled by a specic title of Jesus that happens to be present in both. 477 Chp 22.....................................................................23.....................................................
