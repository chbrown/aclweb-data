This paper proposes a novel iterative reinforcement approach to simultaneously extracting summary and keywords from single document under the assumption that the summary and keywords of a document can be mutually boosted. The approach can naturally make full use of the reinforcement between sentences and keywords by fusing three kinds of relationships between sentences and words, either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both tasks. The corpus-based approach is validated to work almost as well as the knowledge-based approach for computing word semantics."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Text summarization is the process of creating a compressed version of a given document that delivers the main topic of the document. Keyword extraction is the process of extracting a few salient words (or phrases) from a given text and using the words to represent the text. The two tasks are similar in essence because they both aim to extract concise representations for documents. Automatic text summarization and keyword extraction have drawn much attention for a long time because they both are very important for many text applications, including document retrieval, document clustering, etc. For example, keywords of a document can be used for document indexing and thus benefit to improve the performance of document retrieval, and document summary can help to facilitate users to browse the search results and improve users’ search experience.","Text summaries and keywords can be either query-relevant or generic. Generic summary and keyword should reflect the main topics of the document without any additional clues and prior knowledge. In this paper, we focus on generic document summarization and keyword extraction for single documents.","Document summarization and keyword extraction have been widely explored in the natural language processing and information retrieval communities. A series of workshops and conferences on automatic text summarization (e.g. SUMMAC, DUC and NTCIR) have advanced the technology and produced a couple of experimental online systems. In recent years, graph-based ranking algorithms have been successfully used for document summarization (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005; ErKan and Radev, 2004) and keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Such algorithms make use of “voting” or “recommendations” between sentences (or words) to extract sentences (or keywords). Though the two tasks essentially share much in common, most algorithms have been developed particularly for either document summarization or keyword extraction.","Zha (2002) proposes a method for simultaneous keyphrase extraction and text summarization by using only the heterogeneous sentence-to-word relationships. Inspired by this, we aim to take into account all the three kinds of relationships among sentences and words (i.e. the homogeneous relationships between words, the homogeneous relationships between sentences, and the heterogeneous relationships between words and sentences) in 552 a unified framework for both document summarization and keyword extraction. The importance of a sentence (word) is determined by both the importance of related sentences (words) and the importance of related words (sentences). The proposed approach can be considered as a generalized form of previous graph-based ranking algorithms and Zha’s work (Zha, 2002).","In this study, we propose an iterative reinforcement approach to realize the above idea. The proposed approach is evaluated on the DUC2002 dataset and the results demonstrate its effectiveness for both document summarization and keyword extraction. Both knowledge-based approach and corpus-based approach have been investigated to compute word semantics and they both perform very well.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related works. The details of the proposed approach are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents and discusses the evaluation results. Lastly we conclude our paper in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Related Works 2.1 Document Summarization","paragraphs":["Generally speaking, single document summarization methods can be either extraction-based or abstraction-based and we focus on extraction-based methods in this study.","Extraction-based methods usually assign a saliency score to each sentence and then rank the sentences in the document. The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000), etc. Machine learning methods have also been employed to extract sentences, including unsupervised methods (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001) and supervised methods (Kupiec et al., 1995; Conroy and O’Leary, 2001; Amini and Gallinari, 2002; Shen et al., 2007). Other methods include maximal marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Gong and Liu, 2001). In Zha (2002), the mutual reinforcement principle is employed to iteratively extract key phrases and sentences from a document.","Most recently, graph-based ranking methods, including TextRank ((Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005) and LexPageRank (ErKan and Radev, 2004) have been proposed for document summarization. Similar to Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), these methods first build a graph based on the similarity between sentences in a document and then the importance of a sentence is determined by taking into account global information on the graph recursively, rather than relying only on local sentence-specific information. 2.2 Keyword Extraction Keyword (or keyphrase) extraction usually in-volves assigning a saliency score to each candidate keyword by considering various features. Krulwich and Burkey (1996) use heuristics to extract keyphrases from a document. The heuristics are based on syntactic clues, such as the use of italics, the presence of phrases in section headers, and the use of acronyms. Muñoz (1996) uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to discover two-word keyphrases. The algorithm is based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural networks. Steier and Belew (1993) use the mutual information statistics to discover two-word keyphrases.","Supervised machine learning algorithms have been proposed to classify a candidate phrase into either keyphrase or not. GenEx (Turney, 2000) and Kea (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999) are two typical systems, and the most important features for classifying a candidate phrase are the frequency and location of the phrase in the document. More linguistic knowledge (such as syntactic features) has been explored by Hulth (2003). More recently, Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) propose the TextRank model to rank keywords based on the co-occurrence links between words."]},{"title":"3 Iterative Reinforcement Approach 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["The proposed approach is intuitively based on the following assumptions:","Assumption 1: A sentence should be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient sentences, and a word should be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient words.","Assumption 2: A sentence should be salient if it contains many salient words, and a word should be salient if it appears in many salient sentences.","The first assumption is similar to PageRank which makes use of mutual “recommendations” 553 between homogeneous objects to rank objects. The second assumption is similar to HITS if words and sentences are considered as authorities and hubs respectively. In other words, the proposed approach aims to fuse the ideas of PageRank and HITS in a unified framework.","In more detail, given the heterogeneous data points of sentences and words, the following three kinds of relationships are fused in the proposed approach:","SS-Relationship: It reflects the homogeneous relationships between sentences, usually computed by their content similarity.","WW-Relationship: It reflects the homogeneous relationships between words, usually computed by knowledge-based approach or corpus-based approach.","SW-Relationship: It reflects the heterogeneous relationships between sentences and words, usually computed as the relative importance of a word in a sentence.","Figure 1 gives an illustration of the relationships."," Figure 1. Illustration of the Relationships ","The proposed approach first builds three graphs to reflect the above relationships respectively, and then iteratively computes the saliency scores of the sentences and words based on the graphs. Finally, the algorithm converges and each sentence or word gets its saliency score. The sentences with high saliency scores are chosen into the summary, and the words with high saliency scores are combined to produce the keywords. 3.2 Graph Building 3.2.1 Sentence-to-Sentence Graph ( SS-Graph) Given the sentence collection S={si | 1IiIm} of a document, if each sentence is considered as a node, the sentence collection can be modeled as an undirected graph by generating an edge between two sentences if their content similarity exceeds 0, i.e. an undirected link between si and sj (iKj) is constructed and the associated weight is their content similarity. Thus, we construct an undirected graph GSS to reflect the homogeneous relationship between sentences. The content similarity between two sentences is computed with the cosine measure. We use an adjacency matrix U to describe GSS with each entry corresponding to the weight of a link in the graph. U= [Uij]m×m is defined as follows:"]},{"title":"otherwise, j, if iss ssU","paragraphs":["j i j i ij"]},{"title":"0 rr rr","paragraphs":["(1) where i"]},{"title":"s","paragraphs":["and j"]},{"title":"sr","paragraphs":["are the corresponding term vectors of sentences si and sj respectively.

Each synset has a gloss that defines the concept that it represents. Synsets are connected to each other through explicit semantic relations that are defined in WordNet. Many approaches have been proposed to measure semantic relatedness based on WordNet. The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, lch, wup, path, res, lin and jcn (Pedersen et al., 2004). For example, “cat” and “dog” has higher semantic similarity than “cat” and “computer”. In this study, we implement the vector measure to efficiently evaluate the similarities of a large number of word pairs. The vector measure (Patwardhan, 2003) creates a co– occurrence matrix from a corpus made up of the WordNet glosses. Each content word used in a WordNet gloss has an associated context vector. Each gloss is represented by a gloss vector that is the average of all the context vectors of the words found in the gloss. Relatedness between concepts is measured by finding the cosine between a pair of gloss vectors.","Corpus-based measures of word semantic similarity try to identify the degree of similarity between words using information exclusively derived from large corpora. Such measures as mutual information (Turney 2001), latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998), log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) have been proposed to evaluate word semantic similarity based on the co-occurrence information on a large corpus. In this study, we simply choose the mutual information to compute the semantic similarity between word ti and tj as follows: )( )( ) ( log ) ( j i ji ji tp tp ,ttp N ,tt sim    (3) which indicates the degree of statistical dependence between ti and tj. Here, N is the total number of words in the corpus and p(ti) and p(tj) are respectively the probabilities of the occurrences of ti and tj, i.e. count(ti)/N and count(tj)/N, where count(ti) and count(tj) are the frequencies of ti and tj. p(ti, tj) is the probability of the co-occurrence of ti and tj within a window with a predefined size k, i.e. count(ti, tj)/N, where count(ti, tj) is the number of the times ti and tj co-occur within the window.","Similar to the SS-Graph, we can build an undirected graph GWW to reflect the homogeneous relationship between words, in which each node corresponds to a word and the weight associated with the edge between any different word ti and tj is computed by either the WordNet-based vector measure or the corpus-based mutual information measure.

The sentences in each article have been separated and the sentence information was stored into files.","In the experiments, the background corpus for using the mutual information measure to compute word semantics simply consisted of all the documents from DUC2001 to DUC2005, which could be easily expanded by adding more documents.

Then the semantic similarity values between the words were computed.","We used the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) toolkit (i.e.ROUGEeval-1.4.2 in this study) for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. It measured summary quality by counting overlapping units such as the n-gram, word sequences and word pairs between the candidate summary and the reference summary. ROUGE toolkit reported separate scores for 1, 2, 3 and 4-gram, and also for longest common subsequence co-occurrences. Among these different scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) has been shown to agree with human judgment most (Lin and Hovy, 2003). We showed three of the ROUGE metrics in the experimental results: ROUGE-1 (unigram-based), ROUGE-2 (bigram-based), and ROUGE-W (based on weighted longest common subsequence, weight=1.2).","In order to truncate summaries longer than the length limit, we used the “-l” option 2","in the ROUGE toolkit. 4.1.2 Evaluation Results For simplicity, the parameters in the proposed approach are simply set to *=)=0.5, which means that the contributions from sentences and words are equally important. We adopt the WordNet-based vector measure (WN) and the corpus-based mutual information measure (MI) for computing the semantic similarity between words.

The evaluation was conducted on the single word level instead of the multi-word phrase (n-gram) level, in other words, we compared the automatically extracted unigrams (words) and the manually labeled unigrams (words). The reasons were that: 1) there existed partial matching between phrases and it was not trivial to define an accurate measure to evaluate phrase quality; 2) each phrase was in fact com-posed of a few words, so the keyphrases could be obtained by combining the consecutive keywords.","We used 34 documents in the first five document clusters in DUC2002 dataset (i.e. d061-d065).

Each approach returned 10 words with highest saliency scores as the keywords. The extracted 10 words were compared with the manually labeled keywords. The words were converted to their corresponding basic forms based on WordNet before comparison.
