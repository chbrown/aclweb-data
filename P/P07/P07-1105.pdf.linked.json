In formal grammar learning theory it has been shown that learning from “good examples,” or representative examples, is more powerful than learning from all the examples (Freivalds et al., 1993).

The semantic representation is an ontology-based semantic representation. The annotation of the representative examples does not in-clude the entire derivation, unlike most of the existing syntactic treebanks. The aim of the paper is to present the formal aspects of our grammar induction model.","In Section 2, we present a new grammar formalism, called Lexicalized Well-Founded Grammars, a type of constraint-based grammars that combine syntax and semantics. We then turn to the two main results of this paper. In Section 3 we show that our grammars can always be learned from a set of positive representative examples (with no negative examples), and the search space for grammar induction is a complete grammar lattice, which guarantees the uniqueness of the learned grammar. In Section 4, we propose a new computationally efficient model for grammar induction from pairs of utterances and their semantic representations, called Grammar Approximation by Representative Sublanguage (GARS).

First, we present the LWFG induction as an Inductive Logic Programming problem. Second, we present our new relational learning model for LWFG induction, called Grammar Approximation by Representative Sublanguage (GARS). 4.1 Grammar Induction Problem in ILP-setting Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a class of relational learning methods concerned with inducing","first-order Horn clauses from examples and back-","ground knowledge.

We use the “parsing as deduction” technique (Shieber et al., 1995). For all syntagmas we can say in polynomial time whether they belong or not to the grammar language. Thus, using the","","","as generalization model, our grammar induction problem is decidable.  The language of background knowledge,  , is the set of LWFG rules that are already learned together with elementary syntagmas (i.e., corresponding to the lexicon), which are ground atoms (the variables are made constants).  The language of examples,   are syntagmas of the representative sublanguage, which are ground atoms. We only have positive examples.  The hypothesis language,   , is a LWFG lattice whose top element is a conformal grammar, and which preserve the parsing of representative examples. 4.2 Grammar Approximation by Representative Sublanguage Model We have formulated the grammar induction problem in the ILP-setting. The theoretical learning model,","837 called Grammar Approximation by Representative Sublanguage (GARS), can be formulated as follows: Given:","","a representative example set",", lexically con-","sistent (i.e., it allows the construction of the","grammar lattice","element)","","a finite sublanguage",", conformal and thus","unambiguous, which includes the representa-","tive example set,","","",". We called this","sublanguage, the representative sublanguage Learn a grammar",", using the above ILP-learning setting, such that","is unique and","","","","","",".","The hypothesis space is a complete grammar lattice, and thus the uniqueness property of the learned grammar is guaranteed by the learnability theorem (i.e., the learned grammar is the lattice top element). This learnability result extends significantly the class of problems learnable by ILP methods.","The GARS model uses two polynomial algorithms for LWFG learning. In the first algorithm, the learner is presented with an ordered set of representative examples (syntagmas), i.e., the examples are ordered from the simplest to the most complex. The reader should remember that for a LWFG",", there exists a partial ordering among the grammar nonterminals, which allows a total ordering of the representative examples of the grammar",". Thus, in this algorithm, the learner has access to the ordered representative syntagmas when learning the grammar. However, in practice it might be difficult to provide the learner with the “true” order of examples, especially when modeling complex language phenomena. The second algorithm is an iterative algorithm that learns starting from a random order of the representative example set. Due to the property of the search space, both algorithms converge to the same target grammar.","Using ILP and theory revision terminology (Greiner, 1999), we can establish the following analogy: syntagmas (examples) are “labeled queries”, the LWFG lattice is the “space of theories”, and a LWFG in the lattice is “a theory.” The firstalgorithm learns from an “empty theory”, while the second algorithm is an instance of “theory revision”, since the grammar (“theory”) learned during the firstiteration, is then revised, by deleting and adding rules.","Both of these algorithms are cover set algorithms. In the first step the most specific grammar rule is generated from the current representative example. The category name annotated in the representative example gives the name of the lhs nonterminal (predicate invention in ILP terminology), while the robust parser returns the minimum number of chunks that cover the representative example. In the second step this most specificrule is generalized using as performance criterion the number of the examples in","that can be parsed using the candidate grammar rule (hypothesis) together with the previous learned rules. For the full details for these two algorithms, and the proof of their polynomial efficiency, we refer the reader to (Muresan, 2006)."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["A practical advantage of our GARS model is that instead of writing syntactic-semantic grammars by hand (both rules and constraints), we construct just a small annotated treebank - utterances and their semantic molecules. If the grammar needs to be refined, or enhanced, we only refine, or enhance the representative examples/sublanguage, and not the grammar rules and constraints, which would be a more difficulttask.","We have built a framework to test whether our GARS model can learn diverse and complex linguistic phenomena. We have primarily analyzed a set of definitional-type sentences in the medical do-main. The phenomena covered by our learned grammar includes complex noun phrases (including noun compounds, nominalization), prepositional phrases, relative clauses and reduced relative clauses, finite and non-finiteverbal constructions (including, tense, aspect, negation, and subject-verb agreement), copula to be, and raising and control constructions. We also learned rules for wh-questions (including longdistance dependencies). In Figure 3 we show the ontology-level representation of a definition-type sentence obtained using our learned grammar. It includes the treatment of reduced relative clauses, raising construction (tends to persist, where virus is not the argument of tends but the argument of persist), and noun compounds. The learned grammar together with a semantic interpreter targeted to terminological knowledge has been used in an acquisition-query experiment, where the answers are at the concept level (the querying is a graph","838 Hepatitis B is an acute viral hepatitis caused by a virus that tends to persist in the blood serum. #hepatitis #acute #viral #cause #blood #virus sub kind_of th of duration ag prop location th #tend #persist #serum #’HepatitisB’ Figure 3:","A definition-type sentence and its ontology-based representation obtained using our learned LWFG matching problem where the “wh-w ord” matches the answer concept).

Annotating these examples requires knowledge about categories and their attributes. We used 31 categories (nonterminals) and 37 attributes (e.g., category, head, number, person). In this experiment, we chose the representative examples guided by the type of phenomena we wanted to modeled and which occurred in our corpus. We also used 13 lexical categories (i.e., parts of speech).

We have presented a new grammar learning model and showed that the search space is a complete grammar lattice that guarantees the uniqueness of the learned grammar. Starting from these fundamental theoretical results, there are several directions into which to take this research. A first obvious extension is to have probabilistic-LWFGs. For example, the ontology constraints might not be “hard” constraints, but “soft” ones (because language expressions are more or less likely to be used in a certain context). Investigating where to add probabilities (ontology, grammar rules, or both) is part of our planned future work. Another future extension of this work is to investigate how to automatically select the representative examples from an existing treebank."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Johan Bos, Stephen Clark, Mark Steedman, James R.
