They demonstrated very promising results when compared with the state of the art phrase-based system (Och and Ney, 2004) in the NIST 2006 machine translation evaluation 1",". While Galley et al. (2006) and Marcu et al. (2006) put emphasis on target language analysis, Quirk et al. (2005) and Liu et al. (2006) show benefits from modeling the syntax of source language.","1","See http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/","One major problem with linguistically syntax-based models, however, is that tree-to-string rules fail to syntactify non-syntactic phrase pairs because they require a syntax tree fragment over the phrase to be syntactified. Here, we distinguish between syntactic and non-syntactic phrase pairs. By “syntactic” we mean that the phrase pair is subsumed by some syntax tree fragment. The phrase pairs without trees over them are non-syntactic. Marcu et al. (2006) report that approximately 28% of bilingual phrases are non-syntactic on their English-Chinese corpus.","We believe that it is important to make available to syntax-based models all the bilingual phrases that are typically available to phrase-based models. On one hand, phrases have been proven to be a simple and powerful mechanism for machine translation. They excel at capturing translations of short idioms, providing local re-ordering decisions, and incorporating context information straightforwardly. Chiang (2005) shows significant improvement by keeping the strengths of phrases while incorporating syntax into statistical translation. On the other hand, the performance of linguistically syntax-based models can be hindered by making use of only syntactic phrase pairs. Studies reveal that linguistically syntax-based models are sensitive to syntactic analysis (Quirk and Corston-Oliver, 2006), which is still not reliable enough to handle real-world texts due to limited size and domain of training data.","Various solutions are proposed to tackle the problem. Galley et al. (2004) handle non-constituent phrasal translation by traversing the tree upwards until reaches a node that subsumes the phrase. Marcu et al. (2006) argue that this choice is inap-","704 propriate because large applicability contexts are required.","For a non-syntactic phrase pair, Marcu et al. (2006) create a xRS rule headed by a pseudo, non-syntactic nonterminal symbol that subsumes the phrase and corresponding multi-headed syntactic structure; and one sibling xRS rule that explains how the non-syntactic nonterminal symbol can be combined with other genuine nonterminals so as to obtain genuine parse trees. The name of the pseudo nonterminal is designed to reflect how the corresponding rule can be fully realized. However, they neglect alignment consistency when creating sibling rules. In addition, it is hard for the naming mechanism to deal with more complex phenomena.","Liu et al. (2006) treat bilingual phrases as lexicalized TATs (Tree-to-string Alignment Template). A bilingual phrase can be used in decoding if the source phrase is subsumed by the input parse tree. Although this solution does help, only syntactic bilingual phrases are available to the TAT-based model. Moreover, it is problematic to combine the translation probabilities of bilingual phrases and TATs, which are estimated independently.","In this paper, we propose forest-to-string rules which describe the correspondence between multiple parse trees and a string. They can not only capture non-syntactic phrase pairs but also have the capability of generalization. To integrate these rules into tree-to-string translation models, auxiliary rules are introduced to provide a generalization level. As there is no pseudo node or naming mechanism, the integration of forest-to-string rules is flexible, rely-ing only on their root nodes. The forest-to-string and auxiliary rules enable tree-to-string models to derive in a more general way, while the strengths of conventional tree-to-string rules still remain."]},{"title":"2 Forest-to-String Translation Rules","paragraphs":["We define a tree-to-string rule r as a triple ⟨ T̃, S̃, Ã⟩ , which describes the alignment Ã between a source parse tree T̃ = T (f J′","1 ) and a target string S̃ = eI′","1 .
