Take grammatical role (GR) labeling, which is a kind of (shallow) dependency labeling, as an example: chunk-verb-pairs are classified according to a GR (cf. (Buchholz, 1999)). The trials are independent of each other, thus, local decisions are taken such that e.g. a unique GR of a verb might (erroneously) get multiply instantiated etc. Moreover, if there are alternative subcategorization frames of a verb, they must not be confused by mixing up GR from different frames to a non-existent one. Often, a subsequent filter is used to repair such inconsistent solutions. But usually there are alternative solutions, so the demand for an optimal repair arises.","We apply the optimization method Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to (shallow) dependency labeling in order to generate a globally optimized consistent dependency labeling for a given sentence. A maximum entropy classifier, trained on vectors with morphological, syntactic and positional information automatically derived from the TIGER treebank (German), supplies probability vectors that are used as weights in the optimization process. Thus, the probabilities of the classifier do not any longer provide (as usually) the solution (i.e. by picking out the most probable candidate), but count as probabilistic suggestions to a - globally consistent - solution. More formally, the dependency labeling problem is: given a sentence with (i) verbs,  , (ii) NP","and PP chunks1 ,",", label all pairs (   ","",") with a dependency relation (including a class for the null assignment) such that all chunks get attached and for each verb exactly one subcategorization frame is instantiated."]},{"title":"2 Integer Linear Programming","paragraphs":["Integer Linear Programming is the name of a class of constraint satisfaction algorithms which are restricted to a numerical representation of the problem to be solved.

Technically, indicator variables are used to represent attachment decisions. Together with a weight, they form the addend of the objective function.

The model was trained on the TIGER treebank (Brants et al., 2002) with feature vectors stemming from the following set of features: the part of speech tags of the two candidate chunks, the distance between them in chunks, the number of intervening verbs, the number of intervening punctuation marks, person, case and number features, the chunks, the direction of the dependency relation (left or right) and a passive/active voice flag.","The output of the maxent model is for each pair of chunks a probability vector, where each entry represents the probability that the two chunks are related by a particular label (    including  )."]},{"title":"7 Empirical Results","paragraphs":["A 80% training set (32,000 sentences) resulted in about 700,000 vectors, each vector representing either a proper dependency labeling of two chunks, or a null class pairing. The accuracy of the maximum entropy classifierwas 87.46%. Since candidate pairs are generated with only a few restrictions, most pair-ings are null class labelings. They form the majority class and thus get a strong bias. If we evaluate the dependency labels, therefore, the results drop appreciably. The maxent precision then is 62.73% (recall is 85.76%, f-measure is 72.46 %).","Our firstexperiment was devoted to findout how good our ILP approach was given that the correct subcat frame was pre-selected by an oracle.

Actually, (Punyakanok et al., 2004) take into account to some extent verb specific information. They disallow argument types a verb does not “subcate gorize for” by setting an occurrence constraint. However, they do not impose co-occurrence restrictions as we do (allowing for competing subcat frames).","None of the approaches to grammatical role labeling tries to scale up to dependency labeling. Moreover, they suffer from the problem of inconsistent classifier output (e.g. (Buchholz, 1999)). A comparison of the empirical results is difficult,since e.g. the number and type of grammatical/dependency relations differ (the same is true wrt. German dependency parsers, e.g (Foth et al., 2005)). However, our model seeks to integrate the (probabilistic) output of such systems and - in the best case - boosts the results, or at least turn it into a consistent solution."]},{"title":"9 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have introduced a model for shallow dependency labeling where data-driven and theory-driven aspects are combined in a principled way. A classifierprovides empirically justifiedweights, linguistic theory contributes well-motivated global restrictions, both are combined under the regiment of optimization. The empirical results of our approach are promising. However, we have made idealized as-sumptions (small inventory of dependency relations and treebank derived chunks) that clearly must be replaced by a realistic setting in our future work.
