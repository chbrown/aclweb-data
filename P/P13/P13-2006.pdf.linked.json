Instead of utilizing simple similarity measures and their disjoint combinations, our method directly optimizes document and entity representations for a given similarity measure. Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders are first employed to learn an initial document representation in an unsupervised pre-training stage. A supervised fine-tuning stage follows to optimize the representation towards the similarity measure. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets without any manually designed features, even beating complex collective approaches."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Entity linking or disambiguation has recently received much attention in natural language processing community (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Han et al., 2011; Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012). It is an essential first step for succeeding sub-tasks in knowledge base construction (Ji and Grishman, 2011) like populating attribute to entities. Given a sentence with four mentions, “The [[Python]] of [[Delphi]] was a creature with the body of a snake. This creature dwelled on [[Mount Parnassus]], in central [[Greece]].” How can we determine that Python is an earth-dragon in Greece mythology and not the popular programming language, Delphi is not the auto parts supplier, and Mount Parnassus is in Greece, not in Colorado?","A most straightforward method is to compare the context of the mention and the definition of candidate entities. Previous work has explored many ways of measuring the relatedness of context","∗","Corresponding author d and entity e, such as dot product, cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jaccard distance, or more complicated ones (Zheng et al., 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Hoffart et al., 2011; Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007; Zhang et al., 2011). However, these measures are often duplicate or over-specified, because they are disjointly combined and their atomic nature determines that they have no internal structure.","Another line of work focuses on collective disambiguation (Kulkarni et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011). Ambiguous mentions within the same context are resolved simultaneously based on the coherence among decisions. Collective approaches often undergo a non-trivial decision process. In fact, (Ratinov et al., 2011) show that even though global approaches can be improved, local methods based on only similarity sim(d, e) of context d and entity e are hard to beat. This somehow reveals the importance of a good modeling of sim(d, e).","Rather than learning context entity association at word level, topic model based approaches (Kataria et al., 2011; Sen, 2012) can learn it in the semantic space. However, the one-topic-per-entity assumption makes it impossible to scale to large knowledge base, as every entity has a sepa-rate word distribution P (w|e); besides, the training objective does not directly correspond with disambiguation performances.","To overcome disadvantages of previous approaches, we propose a novel method to learn context entity association enriched with deep architecture. Deep neural networks (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007) are built in a hierarchical manner, and allow us to compare context and entity at some higher level abstraction; while at lower levels, general concepts are shared across entities, resulting in compact models. Moreover, to make our model highly correlated with disambiguation performance, our method directly optimizes doc-30 ument and entity representations for a fixed similarity measure. In fact, the underlying representations for computing similarity measure add internal structure to the given similarity measure. Features are learned leveraging large scale annotation of Wikipedia, without any manual design efforts. Furthermore, the learned model is compact compared with topic model based approaches, and can be trained discriminatively without relying on expensive sampling strategy. Despite its simplicity, it beats all complex collective approaches in our experiments. The learned similarity measure can be readily incorporated into any existing collective approaches, which further boosts performance."]},{"title":"2 Learning Representation forContextual Document","paragraphs":["Given a mention string m with its context document d, a list of candidate entities C(m) are generated for m, for each candidate entity ei ∈ C(m), we compute a ranking score sim(dm, ei) indicat-ing how likely m refers to ei. The linking result is e = arg maxei sim(dm, ei).","Our algorithm consists of two stages. In the pre-training stage, Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders are built in an unsupervised layer-wise fashion to discover general concepts encoding d and e. In the supervised fine-tuning stage, the entire network weights are fine-tuned to optimize the similarity score sim(d, e). 2.1 Greedy Layer-wise Pre-training Stacked Auto-encoders (Bengio et al., 2007) is one of the building blocks of deep learning. Assume the input is a vector x, an auto-encoder consists of an encoding process h(x) and a decod-ing process g(h(x)). The goal is to minimize the reconstruction error L(x, g(h(x))), thus retaining maximum information. By repeatedly stacking new auto-encoder on top of previously learned h(x), stacked auto-encoders are obtained. This way we learn multiple levels of representation of input x.","One problem of auto-encoder is that it treats all words equally, no matter it is a function word or a content word. Denoising Auto-encoder (DA) (Vincent et al., 2008) seeks to reconstruct x given a random corruption x̃ of x. DA can capture global structure while ignoring noise as the author shows in image processing. In our case, we input each document as a binary bag-of-words vector (Fig. 1). DA will capture general concepts and ignore noise like function words. By applying masking noise (randomly mask 1 with 0), the model also exhibits a fill-in-the-blank property (Vincent et al., 2010): the missing components must be recovered from partial input. Take “greece” for example, the model must learn to predict it with “python” “mount”, through some hidden unit. The hidden unit may somehow express the concept of Greece mythology. h(x) g(h(x))","python dragon delphicoding ... greece mountsnake phd reconstruct input reconstruct random zero node not reconstruct inactive active, but mask outactive Figure 1: DA and reconstruction sampling.","In order to distinguish between a large number of entities, the vocabulary size must be large enough. This adds considerable computational overhead because the reconstruction process in-volves expensive dense matrix multiplication. Reconstruction sampling keeps the sparse property of matrix multiplication by reconstructing a small subset of original input, with no loss of quality of the learned representation (Dauphin et al., 2011). 2.2 Supervised Fine-tuning This stage we optimize the learned representation (“hidden layer n” in Fig. 2) towards the ranking score sim(d, e), with large scale Wikipedia annotation as supervision. We collect hyperlinks in Wikipedia as our training set {(di, ei, mi)}, where mi is the mention string for candidate generation. The network weights below “hidden layer n” are initialized with the pre-training stage.","Next, we stack another layer on top of the learned representation. The whole network is tuned by the final supervised objective. The reason to stack another layer on top of the learned representation, is to capture problem specific structures. Denote the encoding of d and e as d̂ and ê respectively, after stacking the problem-specific layer, the representation for d is given as f (d) = sigmoid(W × d̂ + b), where W and b are weight and bias term respectively. f (e) follows the same 31 encoding process.","The similarity score of (d, e) pair is defined as the dot product of f (d) and f (e) (Fig. 2): sim(d, e) = Dot(f (d), f (e)) (1) <.,.> f(d) f(e) hidden layer n stacked auto-encoder sim(d,e) Figure 2: Network structure of fine-tuning stage.","Our goal is to rank the correct entity higher than the rest candidates relative to the context of the mention. For each training instance (d, e), we contrast it with one of its negative candidate pair (d, e′","). This gives the pairwise ranking criterion: L(d, e) = max{0, 1 − sim(d, e) + sim(d, e′",")}","(2) Alternatively, we can contrast with all its candidate pairs (d, ei). That is, we raise the similarity score of true pair sim(d, e) and penalize all the rest sim(d, ei). The loss function is defined as negative log of sof tmax function: L(d, e) = − log","exp sim(d, e)","∑ ei∈C(m) exp sim(d, ei) (3) Finally, we seek to minimize the following training objective across all training instances:","L = ∑ d,e L(d, e) (4)","The loss function is closely related to contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), which defines where the positive example takes probability mass from. We find that by penaliz-ing more negative examples, convergence speed can be greatly accelerated. In our experiments, the sof tmax loss function consistently outperforms pairwise ranking loss function, which is taken as our default setting.","However, the sof tmax training criterion adds additional computational overhead when performing mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Although we can use a plain SGD (i.e. mini-batch size is 1), mini-batch SGD is faster to converge and more stable. Assume the mini-batch size is m and the number of candidates is n, a total of m × n forward-backward passes over the network are performed to compute a similarity matrix (Fig. 3), while pairwise ranking criterion only needs 2×m. We address this problem by grouping training pairs with same mention m into one mini-batch {(d, ei)|ei ∈ C(m)}. Observe that if candidate entities overlap, they share the same forward-backward path. Only m + n forward-backward passes are needed for each mini-batch now.","Python (programming language) Pythonidae","Python (mythology) ... ... ... ... ... ... d0","d1 ... dm ... =sim(d,e) e0 e1 e2 en Figure 3: Sharing path within mini-batch.","The re-organization of mini-batch is similar in spirit to Backpropagation Through Structure (BTS) (Goller and Kuchler, 1996). BTS is a variant of the general backpropagation algorithm for structured neural network. In BTS, parent node is computed with its child nodes at the forward pass stage; child node receives gradient as the sum of derivatives from all its parents. Here (Fig. 2), parent node is the score node sim(d, e) and child nodes are f (d) and f (e). In Figure 3, each row shares forward path of f (d) while each column shares forward path of f (e). At backpropagation stage, gradient is summed over each row of score nodes for f (d) and over each column for f (e).","Till now, our input simply consists of bag-of-words binary vector. We can incorporate any handcrafted feature f (d, e) as: sim(d, e) = Dot(f (d), f (e)) + ⃗λ ⃗f (d, e) (5) In fact, we find that with only Dot(f (d), f (e)) as ranking score, the performance is sufficiently good. So we leave this as our future work. 32"]},{"title":"3 Experiments and Analysis","paragraphs":["Training settings: In pre-training stage, input layer has 100,000 units, all hidden layers have 1,000 units with rectifier function max(0, x). Following (Glorot et al., 2011), for the first reconstruction layer, we use sigmoid activation function and cross-entropy error function. For higher reconstruction layers, we use sof tplus (log(1 + exp(x))) as activation function and squared loss as error function. For corruption process, we use a masking noise probability in {0.1,0.4,0.7} for the first layer, a Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 0.1 for higher layers. For reconstruction sampling, we set the reconstruction rate to 0.01. In fine-tuning stage, the final layer has 200 units with sigmoid activation function. The learning rate is set to 1e-3. The mini-batch size is set to 20.","We run all our experiments on a Linux machine with 72GB memory 6 core Xeon CPU. The model is implemented in Python with C extensions, numpy configured with Openblas library. Thanks to reconstruction sampling and refined mini-batch arrangement, it takes about 1 day to converge for pre-training and 3 days for fine-tuning, which is fast given our training set size.","Datasets: We use half of Wikipedia 1","plain text (1̃.5M articles split into sections) for pre-training. We collect a total of 40M hyperlinks grouped by name string m for fine-tuning stage. We holdout a subset of hyperlinks for model selection, and we find that 3 layers network with a higher masking noise rate (0.7) always gives best performance.","We select TAC-KBP 2010 (Ji and Grishman, 2011) dataset for non-collective approaches, and AIDA 2","dataset for collective approaches. For both datasets, we evaluate the non-NIL queries. The TAC-KBP and AIDA testb dataset contains 1020 and 4485 non-NIL queries respectively.","For candidate generation, mention-to-entity dictionary is built by mining Wikipedia structures, following (Cucerzan, 2007). We keep top 30 candidates by prominence P (e|m) for speed consideration. The candidate generation recall are 94.0% and 98.5% for TAC and AIDA respectively.","Analysis: Table 1 shows evaluation results across several best performing systems. (Han et al., 2011) is a collective approach, using Personalized PageRank to propagate evidence between 1 available at http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/, we use","the 20110405 xml dump. 2 available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/aida/ different decisions. To our surprise, our method with only local evidence even beats several complex collective methods with simple word similarity. This reveals the importance of context modeling in semantic space. Collective approaches can improve performance only when local evidence is not confident enough. When embedding our similarity measure sim(d, e) into (Han et al., 2011), we achieve the best results on AIDA.","A close error analysis shows some typical errors due to the lack of prominence feature and name matching feature. Some queries accidentally link to rare candidates and some link to entities with completely different names. We will add these features as mentioned in Eq. 5 in future. We will also add NIL-detection module, which is required by more realistic application scenarios. A first thought is to construct pseudo-NIL with Wikipedia annotations and automatically learn the threshold and feature weight as in (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Kulkarni et al., 2009).
