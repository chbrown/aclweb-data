The general idea is to find those translation model parameters that maximize the probability of the translations of a given source text in a given language model of the target language.","In general, the process of translation has a wide range of phenomena like substitution and reorder-ing of words and phrases. In this paper we only study models that substitute tokens—i.e. words or letters—with a unique substitute. It therefore serves as a very basic case for decipherment and machine translation.","Multiple techniques like integer linear programming (ILP), A∗","search, genetic algorithms, and Bayesian inference have been used to tackle the decipherment problem for 1:1 substitution ciphers. The existence of such a variety of different approaches for solving the same problem already shows that there is no obvious way to solve the problem optimally.","In this paper we show that decipherment of 1:1 substitution ciphers is indeed NP-hard and thus explain why there is no single best approach to the problem. The literature on decipherment provides surprisingly little on the analysis of the complexity of the decipherment problem. This might be related to the fact that a statistical formulation of the decipherment problem has not been analyzed with respect to n-gram language models: This paper shows the close relationship of the decipherment problem to the quadratic assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge the connection between the decipherment problem and the quadratic assignment problem was not known.","The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we review related work. Section 3 introduces the decipherment problem and describes the notation and definitions used throughout this paper. In Section 4 we show that decipherment using a unigram language model corresponds to solving a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP). Section 5 shows the connection between the quadratic assignment problem and decipherment using a bigram language model. Here we also give a reduction of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) to the decipherment problem to highlight the additional complexity in the decipherment problem."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In recent years a large number of publications on the automatic decipherment of substitution ciphers has been published. These publications were mostly dominated by rather heuristic methods and did not provide a theoretical analysis of the complexity of the decipherment problem: (Knight and Yamada, 1999) and (Knight et al., 2006) use the EM algorithm for various decipherment problems, like e.g. word substitution ciphers. (Ravi and Knight, 2008) and (Corlett and Penn, 2010) are able to obtain optimal (i.e. without search errors) decipherments of short cryptograms given an n-615 gram language model. (Ravi and Knight, 2011), (Nuhn et al., 2012), and (Dou and Knight, 2012) treat natural language translation as a deciphering problem including phenomena like reordering, in-sertion, and deletion and are able to train translation models using only monolingual data.","In this paper we will show the connection between the decipherment problem and the linear sum assignment problem as well as the quadratic assignment problem: Regarding the linear sum assignment problem we will make use of definitions presented in (Burkard and ela, 1999). Concern-ing the quadratic assignment problem we will use basic definitions from (Beckmann and Koopmans, 1957). Further (Burkard et al., 1998) gives a good overview over the quadratic assignment problem, including different formulations, solution methods, and an analysis of computational complexity.

Thus a reduction from the decipherment problem to the quadratic assignment problem is trivial. This means that all algorithms capable of solving QAPs can directly be used to solve the decipherment problem.","5.4 Quadratic Assignment Problem ⪯ Decipherment Problem Given QAP (A, B) with integer matrices A = (aij), B = (bij) i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} we construct the count matrix Nff′ and language model matrix Sff′ in such a way that the solution for the decipherment problem implies the solution to the 618 quadratic assignment problem, and vice versa.
