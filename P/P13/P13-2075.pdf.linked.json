In this paper, we propose two MBR-based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches, aiming to re-rank answer candidates from either single and multiple QA systems. The first one re-ranks answer outputs from single QA system based on a traditional MBR model by measuring the correlations between each answer candidates and all the other candidates; while the second one re-ranks the combined answer outputs from multiple QA systems based on a mixture model-based MBR model. The key contribution of this work is that, our MBRAR approaches assume little about QA systems and can be easily applied to QA systems with arbitrary sub-components.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief review of the QA task and describe two types of QA systems with different pros and cons. Section 3 presents two MBRAR approaches that can re-rank the answer candidates from single and multiple QA systems respectively. The relationship between our approach and previous work is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 evaluates our methods on large scale questions selected from two domains (Jeopardy! and Web) and shows promising results. Section 6 concludes this paper."]},{"title":"2 Question Answering 2.1 Overview","paragraphs":["Formally, given an input question Q, a typical factoid QA system generates answers on the basis of the following three procedures:","(1) Question Understanding, which determines the answer type and identifies necessory information contained in Q, such as question focus and lexical answer type (LAT). Such information will be encoded and used by the following procedures.","(2) Passage Retrieval, which formulates queries based on Q, and retrieves passages from offline corpus or online search engines (e.g. Google and Bing).","(3) Answer Extraction, which first extracts answer candidates from retrieved passages, and then ranks them based on specific ranking models. 424 2.2 Two Types of QA Systems We present two different QA sysytems, which are distinguished from three aspects: answer typing, answer generation, and answer ranking.","The 1st","QA system is denoted as Type-Dependent QA engine (TD-QA). In answer typing phase, TD-QA assigns the most possible answer type T̂ to a given question Q based on:","T̂ = argmax T P (T |Q) P (T |Q) is a probabilistic answer-typing model that is similar to Pinchak and Lin (2006)’s work. In answer generation phase, TD-QA uses a CRF-based Named Entity Recognizer to detect all named entities contained in retrieved passages with the type T̂ , and treat them as the answer candidate space H(Q): H(Q) = ⋃ k Ak In answer ranking phase, the decision rule described below is used to rank answer candidate space H(Q):","Â = argmax A∈H(Q) P (A| T̂ , Q)","= argmax A∈H(Q) ∑ i λi · hi(A, T̂ , Q) where {hi(·)} is a set of ranking features that measure the correctness of answer candidates, and {λi} are their corresponding feature weights.","The 2ed","QA system is denoted as Type-Independent QA engine (TI-QA). In answer typing phase, TI-QA assigns top N , instead of the best, answer types TN (Q) for each question Q. The probability of each type candidate is maintained as well. In answer generation phase, TI-QA extracts all answer candidates from retrieved passages based on answer types in TN (Q), by the same NER used in TD-QA. In answer ranking phase, TI-QA considers the probabilities of different answer types as well:","Â = argmax A∈H(Q) P (A|Q)","= argmax A∈H(Q) ∑ T ∈TN (Q) P (A|T, Q) · P (T |Q)","On one hand, TD-QA can achieve relative high ranking precision, as using a unique answer type greatly reduces the size of the candidate list for ranking. However, as the answer-typing model is far from perfect, if prediction errors happen, TD-QA can no longer give correct answers at all.","On the other hand, TI-QA can provide higher answer coverage, as it can extract answer candidates with multiple answer types. However, more answer candidates with different types bring more difficulties to the answer ranking model to rank the correct answer to the top 1 position. So the ranking precision of TI-QA is not as good as TD-QA."]},{"title":"3 MBR-based Answering Re-ranking 3.1 MBRAR for Single QA System","paragraphs":["MBR decoding (Bickel and Doksum, 1977) aims to select the hypothesis that minimizes the expected loss in classification. In MBRAR, we replace the loss function with the gain function that measure the correlation between answer candidates. Thus, the objective of the MBRAR approach for single QA system is to find the answer candidate that is most supported by other candidates under QA system’s distribution, which can be formally written as:","Â = argmax A∈H(Q) ∑ Ak∈H(Q) G(A, Ak) · P (Ak|H(Q))","P (Ak|H(Q)) denotes the hypothesis distribution estimated on the search space H(Q) based on the following log-linear formulation: P (Ak|H(Q)) = exp(β · P (Ak|Q))","∑ A′","∈H exp(β · P (A′ |Q)) P (Ak|Q) is the posterior probability of the answer candidate Ak based on QA system’s ranking model, β is a scaling factor which controls the distribution P (·) sharp (when β > 1) or smooth (when β < 1).","G(A, Ak) is the gain function that denotes the degree of how Ak supports A. This function can be further expanded as a weighted combination of a set of correlation features as:","∑","j λj · hj(A, Ak).","The following correlation features are used in","G(·): • answer-level n-gram correlation feature: hanswer(A, Ak) = ∑ ω∈A #ω(Ak) where ω denotes an n-gram in A, #ω(Ak) denotes the number of times that ω occurs in Ak. 425 • passage-level n-gram correlation feature: hpassage(A, Ak) = ∑ ω∈PA #ω(PAk ) where PA denotes passages from which A are extracted. This feature measures the degree of Ak supports A from the context perspective. • answer-type agreement feature: htype(A, Ak) = δ(TA, TAi) δ(TA, TAk ) denotes an indicator function that equals to 1 when the answer types of A and Ak are the same, and 0 otherwise.","• answer-length feature that is used to penalize long answer candidates.","• averaged passage-length feature that is used to penalize passages with a long averaged length. 3.2 MBRAR for Multiple QA Systems Aiming to apply MBRAR to the outputs from N QA systems, we modify MBR components as follows.","First, the hypothesis space HC(Q) is built by merging answer candidates of multiple QA systems: HC(Q) = ⋃ i Hi(Q)","Second, the hypothesis distribution is defined as a probability distribution over the combined search space of N component QA systems and computed as a weighted sum of component model distributions: P (A|HC(Q)) = N∑ i=1 αi · P (A|Hi(Q)) where α1, ..., αN are coefficients with following constraints holds1",": 0 ≤ α i ≤ 1 and","∑N","i=1 αi = 1,","P (A|Hi(Q)) is the posterior probability of A esti-","mated on the ith","QA system’s search space Hi(Q). Third, the features used in the gain function G(·)","can be grouped into two categories, including: • system-independent features, which includes all features described in Section 3.1 for single system based MBRAR method; 1 For simplicity, the coefficients are equally set: αi =","1/N.","• system-dependent features, which measure the correctness of answer candidates based on information provided by multiple QA systems:","– system indicator feature hsys(A, QAi), which equals to 1 when A is generated by the ith","system QA i, and 0 otherwise;","– system ranking feature hrank(A, QAi), which equals to the reciprocal of the rank position of A predicted by QAi. If QAi fails to generate A, then it equals to 0;","– ensemble feature hcons(A), which equals to 1 when A can be generated by all individual QA system, and 0 other-wise.","Thus, the MBRAR for multiple QA systems can be finally formulated as follows:","Â = argmax A∈HC(Q) ∑ Ai∈HC(Q) G(A, Ai) · P (Ai|HC(Q)) where the training process of the weights in the gain function is carried out with Ranking SVM2 based on the method described in Verberne et al. (2009)."]},{"title":"4 Related Work","paragraphs":["MBR decoding have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks, e.g. machine translation, parsing, speech recognition and etc. As far as we know, this is the first work that applies MBR principle to QA.","Yaman et al. (2009) proposed a classifica-tion based method for QA task that jointly uses multiple 5-W QA systems by selecting one optimal QA system for each question.
