SCFs describe the syntactic realization of verbal predicate-argument structure, SPs capture the semantic preferences verbs have for their arguments and VCs in the Levin (1993) tradition provide a shared level of abstraction for verbs that share many aspects of their syntactic and semantic be-havior.","These three of types of information have proved useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP)","1","The source code of the clustering algorithms and evaluation is submitted with this paper and will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper. tasks which require information about predicate-argument structure, including parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Cholakov and van Noord, 2010; Zhou et al., 2011), semantic role labeling (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Dang, 2004; Bharati et al., 2005; Moschitti and Basili, 2005; zap, 2008; Zapirain et al., 2009), and word sense disambiguation (Dang, 2004; Thater et al., 2010; Ó Séaghdha and Korhonen, 2011), among many others.","Because lexical information is highly sensitive to domain variation, approaches that can identify VCs, SCFs and SPs in corpora have become in-creasingly popular, e.g. (O’Donovan et al., 2005; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Erk, 2007; Preiss et al., 2007; Van de Cruys, 2009; Reisinger and Mooney, 2011; Sun and Korhonen, 2011; Lippincott et al., 2012).","The task of SCF induction involves identifying the arguments of a verb lemma and generalizing about the frames (i.e. SCFs) taken by the verb, where each frame includes a number of arguments and their syntactic types. For example, in (1), the verb ”show” takes the frame SUBJ-DOBJ-CCOMP (subject, direct object, and clausal complement).","(1) [A number of SCF acquisition papers]SUBJ [show]VERB [their readers]DOBJ [which features are most valuable for the acquisition process]CCOMP.","SP induction involves identifying and classify-ing the lexical items in a given argument slot. In sentence (2), for example, the verb ”show” takes the frame SUBJ-DOBJ. The direct object in this frame is likely to be inanimate. (2) [Most SCF and SP acquisition papers]SUBJ, 862 [show]VERB [no evidence to the usefulness of joint learning leaning for these tasks]DOBJ.","Finally, VC induction involves clustering together verbs with similar meaning, reflected in similar SCFs and SPs. For example, ”show” in the above examples could get clustered together with ”demonstrate” and ”indicate”.","Because these challenging tasks capture complementary information about predicate argument structure, they should be able to inform and support each other. Recently, researchers have be-gun to investigate the benefits of their joint learning. Schulte im Walde et al. (2008) integrated SCF and VC acquisition and used it for WordNet-based SP classification. Ó Séaghdha (2010) presented a “dual-topic” model for SPs that induces also verb clusters. Both works reported SP evaluation with promising results. Lippincott et al. (2012) presented a joint model for inducing simple syntactic frames and VCs. They reported high accuracy results on VCs. de Cruys et al. (2012) introduced a joint model for SCF and SP acquisition. They evaluated both the SCFs and SPs, obtaining reasonable result on both tasks.","In this paper, we present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of the three types of information - SCFs, SPs and VCs. Our framework is based on Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs, (Kulesza, 2012; Kulesza and Taskar, 2012c)), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets.","We first show how individual-task DPP kernel matrices can be naturally combined to construct a joint kernel. We use this to construct a joint SCF-SP kernel. We then introduce a novel clustering algorithm based on iterative DPP sampling which can (contrary to other probabilistic frameworks such as Markov random fields) be performed both accurately and efficiently. When defined over the joint SCF and SP kernel, this new algorithm can be used to induce VCs that are valuable for both tasks.","We also contribute by evaluating the value of the clusters induced by our model for the acquisition of the three information types. Our evaluation against a well-known VC gold standard shows that our clustering model outperforms the state-of-the-art verb clustering algorithm of Sun and Korhonen (2009), in our setup where no manually created SCF or SP data is available. Our evaluation against a well-known SCF gold standard and in the context of SP disambiguation tasks shows results that are superior to strong baselines, demonstrating the benefit our approach."]},{"title":"2 Previous Work SCF acquisition","paragraphs":["Most current works induce SCFs from the output of an unlexicalized parser (i.e. a parser trained without SCF annotations) using hand-written rules (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen, 2002; Preiss et al., 2007) or grammatical relation (GR) co-occurrence statistics (O’Donovan et al., 2005; Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006; Ienco et al., 2008; Messiant et al., 2008; Lenci et al., 2008; Altamirano and Alonso i Alemany, 2010; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2010).","Only a handful of SCF induction works are unsupervised. Carroll and Rooth (1996) applied an EM-based approach to a context-free grammar based model, Dkebowski (2009) used point-wise co-occurrence of arguments in parsed Polish data and Lippincott et al. (2012) presented a Bayesian network model for syntactic frame induction that identifies SPs on argument types. However, the frames induced by Lippincott et al. (2012) do not capture sets of arguments for verbs so are far simpler than traditional SCFs.","Current approaches to SCF acquisition suffer from lack of semantic information which is needed to guide the purely syntax-driven acquisition process. Previous works have showed the benefit of hand-coded semantic information in SCF acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). We will address this problem in an unsupervised way: our approach is to consider SCFs together with semantic SPs through VCs which generalize over syntactically and semantically similar verbs.","SP acquisition Considerable research has been conducted on SP acquisition, with a variety of unsupervised models proposed for this task that use no hand-crafted information during training. The latter approaches include latent variable models ( Ó Séaghdha, 2010; Ritter and Etzioni, 2010; Reisinger and Mooney, 2011), distributional similarity methods (Bhagat et al., 2007; Basili et al., 2007; Erk, 2007) and methods based on non-negative tensor factorization (Van de Cruys, 2009). These works use a variety of linguistic features in the acquisition process but none of them 863 integrates the three information types covered in our work.","Verb clustering A variety of VC approaches have been proposed in the literature. These include syntactic, semantic and mixed syntactic-semantic classifications (Grishman et al., 1994; Miller, 1995; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Schuler, 2006; Hovy et al., 2006). We focus on Levin style classes (Levin, 1993) which are defined in terms of diathesis alternations and capture generalizations over a range of syntactic and semantic properties. Previous unsupervised VC acquisition approaches clustered a variety of linguistic features using different (e.g. K-means and spectral) algorithms (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; Korhonen et al., 2008; Sun and Korhonen, 2009; Vlachos et al., 2009; Sun and Korhonen, 2011). The linguistic features included SCFs and SPs, but these were induced separately and then feeded as features to the clustering algorithm. Our framework combines together SCF-motivated and SP-motivated kernel matrices , and uses the joint kernel to induce verb clusters which are likely to be highly relevant for both tasks. Importantly, no manual or automatic system for SCF or SP acquisition has been utilized when constructing the kernel matrices, we only consider features extracted from the output of an unlexicalized parser. Our approach hence provides a framework for acquiring valuable information for the three tasks together.","Joint Modeling A small number of works have recently investigated joint approaches to SCFs, SPs and VCs. Each of them has addressed only a subset of the tasks and all but one have evaluated the performance in the context of one task only. Ó Séaghdha (2010) presented a “dual-topic” model for SPs that induces VCs, reporting evaluation of SPs only. Lippincott et al. (2012) presented a Bayesian network model for syntactic frame (rather than full SCF) induction that induces VCs. Only VCs are evaluated. de Cruys et al. (2012) presented a joint unsupervised model of SCF and SP acquisition based on non-negative tensor factorization. Both SCFs and SPs were evaluated. Finally, the model of Schulte im Walde et al. (2008) addresses the three types of information but SP parameters are estimated with a WordNet based method and only the SPs are evaluated. Although evaluation of these recent joint models has been partial, the results have been encouraging and further motivate the development of a framework that acquires the three types of information together."]},{"title":"3 The Unified Framework","paragraphs":["In this section we present our unified framework. Our idea is to utilize DPPs for verb clustering that informs both SCF and SP acquisition. DPPs define a probability distribution over the possible subsets of a given set. These models assign higher probability mass to subsets that are both high quality and diverse.","Our novel clustering algorithm makes use of three DPP properties that are appealing for our purpose: (1) The existence of efficient sampling algorithms for these models, which enable tractable sampling of high quality and diverse verb subsets; (2) Such verb subsets form natural high quality seeds for hierarchical clustering; and (3) Given individual-task DPP kernel matrices there are various simple and natural ways to combine them into a new DPP kernel matrix.","Individual task DPP kernels represent (i) the quality of a data point (verb) as its average feature-based similarity with the other points in the data set and (ii) the divergence between a pair of points as the inverse similarity between them. For different tasks, different feature sets are used for the kernel construction. The high quality and diverse subsets sampled from the DPP model are considered good cluster seeds as they are likely to be relatively uniformly spread and to provide good coverage of the data set. The algorithm induces an hierarchical clustering, which is particularly suitable for semantic tasks, where a set of clusters that share a parent consists of pure members (i.e. most of the points in each cluster member belong to the same gold cluster) and together provide good coverage of the verb space.","After a brief description of the Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) framework (Section 3.1), we discuss the construction of the joint DPP kernel, given a kernel for each individual task, In section 3.3 we present the DPP-Cluster clustering algorithm. 3.1 Determinantal Point Processes Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion that offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. Recently (Kulesza, 2012; Kulesza and Taskar, 864 2012c) introduced them to the machine learning community and demonstrated their usefulness for a variety of tasks including document summariza-tion, image search, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images and video and automatically building timelines of important news stories (Kulesza and Taskar, 2010; Kulesza and Taskar, 2012a; Gillenwater et al., 2012; Kulesza and Taskar, 2012b). Below we provide a brief description of the framework, a comprehensive survey can be found in (Kulesza and Taskar, 2012c).","Given a set of items Y = {y1, . . . , yN }, a DPP P defines a probability measure on the set of all subsets of Y, 2Y",". Kulesza and Taskar (2012c) restricted their discussion of DDPs to L-ensembles, where the probability of a subset Y ∈ Y is defined through a positive semi-definite matrix L indexed by the elements of Y: PL(Y = Y ) = det(LY )","∑ Y ⊆Y det(LY ) =","det(LY )","det(L + I)","(1) Where I is the N × N identity matrix and","det(Lφ) = 1. Since L is positive semi-definite, it","can be decomposed to L = BT","B. This allows the","construction of an intuitively interpretable model","where each column Bi is the product of a quality","term qi ∈ R+","and a vector of (normalized) diver-","sity features φi ∈ RD",", ||φ","i|| = 1. In this model, qi measures an inherent quality of the i − th item in Y while φT","i φj ∈ [−1, 1] is a similarity measure between items i and j. With this representation we can write:","Lij = qiφT i φjqj (2)","Sij = φT i φj = Lij","√ LiiLjj (3) PL(Y = Y ) ∝ ( ∏ i∈Y q2 i )det(SY ) (4) It can be shown that the first term in equation 4 increases with the quality of the selected items, and the second term increases with their diversity. As a consequence, this distribution places most of its weight on sets that are both high quality and diverse.","Although the number of possible realizations of Y is exponential in N , many inference procedures can be performed accurately and efficiently (i.e. in polynomial time which is very short in practice). In particular, sampling, which NP-hard for alternative models such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs), is efficient, theoretically and practically, for DPPs. 3.2 Constructing a Joint Kernel Matrix DPPs are particularly suitable for joint modeling as they come with various simple and intuitive ways to combine individual model kernel matrices into a joint kernel. This stems from the fact that every positive-semidefinite matrix forms a legal DPP kernel (equation 1). Given individual model DPP kernels, we would therefore like to combine them into a positive-semidefinite matrix.","While there are various ways to construct a positive-semidefinite matrix from two positive-semidefinite matrices – for example, by taking their sum – in this work we are motivated by the product of experts approach (Hinton, 2002), reasoning that high quality assignments according to a product of models have to be of high quality according to each individual model, and sick for a product combination. 2","In practice we construct the joint kernel in the following way. We build on the aforementioned property that a matrix L is positive semi-definite if f L = BT","B. Given two DPPs, PL1 defined by","L1","= AT 1 A1 and PL2 defined byL2","= AT","2 A2, we","construct the joint kernel L12 :","L12","= L1","L2 L2","L1","= CT","C (5)","Where C = AT","2 A2AT","1 A1 and CT","=","AT 1 A1AT","2 A2. 3.3 Clustering Algorithm Algorithm (1) and Figure (1) provide a pseudocode of the algorithm and an example output. Below is a detailed description.","Features Our algorithm builds two DPP kernel matrices (the GenKernelM atrix function), in which the rows and columns correspond to the verbs in the data set, such that the (i, j)-th entry corresponds to verbs number i and j. Following equations 2 and 3 one matrix is built for SCF and one for SP, and they are then combined into the","2","Note that we do not take a product of the individual models but only of their kernel matrices. Yet, if we construct the joint matrix by a multiplication then it follows from a simple generalization of the Cauchy-Binet formula that its principle minors, which define the subset probabilities (equation 1), are a sum of multiplications of the principle minors of the individual model kernels. Still, we do not have guarantees that our choice of kernel combination is the right one. We leave this for future research. 865 joint kernel matrix (the GenJ ointM at function) following equation 5. Each kernel matrix requires a proper feature representation φ and quality score q.","In both kernels we represent a verb by the counts of the grammatical relations (GRs) it participates in. In the SCF kernel a GR is represented by the GR type and the POS tags of the verb and its arguments. In the SP kernels the GRs are represented by the POS tags of the verb and its arguments as well as by the argument head word. Based on this feature representation, the similarity (opposite divergence) is encoded to the model by equation 3 as the dot product between the normalized feature vectors. The quality score qi of the i-th verb is the average similarity of this verb with the other verbs in the dataset.","Cluster set construction In its while loop, the algorithm iteratively generates fixed-size cluster sets such that each data point belongs to exactly one cluster in one set. These cluster sets form the leaf level of the tree in Figure (1). It does so by extracting the T highest probability K-point samples from a set of M subsets, each of which sampled from the joint DPP model, and clustering them by the cluster procedure. The sampling is done by the K-DPP sampling process ((Kulesza and Taskar, 2012c), page 62) 3",".","The cluster procedure first seeds a K-cluster set with the highest probability sample. Then, it gradually extends the clusters by iteratively mapping the samples, in decreasing order of probability, to the existing clusters (the m1M apping function). Mapping is done by attaching every point in the mapped subset to its closet cluster, where the distance between a point and the cluster is the maximum over the distances between the point and each of the points in the cluster. The mapping is many-to-one, that is, multiple points in the subset can be assigned to the same cluster.","Based on the DPP properties, the higher the probability of a sampled subset, the more likely it is to consist of distinct points that provide a good coverage of the verb set. By iteratively extending the clusters with high probability subsets, we thus expect each cluster set to consist of clusters that demonstrate these properties.","3","K-DPP is a DPP conditioned on the sample size. As shown in ((Kulesza and Taskar, 2012c), Section 2.4.3) this conditional distribution is also a DPP. We could have obtained samples of size K by sampling the DPP and rejecting samples of other sizes but this would have been slower.

Each set is augmented with the number of points (left number) and clusters (right number) it includes. The iterative DPP-samples clustering (the While loop) generates the lowest level of the tree, by dividing the data set into cluster sets, each of which consists of K clusters. Each point in the data set belongs to exactly one cluster in exactly one set. The agglomerative clustering then iteratively combines cluster sets such that in each iteration two sets are combined to one set with K clusters.","Agglomerative Clustering Finally, the AgglomerativeClustering function builds a hierarchy of cluster sets, by iteratively combining cluster set pairs. In each iteration it computes the similarity between any such pair, defined to be the lowest similarity between their cluster members, which is in turn defined to be the lowest cosine similarity between their point members. The most similar cluster sets are combined such that each of the clusters in one set is mapped to its most similar cluster in the other set. In this step the algorithm generates data partitions at different granularity levels from finest (from the iterative sampling step) to the coarsest set (generated by the last agglomerative clustering iteration and consisting of exactly K clusters). This property is useful as the optimal level of generalization may be task dependent."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation Data sets and gold standards","paragraphs":["We evaluated the SCFs and verb clusters on gold standard datasets.

These are the Most Frequent SCF (O’Donovan et al., 2005) which uniformly assigns to all verbs the two most frequent SCFs in general language, transitive (SUBJ-DOBJ) and intransitive (SUBJ) (and results in poor F-score), and a filtering that removes frames with low corpus frequencies (which results in low recall even when trying to provide the maximum recall for a given precision level). The task we address is therefore to improve the precision of the corpus statistics baseline in a way that does not substantially harm the F-score.","To remedy this imbalance, we apply a cluster based filtering method on top of the maximum-recall frequency filter. This filter excludes a candidate frame from a verb’s lexicon only if it meets the frequency filter criterion and appears in no more than N other members of the cluster of the verb in question. The filter utilizes the clustering produced by the seventh to last iteration of DPP-cluster that contains seven clusters with approximately 30 members each. Such clustering should provide a good generalization level for the task.","We report results for moderate as well as aggressive filtering (N = 3 and N = 7 respectively). Table 3 clearly demonstrates that cluster based filtering (DPP-cluster and AC) is the only method that provides a good balance between the recall and the precision of the SCF lexicon. Moreover, the lexicon induced by this method includes a substantially higher number of frames per verb compared to the other filtering methods. While both AC and DPP-cluster still prefer recall to precision, DPP-cluster does so to a smaller extent 8",".

AF is the average number of frames per verb. All methods except from cluster based filtering (DPP-cluster and AC) induce lexicons with strong recall/precision imbalance. Cluster based filtering keeps a larger number of frames in the lexicon compared to the frequency thresholding baseline, while keeping similar F-score levels. DPP-cluster provides better recall/precision balance than AC. appears only in the test corpus and a pair (ṽ, n) that appears neither in the test nor in the training corpus. Note, however, that this test only evaluates the capability of a model to distinguish a correct unseen verb-argument pair from an incorrect one, but not its capability to identify erroneous pairs when no alternative pair is presented. This last property can strongly affect the precision of the model.","We therefore propose to measure both aspects of the SP task by computing both the recall and the precision between the list of possible arguments a verb can take according to the model and the corresponding test corpus list 9",".","We evaluate the value of our clustering for SP acquisition in the particularly challenging scenario of domain adaptation. For each of the verbs in our set we induce a list of possible noun direct objects from the BNC corpus and an equivalent list from the North American News Text (NANT) corpus. Following previous work (e.g. (de Cruys et al., 2012)) arguments are identified using a parser (RASP in our case). Using the verb clusters we create a filtered version of the BNC argument lexicon which includes in the noun argument list of a verb only those nouns that appear in the BNC as arguments of that verb and of one of its cluster members. For each verb we then compare the filtered as well as the non-filtered BNC induced lexicon to the NANT lexicon by computing the average recall and precision between the argument lists","9","In principle these measures can take into account the probability assigned by the model to each argument and the corresponding test corpus frequency. In this work we compute probability-ignorant scores and keep more sophisticated evaluations for future research. and then report the average scores across all verbs. We compare to a baseline which maintains only noun arguments that appear at least twice in BNC 10",". As a final measure of performance we compute the ratio between the reduction in precision error (i.e. pmodel−pbaseline","100−pbaseline ) and the increase in recall error ( rbaseline−rmodel","100−rmodel ).","Table 2 presents the results for verbs with up to 200, 600 and 1000 noun arguments in the training data. In all cases, the relative error reduction of the DPP cluster filter is substantially higher than that of the frequency baseline. Note that for this task the baseline AC clusters are of low quality which is reflects by an error reduction ratio of up to 0.5."]},{"title":"5 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper we have presented the first unified framework for the induction of verb clusters, subcategorization frames and selectional preferences from corpus data. Our key idea is to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs and to use the resulting clusters for SCF and SP induction. To implement our idea we presented a novel method which involves constructing a product DPP model for SCFs and SPs and introduced a new algorithm that utilizes the efficient DPP sampling algorithms to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. The induced clusters performed well in evaluation against a VerbNet -based gold standard and proved useful in improving the quality of SCFs and SPs over strong baselines.","Our results demonstrate the benefits of a unified framework for acquiring lexical informa-10 we experimented with other threshold values for this","baseline but the recall in those case becomes very low. 869 tion about different aspects of verbal predicate-argument structure. Not only the acquisition of different types information (syntactic and semantic) can support and inform each other, but also a unified framework can be useful for NLP tasks and applications which require rich information about predicate-argument structure. In future work we plan to apply our approach on larger scale data sets and gold standards and to evaluate it in different domains, languages and in the context of NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing and SRL.","In addition, in our current framework SCF and SP information is used for clustering which is in turn used to improve SCF and SP quality. At this stage no further information flows from the SCF and SP models to the clustering model. A natural extension of our unified framework is to construct a joint model in which the predictions for all three tasks inform each other at all stages of the predic-tion process."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The work in this paper was funded by the Royal Society University Research Fellowship (UK)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Ivana Romina Altamirano and Laura Alonso i Ale-many. 2010.
