Under a classical Aristotelian perspective, plot is supreme;1","modern theoretical dramatists and screenwriters disagree.2","Without addressing this debate directly, much computational work on narrative has focused on learning the sequence of events by which a story is defined; in this tradition we might situate seminal work on learning procedural scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977; Regneri et al., 2010), narrative chains (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008), and plot structure (Finlayson, 2011; Elsner, 2012; McIntyre and Lapata, 2010; Goyal et al., 2010).","We present a complementary perspective that addresses the importance of character in defining","1","“Dramatic action . . . is not with a view to the representa-tion of character: character comes in as subsidiary to the actions . . . The Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul of a tragedy: Character holds the second place.” Poetics I.VI (Aristotle, 335 BCE).","2","“Aristotle was mistaken in his time, and our scholars are mistaken today when they accept his rulings concerning character. Character was a great factor in Aristotle’s time, and no fine play ever was or ever will be written without it” (Egri, 1946, p. 94); “What the reader wants is fascinating, complex characters” (McKee, 1997, 100). a story. Our testbed is film. Under this perspective, a character’s latent internal nature drives the action we observe. Articulating narrative in this way leads to a natural generative story: we first decide that we’re going to make a particular kind of movie (e.g., a romantic comedy), then decide on a set of character types, or personas, we want to see involved (the PROTAGONIST, the LOVE INTER-EST, the BEST FRIEND). After picking this set, we fill out each of these roles with specific attributes (female, 28 years old, klutzy); with this cast of characters, we then sketch out the set of events by which they interact with the world and with each other (runs but just misses the train, spills coffee on her boss) – through which they reveal to the viewer those inherent qualities about themselves. This work is inspired by past approaches that in-fer typed semantic arguments along with narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Regneri et al., 2011), but seeks a more holistic view of character, one that learns from stereotypical attributes in addition to plot events. This work also naturally draws on earlier work on the unsupervised learning of verbal arguments and semantic roles (Pereira et al., 1993; Grenager and Manning, 2006; Titov and Klementiev, 2012) and unsupervised relation discovery (Yao et al., 2011).","This character-centric perspective leads to two natural questions. First, can we learn what those standard personas are by how individual characters (who instantiate those types) are portrayed? Second, can we learn the set of attributes and actions by which we recognize those common types? How do we, as viewers, recognize a VILLIAN?","At its most extreme, this perspective reduces to learning the grand archetypes of Joseph Campbell (1949) or Carl Jung (1981), such as the HERO or TRICKSTER. We seek, however, a more fine-grained set that includes not only archetypes, but stereotypes as well – characters defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be representative of 352 a class. This work offers a data-driven method for answering these questions, presenting two probablistic generative models for inferring latent character types.","This is the first work that attempts to learn explicit character personas in detail; as such, we present a new dataset for character type induction in film and a benchmark testbed for evaluating future work.3"]},{"title":"2 Data 2.1 Text","paragraphs":["Our primary source of data comes from 42,306 movie plot summaries extracted from the November 2, 2012 dump of English-language Wikipedia.4","These summaries, which have a median length of approximately 176 words,5 contain a concise synopsis of the movie’s events, along with implicit descriptions of the characters (e.g., “rebel leader Princess Leia,” “evil lord Darth Vader”).

With this structured representation, we extract linguistic features for each character, looking at immediate verb governors and attribute syntactic dependencies to all of the entity’s mention headwords, extracted from the typed dependency tuples produced by the parser; we refer to “CCprocessed” syntactic relations described in de Marneffe and Manning (2008):","• Agent verbs.

For every character we thus extract a bag of (r, w) tuples, where w is the word lemma and r is one of {agent verb, patient verb, attribute} as identified by the above rules. 2.2 Metadata Our second source of information consists of character and movie metadata drawn from the November 4, 2012 dump of Freebase.7","At the movie level, this includes data on the language, country, release date and detailed genre (365 non-mutually exclusive categories, including “Epic Western,” “Revenge,” and “Hip Hop Movies”). Many of the characters in movies are also associated with the actors who play them; since many actors also have detailed biographical information, we can ground the characters in what we know of those real people – including their gender and estimated age at the time of the movie’s release (the difference between the release date of the movie and the actor’s date of birth).","Across all 42,306 movies, entities average 3.4 agent events, 2.0 patient events, and 2.1 attributes. For all experiments described below, we restrict our dataset to only those events that are among the 1,000 most frequent overall, and only characters with at least 3 events. 120,345 characters meet this criterion; of these, 33,559 can be matched to Freebase actors with a specified gender, and 29,802 can be matched to actors with a given date of birth. Of all actors in the Freebase data whose age is given, the average age at the time of movie is 37.9 (standard deviation 14.1); of all actors whose gender is known, 66.7% are male.8","The age distribution is strongly bimodal when conditioning on gender: the average age of a female actress at the time of a movie’s release is 33.0 (s.d. 13.4), while that of a male actor is 40.5 (s.d. 13.7)."]},{"title":"3 Personas","paragraphs":["One way we recognize a character’s latent type is by observing the stereotypical actions they 7","http://download.freebase.com/ datadumps/ 8","Whether this extreme 2:1 male/female ratio reflects an inherent bias in film or a bias in attention on Freebase (or Wikipedia, on which it draws) is an interesting research question in itself. 353 perform (e.g., VILLAINS strangle), the actions done to them (e.g., VILLAINS are foiled and arrested) and the words by which they are described (VILLAINS are evil). To capture this intuition, we define a persona as a set of three typed distributions: one for the words for which the character is the agent, one for which it is the patient, and one for words by which the character is attributively modified. Each distribution ranges over a fixed set of latent word classes, or topics. Figure 1 illustrates this definition for a toy example: a ZOMBIE persona may be characterized as being the agent of primarily eating and killing actions, the patient of killing actions, and the object of dead attributes. The topic labeled eat may include words like eat, drink, and devour. eat ki l l l o ve dead happy agent 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 eat ki l l l o ve dead happy patient 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 eat ki l l l o ve dead happy attribute 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Figure 1: A persona is a set of three distributions over latent topics.

They each use different evidence: since our data includes not only textual features (in the form of actions and attributes of the characters) but also non-textual information (such as movie genre, age and gender), we design a model that exploits this additional source of information in discriminating between character types; since this extralinguistic information may not always be available, we also design a model that learns only from the text itself.

Bottom: Definition of variables. for simplicity. Throughout, V is the word vocabulary size, P is the number of personas, and K is the number of topics. 4.1 Dirichlet Persona Model In the most basic model, we only use information from the structured text, which comes as a bag of (r, w) tuples for each character in a movie, where w is the word lemma and r is the relation of the word with respect to the character (one of agent verb, patient verb or attribute, as out-lined in §2.1 above). The generative story runs as follows. First, let there be K latent word topics; as in LDA (Blei et al., 2003), these are words that will be soft-clustered together by virtue of appear-ing in similar contexts. Each latent word cluster 354 φk ∼ Dir(γ) is a multinomial over the V words in the vocabulary, drawn from a Dirichlet parameterized by γ. Next, let a persona p be defined as a set of three multinomials ψp over these K topics, one for each typed role r, each drawn from a Dirichlet with a role-specific hyperparameter (νr).","Every document (a movie plot summary) contains a set of characters, each of which is associated with a single latent persona p; for every observed (r, w) tuple associated with the character, we sample a latent topic k from the role-specific ψp,r. Conditioned on this topic assignment, the observed word is drawn from φk. The distribution of these personas for a given document is de-termined by a document-specific multinomial θ, drawn from a Dirichlet parameterized by α.","Figure 2 (above left) illustrates the form of the model. To simplify inference, we collapse out the persona-topic distributions ψ, the topic-word distributions φ and the persona distribution θ for each document. Inference on the remaining latent variables – the persona p for each character type and the topic z for each word associated with that character – is conducted via collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004); at each iteration, for each character e, we sample their persona pe: P (pe = k | p−e, z, α, ν) ∝ ( c−e d,k + αk ) × ∏ j","(c−e r j,k,z","j +νr","j )","(c−e r j,k,⋆+Kνr","j ) (1) Here, c−e","d,k is the count of all characters in document d whose current persona sample is also k (not counting the current character e under consideration);9","j ranges over all (rj, wj) tuples associated with character e.

After a burn-in phase of 10,000 iterations, we collect samples every 10 iterations (to lessen autocorrela-tion) until a total of 100 have been collected. 4.2 Persona Regression To incorporate observed metadata in the form of movie genre, character age and character gender, we adopt an “upstream” modeling approach (Mimno and McCallum, 2008), letting those observed features influence the conditional probability with which a given character is expected to assume a particular persona, prior to observing any of their actions. This captures the increased likelihood, for example, that a 25-year-old male actor in an action movie will play an ACTION HERO than he will play a VALLEY GIRL.","To capture these effects, each character’s latent persona is no longer drawn from a document-specific Dirichlet; instead, theP -dimensional simplex is the output of a multiclass logistic regression, where the document genre metadata md and the character age and gender metadata me together form a feature vector that combines with persona-specific feature weights to form the following loglinear distribution over personas, with the probability for persona k being: P (p = k | md, me, β) =","exp([md;me]⊤ βk)","1+PP−1","j=1 exp([md;me]⊤","βj)","(3)","The persona-specific β coefficients are learned","through Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization 355","(Wei and Tanner, 1990), in which we alternate be-","tween the following: 1.

This evaluation also helps offer guidance for model selection (in choosing the number of latent topics and personas) by measuring performance on an objective task. 5.1 Character Names First, we consider all character names that occur in at least two separate movies, generally as a consequence of remakes or sequels; this includes proper names such as “Rocky Balboa,” “Oliver Twist,” and “Indiana Jones,” as well as generic type names such as “Gang Member” and “The Thief”; to minimize ambiguity, we only consider character names consisting of at least two tokens. Each of these names is used by at least two different characters; for example, a character named “Jason Bourne” is portrayed in The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum. While these characters are certainly free to assume different roles in different movies, we believe that, in the aggregate, they should tend to embody the same character type and thus prove to be a natural clustering to recover. 970 character names occur at least twice in our data, and 2,666 individual characters use one of those names. Let those 970 character names define 970 unique gold clusters whose members include the individual characters who use that name. 5.2 TV Tropes As a second external measure of validation, we consider a manually created clustering presented at the website TV Tropes,10","a wiki that collects user-submitted examples of common tropes (narrative, character and plot devices) found in television, film, and fiction, among other media. While TV Tropes contains a wide range of such conventions, we manually identified a set of 72 tropes that could reasonably be labeled character types, including THE CORRUPT CORPO-RATE EXECUTIVE, THE HARDBOILED DETEC-TIVE, THE JERK JOCK, THE KLUTZ and THE SURFER DUDE.","We manually aligned user-submitted examples of characters embodying these 72 character types with the canonical references in Freebase to create a test set of 501 individual characters. While the 72 character tropes represented here are a more subjective measure, we expect to be able to at least partially recover this clustering. 5.3 Variation of Information To measure the similarity between the two clusterings of movie characters, gold clusters G and induced latent persona clusters C, we calculate the variation of information (Meilă, 2007): V I(G, C) = H(G) + H(C) − 2I(G, C) (5) = H(G|C) + H(C|G) (6)","VI measures the information-theoretic distance between the two clusterings: a lower value means greater similarity, and VI = 0 if they are identical. Low VI indicates that (induced) clusters and (gold) clusters tend to overlap; i.e., knowing a character’s (induced) cluster usually tells us their (gold) cluster, and vice versa.

To determine significance with respect to a random baseline, we conduct a permutation test (Fisher, 1935; Pitman, 1937) in which we randomly shuffle the labels of the learned persona clusters and count the number of times in 1,000 such trials that the VI of the observed persona labels is lower than the VI of the permuted labels; this defines a nonparametric p-value. All results presented are significant at p < 0.001 (i.e. observed VI is never lower than the simulation VI).","Over all tests in comparison to both gold clusterings, we see VI improve as both P and, to a lesser extent, K increase. While this may be expected as the number of personas increase to match the number of distinct types in the gold clusters (970 and 72, respectively), the fact that VI improves as the number of latent topics increases suggests that more fine-grained topics are helpful for capturing nuanced character types.11","The difference between the persona regression model and the Dirichlet persona model here is not","11","This trend is robust to the choice of cluster metric: here VI and F -score have a correlation of −0.87; as more latent topics and personas are added, clustering improves (causing the F -score to go up and the VI distance to go down). significant; while VI allows us to compare models with different numbers of latent clusters, its requirement that clusterings be mutually informative places a high overhead on models that are fundamentally unidirectional (in Table 1, for example, the room for improvement between two models of the same P and K is naturally smaller than the bigger difference between different P or K). While we would naturally prefer a text-only model to be as expressive as a model that requires potentially hard to acquire metadata, we tease apart whether a distinction actually does exist by evaluating the purity of the gold clusters with respect to the labels assigned them. 5.4 Purity For gold clusters G = {g1 . . . gk} and inferred clusters C = {c1 . . . cj} we calculate purity as: Purity = 1 N ∑ k","max j |gk ∩ cj| (7) While purity cannot be used to compare models of different persona size P , it can help us distinguish between models of the same size. A model can attain perfect purity, however, by placing all characters into a single cluster; to control for this, we present a controlled baseline in which each character is assigned a latent character type label proportional to the size of the latent clusters we have learned (so that, for example, if one latent persona cluster contains 3.2% of the total characters, 357 Batman Jim Gordon dark, major, henchman shoot, aim, overpower sentence, arrest, assign Tony Stark Jason Bourne The Joker shoot, aim, overpower testify, rebuff, confess hatch, vow, undergo Van Helsing Colin Sullivan Dracula The Departed The Dark Knight Iron Man The Bourne Identity approve, die, suffer relent, refuse, agree inherit live imagine Jack Dawson Rachel Titanic Figure 3: Dramatis personae of The Dark Knight (2008), illustrating 3 of the 100 character types learned by the persona regression model, along with links from other characters in those latent classes to other movies. Each character type is listed with the top three latent topics with which it is associated. the probability of selecting that persona at random is 3.2%). Table 2 presents each model’s absolute purity score paired with its improvement over its controlled permutation (e.g., ↑41%).","Within each fixed-size partition, the use of metadata yields a substantial improvement over the Dirichlet model, both in terms of absolute purity and in its relative improvement over its sized-controlled baseline. In practice, we find that while the Dirichlet model distinguishes between character personas in different movies, the persona regression model helps distinguish between different personas within the same movie."]},{"title":"6 Exploratory Data Analysis","paragraphs":["As with other generative approaches, latent persona models enable exploratory data analysis. To illustrate this, we present results from the persona regression model learned above, with 50 latent lexical classes and 100 latent personas.

While our testbed has been textual synopses of film, this approach is easily extended to other genres (such as novelistic fiction) and to non-fictional domains as well, where the choice of portraying a real-life person as embodying a particular kind of persona may, for instance, give insight into questions of media framing and bias in newswire; self-presentation of individual personas likewise has a long history in communication theory (Goffman, 1959) and may be use-ful for inferring user types for personalization systems (El-Arini et al., 2012). While the goal of this work has been to induce a set of latent character classes and partition all characters among them, one interesting question that remains is how a specific character’s actions may informatively be at odds with their inferred persona, given the choice of that persona as the single best fit to explain the actions we observe. By examining how any individual character deviates from the behavior indicative of their type, we might be able to paint a more nuanced picture of how a character can embody a specific persona while resisting it at the same time."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Megan Morrison at the CMU School of Drama for early conversations guiding our work, as well as the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.
