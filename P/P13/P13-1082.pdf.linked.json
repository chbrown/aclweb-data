We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also describe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1 BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The effectiveness of domain adaptation approaches such as mixture-modeling (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) has been established, and has led to research on a wide array of adaptation techniques in SMT, for instance (Matsoukas et al., 2009; Shah et al., 2012). In all these approaches, adaptation is performed during model training, with respect to a representative development corpus, and the models are kept unchanged when then system is deployed. Therefore, when working with multiple and/or unlabelled domains, domain adaptation is often impractical for a number of reasons. Firstly, maintaining multiple systems for each language pair, each adapted to a different domain, is costly in terms of computational and human resources: the full system development pipeline needs to be performed for all identified domains, all the models are separately stored and need to be switched at runtime. This is impractical in many real applications, in particular a web translation service which is faced with texts coming from many different domains. Secondly, domain adaptation bears a risk of performance loss. If there is a mismatch between the domain of the development set and the test set, domain adaptation can potentially harm performance compared to an unadapted baseline.","We introduce a translation model architecture that delays the computation of features to the decoding phase. The calculation is based on a vector of component models, with each component providing the sufficient statistics necessary for the computation of the features. With this framework, adaptation to a new domain simply consists of up-dating a weight vector, and multiple domains can be supported by the same system.","We also present a clustering approach for unsupervised adaptation in a multi-domain environment. In the development phase, a set of development data is clustered, and the models are adapted to each cluster. For each sentence that is being decoded, we choose the weight vector that is optimized on the closest cluster, allowing for adaptation even with unlabelled and heterogeneous test data."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["(Ortiz-Martı́nez et al., 2010) delay the computation of translation model features for the purpose of interactive machine translation with online training. The main difference to our approach is that we store sufficient statistics not for a single model, but a vector of models, which allows us to 832 weight the contribution of each component model to the feature calculation. The similarity suggests that our framework could also be used for interactive learning, with the ability to learn a model incrementally from user feedback, and weight it differently than the static models, opening new research opportunities.","(Sennrich, 2012b) perform instance weighting of translation models, based on the sufficient statistics. Our framework implements this idea, with the main difference that the actual combination is delayed until decoding, to support adaptation to multiple domains in a single system.","(Razmara et al., 2012) describe an ensemble decoding framework which combines several translation models in the decoding step. Our work is similar to theirs in that the combination is done at runtime, but we also delay the computation of translation model probabilities, and thus have access to richer sufficient statistics. In principle, our architecture can support all mixture operations that (Razmara et al., 2012) describe, plus additional ones such as forms of instance weighting, which are not possible after the translation probabilities have been computed.","(Banerjee et al., 2010) focus on the problem of domain identification in a multi-domain setting. They use separate translation systems for each domain, and a supervised setting, whereas we aim for a system that integrates support for multiple domains, with or without supervision.","(Yamamoto and Sumita, 2007) propose unsupervised clustering at both training and decoding time. The training text is divided into a number of clusters, a model is trained on each, and during decoding, each sentence is assigned to the closest cluster-specific model. Our approach bears resemblance to this clustering, but is different in that Yamamoto and Sumita assign each sentence to the closest model, and use this model for decoding, whereas in our approach, each cluster is associated with a mixture of models that is optimized to the cluster, and the number of clusters need not be equal to the number of component models."]},{"title":"3 Translation Model Architecture","paragraphs":["This section covers the architecture of the multi-domain translation model framework. Our translation model is embedded in a log-linear model as is common for SMT, and treated as a single translation model in this log-linear combination. We implemented this architecture for phrase-based models, and will use this terminology to describe it, but in principle, it can be extended to hierarchical or syntactic models.","The architecture has two goals: move the calculation of translation model features to the decoding phase, and allow for multiple knowledge sources (e.g. bitexts or user-provided data) to contribute to their calculation. Our immediate purpose for this paper is domain adaptation in a multi-domain environment, but the delay of the feature computation has other potential applications, e.g. in interactive MT.","We are concerned with calculating four features during decoding, henceforth just referred to as the translation model features: p(s|t), lex(s|t), p(t|s) and lex(t|s). s and t denote the source and target phrase. We follow the definitions in (Koehn et al., 2003).","Traditionally, the phrase translation probabilities p(s|t) and p(t|s) are estimated through unsmoothed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). p(x|y) = c(x, y) c(y) = c(x, y)","∑ x′ c(x′",", y) (1) where c denotes the count of an observation, and p the model probability.","The lexical weights lex(s|t) and lex(t|s) are calculated as follows, using a set of word alignments a between s and t:1 lex(s|t, a) = n ∏ i=1","1 |{j|(i, j) ∈ a}| ∑ ∀(i,j)∈a w(si|tj)","(2) A special NULL token is added to t and aligned to each unaligned word in s. w(si|tj) is calculated through MLE, as in equation 1, but based on the word (pair) frequencies.","To combine statistics from a vector of n component corpora, we can use a weighted version of equation 1, which adds a weight vector λ of length n (Sennrich, 2012b): p(x|y; λ) =","∑n i=1 λici(x, y)","∑n i=1","∑ x′ λici(x′",", y) (3) The word translation probabilities w(ti|sj) are defined analogously, and used in equation 2 for a weighted version.","1","The equation shows lex(s|t); lex(t|s) is computed analogously. 833","In order to compute the translation model features online, a number of sufficient statistics need to be accessible at decoding time. For p(s|t) and p(t|s), we require the statistics c(s), c(t) and c(s, t). For accessing them during decoding, we simply store them in the decoder’s data structure, rather than storing pre-computed translation model features. This means that we can use exist-ing, compact data formats for storing and accessing them.2","The statistics are accessed when the decoder collects all translation options for a phrase s in the source sentence. We then access all translation options for each component table, obtaining a vector of statistics c(s) for the source phrase, and c(t) and c(s, t) for each potential target phrase. For phrase pairs which are not found, c(s, t) and c(t) are initially set to 0.","Note that c(t) is potentially incorrect at this point, since a phrase pair not being found does not entail that c(t) is 0. After all tables have been accessed, and we thus know the full set of possible translation options (s, t), we perform a second round of lookups for all c(t) in the vector which are still set to 0. We introduce a second table for accessing c(t) efficiently, again storing it in the decoder’s data structure. We can easily create such a table by inverting the source and target phrases, deduplicating it for compactness (we only need one entry per target phrase), and storing c(t) as only feature.","For lex(s|t), we require an alignment a, plus c(tj) and c(si, tj) for all pairs (i, j) in a. lex(t|s) can be based on the same alignment a (with the exception of NULL alignments, which can be added online), but uses statistics c(sj) and c(ti, sj). For estimating the lexical probabilities, we load the frequencies into a vector of four hash tables.3","Both space and time complexity of the lookup is linear to the number of component tables. We deem it is still practical because the collection of translation options is typically only a small frac-tion of total decoding time, with search making up the largest part. For storing and accessing the sufficient statistics (except for the word (pair) frequencies), we use an on-disk data structure pro-2","We have released an implementation of the architecture as part of the Moses decoder. 3","c(s, t) and c(t, s) are not identical since the lexical probabilities are based on the unsymmetrized word alignment frequencies (in the Moses implementation which we reimplement). phrase (pair) c1(x) c2(x) row 300 80 (row, Zeile) 240 20 (row, Reihe) 60 60 λ p(Zeile|row) p(Reihe|row) (1, 1) 0.68 0.32 (1, 10) 0.40 0.60 (10, 1) 0.79 0.21 Table 1: Illustration of instance weighting with weight vectors for two corpora. vided by Moses, which reduces the memory requirements. Still, the number of components may need to be reduced, for instance through clustering of training data (Sennrich, 2012a).","With a small modification, our framework could be changed to use a single table that stores a vector of n statistics instead of a vector of n tables. While this would be more compact in terms of memory, and keep the number of table lookups independent of the number of components, we chose a vector of n tables for its flexibility. With a vector of tables, tables can be quickly added to or removed from the system (conceivable even at runtime), and can be polymorph. One applications where this could be desirable is interactive machine translation, where one could work with a mix of compact, static tables, and tables designed to be incrementally trainable.","In the unweighted variant, the resulting features are equivalent to training on the concatenation of all training data, excepting differences in word alignment, pruning4","and rounding. The architecture can thus be used as a drop-in replace-ment for a baseline system that is trained on concatenated training data, with non-uniform weights only being used for texts for which better weights have been established. This can be done either using domain labels or unsupervised methods as described in the next section.","As a weighted combination method, we implemented instance weighting as described in equation 3.

Note that the larger corpus (or more precisely, the one in which row occurs more often) has a stronger impact on the probability distribution with uniform weights (or in a concatenation of data sets). Instance weighting allows us to modify the contribution of each corpus. In our implementation, the weight vector is set globally, but can be overridden on a per-sentence basis. In principle, using different weight vectors for different phrase pairs in a sentence is conceivable. The framework can also be extended to support other combination methods, such as a linear interpolation of models."]},{"title":"4 Unsupervised Clustering for Online Translation Model Adaptation","paragraphs":["The framework supports decoding each sentence with a separate weight vector of size 4n, 4 being the number of translation model features whose computation can be weighted, and n the number of model components. We now address the ques-tion of how to automatically select good weights in a multi-domain task. As a way of optimizing instance weights, (Sennrich, 2012b) minimize translation model perplexity on a set of phrase pairs, automatically extracted from a parallel development set. We follow this technique, but want to have multiple weight vectors, adapted to different texts, between which the system switches at decoding time. The goal is to perform domain adaptation without requiring domain labels or user in-put, neither for development nor decoding.","The basic idea consists of three steps: 1. Cluster a development set into k clusters. 2. Optimize translation model weights for each cluster.","3. For each sentence in the test set, assign it to the nearest cluster and use the translation model weights associated with the cluster.","For step 2, we use the algorithm by (Sennrich, 2012b), implemented in the decoder to allow for a quick optimization of a running system. We will here discuss steps 1 and 3 in more detail. 4.1 Clustering the Development Set We use k-means clustering to cluster the sentences of the development set. We train a language model on the source language side of each of the n component bitexts, and compute an n-dimensional vector for each sentence by computing its entropy with each language model. Our aim is not to discriminate between sentences that are more likely and unlikely in general, but to cluster on the basis of relative differences between the language model entropies. For this purpose, we choose the cosine as our similarity measure. Figure 1 illustrates clustering in a two-dimensional vector space, and demonstrates that Euclidean distance is unsuitable because it may perform a clustering that is irrelevant to our purposes.","As a result of development set clustering, we obtain a bitext for each cluster, which we use to optimize the model weights, and a centroid per cluster. At decoding time, we need only perform an assignment step. Each test set sentence is assigned to the centroid that is closest to it in the vector space. 4.2 Scalability Considerations Our theoretical expectation is that domain adaptation will fail to perform well if the test data is from 835 a different domain than the development data, or if the development data is a heterogeneous mix of domains. A multi-domain setup can mitigate this risk, but only if the relevant domain is represented in the development data, and if the development data is adequately segmented for the optimization. We thus suggest that the development data should contain enough data from all domains that one wants to adapt to, and a high number of clusters.","While the resource requirements increase with the number of component models, increasing the number of clusters is computationally cheap at runtime. Only the clustering of the development set and optimization of the translation model weights for each clusters is affected by k. This means that the approach can in principle be scaled to a high number of clusters, and support a high number of domains.5","The biggest risk of increasing the number of clusters is that if the clusters become too small, perplexity minimization may overfit these small clusters. We will experiment with different numbers of clusters, but since we expect the optimal number of clusters to depend on the amount of development data, and the number of domains, we cannot make generalized statements about the ideal number of k.","While it is not the focus of this paper, we also evaluate language model adaptation. We perform a linear interpolation of models for each cluster, with interpolation coefficients optimized using perplexity minimization on the development set. The cost of moving language model interpolation into the decoding phase is far greater than for translation models, since the number of hypotheses that need to be evaluated by the language model is several orders of magnitudes higher than the number of phrase pairs used during the translation. For the experiments with language model adaptation, we have chosen to perform linear interpolation offline, and perform language model switching during decoding. While model switching is a fast operation, it also makes the space complexity of storing the language models linear to the number of clusters. For scaling the approach to a high number of clusters, we envision that multi-","5","If the development set is labelled, one can also use a gold segmentation of development sets instead of k-means clustering.

In an unlabelled setting, one would have to run MERT either on the full development set (as we will do for the CZ–EN task) or separately on each cluster, or use an alternative approach to optimize log-linear weights in a multi-domain setting, such as feature augmentation as described by (Clark et al., 2012). 837 system TM adaptation LM adaptation TM+LM adaptation baseline 34.4 34.4 34.4 1 cluster (no split) 34.5 33.7 34.1 2 clusters 34.6 34.0 34.4 4 clusters 34.7* 34.3 34.6 8 clusters 34.7* 34.5 34.9* 16 clusters 34.7* 34.7* 35.0* gold clusters 35.0* 35.0* 35.4* Table 6: Translation experiments CZ–EN.

For the IT test set, the system with gold labels and TM adaptation yields an improvement of 0.7 BLEU (21.1 → 21.8), LM adaptation yields 1.3 BLEU (21.1 → 22.4), and adapting both models outperforms the baseline by 2.1 BLEU (21.1 → 23.2). The systems that use unsupervised clusters reach a similar level of performance than those with gold clusters, with best results being achieved by the systems with 2–8 clusters. Some systems outperform both the baseline and the gold clusters, e.g. TM adaptation with 8 clusters (21.1 → 21.8 → 22.1), or LM adaptation with 4 or 8 clusters (21.1 → 22.4 → 23.1).","Results with 16 clusters are slightly worse than those with 2–8 clusters due to two effects. Firstly, for the system with adapted TM, one of the three MERT runs is an outlier, and the reported BLEU score of 21.1 is averaged from the three MERT runs achieving 22.1, 21.6, and 19.6 BLEU, respectively. Secondly, about one third of the IT test set is assigned to a cluster that is not IT-specific, which weakens the effect of domain adaptation for the systems with 16 clusters.","For the LEGAL subset, gains are smaller. This can be explained by the fact that the majority of training data is already from the legal domain, which makes it unnecessary to boost its impact on the probability distribution even further.","Table 5 shows the automatically obtained translation model weight vectors for two systems, “gold clusters” and “2 clusters”, for the feature p(t|s). It illustrates that all the corpora that we consider out-of-domain for IT are penalized by a factor of 10–50 (relative to the in-domain kde corpus) for the computation of this feature. For the LEGAL domain, the weights are more uniform, which is congruent with our observation that BLEU changes little.","Table 6 shows results for the CZ–EN data set. For each system, MERT is performed on the full development set. As in the first task, adaptation to the full development set is least effective. The systems with unsupervised clusters significantly outperform the baseline. For the system with 16 clusters, we observe an improvement of 0.3 BLEU for TM adaptation, and 0.6 BLEU for adapting both models (34.4 → 34.7 → 35.0). The labelled system, i.e. the system with 7 clusters corresponding to the 7 data sources, both for the development and test set, performs best. We observe gains of 0.6 BLEU (34.4 → 35.0) for TM or LM adaptation, and 1 BLEU (34.4 → 35.4) when both models are adapted.","We conclude that the translation model architecture is effective in a multi-domain setting, both with unsupervised clusters and labelled domains. The fact that language model adaptation yields an additional improvement in our experiments suggests that it it would be worthwhile to also investigate a language model data structure that efficiently supports multiple domains."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a novel translation model architecture that delays the computation of translation model features to the decoding phase, and uses a vector of component models for this computation.
