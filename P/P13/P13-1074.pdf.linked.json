They neither perform a proper segmentation of the output into sentences, nor predict punctuation symbols. The unavailable punctuations and sentence boundaries in transcribed speech texts create barriers to many subsequent processing tasks, such as summarization, information extraction, question answering and machine translation. Thus, the segmentation of long texts is necessary in many real applications. For example, in speech-to-speech translation, continuously transcribed speech texts need to be segmented before being fed into subsequent machine translation systems (Takezawa et al., 1998; Nakamura, 2009). This is because current machine translation (MT) systems perform the translation at the sentence level, where various models used in MT are trained over segmented sentences and many algorithms inside MT have an exponential complexity with regard to the length of inputs.","The punctuation prediction problem has attracted research interest in both the speech processing community and the natural language processing community. Most previous work primarily exploits local features in their statistical models such as lexicons, prosodic cues and hidden event language model (HELM) (Liu et al., 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Huang and Zweig, 2002; Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996). The word-level models integrating local features have narrow views about the input and could not achieve satisfied performance due to the limited context information access (Favre et al., 2008). Naturally, global contexts are required to model the punctuation prediction, especially for long-range dependencies. For instance, in English question sentences, the ending question mark is long-range dependent on the initial phrases (Lu and Ng, 2010), such as “could you” in Figure 1. There has been some work trying to incorporate syntactic features to broaden the view of hypotheses in the punctuation prediction models (Roark et al., 2006; Favre et al., 2008). In their methods, the punctuation prediction is treated as a separated post-procedure of parsing, which may suffer from the problem of error propagation. In addition, these approaches are not able to incrementally process inputs and are not efficient for very long inputs, especially in the cases of long transcribed speech texts from presentations where the number of streaming words could be larger than hundreds or thousands.","In this paper, we propose jointly performing punctuation prediction and transition-based dependency parsing over transcribed speech text. When the transition-based parsing consumes the stream of words left to right with the shift-reduce decoding algorithm, punctuation symbols are predicted for each word based on the contexts of the parsing tree. Two models are proposed to cause the punctuation prediction to interact with the transition actions in parsing. One is to conduct transition actions of parsing followed by punctuation predictions in a cascaded way. The other is to associate the conventional transition actions of parsing with punctuation perditions, so that predicted punctuations are directly inferred from the 752  (a).

Our models have linear complexity and are capable of handling streams of words with any length. In addition, the computation of models use a rich set of syntactic features, which can improve the complicated punctuation predictions from a global view, especially for the long range dependencies.","Figure 1 shows an example of how parsing helps punctuation prediction over the transcribed speech text. As illustrated in Figure 1(b), two commas are predicted when their preceding words act as the adverbial modifiers (advmod) during parsing. The period after the word “menu” is predicted when the parsing of an adverbial clause modifier (advcl) is completed. The question mark at the end of the input is determined when a direct object modifier (dobj) is identified, together with the long range clue that the auxiliary word occurs before the nominal subject (nsubj). Eventually, two segmentations are formed according to the punctuation prediction results, shown in Figure 1(c).","The training data used for our models is adapted from Treebank data by excluding all punctuations but keeping the punctuation contexts, so that it can simulate the unavailable annotated transcribed speech texts. In decoding, beam search is used to get optimal punctuation prediction results. We conduct experiments on both IWSLT data and TDT4 test data sets. The experimental results show that our method can achieve higher performance than the CRF-based baseline method.","The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 conducts a survey of related work. The transition-based dependency parsing is introduced in Section 3. We explain our approach to predicting punctuations for transcribed speech texts in Section 4. Section 5 gives the results of our experiment. The conclusion and future work are given in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Sentence boundary detection and punctuation prediction have been extensively studied in the speech processing field and have attracted research interest in the natural language processing field as well. Most previous work exploits local features for the task. Kim and Woodland (2001), Huang and Zweig (2002), Christensen et al. (2001), and Liu et al. (2005) integrate both prosodic features (pitch, pause duration, etc.) and lexical features (words, n-grams, etc.) to predict punctuation symbols during speech recognition, where Huang and Zweig (2002) uses a maximum entropy model, Christensen et al. (2001) focus on finite state and multi-layer perceptron methods, and Liu et al. (2005) uses conditional random fields. However, in some scenarios the prosodic cues are not available due to inaccessible original raw speech waveforms. Matusov et al. (2006) integrate segmentation features into the log-linear model in the statistical machine translation (SMT) framework to improve the translation performance when translating transcribed speech texts. Lu and Ng (2010) uses dynamic conditional random fields to perform both sentence boundary and sentence type prediction. They achieved promis-ing results on both English and Chinese transcribed speech texts.

Roark et al. (2006) use a rich set of non-local features including parser scores to re-rank full segmentations. Favre et al. (2008) integrate syntactic information from a PCFG parser into a log-linear and combine it with local features for sentence segmentation. The punctuation prediction in these works is performed as a post-procedure step of parsing, where a parse tree needs to be built in advance. As their parsing over the stream of words in transcribed speech text is exponentially complex, their approaches are only feasible for short input processing. Unlike these works, we incorporate punctuation prediction into the parsing which process left to right input without length limitations.","Numerous dependency parsing algorithms have been proposed in the natural language processing community, including transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing. Compared to graph-based parsing, transition-based parsing can offer linear time complexity and easily leverage non-local features in the models (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006b; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and Sagae, 2010). Starting with the work from (Zhang and Nivre, 2011), in this paper we extend transition-based dependency parsing from the sentence-level to the stream of words and integrate the parsing with punctuation prediction.","Joint POS tagging and transition-based dependency parsing are studied in (Hatori et al., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). The improve-ments are reported with the joint model compared to the pipeline model for Chinese and other richly inflected languages, which shows that it also makes sense to jointly perform punctuation prediction and parsing, although these two tasks of POS tagging and punctuation prediction are different in two ways: 1). The former usually works on a well-formed single sentence while the latter needs to process multiple sentences that are very lengthy. 2). POS tags are must-have features to parsing while punctuations are not. The parsing quality in the former is more sensitive to the performance of the entire task than in the latter."]},{"title":"3 Transition-based dependency parsing","paragraphs":["In a typical transition-based dependency parsing process, the shift-reduce decoding algorithm is applied and a queue and stack are maintained (Zhang and Nivre, 2011). The queue stores the stream of transcribed speech words, the front of which is indexed as the current word. The stack stores the unfinished words which may be linked with the current word or a future word in the queue. When words in the queue are consumed from left to right, a set of transition actions is applied to build a parse tree. There are four kinds of transition actions conducted in the parsing process (Zhang and Nivre, 2011), as described in Table 1. ","Action Description","Shift Fetches the current word from the queue and pushes it to the stack","Reduce Pops the stack","LeftArc Adds a dependency link from the current word to the stack top, and pops the stack","RightArc Adds a dependency link from the stack top to the current word, takes away the current word from the queue and pushes it to the stack Table 1. Action types in transition-based parsing","The choice of each transition action during the parsing is scored by a linear model that can be trained over a rich set of non-local features extracted from the contexts of the stack, the queue and the set of dependency labels. As described in (Zhang and Nivre, 2011), the feature templates could be defined over the lexicons, POS-tags and the combinations with syntactic information.","In parsing, beam search is performed to search the optimal sequence of transition actions, from which a parse tree is formed (Zhang and Clark, 2008). As each word must be pushed to the stack once and popped off once, the number of actions needed to parse a sentence is always 2n, where n is the length of the sentence. Thus, transition-based parsing has a linear complexity with the length of input and naturally it can be extended to process the stream of words."]},{"title":"4 Our method 4.1 Model","paragraphs":["In the task of punctuation prediction, we are given a stream of words from an automatic transcription of speech text, denoted by w1n",": = w1, w2, ... , wn.

It contains around 1.5M words in total and consist of various genres including weblogs, web texts, newsgroups, email, reviews, question-answer sessions, newswires, broadcast news and broadcast conversations. To simulate the transcribed speech text, all words in dependency trees are lowercased and punctuations are excluded before model training. In addition, every ten dependency trees are concatenated sequentially to simulate a parsing result of a stream of words in the model training.","There are two test data sets used in our experiments. One is the English corpus of the IWSLT09 evaluation campaign (Paul, 2009) that is the conversional speech text.

The usage of the latter test data set aims to evaluate the effectiveness of our method in real applications where lots of substantial recognition errors could be contained. In addition, we also evaluate the quality of our transition-based parsing, as its performance could have a big influence on the quality of punctuation prediction.","5.2.1 Performance on correctly recognized text The evaluation of our method on correctly recognized text uses 10% of IWSLT09 training set, which consists of 19,972 sentences from BTEC (Basic Travel Expression Corpus) and 10,061 sentences from CT (Challenge Task).

Punctuation prediction performance on correctly recognized text We achieved good performance on full-stop punctuation compared to the baseline, which shows our method can efficiently process sentence segmentation because each segment is decided by the structure of a single parsing tree. In addition, the global syntactic knowledge used in our work help capture long range dependencies of punctuations. The performance of middle-paused punctuation prediction is fairly low between all methods, which shows predicting middle-paused punctuations is a difficult task. This is because the usage of middle-paused punctuations is very flexible, especially in conversional data. The last column in Table 4 presents the performance of the pure segmentation task where the middle-paused and full-stop punctuations are mixed and not distinguished. The performance of our method is much higher than that of the baseline, which shows our method is good at segmentation. We also note that UPP yields slightly better performance than CPP on full-stop and mixed punctuation prediction, and much better performance on middle-paused punctuation prediction. This could be because the interaction of parsing and punctuation prediction is closer together in UPP than in CPP.","5.2.2 Performance on automatically recognized text Table 5 shows the experimental results of punctuation prediction on automatically recognized text from TDT4 data that is recognized using SRI’s English broadcast news ASR system where the word error rate is estimated to be 18%. As the annotation of middle-paused punctuations in TDT4 is not available, we can only evaluate the performance of full-stop punctuation prediction (i.e., detecting sentence boundaries). Thus, we merge every three sentences into one single input before performing full-stop prediction. The average input length is about 43 words.

The baseline gets a little higher recall than our method, which shows the baseline method tends to make aggressive segmentation decisions. However, both precision and F1 score of our method are much higher than the baseline. CPP has higher recall than UPP, but with lower precision and F1 score. This is in line with Table 4, which consistently illustrates CPP can get higher recall on full-stop punctuation prediction for both correctly recognized and automatically recognized texts.","5.2.3 Performance of transition-based parsing","Performance of parsing affects the quality of punctuation prediction in our work.

Secondly, we evaluate our parsing model in CPP over the texts without punctuations (TOP). Surprisingly, the performance over TOP is better than that over TCP.
