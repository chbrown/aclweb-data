Those systems use synchronous context-free grammars (Chiang, 2007), synchronous tree substitution grammars (Eisner, 2003) or even more powerful for-malisms like synchronous tree-sequence substitution grammars (Sun et al., 2009). However, those systems use linguistic syntactic annotation at different levels. For example, the systems proposed by Wu (1997) and Chiang (2007) use no linguistic information and are syntactic in a structural sense only. Huang et al. (2006) and Liu et al. (2006) use syntactic annotations on the source language side and show significant improvements in translation quality. Using syntax exclusively on the target language side has also been successfully tried by Galley et al. (2004) and Galley et al. (2006). Nowadays, open-source toolkits such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) offer syntax-based components (Hoang et al., 2009), which allow experiments without expert knowledge. The improvements observed for systems using syntactic annotation on either the source or the target language side naturally led to experiments with models that use syntactic annotations on both sides. However, as noted by Lavie et al. (2008), Liu et al. (2009), and Chiang (2010), the integration of syntactic information on both sides tends to decrease translation quality because the systems become too restrictive. Several strategies such as (i) using parse forests instead of single parses (Liu et al., 2009) or (ii) soft syntactic constraints (Chiang, 2010) have been developed to alleviate this problem. Another successful approach has been to switch to more powerful formalisms, which allow the extraction of more general rules. A particularly powerful model is the non-contiguous version of synchronous tree-sequence substitution grammars (STSSG) of Zhang et al. (2008a), Zhang et al. (2008b), and Sun et al. (2009), which allows sequences of trees on both sides of the rules [see also (Raoult, 1997)]. The multi bottom-up tree transducer (MBOT) of Arnold and Dauchet (1982) and Lilin (1978) offers a middle ground between traditional syntax-based models and STSSG. Roughly speaking, an MBOT is an STSSG, in which all the discontinuities must occur on the target language side (Maletti, 2011). This restriction yields many algorithmic advantages over both the traditional models as well as STSSG as demonstrated by Maletti (2010). For-mally, they are expressive enough to express all sensible translations (Maletti, 2012)1",". Figure 2 displays sample rules of the MBOT variant, called lMBOT, that we use (in a graphical representation of the trees and the alignment).","In this contribution, we report on our novel statistical machine translation system that uses an lMBOT-based translation model. The theoretical foundations of lMBOT and their integration into our translation model are presented in Sec-tions 2 and 3. In order to empirically evaluate the lMBOT model, we implemented a machine trans-1","A translation is sensible if it is of linear size increase and can be computed by some (potentially copying) top-down tree transducer. 811 Sε NP1 JJ11 Official111 NNS12 forecasts121 VP2 VBD21 predicted211 NP22 QP221 RB2211 just22111 CD2212 322121 NN222 %2221 Figure 1: Example tree t with indicated positions.

We implemented lMBOT inside the syntax-based component of the Moses open source toolkit. Section 4 presents the most important algorithms of our lMBOT decoder. We evaluate our new system on the WMT 2009 shared translation task English → German. The translation quality is automatically measured using BLEU scores, and we confirm the findings by providing linguistic evidence (see Section 5). Note that in contrast to several previous approaches, we perform large scale experiments by training systems with approx. 1.5 million parallel sentences."]},{"title":"2 Theoretical Model","paragraphs":["In this section, we present the theoretical generative model used in our approach to syntax-based machine translation. Essentially, it is the local multi bottom-up tree transducer of Maletti (2011) with the restriction that all rules must be shallow, which means that the left-hand side of each rule has height at most 2 (see Figure 2 for shallow rules and Figure 4 for rules including non-shallow rules). The rules extracted from the training example of Figure 3 are displayed in Figure 4. Those extracted rules are forcibly made shallow by removing internal nodes. The application of those rules is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.","For those that want to understand the inner workings, we recall the principal model in full detail in the rest of this section. Since we utilize syntactic parse trees, let us introduce trees first. Given an alphabet Σ of labels, the set TΣ of all Σ-trees is the smallest set T such that σ(t1, . . . , tk) ∈ T for all σ ∈ Σ, integer k ≥ 0, and t1, . . . , tk ∈ T . In-tuitively, a tree t consists of a labeled root node σ followed by a sequence t1, . . . , tk of its children. A tree t ∈ TΣ is shallow if t = σ(t1, . . . , tk) with σ ∈ Σ and t1, . . . , tk ∈ Σ. NP QP NN → ( PP von AP NN ) S NP VBD NP → ( S NP VAFIN PP VVPP ) Figure 2: Sample lMBOT rules.","To address a node inside a tree, we use its position, which is a word consisting of positive in-tegers. Roughly speaking, the root of a tree is addressed with the position ε (the empty word). The position iw with i ∈ N addresses the position w in the ith","direct child of the root. In this way, each node in the tree is assigned a unique position. We illustrate this notion in Figure 1. Formally, the positions pos(t) ⊆ N∗","of a tree t = σ(t1, . . . , tk) are inductively defined by pos(t) = {ε} ∪ pos(k)","(t 1, . . . , tk), where","pos(k) (t1, . . . , tk) = ⋃ 1≤i≤k {iw | w ∈ pos(ti)} . Let t ∈ TΣ and w ∈ pos(t). The label of t at position w is t(w), and the subtree rooted at position w is t|w. These notions are also illustrated in Figure 1. A position w ∈ pos(t) is a leaf (in t) if w1 /∈ pos(t). In other words, leaves do not have any children. Given a subset N ⊆ Σ, we let leafN (t) = {w ∈ pos(t) | t(w) ∈ N, w leaf in t} be the set of all leaves labeled by elements of N . When N is the set of nonterminals, we call them leaf nonterminals. We extend this notion to sequences t1, . . . , tk ∈ TΣ by leaf (k) N (t1, . . . , tk) = ⋃ 1≤i≤k {iw | w ∈ leafN (ti)}. Let w1, . . . , wn ∈ pos(t) be (pairwise prefixincomparable) positions and t1, . . . , tn ∈ TΣ. Then t[wi ← ti]1≤i≤n denotes the tree that is obtained from t by replacing (in parallel) the subtrees at wi by ti for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n.","Now we are ready to introduce our model, which is a minor variation of the local multi bottom-up tree transducer of Maletti (2011). Let Σ and ∆ be the input and output symbols, respectively, and let N ⊆ Σ ∪ ∆ be the set of nonterminal symbols. Essentially, the model works on pairs ⟨t, (u1, . . . , uk)⟩ consisting of an input tree t ∈ TΣ 812 and a sequence u1, . . . , uk ∈ T∆ of output trees. Such pairs are pre-translations of rank k. The pre-translation ⟨t, (u1, . . . , uk)⟩ is shallow if all trees t, u1, . . . , uk in it are shallow.","Together with a pre-translation we typically have to store an alignment. Given a pre-translation ⟨t, (u1, . . . , uk)⟩ of rank k and 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we call ui the ith","translation of t. An alignment for this pre-translation is an injective mapping ψ : leaf","(k)","N (u1, . . . , uk) → leafN (t)×N such","that if (w, j) ∈ ran(ψ), then also (w, i) ∈ ran(ψ)","for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i.2","In other words, if an alignment","requests the ith","translation, then it should also re-","quest all previous translations. Definition 1 A shallow local multi bottom-up tree transducer (lMBOT) is a finite setR of rules to-gether with a mapping c : R → R such that every rule, written t →ψ (u1, . . . , uk), contains a shallow pre-translation ⟨t, (u1, . . . , uk)⟩ and an alignment ψ for it.","The components t, (u1, . . . , uk), ψ, and c(ρ) are called the left-hand side, the right-hand side, the alignment, and the weight of the rule ρ = t →ψ (u1, . . . , uk). Figure 2 shows two example lMBOT rules (without weights). Overall, the rules of an lMBOT are similar to the rules of an SCFG (synchronous context-free grammar), but our right-hand sides contain a sequence of trees instead of just a single tree. In addition, the alignments in an SCFG rule are bijective between leaf nonterminals, whereas our model permits multiple alignments to a single leaf nonterminal in the left-hand side (see Figure 2).","Our lMBOT rules are obtained automatically from data like that in Figure 3. Thus, we (word) align the bilingual text and parse it in both the source and the target language. In this manner we obtain sentence pairs like the one shown in Figure 3. To these sentence pairs we apply the rule extraction method of Maletti (2011). The rules extracted from the sentence pair of Figure 3 are shown in Figure 4. Note that these rules are not necessarily shallow (the last two rules are not). Thus, we post-process the extracted rules and make them shallow. The shallow rules corresponding to the non-shallow rules of Figure 4 are shown in Figure 2.","Next, we define how to combine rules to form derivations. In contrast to most other models, we","2","ran(f) for a mapping f : A → B denotes the range of f, which is {f(a) | a ∈ A}.

Let ρ = t →ψ (u1, . . . , uk) be a rule and w ∈ leafN (t) be a leaf nonterminal (occurrence) in the left-hand side. The w-rank rk(ρ, w) of the rule ρ is rk(ρ, w) = max {i ∈ N | (w, i) ∈ ran(ψ)} . For example, for the lower rule ρ in Figure 2 we have rk(ρ, 1) = 1, rk(ρ, 2) = 2, and rk(ρ, 3) = 1. Definition 2 The set τ (R, c) of weighted pre-translations of an lMBOT (R, c) is the smallest set T subject to the following restriction: If there exist","• a rule ρ = t →ψ (u1, . . . , uk) ∈ R,","• a weighted pre-translation","⟨tw, cw, (uw 1 , . . . , uw","kw )⟩ ∈ T","for every w ∈ leafN (t) with – rk(ρ, w) = kw,4 – t(w) = tw(ε),5","and – for every iw′","∈ leaf(k)","N (u1, . . . , uk),6","ui(w′",") = uv","j (ε) with ψ(iw′",") = (v, j),","then ⟨t′",", c′ , (u′","1, . . . , u′","k)⟩ ∈ T is a weighted pre-","translation, where • t′","= t[w ← t","w | w ∈ leafN (t)], 3 A standard semantics is presented, for example,","in (Maletti, 2011). 4 If w has n alignments, then the pre-translation selected","for it has to have suitably many output trees. 5 The labels have to coincide for the input tree. 6 Also the labels for the output trees have to coincide. 813 JJ Official → ( ADJA Offizielle ) NNS forecasts → ( NN Prognosen ) VBD predicted → ( VAFIN sind , VVPP ausgegangen ) RB just → ( ADV nur ) CD 3 → ( CARD 3 ) NN % → ( NN % ) NP JJ NNS → ( NP ADJA NN ) QP RB CD → ( AP ADV CARD ) NP QP NN → ( PP APPR von AP NN ) S NP VP VBD NP → ( S NP VAFIN VP PP VVPP ) Figure 4: Extracted (even non-shallow) rules.

In addition, the rank rk(ρ, w) of the replaced nonterminal should match the number kw of components in the selected weighted pre-translation. Finally, the nonterminals in the right-hand side that are aligned to w should be replaced by the translation that the alignment requests, provided that the nonterminal matches with the root symbol of the requested translation.

(2007) and Hoang et al. (2009). The standard Moses syntax-based decoder only handles SCFG rules; i.e, rules with contiguous components on the source and the target language side. Roughly speaking, SCFG rules are lMBOT rules with exactly one output tree. We thus had to extend the system to support our lMBOT rules, in which arbitrarily many output trees are allowed.","The standard Moses syntax-based decoder uses a CYK+ chart parsing algorithm, in which each source sentence is parsed and contiguous spans are processed in a bottom-up fashion. A rule is applicable11","if the left-hand side of it matches the nonterminal assigned to the full span by the parser and the (non-)terminal assigned to each subspan.12","In order to speed up the decoding, cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) is applied to each chart cell in order to select the most likely hypotheses for subspans. The language model (LM) scoring is directly in-tegrated into the cube pruning algorithm. Thus, LM estimates are available for all considered hypotheses. To accommodate lMBOT rules, we had to modify the Moses syntax-based decoder in several ways. First, the rule representation itself is adjusted to allow sequences of shallow output trees on the target side. Naturally, we also had to ad-just hypothesis expansion and, most importantly, language model scoring inside the cube pruning algorithm. An overview of the modified pruning procedure is given in Algorithm 1.","The most important modifications are hidden in lines 5 and 8. The expansion in Line 5 involves matching all nonterminal leaves in the rule as defined in Definition 2, which includes matching all leaf nonterminals in all (discontiguous) output trees. Because the output trees can remain discontiguous after hypothesis creation, LM scoring has to be done individually over all output trees. Algorithm 2 describes our LM scoring in detail. In it we use k strings w1, . . . , wk to collect the lexical information from the k output com-","11","Note that our notion of applicable rules differs from the default in Moses.","12","Theoretically, this allows that the decoder ignores unary parser nonterminals, which could also disappear when we make our rules shallow; e.g., the parse tree left in the pre-translation of Figure 5 can be matched by a rule with left-hand side NP(Official, forecasts).

These strings can later be rearranged in any order, so we LM-score all of them separately. Roughly speaking, we obtain wi by traversing ui depth-first left-to-right. If we meet a lexical element (terminal), then we add it to the end of wi. On the other hand, if we meet a nonterminal, then we have to consult the best pre-translation τ ′","= ⟨t′",", (u′","1, . . . , u′","k′)⟩, which will contribute the subtree at this position.

This string w′","j is then appended to wi. Once all the strings are built, we score them using our 4-gram LM. The overall LM score for the pre-translation is obtained by multiplying the scores for w1, . . . , wk. Clearly, this treats w1, . . . , wk as k separate strings, although they eventually will be combined into a single string. Whenever such a concatenation happens, our LM scoring will automatically compute n-gram LM scores based on the concatenation, which in particular means that the LM scores get more accurate for larger spans. Finally, in the final rule only one component is allowed, which yields that the LM indeed scores the complete output sentence.","Figure 7 illustrates our LM scoring for a pre-translation involving a rule with two (discontiguous) target sequences (the construction of the pre-translation is illustrated in Figure 6).

The results of our evaluation are reported in Table 1. For comparison, we also report the results obtained by a system that utilizes parses only on the source side (Moses tree-to-string) with its standard features.","We can observe from Table 1 that our lMBOT-based system outperforms the baseline.

Finally, Table 3 presents the number of rules with k target side components used during decoding. 5.3 Linguistic Analysis In this section we present linguistic evidence supporting the fact that the lMBOT-based system significantly outperforms the baseline. All examples are taken from the translation of the test set used for automatic evaluation. We show that when our system generates better translations, this is directly related to the use of lMBOT rules.","Figures 8 and 9 show the ability of our system to correctly reorder multiple segments in the source sentence where the baseline translates those segments sequentially. An analysis of the generated derivations shows that our system produces the correct translation by taking advantage of rules with discontiguous units on target language side. The rules used in the presented derivations are displayed in Figures 10 and 11. In the first example (Figure 8), we begin by translating “(( smuggle)VB (eight projectiles)NP (into the kingdom)PP)VP” into the discontiguous sequence composed of (i) “( acht geschosse)NP” ; (ii) “( in das königreich)PP” and (iii) “( schmuggeln)VP”. In a second step we as-semble all sequences in a rule with contiguous target language side and, at the same time, insert the word “( zu)PTKZU” between “( in das königreich)PP” and “( schmuggeln)VP”.","The second example (Figure 9) illustrates a more complex reordering.

In a second step, we translate the auxiliary “( has)VBZ” by in-serting “( hat)VAFIN” into the sequence. We thus obtain, for the input segment “(( has)VBZ (again)ADV commented on (the problem of global warming)NP)VP”, the sequence (i) “( das problem der globalen erwärmung)NP”; (ii) “( hat)VAFIN”; (iii) “( wieder)ADV”; (iv) “( kommentiert)VVPP”. In a last step, the constituent “( president václav klaus)NP” is inserted between the discontiguous units “( hat)VAFIN” and “( wieder)ADV” to form the contiguous sequence “(( das problem der globalen erwärmung)NP (hat)VAFIN (präsident václav klaus)NP (wieder)ADV (kommentiert)VVPP)TOP”.","Figures 12 and 13 show examples where our system generates complex words in the target language out of a simple source language word. Again, an analysis of the generated derivation shows that lMBOT takes advantage of rules hav-ing several target side components. Examples of such rules are given in Figure 14. Through its ability to use these discontiguous rules, our system correctly translates into reflexive or particle verbs such as “ konzentriert sich” (for the English “ focuses”) or “ besteht darauf ” (for the English “ insist”). Another phenomenon well handled by our system are relative pronouns. Pronouns such as “that” or “whose” are systematically translated 818 . . . geplant hatten 8 geschosse in das königreich zu schmuggeln . . . had planned to smuggle 8 projectiles into the kingdom . . . vorhatten zu schmuggeln 8 geschosse in das königreich Figure 8: Verbal Reordering (top: our system, bottom: baseline) das problem der globalen erwärmung hat präsident václav klaus wieder kommentiert president václav klaus has again commented on the problem of global warming präsident václav klaus hat wieder kommentiert das problem der globalen erwärmung Figure 9: Verbal Reordering (top: our system, bottom: baseline) . . . die serbische delegation bestand darauf , dass jede entscheidung . . . . . . the serbian delegation insisted that every decision . . . . . . die serbische delegation bestand , jede entscheidung . . .

To achieve this we implemented the formal model as described in Section 2 inside the Moses machine translation toolkit. Several modifications were necessary to obtain a working system. We publicly release all our developed software and our complete tool-chain to allow independent experiments and evaluation. This includes our lMBOT decoder IN that → ( $, ,",", KOUS dass ) VBZ focuses → ( VVFIN konzentriert , PRF sich ) Figure 14: lMBOT rules generating a relative clause/reflexive pronoun presented in Section 4 and a separate C++ module that we use for rule extraction (see Section 3).","Besides the automatic evaluation, we also performed a small manual analysis of obtained translations and show-cased some examples (see Section 5.3). We argue that our lMBOT approach can adequately handle discontiguous phrases, which occur frequently in German. Other languages that exhibit such phenomena include Czech, Dutch, Russian, and Polish. Thus, we hope that our system can also successfully be applied for other language pairs, which we plan to pursue as well.","In other future work, we want to investigate full backwards application of lMBOT rules, which would be more suitable for the converse translation direction German → English. The current independent LM scoring of components has some negative side-effects that we plan to circumvent with the use of lazy LM scoring."]},{"title":"Acknowledgement","paragraphs":["The authors thank Alexander Fraser for his ongo-ing support and advice.
