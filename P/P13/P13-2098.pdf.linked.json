In this paper we incorporate linguistically and semantically motivated features to an existing OCR system. To do so we follow an n-best list reranking approach that exploits recent advances in learning to rank techniques. We achieve 10.1% and 11.4% reduction in recognition word error rate (WER) relative to a standard baseline system on typewritten and handwritten Arabic respectively."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the task of converting scanned images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. Arabic OCR is a challenging problem due to Arabic’s connected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and rich morphology (Habash, 2010). Therefore only a few OCR systems have been developed (Märgner and Abed, 2009). The BBN Byblos OCR system (Natajan et al., 2002; Prasad et al., 2008; Saleem et al., 2009), which we use in this paper, relies on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to recover the sequence of characters from the image, and uses an n-gram language model (LM) to emphasize the fluency of the output. For an input image, the OCR decoder generates an n-best list of hypotheses each of which is associated with HMM and LM scores.","In addition to fluency as evaluated by LMs, other information potentially helps in discriminating good from bad hypotheses. For example, Habash and Roth (2011) use a variety of linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and non-linguistic features to automatically identify errors in OCR hypotheses. Another example presented by Devlin et al. (2012) shows that using a statistical machine translation system to assess the difficulty of translating an Arabic OCR hypothesis into English gives valuable feedback on OCR quality. Therefore, combining additional information with the LMs could reduce recognition errors. However, direct integration of such information in the decoder is difficult.","A straightforward alternative which we advocate in this paper is to use the available information to rerank the hypotheses in the n-best lists. The new top ranked hypothesis is considered as the new output of the system. We propose combining LMs with linguistically and semantically motivated features using learning to rank methods. Discriminative reranking allows each hypothesis to be represented as an arbitrary set of features without the need to explicitly model their interactions. Therefore, the system benefits from global and potentially complex features which are not available to the baseline OCR decoder. This approach has successfully been applied in numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks includ-ing syntactic parsing (Collins and Koo, 2005), semantic parsing (Ge and Mooney, 2006), machine translation (Shen et al., 2004), spoken language understanding (Dinarelli et al., 2012), etc. Furthermore, we propose to combine several ranking methods into an ensemble which learns from their predictions to further reduce recognition errors.","We describe our features and reranking approach in §2, and we present our experiments and results in §3."]},{"title":"2 Discriminative Reranking for OCR","paragraphs":["Each hypothesis in an n-best list {hi}n","i=1 is represented by a d-dimensional feature vector xi ∈ Rd",". Each xi is associated with a loss li to generate a labeled n-best list H = {(xi, li)}n","i=1. The loss is computed as the Word Error Rate (WER) of the 549 hypotheses compared to a reference transcription. For supervised training we use a set of n-best lists H = {H(k)","}M","k=1. 2.1 Learning to rank approaches Major approaches to learning to rank can be divided into pointwise score regression, pairwise preference satisfaction, and listwise structured learning. See Liu (2009) for a survey. In this paper, we explore all of the following learning to rank approaches. Pointwise In the pointwise approach, the ranking problem is formulated as a regression, or ordinal classification, for which any existing method can be applied. Each hypothesis constitutes a learning instance. In this category we use a regression method called Multiple Additive Regression Trees (MART) (Friedman, 2000) as implemented in RankLib.1","The major problem with pointwise approaches is that the structure of the list of hypotheses is ignored. Pairwise The pairwise approach takes pairs of hypotheses as instances in learning, and formalizes the ranking problem as a pairwise classifica-tion or pairwise regression. We use several methods from this category.","RankSVM (Joachims, 2002) is a method based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for which we use only linear kernels to keep complexity low. Exact optimization of the RankSVM objective can be computationally expensive as the number of hypothesis pairs can be very large. Approximate stochastic training strategies reduces complexity and produce comparable performance. Therefore, in addition to RankSVM, we use stochastic sub-gradient descent (SGDSVM), Pegasos (PegasosSVM) and Passive-Aggressive Perceptron (PAPSVM) as implemented in Sculley (2009).2","RankBoost (Freund et al., 2003) is a pairwise boosting approach implemented in RankLib. It uses a linear combination of weak rankers, each of which is a binary function associated with a single feature. This function is 1 when the feature value exceeds some threshold and 0 otherwise.","RankMIRA is a ranking method presented in (Le Roux et al., 2012).3","It uses a weighted linear combination of features which assigns the highest 1 http://people.cs.umass.edu/ṽdang/","ranklib.html 2 http://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml 3 https://github.com/jihelhere/","adMIRAble score to the hypotheses with the lowest loss. During training, the weights are updated according to the Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA), whenever the highest scoring hypothesis differs from the hypothesis with the lowest error rate.","In pairwise approaches, the group structure of the n-best list is still ignored. Additionally, the number of training pairs generated from an n-best list depends on its size, which could result in training a model biased toward larger hypothesis lists (Cao et al., 2006). Listwise The listwise approach takes n-best lists as instances in both learning and prediction. The group structure is considered explicitly and ranking evaluation measures can be directly optimized. The listwise methods we use are implemented in RankLib.","AdaRank (Xu and Li, 2007) is a boosting approach, similar to RankBoost, except that it optimizes an arbitrary ranking metric, for which we use Mean Average Precision (MAP).","Coordinate Ascent (CA) uses a listwise linear model whose weights are learned by a coordinate ascent method to optimize a ranking metric (Metzler and Bruce Croft, 2007). As with AdaRank we use MAP.","ListNet (Cao et al., 2007) uses a neural network model whose parameters are learned by gradient descent method to optimize a listwise loss based on a probabilistic model of permutations. 2.2 Ensemble reranking In addition to the above mentioned approaches, we couple simple feature selection and reranking models combination via a straightforward ensemble learning method similar to stacked generalization (Wolpert, 1992) and Combiner (Chan and Stolfo, 1993). Our goal is to generate an overall meta-ranker that outperforms all base-rankers by learning from their predictions how they correlate with each other.","To obtain the base-rankers, we train each of the ranking models of §2.1 using all the features of §2.3 and also using each feature family added to the baseline features separately. Then, we use the best model for each ranking approach to make predictions on a held-out data set of n-best lists. We can think of each base-ranker as computing one feature for each hypothesis. Hence, the scores generated by all the rankers for a given hypothesis constitute its feature vector.","The held-out n-best lists and the predictions of 550 the base-rankers represent the training data for the meta-ranker. We choose RankSVM4","as the meta-ranker since it performed well as a base-ranker. 2.3 Features Our features fall into five families.","Base features include the HMM and LM scores produced by the OCR system. These features are used by the baseline system5","as well as by the various reranking methods.","Simple features (“simple”) include the baseline rank of the hypothesis and a 0-to-1 range normalized version of it. We also use a hypothesis confidence feature which corresponds to the average of the confidence of individual words in the hypothesis; “confidence” for a given word is computed as the fraction of hypotheses in the n-best list that contain the word (Habash and Roth, 2011). The more consensus words a hypothesis contains, the higher its assigned confidence. We also use the average word length and the number of content words (normalized by the hypothesis length). We define “content words” as non-punctuation and non-digit words. Additionally, we use a set of binary features indicating if the hypothesis contains a sequence of duplicated characters, a date-like sequence and an occurrence of a specific character class (punctuation, alphabetic and digit).","Word LM features (“LM-word”) include the log probabilities of the hypothesis obtained using n-gram LMs with n ∈ {1, . . . , 5}. Separate LMs are trained on the Arabic Gigaword 3 corpus (Graff, 2007), and on the reference transcriptions of the training data (see §3.1). The LM models are built using the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).","Linguistic LM features (“LM-MADA”) are similar to the word LM features except that they are computed using the part-of-speech and the lemma of the words instead of the actual words.6","Semantic coherence feature (“SemCoh”) is motivated by the fact that semantic information can be very useful in modeling the fluency of phrases, and can augment the information provided by n-gram LMs. In modeling contextual 4","RankSVM has also been shown to be a good choice for the meta-learner in general stacking ensemble learning (Tang et al., 2010). 5","The baseline ranking is simply based on the sum of the logs of the HMM and LM scores. 6","The part-of-speech and the lemmas are obtained using MADA 3.0, a tool for Arabic morphological analysis and disambiguation (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Habash et al., 2009). lexical semantic information, simple bag-of-words models usually have a lot of noise; while more sophisticated models considering positional information have sparsity issues. To strike a balance between these two extremes, we introduce a novel model of semantic coherence that is based on a measure of semantic relatedness between pairs of words. We model semantic relatedness between two words using the Information Content (IC) of the pair in a method similar to the one used by Lin (1997) and Lin (1998).","IC(w1, d, w2) = log f (w1, d, w2)f (∗, d, ∗) f (w1, d, ∗)f (∗, d, w2) Here, d can generally represent some form of relation between w1 and w2. Whereas Lin (1997) and Lin (1998) used dependency relation between words, we use distance. Given a sentence, the distance between w1 and w2 is one plus the number of words that are seen after w1 and before w2 in that sentence. Hence, f (w1, d, w2) is the number of times w1 occurs before w2 at a distance d in all the sentences in a corpus. ∗ is a placeholder for any word, i.e., f (∗, d, ∗) is the frequency of all word pairs occurring at distance d. The distances are directional and not absolute values. A similar measure of relatedness was also used by Kolb (2009).","We estimate the frequencies from the Arabic Gigaword. We set the window size to 3 and cal-culate IC values of all pairs of words occurring at distance within the window size. Since the distances are directional, it has to be noted that given a word, its relations with three words before it and three words after it are modeled. During testing, for each phrase in our test set, we measure semantic relatedness of pairs of words using the IC values estimated from the Arabic Gigaword, and normalize their sum by the number of pairs in the phrase to obtain a measure of Semantic Coherence (SC) of the phrase. That is,","SC(p) = 1","m × ∑","1≤d≤W","1≤i+d<n IC(wi, d, wi+d) where p is the phrase being evaluated, n is the number of words in it, d is the distance between words, W is the window size (set to 3), and m is the number of all possible wi, wi+d pairs in the phrase given these conditions. 551 print hand |H∗| n |h| |H∗| n |h| Hb 1,560 62 9 2,295 225 8 Hm 1,000 76 9 1,000 225 9 Ht 1,000 64 9 1,000 227 9 Table 1: Data sets statistics. |H∗| refers to the number of n-best lists, n is the average size of the lists, and |h| is the average length of a hypothesis. print hand Baseline 13.8% 35% Oracle 9.8% 20.9% Best result 12.4% 30.9% Table 2: WER for baseline, oracle and best reranked hypotheses."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["3.1 Data and baselines We used two data sets derived from highresolution image scans of typewritten and handwritten Arabic text along with ground truth transcriptions.7","The BBN Byblos system was then used to process these scanned images into sequences of segments (sentence fragments) and generate a ranked n-best list of hypotheses for each segment (Natajan et al., 2002; Prasad et al., 2008; Saleem et al., 2009). We divided each of the typewritten data set (“print”) and handwritten data set (“hand”) into three disjoint parts: a training set for the base-rankers Hb, a training set for the meta-ranker Hm and a test set Ht. Table 1 presents some statistics about these data sets. Our baseline is based on the sum of the logs of the HMM and LM scores. Table 2 presents the WER for our baseline hypothesis, the best hypothesis in the list (our oracle) and our best reranking results which we describe in details in §3.2.","For LM training we used 220M words from Arabic Gigaword 3, and 2.4M words from each “print” and “hand” ground truth annotations.

We trained each model with different sizes of n-best, varying from n = 5 to n = 60 for “print” data, and between n = 5 and n = 150 for “hand” data. The top n hypotheses according to the baseline are selected for each n. Figure 1 plots WER as a function of the size of the training list n for both “print” and “hand” data.","The lowest WER scores are achieved for n = 10 and n = 15 for both “print” and “hand” data. We note that a small number of hypotheses per list is sufficient for RankSVM to obtain a good performance, but also increasing n further seems to increase the error rate. For the rest of this paper we use the top 10-best hypotheses per segment. 3.2 Reranking results The reranking results for “print” and “hand” are presented in Table 3. The results are presented as the difference in WER from the baseline WER. See the caption in Table 3 for more information.","For “print”, the pairwise approaches clearly out-perform the listwise approaches and achieve the lowest WER of 12.4% (10.1% WER reduction relative to the baseline) with 7 different combinations of rankers and feature families. While both approaches do not minimize WER directly, the pairwise methods have the advantage of using objectives that are simpler to optimize, and they are trained on much larger number of examples which may explain their superiority. RankBoost, however, is less competitive with a performance closer to that of listwise approaches.
