For supervised models, the human-annotated corpora on which models are trained, however, are expensive and difficult to build. As alternative strategies, methods which utilize raw texts have been in-vestigated recently, including unsupervised methods which use only raw texts (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; William et al., 2009), and semi-supervised methods (Koo et al., 2008) which use both raw texts and annotated corpus. And there are a lot of efforts have also been devoted to bilingual projection (Chen et al., 2010), which resorts to bilingual text with one language parsed, and projects the syntactic information from the parsed language to the unparsed one (Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009).","In dependency grammar induction, unsupervised methods achieve continuous improvements in recent years (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Bod, 2006; William et al., 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010). Relying on a predefined distributional assumption and iteratively maximizing an approximate indicator (entropy, likelihood, etc.), an unsupervised model usually suffers from two drawbacks, i.e., lower performance and high-er computational cost. On the contrary, bilingual projection (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang and Liu, 2010) seems a promising substitute for languages with a large amount of bilingual sentences and an exist-ing parser of the counterpart language. By project-ing syntactic structures directly (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang and Liu, 2010) across bilingual texts or indirectly across multilingual texts (Snyder et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011; Naseem et al., 2012), a better dependency grammar can be easily induced, if syntactic isomorphism is largely maintained between target and source languages.","Unsupervised induction and bilingual projection run according to totally different principles, the former mines the underlying structure of the monolingual language, while the latter leverages the syntactic knowledge of the parsed counter-1063 Bilingual corpus Joint Optimization Bilingually-guided Parsing model Unsupervised objective Projection objective Random Treebank Evolved treebank Target sentences Source sentences projection Figure 1: Training the bilingually-guided parsing model by iteration. part language. Considering this, we propose a novel strategy for automatically inducing a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency information, which integrates the advantage of bilingual projection into the unsupervised framework. A randomly-initialized monolingual treebank evolves in a self-training iterative procedure, and the grammar parameters are tuned to simultaneously maximize both the monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood of the evolv-ing treebank. The monolingual likelihood is similar to the optimization objectives of conventional unsupervised models, while the bilingually-projected likelihood is the product of the projected probabilities of dependency trees. By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, we can automatically induce a monolingual dependency grammar which is much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. In addition, since both likelihoods are fundamentally factorized into dependency edges (of the hypothesis tree), the computational complexity approaches to unsupervised models, while with much faster convergence. We evaluate the final automatically-induced dependency parsing model on 5 languages. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous work based on unsupervised method or indirect/direct dependency projection, where we see an average improvement of 28.5% over unsupervised baseline on all languages, and the improvements are 3.9%/3.0% over indirect/direct baselines. And our model achieves the most significant gains on Chinese, where the improvements are 12.0%, 4.5% over indirect and direct projection baselines respectively.","In the rest of the paper, we first describe the unsupervised dependency grammar induction framework in section 2 (where the unsupervised optimization objective is given), and introduce the bilingual projection method for dependency parsing in section 3 (where the projected optimization objective is given); Then in section 4 we present the bilingually-guided induction strategy for dependency grammar (where the two objectives above are jointly optimized, as shown in Figure 1). After giving a brief introduction of previous work in section 5, we finally give the experimental results in section 6 and conclude our work in section 7."]},{"title":"2 Unsupervised Dependency GrammarInduction","paragraphs":["In this section, we introduce the unsupervised objective and the unsupervised training algorithm which is used as the framework of our bilingually-guided method. Unlike previous unsupervised work (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Bod, 2006), we select a self-training approach (similar to hard EM method) to train the unsupervised model. And the framework of our unsupervised model builds a random treebank on the monolingual corpus firstly for initialization and trains a discriminative parsing model on it. Then we use the parser to build an evolved treebank with the 1-best result for the next iteration run. In this way, the parser and treebank evolve in an iterative way until convergence. Let’s introduce the parsing objective firstly:","Define ei as the ith","word in monolingual sentence E; deij denotes the word pair dependency relationship (ei → ej ). Based on the features around deij , we can calculate the probability P r(y|deij ) that the word pair deij can form a dependency arc 1064 as:","P r(y|de ij ) = 1","Z(de ij ) exp(∑","n λn · fn(de","ij , y)) (1) where y is the category of the relationship of deij : y = + means it is the probability that the word pair deij can form a dependency arc and y = − means the contrary. λn denotes the weight for feature function fn(deij , y), and the features we used are presented in Table 1 (Section 6). Z(deij ) is a normalizing constant:","Z(deij ) = ∑ y exp(∑","n λn · fn(deij , y)) (2)","Given a sentence E, parsing a dependency tree is to find a dependency tree DE with maximum probability PE:","PE = arg max","DE ∏","de","ij ∈DE P r(+|deij ) (3) 2.1 Unsupervised Objective We select a simple classifier objective function as the unsupervised objective function which is in-stinctively in accordance with the parsing objective:","θ(λ) = ∏","de∈DE P r(+|de) ∏","de∈ D̃E P r(−|de)","(4) where E is the monolingual corpus and E ∈ E, DE is the treebank that contains all DE in the corpus, and D̃E denotes all other possible dependency arcs which do not exist in the treebank.","Maximizing the Formula (4) is equivalent to maximizing the following formula:","θ1(λ) = ∑ de∈DE log P r(+|de)","+ ∑ de∈ D̃E log P r(−|de) (5) Since the size of edges between DE and D̃E is disproportionate, we use an empirical value to reduce the impact of the huge number of negative instances:","θ2(λ) = ∑ de∈DE log P r(+|de)","+ |DE| | D̃E| ∑","de∈ D̃E log P r(−|de) (6) where |x| is the size of x.

Take Figure 2 as an example, following the Direct Projection Algorithm (DPA) (Hwa et al., 2005) (Section 5), the dependency relationships between words can be directly projected from the source 1065 Algorithm 2 Training projection model 1: DP , DN ← proj(F , DF , A, E) 2: repeat ▷ train(DP , DN ) 3: ∇φ ← grad(DP , DN , φ(λ)) 4: λ ← climb(φ, ∇φ, λ) 5: until maximization language to the target language. Therefore, we can hardly obtain a treebank with complete trees through direct projection. So we extract projected discrete dependency arc instances instead of treebank as training set for the projected grammar induction model. 3.1 Projection Objective Correspondingly, we select an objective which has the same form with the unsupervised one:","φ(λ) = ∑ de∈DP log P r(+|de)","+ ∑ de∈DN log P r(−|de) (7) where DP is the positive dependency arc instance set, which is obtained by direct projection methods (Hwa et al., 2005; Jiang and Liu, 2010) and DN is the negative one. 3.2 Projection Algorithm Basically, the training procedure in line 2,7 of Algorithm 1 can be divided into smaller iterative steps, and Algorithm 2 outlines the training step of projection model with instances. F in Algorithm 2 is source sentences in bilingual corpus, and A is the alignments. Function gr\\u{6164} (·, ·, ·) gives the gradient (∇φ) and the objective is optimized with a generic optimization step (such as an LBFGS iteration (Zhu et al., 1997)) in the subroutine climb(·, ·, ·)."]},{"title":"4 Bilingually-Guided DependencyGrammar Induction","paragraphs":["This section presents our bilingually-guided grammar induction model, which incorporates unsupervised framework and bilingual projection model through a joint approach.","According to following observation: unsupervised induction model mines underlying syntactic structure of the monolingual language, however, it is hard to find good grammar induction in the exponential parsing space; bilingual projection obtains relatively reliable syntactic knowledge of the parsed counterpart, but it possibly contains a lot of noises (e.g. Figure 2). We believe that unsupervised model and projection model can comple-ment each other and a joint model which takes better use of both unsupervised parse trees and projected dependency arcs can give us a better parser.","Based on the idea, we propose a novel strategy for training monolingual grammar induction model with the guidance of unsupervised and bilingually-projected dependency information. Figure 1 outlines our bilingual-guided grammar induction process in its entirety. In our method, we select compatible objectives for unsupervised and projection models, in order to they can share the same grammar parameters. Then we incorporate projection model into our iterative unsupervised framework, and jointly optimize unsupervised and projection objectives with evolv-ing treebank and constant projection information respectively. In this way, our bilingually-guided model’s parameters are tuned to simultaneously maximizing both monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood by 4 steps:","1. Randomly build treebank on target sentences for initialization, and get the projected arc instances through projection from bitext.","2. Train the bilingually-guided grammar induction model by multi-objective optimization method with unsupervised objective and projection objective on treebank and projected arc instances respectively.","3. Use the parsing model to build new treebank on target language for next iteration. 4. Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 until convergence.","The unsupervised objective is optimized by the loop—”tree bank→optimized model→new tree bank”. The treebank is evolved for runs. The unsupervised model gets projection constraint implicitly from those parse trees which contain information from projection part. The projection objective is optimized by the circulation—”projected instances→optimized model”, these projected instances will not change once we get them.","The iterative procedure proposed here is not a co-training algorithm (Sarkar, 2001; Hwa et al., 2003), because the input of the projection objective is static. 1066 4.1 Joint Objective For multi-objective optimization method, we employ the classical weighted-sum approach which just calculates the weighted linear sum of the objectives:","OBJ = ∑ m weightm\\u{6f62}j m (8)","We combine the unsupervised objective (Formula (6)) and projection objective (Formula (7)) together through the weighted-sum approach in Formula (8): l(λ) = αθ2(λ) + (1 − α)φ(λ) (9) where l(λ) is our weight-sum objective. And α is a mixing coefficient which reflects the relative confidence between the unsupervised and projection objectives. Equally, α and (1− α) can be seen as the weights in Formula (8). In that case, we can use a single parameter α to control both weights for different objective functions. When α = 1 it is the unsupervised objective function in Formula (6). Contrary, if α = 0, it is the projection objective function (Formula (7)) for projected instances.","With this approach, we can optimize the mixed parsing model by maximizing the objective in Formula (9). Though the function (Formula (9)) is an interpolation function, we use it for training instead of parsing. In the parsing procedure, our method calculates the probability of a dependency arc according to the Formula (2), while the interpolating method calculates it by: P r(y|deij ) =αP r1(y|deij ) + (1 − α)P r2(y|deij ) (10) where P r1(y|deij ) and P r2(y|deij ) are the probabilities provided by different models. 4.2 Training Algorithm We optimize the objective (Formula (9)) via a gradient-based search algorithm. And the gradient with respect to λk takes the form:","∇l(λk) = α ∂θ2(λ) ∂λk + (1 − α) ∂φ(λ)","∂λk (11)","Algorithm 3 outlines our joint training procedure, which tunes the grammar parameter λ simultaneously maximize both unsupervised objective Algorithm 3 Training joint model 1: DP , DN ← proj(F , DF , A, E) 2: build random DE 3: λ ← train(DP , DN ) 4: repeat 5: for each E ∈ E do ▷ E step 6: DE ← parse(E, λ) 7: ∇l(λ) ← grad(DE, D̃E, DP , DN , l(λ)) 8: λ ←climb(l(λ), ∇l(λ), λ) ▷ M step 9: until convergence and projection objective. And it incorporates unsupervised framework and projection model algorithm together. It is grounded on the work which uses features in the unsupervised model (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).","In line 1, 2 we get projected dependency instances from source side according to projection methods and build a random treebank (step 1). Then we train an initial model with projection instances in line 3. From line 4-9, the objective is optimized with a generic optimization step in the subroutine climb(·, ·, ·, ·, ·). For each sentence we parse its dependency tree, and update the tree into the treebank (step 3). Then we calculate the gradient and optimize the joint objective according to the evolved treebank and projected instances (step 2).

By simultaneously maximizing the monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood in the EM procedure, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction. Experiments on 5 languages show that the novel strategy significantly outperforms previous unsupervised or bilingually-projected models. Since its computational complexity approaches to the skeleton unsupervised model (with much few-er iterations), and the bilingual text aligned to 1070 resource-rich languages is easy to obtain, such a hybrid method seems to be a better choice for automatic grammar induction. It also indicates that the combination of bilingual constraint and unsupervised methodology has a promising prospect for grammar induction.
