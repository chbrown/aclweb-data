Low-quality bilingual data tends to produce incorrect translation knowledge and also degrades translation modeling performance. Previous work often used supervised learning methods to filter low-quality data, but a fair amount of human labeled examples are needed which are not easy to obtain. To reduce the reliance on labeled examples, we propose an unsupervised method to clean bilingual data. The method leverages the mutual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that better sentence pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa.

In real-world SMT systems, bilingual data is often mined from the web where low-quality data is in-evitable. The low-quality bilingual data degrades the quality of word alignment and leads to the incorrect phrase pairs, which will hurt the translation performance of phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). Therefore, it is very important to exploit data quality in-formation to improve the translation modeling.","Previous work on bilingual data cleaning often involves some supervised learning methods. Several bilingual data mining systems (Resnik and","∗","This work has been done while the first author was visit-ing Microsoft Research Asia. Smith, 2003; Shi et al., 2006; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Jiang et al., 2009) have a postprocessing step for data cleaning. Maximum entropy or SVM based classifiers are built to filter some non-parallel data or partial-parallel data. Although these methods can filter some low-quality bilingual data, they need sufficient human labeled training instances to build the model, which may not be easy to acquire.","To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to clean the bilingual data. It is intuitive that high-quality parallel data tends to produce better phrase pairs than low-quality data. Mean-while, it is also observed that the phrase pairs that appear frequently in the bilingual corpus are more reliable than less frequent ones because they are more reusable, hence most good sentence pairs are prone to contain more frequent phrase pairs (Foster et al., 2006; Wuebker et al., 2010). This kind of mutual reinforcement fits well into the framework of graph-based random walk. When a phrase pair p is extracted from a sentence pair s, s is considered casting a vote for p. The higher the number of votes a phrase pair has, the more reliable of the phrase pair. Similarly, the quality of the sentence pair s is determined by the number of votes casted by the extracted phrase pairs from s.","In this paper, a PageRank-style random walk algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007) is conducted to iteratively compute the importance score of each sentence pair that indicates its quality: the higher the better. Unlike other data filtering methods, our proposed method utilizes the importance scores of sentence pairs as fractional counts to calculate the phrase translation probabilities based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), thereby none of the bilingual data is filtered out. Experimental results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the performance in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks. 340"]},{"title":"2 The Proposed Approach 2.1 Graph-based random walk","paragraphs":["Graph-based random walk is a general algorithm to approximate the importance of a vertex within the graph in a global view. In our method, the vertices denote the sentence pairs and phrase pairs. The importance of each vertex is propagated to other vertices along the edges. Depending on different scenarios, the graph can take directed or undirected, weighted or un-weighted forms. Start-ing from the initial scores assigned in the graph, the algorithm is applied to recursively compute the importance scores of vertices until it converges, or the difference between two consecutive iterations falls below a pre-defined threshold. 2.2 Graph construction Given the sentence pairs that are word-aligned automatically, an undirected, weighted bipartite graph is constructed which maps the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs to the vertices. An edge between a sentence pair vertex and a phrase pair vertex is added if the phrase pair can be extracted from the sentence pair. Mutual reinforcement scores are defined on edges, through which the importance scores are propagated between vertices. Figure 1 illustrates the graph structure. Formally, the bipartite graph is defined as: G = (V, E) where V = S ∪ P is the vertex set, S = {si|1 ≤ i ≤ n} is the set of all sentence pairs. P = {pj|1 ≤ j ≤ m} is the set of all phrase pairs which are extracted from S based on the word alignment. E is the edge set in which the edges are between S and P , thereby E = {⟨si, pj⟩|si ∈ S, pj ∈ P, φ(si, pj) = 1}. φ(si, pj) =","{ 1 if pj can be extracted from si 0 otherwise 2.3 Graph parameters For sentence-phrase mutual reinforcement, a nonnegative score r(si, pj) is defined using the standard TF-IDF formula:","r(si, pj) =","{ P F (si,pj)×IP F (pj)","∑ p′ ∈{p|φ(s","i,p)=1} P F (si,p′",")×IP F (p′",") if φ(si, pj) = 1 0 otherwise Sentence Pair Vertices Phrase Pair Vertices"]},{"title":"s1 s2 s3 p1 p3 p4 p5 p6 p2","paragraphs":["Figure 1: The circular nodes stand for S and square nodes stand for P . The lines capture the sentence-phrase mutual reinforcement. where P F (si, pj) is the phrase pair frequency in a sentence pair and IP F (pj) is the inverse phrase pair frequency of pj in the whole bilingual corpus. r(si, pj) is abbreviated as rij.","Inspired by (Brin and Page, 1998; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007), we compute the importance scores of sentence pairs and phrase pairs using a PageRank-style algorithm. The weights rij are leveraged to reflect the relationships between two types of vertices. Let u(si) and v(pj) denote the scores of a sentence pair vertex and a phrase pair vertex. They are computed iteratively by: u(si) = (1 − d) + d × ∑ j∈N(si) rij","∑ k∈M(pj) rkj v(pj) v(pj) = (1 − d) + d × ∑ j∈M(pj) rij","∑ k∈N(si) rik u(si) where d is empirically set to the default value 0.85 that is same as the original PageRank, N (si) = {j|⟨si, pj⟩ ∈ E}, M (pj) = {i|⟨si, pj⟩ ∈ E}. The detailed process is illustrated in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 iteratively updates the scores of sentence pairs and phrase pairs (lines 10-26). The computation ends when difference between two consecutive iterations is lower than a pre-defined threshold δ (10−12","in this study). 2.4 Parallelization When the random walk runs on some large bilingual corpora, even filtering phrase pairs that appear only once would still require several days of CPU time for a number of iterations. To over-come this problem, we use a distributed algorithm 341 Algorithm 1 Modified Random Walk 1: for all i ∈ {0 . . . |S| − 1} do 2: u(si)(0)","← 1 3: end for 4: for all j ∈ {0 . . . |P | − 1} do 5: v(pj)(0)","← 1 6: end for 7: δ ← Infinity 8: ε ← threshold 9: n ← 1 10: while δ > ε do 11: for all i ∈ {0 . . . |S| − 1} do 12: F (si) ← 0 13: for all j ∈ N(si) do 14: F (si) ← F (si) + r ij","∑","k∈M(p","j) r","kj · v(pj)(n−1) 15: end for 16: u(si)(n)","← (1 − d) + d · F (si) 17: end for 18: for all j ∈ {0 . . . |P | − 1} do 19: G(pj) ← 0 20: for all i ∈ M(pj) do 21: G(pj) ← G(pj) + r ij","∑","k∈N(s i) r","ik · u(si)(n−1) 22: end for 23: v(pj)(n)","← (1 − d) + d · G(pj) 24: end for 25: δ ← max(△u(si)||S|−1","i=1 , △v(pj)||P|−1","j=1 ) 26: n ← n + 1 27: end while 28: return u(si)(n)","||S|−1","i=0 based on the iterative computation in the Sec-tion 2.3. Before the iterative computation starts, the sum of the outlink weights for each vertex is computed first. The edges are randomly partitioned into sets of roughly equal size. Each edge ⟨si, pj⟩ can generate two key-value pairs in the format ⟨si, rij⟩ and ⟨pj, rij⟩. The pairs with the same key are summed locally and accumulated across different machines. Then, in each iteration, the score of each vertex is updated according to the sum of the normalized inlink weights. The key-value pairs are generated in the format ⟨si, rij","∑ k∈M(p","j) rkj · v(pj)⟩ and ⟨pj,","rij","∑","k∈N(s","i) rik · u(si)⟩. These key-value pairs are also randomly partitioned and summed across different machines. Since long sentence pairs usually extract more phrase pairs, we need to normalize the importance scores based on the sentence length. The algorithm fits well into the MapReduce programming model (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008) and we use it as our implementation. 2.5 Integration into translation modeling After sufficient number of iterations, the importance scores of sentence pairs (i.e., u(si)) are obtained. Instead of simple filtering, we use the scores of sentence pairs as the fractional counts to re-estimate the translation probabilities of phrase pairs. Given a phrase pair p = ⟨ f̄ , ē⟩, A( f̄ ) and B(ē) indicate the sets of sentences that f̄ and ē appear. Then the translation probability is defined as: PCW( f̄ |ē) =","∑ i∈A( f̄)∩B(ē) u(si) × ci( f̄ , ē) ∑","j∈B(ē) u(sj) × cj(ē) where ci(·) denotes the count of the phrase or phrase pair in si. PCW( f̄ |ē) and PCW(ē| f̄ ) are named as Corpus Weighting (CW) based translation probability, which are integrated into the log-linear model in addition to the conventional phrase translation probabilities (Koehn et al., 2003)."]},{"title":"3 Experiments 3.1 Setup","paragraphs":["We evaluated our bilingual data cleaning approach on large-scale Chinese-to-English machine translation tasks.

The language model was trained on the LDC English Gigaword Version 4.0 plus the English part of the bilingual corpus. The lexicalized reordering model (Xiong et al., 2006) was trained over the 40% randomly sampled sentence pairs from our parallel data. Case-insensitive BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002) was used as the evaluation metric. The parameters of the log-linear model are tuned by optimiz-ing BLEU on the development data using MERT (Och, 2003). Statistical significance test was performed using the bootstrap re-sampling method proposed by Koehn (2004). 3.2 Baseline The experimental results are shown in Table 2. In the baseline system, the phrase pairs that appear only once in the bilingual data are simply discarded because most of them are noisy. In addition, the fix-discount method in (Foster et al., 2006) for phrase table smoothing is also used. This implementation makes the baseline system perform much better and the model size is much smaller. In fact, the basic idea of our ”one count” cutoff is very similar to the idea of ”leaving-one-out” in (Wuebker et al., 2010). The results show 未经 探索 的 新 领域 uncharted waters 未经 探索 的 新 领域 unexplored new areas weijing tansuo de xin lingyu Figure 2: The left one is the non-literal translation in our bilingual corpus. The right one is the literal translation made by human for comparison. that the ”leaving-one-out” method performs al-most the same as our baseline, thereby cannot bring other benefits to the system. 3.3 Results We evaluate the proposed bilingual data cleaning method by incorporating sentence scores into translation modeling. In addition, we also compare with several settings that filtering low-quality sentence pairs from the bilingual data based on the importance scores. The last N = { 0.25M, 0.5M, 1M } sentence pairs are filtered before the modeling process. Although the simple bilingual data filtering can improve the performance on some datasets, it is difficult to determine the border line and translation performance is fluctuated. One main reason is in the proposed random walk approach, the bilingual sentence pairs with non-literal translations may get lower scores because they appear less frequently compared with those literal translations. Crudely filtering out these data may degrade the translation performance. For example, we have a sentence pair in the bilingual corpus shown in the left part of Figure 2. Although the translation is correct in this situation, translat-ing the Chinese word ”lingyu” to ”waters” appears very few times since the common translations are ”areas” or ”fields”. However, simply filtering out this kind of sentence pairs may lead to some loss of native English expressions, thereby the trans-343 lation performance is unstable since both non-parallel sentence pairs and non-literal but parallel sentence pairs are filtered. Therefore, we use the importance score of each sentence pair to estimate the phrase translation probabilities. It consistently brings substantial improvements compared to the baseline, which demonstrates graph-based random walk indeed improves the translation modeling performance for our SMT system. 3.4 Discussion In (Goutte et al., 2012), they evaluated phrase-based SMT systems trained on parallel data with different proportions of synthetic noisy data. They suggested that when collecting larger, noisy parallel data for training phrase-based SMT, cleaning up by trying to detect and remove incorrect alignments can actually degrade performance. Our experimental results confirm their findings on some datasets. Based on our method, some-times filtering noisy data leads to unexpected results. The reason is two-fold: on the one hand, the non-literal parallel data makes false positive in noisy data detection; on the other hand, large-scale SMT systems is relatively robust and tolerant to noisy data, especially when we remove frequency-1 phrase pairs. Therefore, we propose to integrate the importance scores when re-estimating phrase pair probabilities in this paper. The importance scores can be considered as a kind of contribution constraint, thereby high-quality parallel data contributes more while noisy parallel data contributes less."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we develop an effective approach to clean the bilingual data using graph-based random walk.
