The proposed approach is based on a graph-based label propagation technique. One constructs a nearest-neighbor similarity graph over all trigrams of labeled and unlabeled data for propagating syntactic information, i.e., label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as virtual evidences to regularize the learning of linear conditional random fields (CRFs) on unlabeled data. An inductive character-based joint model is obtained eventually. Empirical results on Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research corpora (MSR) reveal that the proposed model can yield better results than the supervised baselines and other competitive semi-supervised CRFs in this task."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are two critical and necessary initial procedures with respect to the majority of high-level Chinese language processing tasks such as syntax parsing, information extraction and machine translation. The traditional way of segmentation and tagging is performed in a pipeline approach, first segmenting a sentence into words, and then assigning each word a POS tag. The pipeline approach is very simple to implement, but frequently causes error propagation, given that wrong segmentations in the earlier stage harm the subsequent POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004). The joint approaches of word segmentation and POS tagging (joint S&T) are proposed to resolve these two tasks simultaneously. They effectively alleviate the error propagation, because segmentation and tagging have strong interaction, given that most segmentation ambiguities cannot be resolved without considering the surrounding grammatical constructions encoded in a POS sequence (Qian and Liu, 2012).","In the past years, several proposed supervised joint models (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Jiang et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010) achieved reasonably accurate results, but the outstanding problem among these models is that they rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data, i.e., segmented texts with POS tags. However, the production of such labeled data is extremely timeconsuming and expensive (Jiao et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2009). Therefore, semi-supervised joint S&T appears to be a natural solution for easily incorporating accessible unlabeled data to improve the joint S&T model. This study focuses on using a graph-based label propagation method to build a semi-supervised joint S&T model. Graph-based label propagation methods have recently shown they can outperform the state-of-the-art in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks, e.g., POS tagging (Subramanya et al., 2010), knowledge acquisition (Talukdar et al., 2008), shallow semantic parsing for unknown predicate (Das and Smith, 2011). As far as we know, however, these methods have not yet been applied to resolve the problem of joint Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and POS tagging.","Motivated by the works in (Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and Smith, 2011), for structured problems, graph-based label propagation can be employed to infer valuable syntactic information (n-gram-level label distributions) from labeled data to unlabeled data. This study extends this intuition to construct a similarity graph for propagating trigram-level label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as prior knowledge to regularize the learning of a sequential model, conditional random fields (CRFs) in this case, on both 770 labeled and unlabeled data to achieve the semi-supervised learning. The approach performs the incorporation of the derived labeled distributions by manipulating a “virtual evidence” function as described in (Li, 2009). Experiments on the data from the Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research (MSR) show that the proposed model results in significant improvement over other comparative candidates in terms of F-score and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recall.","This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 points out the main differences with the related work of this study. Section 3 reviews the background, including supervised character-based joint S&T model based on CRFs and graph-based label propagation. Section 4 presents the details of the proposed approach. Section 5 reports the experiment results. The conclusion is drawn in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Prior supervised joint S&T models present approximate 0.2% - 1.3% improvement in F-score over supervised pipeline ones. The state-of-the-art joint models include reranking approaches (Shi and Wang, 2007), hybrid approaches (Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; Sun, 2011), and single-model approaches (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Zhang and Clark, 2010). The proposed approach in this paper belongs to the single-model type.","There are few explorations of semi-supervised approaches for CWS or POS tagging in previous works. Xu et al. (2008) described a Bayesian semi-supervised CWS model by considering the segmentation as the hidden variable in machine translation. Unlike this model, the proposed approach is targeted at a general model, instead of one oriented to machine translation task. Sun and Xu (2011) enhanced a CWS model by interpolat-ing statistical features of unlabeled data into the CRFs model. Wang et al. (2011) proposed a semi-supervised pipeline S&T model by incorporating n-gram and lexicon features derived from unlabeled data. Different from their concern, our emphasis is to learn the semi-supervised model by injecting the label information from a similarity graph constructed from labeled and unlabeled data. The induction method of the proposed approach also differs from other semi-supervised CRFs algorithms. Jiao et al. (2006), extended by Mann and McCallum (2007), reported a semi-supervised CRFs model which aims to guide the learning by minimizing the conditional entropy of unlabeled data. The proposed approach regularizes the CRFs by the graph information. Subramanya et al. (2010) proposed a graph-based self-train style semi-supervised CRFs algorithm. In the proposed approach, an analogous way of graph construction intuition is applied. But overall, our approach differs in three important aspects: first, novel feature templates are defined for measuring the similarity between vertices. Second, the critical property, i.e., sparsity, is considered among label propagation. And third, the derived label information from the graph is smoothed into the model by optimiz-ing a modified objective function."]},{"title":"3 Background 3.1 Supervised Character-based Model","paragraphs":["The character-based joint S&T approach is operated as a sequence labeling fashion that each Chinese character, i.e., hanzi, in the sequence is assigned with a tag. To perform segmentation and tagging simultaneously in a uniform framework, according to Ng and Low (2004), the tag is composed of a word boundary part, and a POS part, e.g., “B NN” refers to the first character in a word with POS tag “NN”. In this paper, 4 word boundary tags are employed: B (beginning of a word), M (middle part of a word), E (end of a word) and S (single character). As for the POS tag, we shal-l use the 33 tags in the Chinese tree bank. Thus, the potential composite tags of joint S&T consist of 132 (4×33) classes.","The first-order CRFs model (Lafferty et al., 2001) has been the most common one in this task.

Most of these algorithms are transductive in nature, so they cannot be used to predict an unseen test example in the future (Belkin et al., 2006). Typically, graph-based label propagation algorithms are run in two main steps: graph construction and label propagation. The graph construction provides a natural way to represent data in a variety of target domains. One constructs a graph whose vertices consist of labeled and unlabeled examples. Pairs of vertices are connected by weighted edges which encode the degree to which they are expected to have the same label (Zhu et al., 2003). Popular graph construction methods include k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) (Bentley, 1980; Beygelzimer et al., 2006), b-matching (Jebara et al., 2009) and local recon-struction (Daitch et al., 2009). Label propagation operates on the constructed graph. The primary objective is to propagate labels from a few labeled vertices to the entire graph by optimiz-ing a loss function based on the constraints or properties derived from the graph, e.g., smoothness (Zhu et al., 2003; Subramanya et al., 2010; Talukdar et al., 2008), or sparsity (Das and Smith, 2012). State-of-the-art label propagation algorithms include LP-ZGL (Zhu et al., 2003), Adsorption (Baluja et al., 2008), MAD (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) and Sparse Inducing Penalties (Das and Smith, 2012)."]},{"title":"4 Method","paragraphs":["The emphasis of this work is on building a joint S&T model based on two different kinds of data sources, labeled and unlabeled data. In essence, this learning problem can be treated as incorporating certain gainful information, e.g., prior knowledge or label constraints, of unlabeled data into the supervised model. The proposed approach employs a transductive graph-based label propagation method to acquire such gainful information, i.e., label distributions from a similarity graph constructed over labeled and unlabeled data. Then, the derived label distributions are injected as virtual evidences for guiding the learning of CRFs.","Algorithm 1 semi-supervised joint S&T induction","Input: Dl = {(xi, yi)}l","i=1 labeled sentences Du = {(xi)}l+u","i=l+1 unlabeled sentences Output:","Λ: a set of feature weights 1: Begin 2: {G} = construct graph (Dl, Du) 3: {q0} = init labelDist ({G}) 4: {q} = propagate label ({G}, {q0}) 5: {Λ} = train crf (Dl ∪ Du, {q}) 6: End","The model induction includes the following steps (see Algorithm 1): firstly, given labeled and unlabeled data, i.e., Dl = {(xi, yi)}l","i=1 with l labeled sentences and Du = {(xi)}l+u","i=l+1 with u unlabeled sentences, a specific similarity graph G representing Dl and Du is constructed (construct graph). The vertices (Section 4.1) in the constructed graph consist of all trigrams that occur in labeled and unlabeled sentences, and edge weights between vertices are computed using the cosine distance between pointwise mutual information (PMI) statistics. Afterwards, the estimated label distributions q0 of vertices in the graph G are randomly initialized (init labelDist). Subsequently, 772 the label propagation procedure (propagate label) is conducted for projecting label distributions q from labeled vertices to the entire graph, using the algorithm of Sparse-Inducing Penalties (Das and Smith, 2012) (Section 4.2). The final step (train crf) of the induction is incorporating the inferred trigram-level label distributions q into CRFs model (Section 4.3). 4.1 Graph Construction In most graph-based label propagation tasks, the final effect depends heavily on the quality of the graph. Graph construction thus plays a central role in graph-based label propagation (Zhu et al., 2003). For character-based joint S&T, unlike the unstructured learning problem whose vertices are formed directly by labeled and unlabeled instances, the graph construction is non-trivial. Das and Petrov (2011) mentioned that taking individual characters as the vertices would result in various ambiguities, whereas the similarity measurement is still challenging if vertices corresponding to entire sentences.","This study follows the intuitions of graph construction from Subramanya et al. (2010) in which vertices are represented by character trigrams occurring in labeled and unlabeled sentences. For-mally, given a set of labeled sentences Dl, and unlabeled ones Du, where D ≜ {Dl, Du}, the goal is to form an undirected weighted graph G = (V, E), where V is defined as the set of vertices which covers all trigrams extracted from Dl and Du. Here, V = Vl ∪ Vu, where Vl refers to trigrams that occurs at least once in labeled sentences and Vu refers to trigrams that occur only in unlabeled sentences. The edges E ∈ Vl × Vu, connect all the vertices. This study makes use of a symmetric k-NN graph (k = 5) and the edge weights are measured by a symmetric similarity function (Equation (3)): wi,j =","{ sim(xi, xj) if j ∈ K(i) or i ∈ K(j) 0 otherwise","(3) where K(i) is the set of the k nearest neighbors of xi(|K(i) = k, ∀i|) and sim(xi, xj) is a similarity measure between two vertices. The similarity is computed based on the co-occurrence statistics over the features in Table 2. Most features we adopted are selected from those of (Subramanya et al., 2010). Note that a novel feature in the last row encodes the classes of surrounding characters, where four types are defined: number, punctuation, alphabetic letter and other. It is especially helpful for the graph to make connections with trigrams that may not have been seen in labeled data but have similar label information. The pointwise mutual information values between the trigrams and each feature instantiation that they have in common are summed to sparse vectors, and their cosine distances are computed as the similarities.","Description Feature Trigram + Context x1x2x3x4x5","Trigram x2x3x4","Left Context x1x2 Right Context x4x5 Center Word x3","Trigram - Center Word x2x4","Left Word + Right Context x2x4x5","Right Word + Left Context x1x2x3","Type of Trigram: number,","punctuation, alphabetic letter","and other t(x2)t(x3)t(x4) Table 2: Features employed to measure the similarity between two vertices, in a given text “ x1x2x3x4x5”, where the trigram is “ x2x3x4”.","The nature of the similarity graph enforces that the connected trigrams with high weight appearing in different texts should have similar syntax configurations. Thus, the constructed graph is expected to provide additional information that cannot be expressed directly in a sequence model (Subramanya et al., 2010). One primary benefit of this property is on enriching vocabulary coverage. In other words, the new features of various trigrams only occurring in unlabeled data can be discovered. As the excerpt in Figure 1 shows, the trigram “ 天津港” (Tianjin port) has no any label information, as it only occurs in unlabeled data, but for-tunately its neighborhoods with similar syntax information, e.g., “ 上海港” (Shanghai port), “ 广州 港” (Guangzhou port), can assist to infer the correct tag “M NN”. 4.2 Label Propagation In order to induce trigram-level label distributions from the graph constructed by the previous step, a label propagation algorithm, Sparsity-Inducing Penalties, proposed by Das and Smith (2012), is employed. This algorithm is used because it captures the property of sparsity that only a few labels 773 Figure 1: An excerpt from the similarity graph over trigrams on labeled and unlabeled data. are typically associated with a given instance. In fact, the sparsity is also a common phenomenon among character-based CWS and POS tagging. The following convex objective is optimized on the similarity graph in this case:","argmin q l ∑ j=1 ∥ qj − rj ∥2 +μ l+u ∑ i=1,k∈N (i)","wik ∥ qi − qk ∥2 +λ l+u ∑ i=1 ∥ qi ∥2 s.t. qi ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ V","(4) where rj denotes empirical label distributions of labeled vertices, and qi denotes unnormalized estimate measures in every vertex. The wik refers to the similarity between the ith trigram and the kth trigram, and N (i) is a set of neighbors of the ith trigram. μ and λ are two hyperparameters whose values are discussed in Section 5. The squared-loss criterion1","is used to formulate the objective function. The first term in Equation (4) is the seed match loss which penalizes the estimated label distributions qj, if they go too far away from the empirical labeled distributions rj. The second term is the edge smoothness loss that requires qi should be smooth with respect to the graph, such that two vertices connected by an edge with high weight should be assigned similar labels. The final term is a regularizer to incorporate the prior knowledge, e.g., uniform distributions used in (Talukdar et al., 2008; Das and Smith, 2011). This study applies the squared norm of q to encourage sparsity per vertex. Note that the estimated label distribution","1","It can be seen as a multi-class extension of quadratic cost criterion (Bengio et al., 2006) or as a variant of the objective in (Zhu et al., 2003). An entropic distance measure could also be used, e.g., KL-divergence (Subramanya et al., 2010; Das and Smith, 2012). qi in Equation (4) is relaxed to be unnormalized, which simplifies the optimization. Thus, the objective function can be optimized by L-BFGS-B (Zhu et al., 1997), a generic quasi-Newton gradient-based optimizer. The partial derivatives of Equation (4) are computed for each parameter of q and then passed on to the optimizer that updates them such that Equation (4) is maximized. 4.3 Semi-Supervised CRFs Training The trigram-level label distributions inferred in the propagation step can be viewed as a kind of valuable “prior knowledge” to regularize the learning on unlabeled data. The final step of the induction is thus to incorporate such prior knowledge into CRFs. Li (2009) generalizes the use of virtual evidence to undirected graphical models and, in particular, to CRFs for incorporating external knowledge. By extending the similar intuition, as illustrated in Figure 2, we modify the structure of a regular linear-chain CRFs on unlabeled data for smoothing the derived label distributions, where virtual evidences, i.e., q in our case, are donated by {v1, v2, . . . , vT }, in parallel with the state variables {y1, y2, . . . , yT }. The modified CRFs model allows us to flexibly define the interaction between estimated state values and virtual evidences by potential functions. Therefore, given labeled and unlabeled data, the learning objective is defined as follows: L(Λ) + l+u ∑ i=l+1","Ep(yi|xi,vi;Λg )[log p(yi, vi|xi; Λ)]","(5) where the conditional probability in the second term is denoted as p(yi, vi|xi; Λ) = 1","Z′ (xi; Λ) exp{ N ∑ j=1 K ∑ k=1 λkfk(y j−1 i , y j i , xi, j) +α N ∑ t=1","s(yt i , vt","i )}","(6) The first term in Equation (5) is the same as Equation (2), which is the traditional CRFs learning objective function on the labeled data. The second term is the expected conditional likelihood of unlabeled data. It is directed to maximize the conditional likelihood of hidden states with the derived label distributions on unlabeled data, i.e., p(y, v|x), where y and v are jointly modeled but 774 the probability is still conditional on x. Here, Z′","(x; Λ) is the partition function of normalization that is achieved by summing the numerator over both y and v. A virtual evidence feature function of s(yt","i , vt","i ) with pre-defined weight α is defined to regularize the conditional distributions of states over the derived label distributions. The learning is impacted by the derived label distributions as Equation (7): firstly, if the trigram xt−1","i xt","ixt+1","i at current position does have no corresponding derived label distributions (vt","i = null), the value of zero is assigned to all state hypotheses so that the posteriors would not affected by the derived information. Secondly, if it does have a derived label distribution, since the virtual evidence in this case is a distribution instead of a specific label, the label probability in the distribution under the current state hypothesis is assigned. This means that the values of state variables are constrained to agree with the derived distributions.","s(yt i , vt","i ) =","{","qxt−1 i xt","ixt+1","i","(yt i ) if vt","i ̸= null 0 else","(7) The second term in Equation (5) can be optimized by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in the same fashion as in the generative approach, following (Li, 2009). One can iteratively optimize the Q function Q(Λ) =∑","y p(yi|xi; Λg",") log p(y","i, vi|xi; Λ), in which Λg","is the model estimated from the previous iteration. Here the gradient of the Q function can be measured by: ∂Q(Λ) ∂Λk = ∑ t ∑ yt−1 i ,yt","i","fk(yt−1 i , yt","i , xi, t).","(p(yt−1","i , yt i |xi, vi; Λ) − p(yt−1","i , yt","i |xi; Λ)) (8) The forward-backward algorithm is used to measure p(yt−1","i , yt","i |xi, vi; Λ) and p(yt−1","i , yt","i |xi; Λ). Thus, the objective function Equation (5) is optimized as follows: for the instances i = 1, 2, ..., l, the parameters Λ are learned as the supervised manner; for the instances i = l + 1, l + 2, ..., u + l, in the E-step, the expected value of Q function is computed, based on the current model Λg",". In the M-step, the posteriors are fixed and updatedΛ that maximizes Equation (5).

In addition, two state-of-the-art semi-supervised CRFs algorithms, Jiao’s CRFs (Jiao et al., 2006) and Subramanya’s CRFs (Subramanya et al., 2010), are also used to build joint S&T models.

The majority (317,677 trigrams) occurred only in unlabeled data. Based on the development data, the hyperparameters of our model were tuned among the following settings: for the graph propagation, μ ∈ {0.2, 0.5, 0.8} and λ ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8}; for the CRFs training, α ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}. The best performed joint settings are μ = 0.5, λ = 0.3 and α = 0.7. With the chosen set of hyperparameters, the test data was used to measure the final performance.

Firstly, as expected, for the two supervised baselines, the joint model outperforms the pipeline one, especially on segmentation. It obtains 0.92% and 2.32% increase in terms of F-score and OOV-R respectively. This outcome verifies the commonly accepted fact that the joint model can substantially improve the pipeline one, since POS tags provide additional information to word segmentation (Ng and Low, 2004). Secondly, it is also noticed that all four semi-supervised models are able to benefit from unlabeled data and greatly improve the results with respect to the baselines. On the whole, for segmentation, they achieve average improvements of 1.02% and 6.8% in F-score and OOV-R; whereas for POS tagging, the average increments of F-sore and OOV-R are 0.87% and 6.45%. An interesting phenomenon is found among the comparisons with baselines that the supervised joint model (Baseline II) is even competitive with semi-supervised pipeline one (Wang et al., 2011). This illustrates the effects of error propagation in the pipeline approach. Thirdly, in what concerns the semi-supervised approaches, the three joint S&T models, i.e., Jiao’s, Subramanya’s and our model, are superior to the pipeline model, i.e., Wang’s 776 model. Moreover, the two graph-based approaches, i.e., Subramanya’s and our model, outperform the others. Most importantly, the boldface numbers in the last row illustrate that our model does achieve the best performance. Overall, for word segmentation, it obtains average improvements of 1.43% and 8.09% in F-score and OOV-R over others; for POS tagging, it achieves average improvements of 1.09% and 7.73%.","","","","","","","                  ","","","","","","                                                                                                  ","","","","","","","                  ","","","","","","                                                                                          ","","","","","","","                  ","","","","","","                                                                                    ","","","","","","","                  ","","","","","","                    ","","","","                                                                 Figure 3: The learning curves of semi-supervised models on unlabeled data, where left graphs are segmentation and the right ones are tagging. 5.4 Learning Curve An additional experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of unlabeled data for the four semi-supervised models. Figure 3 illustrates the curves of F-score and OOV-R for segmentation and tagging respectively, as the unlabeled data size is progressively increased in steps of 6,000 sentences. It can be clearly observed that all curves of our model are able to mount up steadily and achieve better gains over others consistently. The most competitive performance of the other three candidates is achieved by Subramanya’s model. This strongly reveals that the knowledge derived from the similarity graph does effectively strengthen the model. But in Subramanya’s model, when the unlabeled size ascends to approximately 30,000 sentences the curves become nearly asymptotic. The semi-supervised pipeline model, Wang’s model, presents a much slower growth on all curves over the others and also begins to over-fit with large unlabeled data sizes (>25,000 sentences). The figure also shows an erratic fluctuation of Jiao’s model. Since this approach aims at minimizing conditional entropy over unlabeled data and encourages finding putative labelings for unlabeled data, it results in a data-sensitive model (Li et al., 2009). 5.5 Analysis & Discussion A statistical analysis of the segmentation and tagging results of the supervised joint model (Baseline II) and our model is carried out to comprehend the influence of the graph-based semi-supervised behavior. For word segmentation, the most significant improvement of our model is mainly concentrated on two kinds of words which are known for their difficulties in terms of CWS: a) named entities (NE), e.g., “ 天津港” (Tianjin port) and “ 保税 区” (free tax zone); and b) Chinese numbers (CN), e.g., “ 八点五亿” (eight hundred and fifty million) and “ 百分之七十二” (seventy two percent). Very often, these words do not exist in the labeled data, so the supervised model is hard to learn their features. Part of these words, however, may occur in the unlabeled data. The proposed semi-supervised approach is able to discover their label information with the help of a similarity graph. Specifically, it learns the label distributions from similar words (neighborhoods), e.g., “ 上海港” (Shanghai port), “ 保 护 区” (protection zone), “ 九 点 七 亿” (nine hundred and seventy million). The statistics in Table 5 demonstrate significant error reductions of 50.44% and 48.74% on test data, corresponding to NE and CN respectively.

The error pattern is defined by “A→B” that refers the true tag of “A” is annotated by a tag of “B”. The obvious improvement brought by our model occurs with the tags “NN”, “CD”, “NR”, “JJ” and “NR”, where errors are reduced 60.74% on aver-777 Pattern #baErr ↓ Pattern #baErr ↑ NN→VV 58 38 NN→NR 13 6 CD→NN 41 27 IJ→ON 9 5 NR→VV 29 17 VV→NN 4 3 JJ→NN 18 11 NR→NN 1 3 NR→VA 19 10 JJ→AD 1 2 Table 6: The statistics of POS tagging error patterns in test data. #baErr denote the count of tagging error by Baseline II, while ↓ and ↑ denotes the number of error reduced or increased by our model. age. More impressively, there is a large portion of fixed error pattern instances stemming from OOV words. Meanwhile, it is also observed that the disambiguation of error patterns in the right portion of the table slightly suffers from our approach. In reality, it is impossible and unrealistic to request a model to be “no harms but only benefits” under whatever circumstances."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This study introduces a novel semi-supervised approach for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. The approach performs the semi-supervised learning in the way that the trigram-level distributions inferred from a similarity graph are used to regularize the learning of CRFs model on labeled and unlabeled data. The empirical results indicate that the similarity graph information and the incorporation manner of virtual evidences present a positive effect to the model induction."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors are grateful to the Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau and the Research Committee of the University of Macau for the funding support for our research, under the reference No. 017/2009/A and RG060/09-10S/CS/FST.
