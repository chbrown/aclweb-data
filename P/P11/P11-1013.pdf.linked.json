Machine learning approaches to this problem (?; ?; ?; ?; ?; ?) typically assume that classification models are trained and tested using data drawn from some fixed distribution. However, in many practical cases, we may have plentiful labeled examples in the source domain, but very few or no labeled examples in the target domain with a different distribution. For example, we may have many labeled books reviews, but we are interested in detecting the polarity of electronics reviews. Reviews for different produces might have widely different vocabularies, thus classifiers trained on one domain often fail to produce satisfactory results when shifting to another domain. This has motivated much research on sentiment transfer learning which transfers knowledge from a source task or domain to a different but related task or domain (?; ?; ?; ?).","Joint sentiment-topic (JST) model (?; ?) was extended from the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model (?) to detect sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. The only supervision required by JST learning is domain-independent polarity word prior information. With prior polarity words extracted from both the MPQA subjectivity lexicon1 and the appraisal lexicon2",", the JST model achieves a sentiment classification accuracy of 74% on the movie review data3","and 71% on the multi-domain sentiment dataset4",". Moreover, it is also able to extract coherent and informative topics grouped under different sentiment. The fact that the JST model does not required any labeled documents for training makes it desirable for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. Many existing approaches solve the sentiment transfer problem by associating words 1 http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/ 2 http://lingcog.iit.edu/arc/appraisal_","lexicon_2007b.tar.gz 3 http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/","movie-review-data 4 http://www.cs.jhu.edu/m̃dredze/","datasets/sentiment/index2.html 123 from different domains which indicate the same sentiment (?; ?). Such an association mapping problem can be naturally solved by the posterior inference in the JST model. Indeed, the polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST essentially capture sentiment associations among words from different domains which effectively overcome the data distribution difference between source and target domains.","The previously proposed JST model uses the sentiment prior information in the Gibbs sampling inference step that a sentiment label will only be sampled if the current word token has no prior sentiment as defined in a sentiment lexicon. This in fact implies a different generative process where many of the word prior sentiment labels are observed. The model is no longer “latent”. We propose an alternative approach by incorporating word prior polarity information through modifying the topic-word Dirichlet priors. This essentially creates an informed prior distribution for the sentiment labels and would allow the model to actually be latent and would be consistent with the generative story.","We study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by the JST model and show that by augmenting the original feature space with polarity-bearing topics, the performance of in-domain supervised classifiers learned from augmented feature representation improves substantially, reaching the state-of-the-art results of 95% on the movie review data and an average of 90% on the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Furthermore, using simple feature augmentation, our proposed approach outperforms the structural correspondence learning (SCL) (?) algorithm and achieves comparable results to the recently proposed spectral feature alignment (SFA) method (?). Nevertheless, our approach is much simpler and does not require difficult parameter tuning.","We proceed with a review of related work on sentiment domain adaptation. We then briefly describe the JST model and present another approach to incorporate word prior polarity information into JST learning. We subsequently show that words from different domains can indeed be grouped under the same polarity-bearing topic through an illustration of example topic words extracted by JST before proposing a domain adaptation approach based on JST. We verify our proposed approach by conducting experiments on both the movie review data and the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Finally, we conclude our work and outline future directions."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been significant amount of work on algorithms for domain adaptation in NLP. Earlier work treats the source domain data as “prior knowledge” and uses maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation to learn a model for the target domain data under this prior distribution (?). Chelba and Acero (?) also uses the source domain data to estimate prior distribution but in the context of a maximum entropy (ME) model. The ME model has later been studied in (?) for domain adaptation where a mixture model is defined to learn differences between domains.","Other approaches rely on unlabeled data in the target domain to overcome feature distribution differences between domains. Motivated by the alternating structural optimization (ASO) algorithm (?) for multi-task learning, Blitzer et al. (?) proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from target domain, SCL selects a set of pivot features to link the source and target domains where pivots are selected based on their common frequency in both domains and also their mutual information with the source labels.","There has also been research in exploring careful structuring of features for domain adaptation. Daumé (?) proposed a kernel-mapping function which maps both source and target domains data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points from the same domain are twice as similar as those from different domains. Dai et al.(?) proposed translated learning which uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Dai et al. (?) further proposed using spectral learning theory to learn an eigen feature representation from a task graph representing features, instances and class labels. In a similar vein, Pan et al. (?) proposed the spectral feature alignment (SFA) algorithm where some domain-independent words are used as a bridge to construct a bipartite graph to model the co-occurrence relationship between domain-specific words and domain-independent words. Feature clusters are 124 generated by co-align domain-specific and domain-independent words.","Graph-based approach has also been studied in (?) where a graph is built with nodes denoting documents and edges denoting content similarity between documents. The sentiment score of each unlabeled documents is recursively calculated until convergence from its neighbors the actual labels of source domain documents and pseudo-labels of target document documents. This approach was later extended by simultaneously considering relations between documents and words from both source and target domains (?).","More recently, Seah et al. (?) addressed the issue when the predictive distribution of class label given input data of the domains differs and proposed Predictive Distribution Matching SVM learn a robust classifier in the target domain by leveraging the labeled data from only the relevant regions of multiple sources."]},{"title":"3 Joint Sentiment-Topic (JST) Model","paragraphs":["Assume that we have a corpus with a collection of D documents denoted by C = {d1, d2, ..., dD}; each document in the corpus is a sequence of Nd words denoted by d = (w1, w2, ..., wNd), and each word in the document is an item from a vocabulary index with V distinct terms denoted by {1, 2, ..., V }.

In this section, we study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST. We combined reviews from the source and target domains and discarded document labels in both domains. There are a total of six different combinations. We then run JST on the combined data sets and listed some of the topic words extracted as shown in Table ??. Words in each cell are grouped under one topic and the upper half of the table shows topic words under the positive sentiment label while the lower half shows topic words under the negative sentiment label.","We can see that JST appears to better capture sentiment association distribution in the source and target domains. For example, in the DVD+Elec. set, words from the DVD domain describe a rock concert DVD while words from the Electronics domain are likely relevant to stereo amplifiers and receivers, and yet they are grouped under the same topic by the JST model. Checking the word coverage in each domain reveals that for example “bass” seldom appears in the DVD domain, but appears more often in the Electronics domain. Likewise, in the Book+Kitch. set, “stainless” rarely appears in the Book domain and “interest” does not occur often in the Kitchen domain and they are grouped under the same topic. These observations motivate us to explore polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST for cross-domain sentiment classification since grouping words from different domains but bearing similar sentiment has the effect of overcoming the data distribution difference of two domains."]},{"title":"5 Domain Adaptation using JST","paragraphs":["Given input data x and a class label y, labeled patterns of one domain can be drawn from the joint distribution P (x, y) = P (y|x)P (x).

Preprocessing was performed on both of the datasets by removing punctuation, numbers, nonalphabet characters and stopwords. The MPQA subjectivity lexicon is used as a sentiment lexicon in our experiments. 6.1 Experimental Setup While the original JST model can produce reasonable results with a simple symmetric Dirichlet prior, here we use asymmetric prior α over the topic proportions which is learned directly from data using a fixed-point iteration method (?).","In our experiment, α was updated every 25 iterations during the Gibbs sampling procedure. In terms of other priors, we set symmetric prior β = 0.01 and γ = (0.05×L)/S, where L is the average document length, and the value of 0.05 on average allocates 5% of probability mass for mixing. 6.2 Supervised Sentiment Classification We performed 5-fold cross validation for the performance evaluation of supervised sentiment classification. Results reported in this section are averaged over 10 such runs. We have tested several classifiers including Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) and support vector machines (SVMs) from WEKA5",", and maximum entropy (ME) from MALLET6",". All parameters are set to their default values except the Gaussian 5 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 6 http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ 127 prior variance is set to 0.1 for the ME model training.

Thus, we only report results from ME trained on document vectors with each term weighted according to its frequency. 85 90 95 100 c c u r a c y  ( % ) MovieReview Book DVD Electronics Kitchen 75 80 85 90 95 100 1 5 10 15 30 50 100 150 200 A c c u r a c y  ( % ) No.ofTopics MovieReview Book DVD Electronics Kitchen Figure 2: Classification accuracy vs. no. of topics.","The only parameter we need to set is the number of topics T . It has to be noted that the actual number of feature clusters is 3 × T . For example, when T is set to 5, there are 5 topic groups under each of the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment labels and hence there are altogether 15 feature clusters. The generated topics for each document from the JST model were simply added into its bag-of-words (BOW) feature representation prior to model training. Figure ?? shows the classification results on the five different domains by varying the number of topics from 1 to 200. It can be observed that the best classification accuracy is obtained when the number of topics is set to 1 (or 3 feature clusters). Increasing the number of topics results in the decrease of accuracy though it stabilizes after 15 topics. Nevertheless, when the number of topics is set to 15, using JST feature augmentation still outperforms ME without feature augmentation (the baseline model) in all of the domains. It is worth pointing out that the JST model with single topic becomes the standard LDA model with only three sentiment topics. Nevertheless, we have proposed an effective way to incorporate domain-independent word polarity prior information into model learning. As will be shown later in Table ?? that the JST model with word polarity priors incorporated performs significantly better than the LDA model without incorporating such prior information.","For comparison purpose, we also run the LDA model and augmented the BOW features with the Method MR","MDS","Book DVD Elec.

The best accuracy was obtained when the number of topics is set to 15 in the LDA model. Table ?? shows the classification accuracy results with or without feature augmentation. We have performed significance test and found that LDA performs statistically significant better than Baseline according to a paired t-test with p < 0.005 for the Kitchen domain and with p < 0.001 for all the other domains. JST performs statistically significant better than both Baseline and LDA with p < 0.001.","We also compare our method with other recently proposed approaches. Yessenalina et al. (?) explored different methods to automatically generate annotator rationales to improve sentiment classification accuracy. Our method using JST feature augmentation consistently performs better than their approach (denoted as [YE10] in Table ??). They further proposed a two-level structured model (?) for document-level sentiment classification. The best accuracy obtained on the MR data is 93.22% with the model being initialized with sentence-level human annotations, which is still worse than ours. Li et al. (?) adopted a two-stage process by first classifying sentences as personal views and impersonal views and then using an ensemble method to perform sentiment classification. Their method (denoted as [LI10] in Table ??) performs worse than either LDA or JST feature augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the results achieved using JST feature augmentation are the state-of-the-art for both the MR and the MDS datasets. 6.3 Domain Adaptation We conducted domain adaptation experiments on the MDS dataset comprising of four different domains, Book (B), DVD (D), Electronics (E), and Kitchen appliances (K). We randomly split each do-128 main data into a training set of 1,600 instances and a test set of 400 instances. A classifier trained on the training set of one domain is tested on the test set of a different domain. We preformed 5 random splits and report the results averaged over 5 such runs. Comparison with Baseline Models","We compare our proposed approaches with two baseline models. The first one (denoted as “Base” in Table ??) is an ME classifier trained without adaptation. LDA results were generated from an ME classifier trained on document vectors augmented with topics generated from the LDA model. The number of topics was set to 15. JST results were obtained in a similar way except that we used the polarity-bearing topics generated from the JST model. We also tested with adding pseudo-labeled examples from the JST model into the source domain for ME classifier training (following Algorithm??), denoted as “JST-PL” in Table ??. The document sentiment classification probability thresholdτ was set to 0.8. Finally, we performed feature selection by selecting the top 2000 features according to the information gain criteria (“JST-IG”) 7",".","There are altogether 12 cross-domain sentiment classification tasks. We showed the adaptation loss results in Table ?? where the result for each domain and for each method is averaged over all three possible adaptation tasks by varying the source domain. The adaptation loss is calculated with respect to the in-domain gold standard classification result. For example, the in-domain goal standard for the Book domain is 79.96%. For adapting from DVD to Book, baseline achieves 72.25% and JST gives 76.45%. The adaptation loss is 7.71 for baseline and 3.51 for JST.","It can be observed from Table ?? that LDA only improves slightly compared to the baseline with an error reduction of 11%. JST further reduces the error due to transfer by 27%. Adding pseudo-labeled examples gives a slightly better performance compared to JST with an error reduction of 36%. With feature selection, JST-IG outperforms all the other approaches with a relative error reduction of 53%. 7","Both values of 0.8 and 2000 were set arbitrarily after an initial run on some held-out data; they were not tuned to optimize test performance.

The last row shows the average loss over all the four domains. Parameter Sensitivity","There is only one parameters to be set in the JSTIG approach, the number of topics. We plot the classification accuracy versus different topic numbers in Figure ?? with the number of topics varying between 1 and 200, corresponding to feature clusters varying between 3 and 600. It can be observed that for the relatively larger Book and DVD data sets, the accuracies peaked at topic number 10, whereas for the relatively smaller Electronics and Kitchen data sets, the best performance was obtained at topic number 50. Increasing topic numbers results in the decrease of classification accuracy. Manually examining the extracted polarity topics from JST reveals that when the topic number is small, each topic cluster contains well-mixed words from different domains. However, when the topic number is large, words under each topic cluster tend to be dominated by a single domain. Comparison with Existing Approaches","We compare in Figure ?? our proposed approach with two other domain adaptation algorithms for sentiment classification, SCL and SFA. Each set of bars represent a cross-domain sentiment classification task. The thick horizontal lines are in-domain sentiment classification accuracies. It is worth not-ing that our in-domain results are slightly different from those reported in (?; ?) due to different random splits. Our proposed JST-IG approach outperforms SCL in average and achieves comparable results to SFA. While SCL requires the construction of a reasonable number of auxiliary tasks that are use-ful to model “pivots” and “non-pivots”, SFA relies on a good selection of domain-independent features for the construction of bipartite feature graph before running spectral clustering to derive feature clusters. 129 70 75 80 85 u r a c y  ( % ) D>B E>B K>B B>D E>D K>D 60 65 70 75 80 85 1 5 10 15 30 50 100 150 200 A c c u r a c y  ( % ) No.oftopics D>B E>B K>B B>D E>D K>D (a) Adapted to Book and DVD data sets. 80 85 u r a c y  ( % ) B>E D>E K>E B>K D>K E>K 70 75 80 85 1 5 10 15 30 50 100 150 200 A c c u r a c y  ( % ) No.oftopics B>E D>E K>E B>K D>K E>K (b) Adapted to Electronics and Kitchen data sets.
