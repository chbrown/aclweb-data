The standard approach to word alignment employs directional Markov models that align the words of a sentence f to those of its translation e, such as IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) or the HMM-based alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996).","Machine translation systems typically combine the predictions of two directional models, one which aligns f to e and the other e to f (Och et al., 1999). Combination can reduce errors and relax the one-to-many structural restriction of directional models. Common combination methods include the union or intersection of directional alignments, as well as heuristic interpolations between the union and intersection like grow-diag-final (Koehn et al., 2003). This paper presents a model-based alternative to aligner combination. Inference in a probabilistic model resolves the conflicting predictions of two directional models, while taking into account each model’s uncertainty over its output.","This result is achieved by embedding two directional HMM-based alignment models into a larger bidirectional graphical model. The full model structure and potentials allow the two embedded directional models to disagree to some extent, but reward agreement. Moreover, the bidirectional model enforces a one-to-one phrase alignment structure, similar to the output of phrase alignment models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero et al., 2008), unsupervised inversion transduction grammar (ITG) models (Blunsom et al., 2009), and supervised ITG models (Haghighi et al., 2009; DeNero and Klein, 2010).","Inference in our combined model is not tractable because of numerous edge cycles in the model graph. However, we can employ dual decomposition as an approximate inference technique (Rush et al., 2010). In this approach, we iteratively apply the same efficient sequence algorithms for the underlying directional models, and thereby optimize a dual bound on the model objective. In cases where our algorithm converges, we have a certificate of optimality under the full model. Early stopping before convergence still yields useful outputs.","Our model-based approach to aligner combination yields improvements in alignment quality and phrase extraction quality in Chinese-English experiments, relative to typical heuristic combinations methods applied to the predictions of independent directional models. 420"]},{"title":"2 Model Definition","paragraphs":["Our bidirectional model G = (V, D) is a globally normalized, undirected graphical model of the word alignment for a fixed sentence pair(e, f ).

The coherence edges and the link matrix c only serve to resolve conflicts between the directional models and communicate information between them.","Because directional alignments are preserved in-tact as components of our model, extensions or refinements to the underlying directional Markov alignment model could be integrated cleanly into our model as well, including lexicalized transition models (He, 2007), extended conditioning contexts (Brunning et al., 2009), and external information (Shindo et al., 2010).","For any assignment to (a, b, c) with non-zero probability, c must encode a one-to-one phrase alignment with a maximum phrase length of 3.

One subgraph Ga includes all of the vertices correspond-ing to variables a and c. The other subgraph Gb includes vertices for variables b and c.

We analyze the behavior of early stopping experimentally in Section 5. 3.6 Inference Properties Because we set a maximum number of iterations n in the dual decomposition algorithm, and each iteration only involves optimization in a sequence model, our entire inference procedure is only a constant multiple n more computationally expensive than evaluating the original directional aligners.","Moreover, the value of u is specific to a sentence pair. Therefore, our approach does not require any additional communication overhead relative to the independent directional models in a distributed aligner implementation. Memory requirements are virtually identical to the baseline: only u must be stored for each sentence pair as it is being processed, but can then be immediately discarded once alignments are inferred.","Other approaches to generating one-to-one phrase alignments are generally more expensive. In particular, an ITG model requires O(|e|3","· |f |3",") time, whereas our algorithm requires only","O(n · (|f ||e|2 + |e||f |2",")) .

In the case 425 that a supervised model is restricted to proposing alignment links that appear in the output of a directional aligner, these models can be interpreted as a combination technique (Deng and Zhou, 2009). Such a model-based approach differs from ours in that it requires a supervised dataset and treats the directional aligners’ output as fixed.","Combination is also related to agreement-based learning (Liang et al., 2006). This approach to jointly learning two directional alignment models yields state-of-the-art unsupervised performance. Our method is complementary to agreement-based learning, as it applies to Viterbi inference under the model rather than computing expectations. In fact, we employ agreement-based training to estimate the parameters of the directional aligners in our experi-ments.","A parallel idea that closely relates to our bidirectional model is posterior regularization, which has also been applied to the word alignment problem (Graca̧ et al., 2008). One form of posterior regularization stipulates that the posterior probability of alignments from two models must agree, and enforces this agreement through an iterative procedure similar to Algorithm 1. This approach also yields state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment performance on some datasets, along with improvements in end-to-end translation quality (Ganchev et al., 2008).","Our method differs from this posterior regularization work in two ways. First, we iterate over Viterbi predictions rather than posteriors. More importantly, we have changed the output space of the model to be a one-to-one phrase alignment via the coherence edge potential functions.","Another similar line of work applies belief propagation to factor graphs that enforce a one-to-one word alignment (Cromières and Kurohashi, 2009). The details of our models differ: we employ distance-based distortion, while they add structural correspondence terms based on syntactic parse trees. Also, our model training is identical to the HMM-based baseline training, while they employ belief propagation for both training and Viterbi inference. Although differing in both model and inference, our work and theirs both find improvements from defin-ing graphical models for alignment that do not admit exact polynomial-time inference algorithms.

Our bidirectional model, which requires no additional learning and no supervised data, can be applied using dual decomposition with only a constant factor additional computation relative to independent directional inference. The resulting predictions improve the precision and recall of both alignment links and extraced phrase pairs in Chinese-English experiments. The best results follow from combination via intersection.","Because our technique is defined declaratively in terms of a graphical model, it can be extended in a straightforward manner, for instance with additional potentials on c or improvements to the component directional models. We also look forward to discovering the best way to take advantage of these new alignments in downstream applications like machine translation, supervised word alignment, bilingual parsing (Burkett et al., 2010), part-of-speech tag induction (Naseem et al., 2009), or cross-lingual model projection (Smith and Eisner, 2009; Das and Petrov, 2011)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Necip Fazil Ayan and Bonnie J.
