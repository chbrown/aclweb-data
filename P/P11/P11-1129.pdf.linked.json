The standard n-gram language model (Goodman, 2001) assigns probabilities to hypotheses in the target language conditioning on a context history of the preceding n − 1 words. Along with the efforts that advance translation models from word-based paradigm to syntax-based philosophy, in recent years we have also witnessed increasing efforts dedicated to extend standard n-gram language models for SMT. We roughly categorize these efforts into two directions: data-volume-oriented and data-depth-oriented.","In the first direction, more data is better. In order to benefit from monolingual corpora (LDC news data or news data collected from web pages) that consist of billions or even trillions of English words, huge language models are built in a distributed manner (Zhang et al., 2006; Brants et al., 2007). Such language models yield better translation results but at the cost of huge storage and high computation.","The second direction digs deeply into monolingual data to build linguistically-informed language models. For example, Charniak et al. (2003) present a syntax-based language model for machine translation which is trained on syntactic parse trees. Again, Shen et al. (2008) explore a dependency language model to improve translation quality. To some extent, these syntactically-informed language models are consistent with syntax-based translation models in capturing long-distance dependencies.","In this paper, we pursue the second direction without resorting to any linguistic resources such as a syntactic parser. With a belief that a language model that embraces a larger context provides better prediction ability, we learn additional information from training data to enhance conventional n-gram language models and extend their ability to capture richer contexts and long-distance dependencies. In particular, we integrate backward n-grams and mutual information (MI) triggers into language models in SMT.","In conventional n-gram language models, we look at the preceding n − 1 words when calculating the probability of the current word. We henceforth call the previous n − 1 words plus the current word as forward n-grams and a language model built 1288 on forward n-grams as forward n-gram language model. Similarly, backward n-grams refer to the succeeding n − 1 words plus the current word. We train a backward n-gram language model on backward n-grams and integrate the forward and backward language models together into the decoder. In doing so, we attempt to capture both the preceding and succeeding contexts of the current word.","Different from the backward n-gram language model, the MI trigger model still looks at previous contexts, which however go beyond the scope of forward n-grams. If the current word is indexed as wi, the farthest word that the forward n-gram includes is wi−n+1. However, the MI triggers are capable of detecting dependencies between wi and words from w1 to wi−n. By these triggers ({wk → wi}, 1 ≤ k ≤ i − n), we can capture long-distance dependencies that are outside the scope of forward n-grams.","We integrate the proposed backward language model and the MI trigger model into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system. We evaluate the effectiveness of both models on Chinese-to-English translation tasks with large-scale training data. Compared with the baseline which only uses the forward language model, our experimental results show that the additional backward language model is able to gain about 0.5 BLEU points, while the MI trigger model gains about 0.4 BLEU points. When both models are integrated into the decoder, they collectively improve the performance by up to 1 BLEU point.","The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly introduce related work and show how our models differ from previous work. Section 3 and 4 will elaborate the backward language model and the MI trigger model respectively in more detail, describe the training procedures and explain how the models are integrated into the phrase-based decoder. Section 5 will empirically evaluate the effectiveness of these two models. Section 6 will conduct an in-depth analysis. In the end, we conclude in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Previous work devoted to improving language models in SMT mostly focus on two categories as we mentioned before1",": large language models (Zhang et al., 2006; Emami et al., 2007; Brants et al., 2007; Talbot and Osborne, 2007) and syntax-based language models (Charniak et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2008; Post and Gildea, 2008). Since our philosophy is fundamentally different from them in that we build contextually-informed language models by using backward n-grams and MI triggers, we discuss previous work that explore these two techniques (backward n-grams and MI triggers) in this section.","Since the context “history” in the backward language model (BLM) is actually the future words to be generated, BLM is normally used in a postprocessing where all words have already been generated or in a scenario where sentences are proceeded from the ending to the beginning. Duchateau et al. (2002) use the BLM score as a confidence measure to detect wrongly recognized words in speech recognition. Finch and Sumita (2009) use the BLM in their reverse translation decoder where source sentences are proceeded from the ending to the beginning. Our BLM is different from theirs in that we access the BLM during decoding (rather than after decoding) where source sentences are still proceeded from the beginning to the ending.","Rosenfeld et al. (1994) introduce trigger pairs into a maximum entropy based language model as features. The trigger pairs are selected according to their mutual information. Zhou (2004) also propose an enhanced language model (MI-Ngram) which consists of a standard forward n-gram language model and an MI trigger model. The latter model measures the mutual information of distance-dependent trigger pairs. Our MI trigger model is mostly inspired by the work of these two papers, especially by Zhou’s MI-Ngram model (2004). The difference is that our model is distance-independent and, of course, we are interested in an SMT problem rather than a speech recognition one.","Raybaud et al. (2009) use MI triggers in their confidence measures to assess the quality of translation results after decoding. Our method is different from theirs in the MI calculation and trigger pair selection. Mauser et al. (2009) propose bilingual triggers where two source words trigger one target word to 1 Language model adaptation is not very related to our work","so we ignore it. 1289 improve lexical choice of target words. Our analysis (Section 6) show that our monolingual triggers can also help in the selection of target words."]},{"title":"3 Backward Language Model","paragraphs":["Given a sequence of words wm","1 = (w1...wm), a","standard forward n-gram language model assigns a","probability Pf (wm","1 ) to wm","1 as follows.","Pf (wm 1 ) = m ∏ i=1","P (wi|wi−1 1 ) ≈ m ∏ i=1","P (wi|wi−1 i−n+1) (1) where the approximation is based on the nth order Markov assumption. In other words, when we predict the current word wi, we only consider the preceding n − 1 words wi−n+1...wi−1 instead of the whole context history w1...wi−1.","Different from the forward n-gram language model, the backward n-gram language model assigns a probability Pb(wm","1 ) to wm","1 by looking at the succeeding context according to","Pb(wm 1 ) = m ∏ i=1","P (wi|wm i+1) ≈ m ∏ i=1","P (wi|wi+n−1 i+1 ) (2) 3.1 Training For the convenience of training, we invert the order in each sentence in the training data, i.e., from the original order (w1...wm) to the reverse order (wm...w1). In this way, we can use the same toolkit that we use to train a forward n-gram language model to train a backward n-gram language model without any other changes. To be consistent with training, we also need to reverse the order of translation hypotheses when we access the trained backward language model2",". Note that the Markov context history of Eq. (2) is wi+n−1...wi+1 instead of wi+1...wi+n−1 after we invert the order. The words are the same but the order is completely reversed. 3.2 Decoding In this section, we will present two algorithms to integrate the backward n-gram language model into two kinds of phrase-based decoders respectively: 1) a CKY-style decoder that adopts bracket-ing transduction grammar (BTG) (Wu, 1997; Xiong","2","This is different from the reverse decoding in (Finch and Sumita, 2009) where source sentences are reversed in the order. et al., 2006) and 2) a standard phrase-based decoder (Koehn et al., 2003). Both decoders translate source sentences from the beginning of a sentence to the ending. Wu (1996) introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to integrate a forward bigram language model with inversion transduction grammar. His algorithm is then adapted and extended for integrating forward n-gram language models into synchronous CFGs by Chiang (2007). Our algorithms are different from theirs in two major aspects","1. The string input to the algorithms is in a reverse order.","2. We adopt a different way to calculate language model probabilities for partial hypotheses so that we can utilize incomplete n-grams.","Before we introduce the integration algorithms, we define three functions P, L, and R on strings (in a reverse order) over the English terminal alphabet T . The function P is defined as follows.","P(wk...w1) = P (wk)...P (wk−n+2|wk...wk−n+3) } {{ }","a × ∏ 1≤i≤k−n+1 P (wi|wi+n−1...wi+1)","} {{ } b (3) This function consists of two parts:","• The first part (a) calculates incomplete n-gram language model probabilities for word wk to wk−n+2. That means, we calculate the uni-gram probability for wk (P (wk)), bigram probability for wk−1 (P (wk−1|wk)) and so on until we take n − 1-gram probability for wk−n+2 (P (wk−n+2|wk...wk−n+3)). This resembles the way in which the forward language model probability in the future cost is computed in the standard phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003).","• The second part (b) calculates complete n-gram backward language model probabilities for word wk−n+1 to w1. The function is different from Chiang’s p function in that his function p only calculates language model probabilities for the complete n-grams. Since 1290 we calculate backward language model probabilities during a beginning-to-ending (left-to-right) decoding process, the succeeding context for the current word is either yet to be generated or incomplete in terms of n-grams. The P function enables us to utilize incomplete succeeding contexts to approximately predict words. Once the succeeding contexts are complete, we can quickly update language model probabilities in an efficient way in our algorithms.","The other two functions L and R are defined as follows L(wk...w1) = { wk...wk−n+2, if k ≥ n wk...w1, otherwise (4) R(wk...w1) = { wn−1...w1, if k ≥ n wk...w1, otherwise (5) The L and R function return the leftmost and rightmost n − 1 words from a string in a reverse order respectively.","Following Chiang (2007), we describe our algorithms in a deductive system. We firstly show the algorithm3","that integrates the backward language model into a BTG-style decoder (Xiong et al., 2006) in Figure 1. The item [A, i, j; l|r] indicates that a BTG node A has been constructed spanning from i to j on the source side with the leftmost|rightmost n − 1 words l|r on the target side. As mentioned be-fore, all target strings assessed by the defined functions (P, L, and R) are in an inverted order (denoted by e). We only display the backward language model probability for each item, ignoring all other scores such as phrase translation probabilities. The Eq. (8) in Figure 1 shows how we calculate the backward language model probability for the axiom which applies a BTG lexicon rule to translate a source phrase c into a target phrase e. The Eq. (9) and (10) show how we update the backward language model probabilities for two inference rules which combine two neighboring blocks in a straight and inverted order respectively. The fundamental theories behind this update are P(e1e2) = P(e1)P(e2) P(R(e2)L(e1)) P(R(e2))P(L(e1)) (6) 3 It can also be easily adapted to integrate the forward n-","gram language model.

Only the probabilities of boundary words (e.g., R(e2)L(e1) in Eq. (6)) need to be recalculated since they have complete n-grams after the concatenation. Table 1 shows values of P, L, and R in a 3-gram example which helps to verify Eq. (6). These two equations guarantee that our algorithm can correctly compute the backward language model probability of a sentence stepwise in a dynamic programming framework.4","The theoretical time complexity of this algorithm is O(m3","|T |4(n−1)",") because in the update parts in Eq.

However, n-gram language models can only capture short-distance dependencies within an n-word window. In order to model long-distance dependencies, previous work such as (Rosenfeld et al., 1994) and (Zhou, 2004) exploit trigger pairs. A trigger pair is defined as an ordered 2-tuple (x, y) where word x occurs in the preceding context of word y. It can also be denoted in a more visual manner as x → y with x being the trigger and y the triggered word5",".","We use pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) to measure the strength of the association between x and y, which is defined as follows P M I(x, y) = log( P (x, y) P (x)P (y) ) (12) 5 In this paper, we require that word x and y occur in the","same sentence. Zhou (2004) proposes a new language model enhanced with MI trigger pairs. In his model, the probability of a given sentence wm","1 is approximated as","P (wm 1 ) ≈( m ∏ i=1","P (wi|wi−1 i−n+1)) × m ∏ i=n+1 i−n ∏ k=1 exp(P M I(wk, wi, i − k − 1)) (13) There are two components in his model. The first component is still the standard n-gram language model. The second one is the MI trigger model which multiples all exponential PMI values for trigger pairs where the current word is the triggered word and all preceding words outside the n-gram window of the current word are triggers. Note that his MI trigger model is distance-dependent since trigger pairs (wk, wi) are sensitive to their distance i − k − 1 (zero distance for adjacent words). Therefore the distance between word x and word y should be taken into account when calculating their PMI.","In this paper, for simplicity, we adopt a distance-independent MI trigger model as follows","M I(wm 1 ) = m ∏ i=n+1 i−n ∏ k=1 exp(P M I(wk, wi)) (14) We integrate the MI trigger model into the log-linear model of machine translation as an additional knowledge source which complements the standard n-gram language model in capturing long-distance dependencies. By MERT (Och, 2003), we are even able to tune the weight of the MI trigger model against the weight of the standard n-gram language model while Zhou (2004) sets equal weights for both models. 1292 4.1 Training We can use the maximum likelihood estimation method to calculate PMI for each trigger pair by tak-ing counts from training data. Let C(x, y) be the co-occurrence count of the trigger pair (x, y) in the training data. The joint probability of (x, y) is calculated as P (x, y) = C(x, y)","∑ x,y C(x, y) (15) The marginal probabilities of x and y can be deduced from the joint probability as follows P (x) = ∑ y P (x, y) (16) P (y) = ∑ x P (x, y) (17)","Since the number of distinct trigger pairs is O(|T |2","), the question is how to select valuable trigger pairs. We select trigger pairs according to the following three steps","1. The distance between x and y must not be less than n − 1. Suppose we use a 5-gram language model and y = wi , then x ∈ {w1...wi−5}.","2. C(x, y) > c. In all our experiments we set c = 10.","3. Finally, we only keep trigger pairs whose PMI value is larger than 0. Trigger pairs whose PMI value is less than 0 often contain stop words, such as “the”, “a”. These stop words have very large marginal probabilities due to their high frequencies. 4.2 Decoding The MI trigger model of Eq. (14) can be directly integrated into the decoder. For the standard phrase-based decoder (Koehn et al., 2003), whenever a partial hypothesis is extended by a new target phrase, we can quickly retrieve the pre-computed PMI value for each trigger pair where the triggered word locates in the newly translated target phrase and the trigger is outside the n-word window of the triggered word. It’s a little more complicated to integrate the MI trigger model into the CKY-style phrase-based decoder. But we still can handle it by dynamic programming as follows M I(e1e2) = M I(e1)M I(e2)M I(e1 → e2) (18) where M I(e1 → e2) represents the PMI values in which a word in e1 triggers a word in e2. It is defined as follows M I(e1 → e2) = ∏ wi∈e2 ∏ wk∈e1 i−k≥n exp(P M I(wk, wi)) (19)"]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["In this section, we conduct large-scale experiments on NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed backward language model and MI trigger model in SMT.

The forward language model score for the baseline hypothesis is -26.41, which is higher than the score of the F+M hypothesis -26.67. This could be the reason why the baseline selects the word “was” instead of “is”. As can be seen, there is another “is” in the preceding context of the word “was” in the baseline hypothesis. Unfortunately, this word “is” is located just outside the scope of the preceding 5-gram context of “was”. The forward 5-gram language model is hence not able to take it into account when calculating the probability of “was”. However, this is not a problem for the MI trigger model.
