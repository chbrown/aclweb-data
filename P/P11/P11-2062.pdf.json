In addi-tion to being both templatic (root/pattern) and concatenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic’s optional diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity (Habash, 2010). This paper focuses on two specific issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal morphology involving the features of gender and number only: the discrepancy between morphological form and function and the complex system of morpho-syntactic agreement. 2.1 Form and Function Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: masculine (M ) and feminine (F ), and for number: singular (S), dual (D) and plural (P ).

However, the bulk of this work does not address form-function discrepancy or morpho-syntactic agreement issues. This is unfortunately the case in some of the most commonly used resources for Arabic NLP: the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and the Penn Arabic Tree Bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004). There are some important exceptions (Goweder et al., 2004; Smrž, 2007b; Elghamry et al., 2008; Abbès et al., 2004; Attia, 2008; Altantawy et al., 2010). We focus on comparing with two of these due to space restrictions.","Smrž (2007b)’s work contrasting illusory (form) features and functional features inspired our distinc-tion of morphological form and function. However, unlike him, we do not distinguish between sub-functional (logical and formal) features. His ElixirFM analyzer (Smrž, 2007a) extends BAMA by including functional number and some functional gender information, but not rationality. This analyzer was used as part of the annotation of the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and Hajič, 2006). In the work presented here, we annotate for all three features completely in the PATB and we present a quantitative analysis of morpho-syntactic agreement patterns in it.","Elghamry et al. (2008) presented an automatic cue-based algorithm that uses bilingual and monolingual cues to build a web-extracted lexicon enriched with gender, number and rationality features. Their automatic technique achieves an F-score of 89.7% against a gold standard set. Unlike them, we annotate the PATB manually exploiting existing PATB information to help annotate efficiently and accurately."]},{"title":"4 Corpus Annotation 4.1 The Corpus","paragraphs":["We annotated the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) part 3 (Maamouri et al., 2004) for functional gender, number and rationality. The corpus contains around 16.6K sentences and over 400K tokens.8","All PATB","8","All clitics are separated from words in the PATB except for the definite article +"]},{"title":"@̈","paragraphs":["Al+. tokens are already diacritized and lemma/part-of-speech (POS) disambiguated manually. Since verbs are regular in their form-to-function mapping, we annotate them automatically. Nominals account for almost half of all tokens (∼ 197K tokens). The unique diacritized nominal types are almost 52K corresponding to 15,720 unique lemmas. 4.2 Annotation Simplification To simplify the annotation task, we made the following decisions. First, we decided to annotate nominals out of context except for the use of their lemmas and POS tags, which were already assigned manually in context in the PATB. The intuition here being that the functional features we are after are not contextually variable. We are consciously ignoring usage in figures-of-speech. Second, we normalized the case/state-variant forms of the number/gender suffixes and removed the definite article proclitic. The decision to normalize is conditioned on the manually annotated PATB POS tag. The normalized forms preserve the most important information for our task: the stem of the word and the number/gender suffix. These two decisions allow us exploit the PATB POS and lemma annotations to reduce the number of annotation decisions from 197K tokens and their lemmas to 21,148 morphologically normalized forms and 15,720 lemmas – an order of magnitude less decisions to make, which made the task more feasible both in terms of money and time. Of all nouns, adjectives and proper nouns, around 4.6% (tokens) and 27.2% (types) have no lemmas (annotated as DEFAULT, TBupdate, or nolemma). These cases make our out-of-context annotation very hard. We do not currently address this issue. A smaller set of closed class words (778 types corresponding to 35,675 tokens), e.g. pronouns and quantifiers, were annotated manually separately. The annotation speed averaged about 675 (words/lemmas) per hour. 4.3 Annotation Guidelines We summarize the annotation guidelines here due to space restrictions. Full guidelines will be presented in a future publication. The core annotation task in-volves assigning the correct functional gender, number and rationality to nominals. Gender can be M , F , B (both), or U (unknown). Number can be S, D, 359 P , or U . And rationality can be R, I, B,9","N or U . The annotators were given word clusters each of which consisting of a lemma and all of its simplified inflected forms appearing in the PATB. We also provided the POS and English gloss. Annotators were asked to assign the rationality feature to the lemma only; and the gender and number features to the inflected forms. Default form-based gender and number are provided. As for rationality, adjectives receive a default N and everything else gets I. The guidelines explained the form-function discrepancy problem, and the various morpho-syntactic agreement rules (Section 2) were given as tests to allow the annotators to make correct decisions. The issue figures-of-speech is highlighted as a challenge and annotators are asked to think of different contexts for the word in question. 4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement We computed inter-annotator agreement (IAA) over a random set of 397 lemma clusters with 509 word types corresponding to 4,781 tokens. The type-based IAA scores for words with known lemmas are 93.7%, 99.0% and 89.6% for gender, number and rationality respectively. The corresponding token-based IAA scores are 94.5%, 99.7% and 95.1%. The respective Kappa values (Cohen, 1960) for types are 0.87, 0.97, 0.82 and for tokens 0.89, 0.99, 0.92. Based on these scores, the number features is the easiest to annotate, followed by gender and rationality. This is explainable by the fact that number in Arabic is always expressed morphologically through affix or stem change, while gender is more lexical, and rationality is completely lexical. The corresponding IAA scores for all words (including words with unknown lemmas) drop to 86.8%, 94.9% and 82.9% (for types) and 93.5%, 99.2% and 94.0% (for tokens). The respective Kappa values for types are 0.74, 0.85, 0.73 and for tokens 0.87, 0.97, 0.90 The difference caused by missing lemmas highlights the need and value for complete annotations in the PATB. The overall high scores for IAA suggest that the task is not particularly hard for humans to per-form, and that disambiguating information is crucial. Points of disagreement will be addressed in future extensions of the guidelines. 9 The rationality value B is used for cases with lemma am-","biguity, e.g.,"]},{"title":"æ JJ̊o","paragraphs":["hyltwn ‘Hilton’ can refer to the hotel chain or a member of the Hilton family."]},{"title":"5 Corpus Analysis","paragraphs":["We present a quantitative analysis of the annotated corpus focusing on the issues that motivated it. 5.1 Form-Function Similarity Patterns Table 1 summarizes the different combinations of form-function values of gender, number and rationality for nominals in our corpus. In terms of gender, the M value seems to be twice as common as F both in form and function. In 91.4% of all nominals, function and form agree. Adjectives show the most agreement (98.8%) followed by nouns (92.5%) and then proper nouns (74.6%). As for number, S is the dominant value in form (91.8%) and function (83.1%). Broken plurals ( S","P ) are almost 55% of all plurals. 99.5% of proper nouns are singular, which means that rationality is effectively irrelevant for proper nouns as a feature, since it is only relevant morpho-syntactically with plurals. Although the great majority of nouns are irrational, proper nouns tend to be almost equally split between rational and irrational. In terms of gender and number (jointly), 85% of all nominals have matching form and function values, with adjective having the highest ratio, followed by nouns and then proper nouns. 5.2 Morpho-syntactic Agreement Patterns We focus on three agreement classes: Noun-Adj(ective), Verb-Subject (VSO and SVO orders) and Number-Noun (multiple configurations). We only consider structural bigrams in the CATIB (Habash and Roth, 2009) dependency version of the training portion of the PATB (part 3) used by Marton et al. (2011). See Figure 1 for an example. The total number of relevant bigrams is 39,561 or almost 11.6% of all bigrams. Over two-thirds are Noun-Adj, and around a quarter are Verb-Subject. For each agreement class, we compare using a simple agreement rule (parent and child values match) with using an implementation of the complex agreement rules summarized in Section 2. We also compare using form-based features or functional features.10 Table 2 presents the percentage of bigrams we determine to agree (i.e. be grammatical) under different features and rules.

The second column specifies (Form/Function) values. =/= signifies complete match. form-based gender and number agreement between parent and child is only 66.7%. Using functional values, the simple gender and number agreement moves only to 68.5%. Introducing complex agreement rules with form-based values (using the default N value for rationality of adjectives and I for other classes) increases grammaticality scores to 80.3% overall. However, with using both functional morphology features and complex agreement rules, the grammaticality score jumps to 93.6% overall. These results validate the need for both functional features and complex agreement rules in Arabic. 5.3 Manual Analysis of Agreement Problems The cases we considered ungrammatical when applying complex agreement rules with functional features above add up to 2,540 instances. Out of these, we took a random sample of 423 cases and analyzed it manually. About 50% of all problems are the result of human annotation errors.

The rest of the agreement problems (∼30%) are the result of special rules or figures-of-speech that are not handled. Figures of speech account for about 7% of all error cases (or less than 0.5% of all nominals). The most common cases of unhandled rules include not modeling conjunctions, which affect number agreement, followed by gender-number invariable forms of some adjectives. After this error analysis, we identified 379 lemmas involved in incorrect rationality-affected agreement (as per our rules). All of these cases had a P I features but did not agreed as F S. Out of these lemmas, 204 were corrected manually as R. The functional agreement with rules jumped from 93.6% to 95.7% (a 33% error reduction)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We presented a large resource enriched with latent features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic.
