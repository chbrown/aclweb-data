Unication is a well known algorithm. Prolog, for example, makes extensive use of term unication. Graph unication is slightly dierent. Two dierent graph notations and an example unication are shown in Figure 1 and 2, respectively.","In typical unication-based grammar parsers, roughly 90% of the unications fail.

As copying is the most expensive part of unication, a great deal of research has gone in eliminating superuous copying. Examples of these approaches are given in (Tomabechi, 1991) and (Wroblewski, 1987). In order to avoid superuous copying, these algorithms incorporate control data in the graphs. This has several drawbacks, as we will discuss next. Memory Consumption To achieve the goal of eliminating superuous copying, the aforementioned algorithms include administrative elds|which we will call scratch elds|in the node structure. These elds do not attribute to the denition of the graph, but are used to eciently guide the unication and copying process. Before a graph is used in unication, or after a result graph has been copied, these elds just take up space. This is undesirable, because memory usage is of great concern in many unication-based grammar parsers. This problem is especially of concern in Tomabechi’s algorithm, as it in-creases the node size by at least 60% for typical implementations.","In the ideal case, scratch elds would be stored in a separate buer allowing them to be reused for each unication. The size of such a buer would be proportional to the maximum number of nodes that are involved in a single unication. Although this technique reduces memory usage considerably, it does not reduce the amount of data involved in a single unication. Nevertheless, storing and loading nodes without scratch elds will be faster, because they are smaller. Because scratch elds are reused, there is a high probability that they will remain in cache.

The overhead of a hash table, however, may be signicant. In general, any binding mechanism is bound to require some extra work. Nevertheless, considering the dierence in speed between processors and memory, reducing the memory footprint may compensate for the loss of performance to some extent. Symmetric Multi Processing Smallscale desktop multiprocessor systems (e.g. dual or even quad Pentium machines) are be-coming more commonplace and aordable. If we focus on graph unication, there are two ways to exploit their capabilities. First, it is possible to parallelize a single graph unication, as proposed by e.g. (Tomabechi, 1991). Suppose we are unifying graph a with graph b, then we could allow multiple processors to work on the unication of a and b simultaneously. We will call this parallel unication. Another approach is to allow multiple graph unications to run concurrently. Suppose we are unifying graph a and b in addition to unifying graph a and c. By assigning a dierent processor to each operation we obtain what we will call concurrent unication. Parallel unication exploits parallelism inherent of graph unication itself, whereas concurrent unication exploits parallelism at the context-free grammar backbone. As long as the number of unication operations in 1","Most of today’s computers load and store data in large chunks (called cache lines), causing even uninitialized elds to be transported. one parse is large, we believe it is preferable to choose concurrent unication. Especially when a large number of unications terminates quickly (e.g. due to failure), the overhead of more nely grained parallelism can be considerable.","In the example of concurrent unication, graph a was used in both unications. This suggests that in order for concurrent unication to work, the input graphs need to be read only. With destructive unication algorithms this does not pose a problem, as the source graphs are copied before unication. However, including scratch elds in the node structure (as Tomabechi’s and Wroblewski’s algorithms do) thwarts the implementation of concurrent unication, as dierent processors will need to write dierent values in these elds. One way to solve this problem is to disallow a single graph to be used in multiple unication operations simultaneously. In (van Lohuizen, 2000) it is shown, however, that this will greatly impair the ability to achieve speedup. Another solution is to duplicate the scratch elds in the nodes for each processor. This, however, will enlarge the node size even further. In other words, Tomabechi’s and Wroblewski’s algorithms are not suited for concurrent unication."]},{"title":"2 Algorithm","paragraphs":["The key to the solution of all of the abovementioned issues is to separate the scratch elds from the elds that actually make up the denition of the graph. The resulting data structures are shown in Figure 3.

Our implementation derives osets from index values stored in nodes. rithm for unication-based grammar parsing (see e.g. (op den Akker et al., 1995)). We have separated the scratch elds needed for unication from the scratch elds needed for copying.2","We propose the following technique to associate scratch structures with nodes. We take an array of scratch structures. In addition, for each graph we assign each node a unique index number that corresponds to an element in the array. Dierent graphs typically share the same indexes. Since unication involves two graphs, we need to ensure that two nodes will not be assigned the same scratch structure. We solve this by interleaving the index positions of the two graphs. This mapping is shown in Figure 4. Obviously, the minimum number of elements in the table is two times the number of nodes of the largest graph. To reduce the table size, we allow certain nodes to be deprived of scratch structures. (For example, we do not forward atoms.) We denote this with a valuation function v, which returns 1 if the node is assigned an index and 0 otherwise.","We can associate the index with a node by including it in the node structure. For structure sharing, however, we have to use osets between nodes (see Figure 4), because otherwise dierent nodes in a graph may end up having the same index (see Section 3).

As storing osets in arcs consumes more memory than storing indexes in nodes (more arcs may point to the same node), we store index values and use them to compute the osets. For ease of reading, we present our algorithm as if the osets were stored instead of computed. Note that the small index values consume much less space than the scratch elds they replace.","The resulting algorithm is shown in Figure 5. It is very similar to the algorithm in (Tomabechi, 1991), but incorporates our in-dexing technique. Each reference to a node now not only consists of the address of the node structure, but also its index in the table. This is required because we cannot derive its table index from its node structure alone.","The second argument of Copy indicates the next free index number. Copy returns references with an oset, allowing them to be directly stored in arcs. These osets will be negative when Copy exits at line 2.2, resembling a reentrancy. Note that only AbsArc explicitly denes operations on osets. AbsArc computes a node’s index using its parent node’s index and an oset.","Unify(dg1; dg2)","1. try Unify1((dg1; 0); (dg2; 1))a 1.1.

This simplies the algorithm. We only reset the table up to the highest index in use. As table entries are roughly lled in increasing order, there is little overhead for clearing unused elements.","A nice property of the algorithm is that indexes identify from which input graph a node originates (even=left, odd=right). This information can be used, for example, to selectively share nodes in a structure sharing scheme. We can also specify additional scratch elds or additional arrays at hardly any cost. Some of these abilities will be used in the enhancements of the algorithm we will discuss next."]},{"title":"3 Enhancements","paragraphs":["Structure Sharing Structure sharing is an important technique to reduce memory usage. We will adopt the same terminology as Tomabechi in (Tomabechi, 1992). That is, we will use the term feature-structure sharing when two arcs in one graph converge to the same node in that graph (also refered to as reentrancy) and data-structure sharing when arcs from two dierent graphs converge to the same node.","The conditions for sharing mentioned in (Tomabechi, 1992) are: (1) bottom and atomic nodes can be shared; (2) complex nodes can be shared unless they are modied. We need to add the following condition: (3) all arcs in the shared subgraph must have the same osets as the subgraph that would have resulted from copying. A possible violation of this constraint is shown in Figure 6. As long as arcs are processed in increasing order of index number,3","this condition can only be violated in case of reentrancy. Basically, the condition can be violated when a reentrancy points past a node that is bound to a larger subgraph.","3","This can easily be accomplished by xing the order in which arcs are stored in memory.

As nodes from the dierent input graphs are never assigned the same table entry, they are always bound independently of each other. (See the footnote for line 3 of Unify1.)","The sharing version of Copy is similar to the variant in (Tomabechi, 1992). The extra check can be implemented straightforwardly by comparing the old oset with the oset for the new nodes. Because we derive the osets from index values associated with nodes, we need to compensate for a dierence between the index of the shared node and the index it should have in the new graph. We store this information in a specialized share arc. We need to adjust Unify1 to handle share arcs accordingly.

This can result in superuous copying when the graph is subsumed by an existing graph. Our technique allows subsumption to use the bindings generated by Unify1 in addition to its own table. This allows us to defer copying until we completed subsumption checking. Packed Nodes With a straightforward implementation of our algorithm, we obtain a node size of 8 bytes.4","By dropping the concept of a xed node size, we can reduce the size of atom and bottom nodes to 4 bytes. Type information can be stored in two bits. We use the two least signicant bits of point-ers (which otherwise are 0) to store this type information. Instead of using a pointer for the value eld, we store nodes in place. Only for reentrancies we still need pointers. Complex nodes require 8 bytes, as they include a pointer to the rst node past its children (necessary for unication).

The system was implemented in Objective-C using a xed arity graph representation. We used a test set of 22 sentences of varying length. Usually, approximately 90% of the unications fails.

Structure sharing roughly halved this once more.7","The third condition prohibited sharing in less than 2% of the cases where it would be possible in Tomabechi’s approach.","Figure 7 shows that our algorithm does not increase execution times. Our algorithm even scrapes o roughly 7% of the total parsing time. This speedup can be attributed to improved cache utilization. We veried this by running the same tests with cache disabled. This made our algorithm actually run slower than Tomabechi’s algorithm. Deferred copying did not improve performance. The additional overhead of dereferencing during subsumption was not compensated by the savings on copying. Structure sharing did not signicantly alter the performance as well. Although, this version uses less memory, it has to perform additional work.","Running the same tests on machines with less memory showed a clear performance advantage for the algorithms using less memory, because paging could be avoided."]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["We reduce memory consumption of graph unication as presented in (Tomabechi, 1991) (or (Wroblewski, 1987)) by separating scratch elds from node structures. Pereira’s (Pereira, 1985) algorithm also stores changes to nodes separate from the graph. However, Pereira’s mechanism incurs a log(n) overhead for accessing the changes (where n is the number of nodes in a graph), resulting in an O(n log n) time algorithm. Our algorithm runs in O(n) time.","6","The results do not include the space consumed by the scratch tables. However, these tables do not consume more than 10 KB in total, and hence have no signicant impact on the results.","7","Because the packed version has a variable node size, structure sharing yielded less relative improvements than when applied to the basic version. In terms of number of nodes, though, the two results were identical.","With respect to over and early copying (as dened in (Tomabechi, 1991)), our algorithm has the same characteristics as Tomabechi’s algorithm. In addition, our algorithm allows to postpone the copying of graphs until after subsumption checks complete. This would require additional elds in the node structure for Tomabechi’s algorithm.","Our algorithm allows sharing of grammar nodes, which is usually impossible in other implementations (Malouf et al., 2000). A weak point of our structure sharing scheme is its extra condition. However, our experiments showed that this condition can have a minor impact on the amount of sharing.","We showed that compressing node structures allowed us to reduce memory consumption by another 40% without sacricing performance. Applying the same technique to Tomabechi’s algorithm would yield smaller relative improvements (max. 20%), because the scratch elds cannot be compressed to the same extent.","One of the design goals of Tomabechi’s algorithm was to come to an ecient implementation of parallel unication(Tomabechi, 1991). Although theoretically parallel unication is hard (Vitter and Simons, 1986), Tomabechi’s algorithm provides an elegant solution to achieve limited scale parallelism (Fujioka et al., 1990). Since our algorithm is based on the same principles, it allows parallel unication as well. Tomabechi’s algorithm, however, is not thread-safe, and hence cannot be used for concurrent unication."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We have presented a technique to reduce memory usage by separating scratch elds from nodes. We showed that compressing node structures can further reduce the memory footprint. Although these techniques require extra computation, the algorithms still run faster. The main reason for this was the dierence between cache and memory speed. As current developments indicate that this dierence will only get larger, this eect is not just an artifact of the current architectures.","We showed how to incoporate data-structure sharing. For our grammar, the additional constraint for sharing did not pose a problem. If it does pose a problem, there are several techniques to mitigate its eect. For example, one could reserve additional indexes at critical positions in a subgraph (e.g. based on type information). These can then be assigned to nodes in later unications without introducing conicts elsewhere. Another technique is to include a tiny table with repair information in each share arc to allow a small number of conicts to be resolved.","For certain grammars, data-structure sharing can also signicantly reduce execution times, because the equality check (see line 3 of Unify1) can intercept shared nodes with the same address more frequently. We did not exploit this benet, but rather included an oset check to allow grammar nodes to be shared as well. One could still choose, however, not to share grammar nodes.","Finally, we introduced deferred copying. Although this technique did not improve performance, we suspect that it might be benecial for systems that use more expensive memory allocation and deallocation models (like garbage collection).","Since memory consumption is a major concern with many of the current unication-based grammar parsers, our approach provides a fast and memory-ecient alternative to Tomabechi’s algorithm. In addition, we showed that our algorithm is well suited for concurrent unication, allowing to reduce execution times as well."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[Fujioka et al.1990] T.
