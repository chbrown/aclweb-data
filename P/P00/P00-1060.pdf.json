        "In the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman, 1992] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996]. How to evaluate the different feature types’ effects for syntactic parsing? The paper proposes an information-theory-based feature types analysis model, which uses the measures of predictive information quantity, predictive information gain, predictive information redundancy and predictive information summation to quantitatively analyse the different contextual feature types’ or feature types combination’s predictive power for syntactic structure. In the following, Section 2 describes the probabilistic evaluation model for syntactic trees; Section 3 proposes an information-theory-based feature type analysis model; Section 4 introduces several experimental issues; Section 5 quantitatively analyses the different contextual feature types or feature types combination in the view of information theory and draws a series of conclusion on their predictive powers for syntactic structures."

The difference among the different parsing models lies mainly in that they use different feature types or feature type combination to divide the contextual condition into equivalent classes. Our ultimate aim is to determine which combination of feature types is optimal for the probabilistic evaluation model of statistical syntactic parsing. Unfortunately, the state of knowledge in this regard is very limited. Many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively. In the paper, we propose an information-theory-based feature type analysis model by which we can quantitatively analyse the predictive power of different feature types or feature type combinations for syntactic structure in a systematic way. The conclusion is expected to provide reliable reference for feature type selection in the probabilistic evaluation modelling for statistical syntactic parsing."

Based on these analysis, we can select the feature type or feature types combination that has the optimal predictive information summation to build the probabilistic parsing model. However, there are still some questions to be answered in this paper. For example, what is the beneficial improvement in the performance after using this method in a real parser? Whether the improvements in PIQ will lead to the improvement of parsing accuracy or not? In the following research, we will incorporate these conclusions into a real parser to see whether the parsing accuracy can be improved or not. Another work we will do is to do some experimental analysis to find the impact of data sparseness on feature type analysis, which is critical to the performance of real systems. The proposed feature type analysis method can be used in not only the probabilistic modelling for statistical syntactic parsing, but also language modelling in more general fields [WU, 1999a] [WU, 1999b]."
