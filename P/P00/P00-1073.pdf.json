        "We propose a distribution-based pruning of n-gram backoff language models. Instead of the conventional approach of pruning n-grams that are infrequent in training data, we prune n-grams that are likely to be infrequent in a new document. Our method is based on the n-gram distribution i.e. the probability that an n-gram occurs in a new document. Experimental results show that our method performed 7-9% (word perplexity reduction) better than conventional cutoff methods."

        "Statistical language modelling (SLM) has been successfully applied to many domains such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), information retrieval (Miller et al., 1999), and spoken language understanding (Zue, 1995). In particular, n-gram language model (LM) has been demonstrated to be highly effective for these domains. N-gram LM estimates the probability of a word given previous words, P(wn|w1,...,wn-1).",
        "In applying an SLM, it is usually the case that more training data will improve a language model. However, as training data size increases, LM size increases, which can lead to models that are too large for practical use.",
        "To deal with the problem, count cutoff (Jelinek, 1990) is widely used to prune language models. The cutoff method deletes from the LM those n-grams that occur infrequently in the training data. The cutoff method assumes that if an n-gram is infrequent in training data, it is also infrequent in testing data. But in the real world, training data rarely matches testing data perfectly. Therefore, the count cutoff method is not perfect.",
        "In this paper, we propose a distribution-based cutoff method. This approach estimates if an n-gram is “likely to be infrequent in testing data”. To determine this likelihood, we divide the training data into partitions, and use a cross-validation-like approach. Experiments show that this method performed 7-9% (word perplexity reduction) better than conventional cutoff methods.",
        "In section 2, we discuss prior SLM research, including backoff bigram LM, perplexity, and related works on LM pruning methods. In section 3, we propose a new criterion for LM pruning based on n-gram distribution, and discuss in detail how to estimate the distribution. In section 4, we compare our method with count cutoff, and present experimental results in perplexity. Finally, we present our conclusions in section 5."

        "One of the most successful forms of SLM is the n-gram LM. N-gram LM estimates the probability of a word given the n-1 previous words, P(wn|w1,...,wn-1). In practice, n is usually set to 2 (bigram), or 3 (trigram). For simplicity, we restrict our discussion to bigram, P(wn|wn-1), which assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the identity of the immediately preceding word. But our approach extends to any n-gram.",

To deal with the problem, (Katz, 1987) proposed a backoff scheme, which is widely used in bigram language modelling.

        "Due to the memory limitation in realistic applications, only a finite set of word pairs have conditional probabilities P(wn|wn-1) explicitly represented in the model, especially when the model is trained on a large corpus. The remaining word pairs are assigned a probability by back-off (i.e. unigram estimates). The goal of bigram pruning is to remove uncommon explicit bigram estimates P(wn|wn-1) from the model to reduce the number of parameters, while minimizing the performance loss.",
        "The most common way to eliminate unused count is by means of count cutoffs (Jelinek, 1990). A cutoff is chosen, say 2, and all probabilities stored in the model with 2 or fewer counts are removed. This method assumes that there is not much difference between a bigram occurring once, twice, or not at all. Just by excluding those bigrams with a small count from a model, a significant saving in memory can be achieved. In a typical training corpus, roughly 65% of unique bigram sequences occur only once.",
        "Recently, several improvements over count cutoffs have been proposed. (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) proposed a different pruning scheme for backoff models, where bigrams are ranked by a weighted difference of the log probability estimate before and after pruning. Bigrams with difference less than a threshold are pruned.",
        "(Stolcke, 1998) proposed a criterion for pruning based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned model. The relative entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training data perplexity. All bigrams that change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model. Stolcke also concluded that, for practical purpose, the method in (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996) is a very good approximation to this method.",
        "All previous cutoff methods described above use a similar criterion for pruning, that is, the difference (or information loss) between the original estimate and the backoff estimate. After ranking, all bigrams with difference small enough will be pruned, since they contain no more information."

        "As described in the previous section, previous cutoff methods assume that training data covers testing data. Bigrams that are infrequent in training data are also assumed to be infrequent in testing data, and will be cutoff. But in the real world, no matter how large the training data, it is still always very sparse compared to all data in the world. Furthermore, training data will be biased by its mixture of domain, time, or style, etc. For example, if we use newspaper in training, a name like “Lewinsky” may have high frequency in certain years but not others; if we use Gone with the Wind in training, “Scarlett O’Hara” will have disproportionately high probability and will not be cutoff.",
        "We propose another approach to pruning. We aim to keep bigrams that are more likely to occur in a new document. We therefore propose a new criterion for pruning parameters from bigram models, based on the bigram distribution i.e. the probability that a bigram will occur in a new document. All bigrams with the probability less than a threshold are removed.",
        "We estimate the probability that a bigram occurs in a new document by dividing training data into partitions, called subunits,andusea cross-validation-like approach. In the remaining part of this section, we firstly investigate several methods for term distribution modelling, and extend them to bigram distribution modelling. Then we investigate the effects of the definition of the subunit, and experiment with various ways to divide a training set into subunits. Experiments show that this not only allows a much more efficient computation for bigram distribution modelling, but also results in a more general bigram model, in spite of the domain, style, or temporal bias of training data."
