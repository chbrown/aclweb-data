In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the t~t~k at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate.Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues. 1 Introduction In collaborative consultation dialogues, the consultant and the executing agent collaborate on developing a plan to achieve the executing agent's domain goal. Since agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that conflicts in their beliefs arise during the planning process. In such cases, collaborative agents should attempt to square away (Joshi, 1982) the conflicts by engaging in collaborative negotiation to determine what should constitute their shared plan of actions and shared beliefs. Collaborative negotiation differs from non-collaborative negotiation and argum_entation mainly in the attitude of the participants, since collaborative agents are not selfcentered, but act in a way as to benefit the agents as","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-9122026. a group. Thus, when facing a conflict, a collaborative agent should not automatically reject a belief with which she does not agree; instead, she should evaluate the belief and the evidence provided to her and adopt the belief if the evidence is convincing. On the other hand, if the evaluation indicates that the agent should maintain her original belief, she should attempt to provide sufficient justification to convince the other agent to adopt this belief if the belief is relevant to the task at hand.","This paper presents a model for engaging in collaborative negoa~ion to resolve conflicts in agents' beliefs about domain knowledge.

Sidner (1992; 1994) formulated an artificial language for modeling collaborative discourse using propo~acceptance and proposal/rejection sequences; however, her work is descriptive and does not specify response generation strategies for agents involved in collaborative interactions.","Webber and Joshi (1982) have noted the importance of a cooperative system providing support for its responses. They identified strategies that a system can adopt in justifying its beliefs; however, they did not specify the criteria under which each of these strategies should be selected. 136 Walker (1994) described a method of determining when to include optional warrants to justify a claim based on factors such as communication cost, inference cost, and cost of memory retrieval. However, her model focuses on determining when to include informationally redundant utterances, whereas our model determines whether or not justification is needed for a claim to be convincing and, ff so, selects appropriate evidence from the system's private beliefs to support the claim.","Caswey et al. (Cawsey et al., 1993; Logan et al., 1994) introduced the idea of utilizing a belief revision mechanism (Galliers, 1992) to predict whether a set of evidence is sufficient to change a user's existing belief and to generate responses for information retrieval dialogues in a library domain. They argued that in the library dialogues they analyzed, \"in no cases does negotiation extend beyond the initial belief conflict and its immediate resolution:' (Logan et al., 1994, page 141). However, our analysis of naturally-occurring consultation dialogues (Columbia University Transcripts, 1985; SRI Transcripts, 1992) shows that in other domains conflict resolution does extend beyond a single exchange of conflicting befiefs; therefore we employ a re, cursive model for collaboration that captures extended negotiation and represents the structure of the discourse. Furthermore, their system deals with a single conflict, while our model selects a focus in its pursuit of conflict resolution when multiple conflicts arise. In addition, we provide a process for selecting among multiple possible pieces of evidence. 3 Features of Collaborative Negotiation Collaborative negoti~ion occurs when conflicts arise among agents developing a shared plan 1 during collaborative planning. A collaborative agent is driven by the goal of developing a plan that best satisfies the interests of all the agents as a group, instead of one that maximizes his own interest. This results in several distinctive features of collaborative negotiation: 1) A collaborative agent does not insist on winning an argument, and may change his beliefs ff another agent presents convincing justification for an opposing belief. This differentiates collaborative negotiation from argumentation (Birnbaum et al., 1980; Reichman, 1981; Cohen, 1987; Quilici, 1992). 2) Agents involved in collaborative negotiation are open and honest with one another; they will not deliberately present false information to other agents, present information in such a way as to mislead the other agents, or strategically hold back information from other agents for later use. This distinguishes collaborative negotiation from non-collaborative negotiation such as labor negotiation (Sycara, 1989). 3) Collaborative agents are interested in","1The notion of shared plan has been used in (Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Allen, 1991). others' beliefs in order to decide whether to revise their own beliefs so as to come to agreement (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995). Although agents involvedin argumentation and non-collaborative negotiation take other agents' beliefs into consideration, they do so mainly to find weak points in their opponents' beliefs and attack them to win the argument."]},{"title":"In","paragraphs":["our earlier work, we built on Sidner's proposal/acceptance and proposal/rejection sequences (Sitnet, 1994) and developed a model tha¢ captures collaborative planning processes in a Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1994).

The enhanced dialogue model has four levels: the domain level which consists of the domain plan being constructed for the user's later execution, the problem-solving level which contains the actions being performed to construct the don~n plan, the belief level which consists of the mutual beliefs pursued during the planning process in order to further the problem-solving intentions, and the discourse level which contains the communicative actions initiated to achieve the mutual beliefs (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1994). This paper focuses on the evaluation and modification of proposed beliefs, and details a strategy for engaging in collaborative negotiations. 137"]},{"title":"4.1 Evaluating Proposed Beliefs","paragraphs":["Our system maintains a set of beliefs about the domain and about the user's beliefs. Associated with each belief is a strength that represents the agent's confidence in holding that belief. We model the strength of a belief using endorsements, which are explicit records of factors that affect one's certainty in a hypothesis (Cohen, 1985), following (Galliers, 1992; Logan et al., 1994). Our endorsements are based on the semantics of the utterance used to convey a befief, the level of expertise of the agent conveying the belief, stereotypical knowledge, etc.","The belief level of the dialogue model consists of mutual beliefs proposed by the agents' discourse actions. When an agent proposes a new belief and gives (optional) supporting evidence for it, this set of proposed beliefs is represented as a belief tree, where the belief represented by a child node is intended to support that represented by its parent. The root nodes of these belief trees (rap-level beliefs) contribute to problem-solving actions and thus affect the domain plan being developed. Given a set of newly proposed beliefs, the system must decide whether to accept the proposal or m initiate a negotiation dialogue to resolve conflicts. The evaluation of proposed beliefs starts at the leaf nodes of the proposed belief trees since acceptance of a piece of proposed evidence may affect acceptance of the parent belief it is intended to support. The process continues until the top-level proposed beliefs are evaluated. Conflict resolution strategies are invoked only if the top-level proposed beliefs are not accepted because if collaborative agents agree on a belief relevant to the domain plan being constructed, it is irrelevant whether they agree on the evidence for that belief (Young et al., 1994).","In determining whether to accept a proposed befief or evidential relationship, the evaluator first constructs an evidence set containing the system's evidence thin supports or attacks _bcl and the evidence accepted by the system that was proposed by the user as support for -bel. Each piece of evidence contains a belief _beli, and an evidential relationship supports(.beli,-bel). Follow-ing Walker's weakest link assumption (Walker, 1992) the strength of the evidence is the weaker of the strength of the belief and the strength of the evidential relationship. The evaluator then employs a simplified version of Galliers' belief revision mechanism 2 (Galliers, 1992; Logan et al., 1994) to compare the strengths of the evidence that supports and attacks _bel. If the strength of one set of evidence strongly outweighs that of the other, the decision to accept or reject.bel is easily made.

Since beliefs (1) and (2) above constitute a warranted piece of evidence against the proposed belief and beliefs (3) and (4) constitute a strong piece of evidence against it, the system will not accept On-Sabbatical(Smith, next year).","The system believes that being on sabbatical implies a faculty member is not teaching any courses; thus the proposed evidential relationship will be accepted. However, the system will not accept the top-level proposed belief, -,Teaches(Smith, A/), since the system has a prior belief to the contrary (as expressed in utterance ( 1 )) and the only evidence provided by the user was an implication whose antecedent was not accepted. 4.2 Modifying Unaccepted Proposals The collaborative planning principle in (Whittak~ and Stenton, 1988; Walker, 1992) suggests that \"conversants must provide evidence of a detected discrepancy in belief as soon as possible.\" Thus, once an agent detects a relevant conflict, she must notify the other agent of the conflict and initiate a negotiation subdialogne to resolve it-- to do otherwise is to fail in her responsibility as a collaborative agent. We capture the attempt to resolve a conflict with the problem-solving action Modify-Proposal, whose goal is to modify the proposal to a form that will potentially be accepted by both agents. When applied to belief modification, Modify-Proposal has two specializations: Correct-Node, for when a proposed belief is not accepted, and Correct-Relation, for when a proposed evidential relationship is not accepted. Figure 2 shows the problem-solving recipes 4 for Correct-Node and its subac-tion, Modify-Node, that is responsible for the actual modification of the proposal. The applicability conditions 5 of Correct-Node specify that the action can only be invoked when _sl believes that _node is not acceptable while _s2 believes that it is (when _sl and _s2 disagree about the proposed belief represented by ..node). However, since this is a collaborative interaction, the actual modification can only be performed when both ..sl and _s2 believe that _node is not acceptable w that is, the conflict between _sl and .s2 must have been resolved.

For example, in the case where Correct-Node is selected as the specialization of Modify-Proposal, the system must determine how the parameter node in Correct-Node should be instantiated. The goal of the modification process is to resolve the agents' conflicts regarding the unaccepted top-level proposed beliefs. For each such belief, the system could provide evidence against the befief itself, address the unaccepted evidence proposed by the user to eliminate the user's justification for the belief, or both. Since collaborative agents are expected to engage in effective and efficient dialogues, the system should address the unaccepted belief that it predicts will most quickly resolve the top-level conflict. Therefore, for each unaccepted top-level belief, our process for selecting the focus of modificatkm involves two steps: identifying a candidate foci tree from the proposed belief tree, and selecting a","eThis subdialogue is considered an interrupt by Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990), initiated to negotiate the truth of a piece of information. However, the utterances they classify as interrupts include not only our negotiation subdialogues, generated for the purpose of modifying a proposal, but also clarification subdialogues, and information-sharing subdialogues (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995), which we contend should be part of the evaluation process. 139 focus from the candidate foci tree using the heuristic \"attack the belief(s) that will most likely resolve the conflict about the top-level belief.\" A candidate loci tree contains the pieces of evidence in a proposed belief tree which, if disbelieved by the user, might change the user's view of the unaccepted top-level proposed belief (the root node of that belief tree). It is identified by performing a depth-first search on the proposed belief tree. When a node is visited, both the belief and the evidential relationship between it and its parent are examined. If both the belief and relationship were accepted by the evaluator, the search on the current branch will terminate, since once the system accepts a belief, it is irrelevant whether it accepts the user's support for that belief (Young et al., 1994). Otherwise, this piece of evidence will be included in the candidate loci tree and the system will continue to search through the evidence in the belief tree proposed as support for the unaccepted belief and/or evidential relationship.","Once a candidate foci tree is identified, the system should select the focus of modification based on the likelihood of each choice changing the user's belief about the top-level belief. Figure 3 shows our algorithm for this selection process. Given an unaccept~ belief (.bel) and the beliefs proposed to support it, Select-Focus. Modification will annotate_bel with 1) its focus of modification (.bel.focus), which contains a set of beliefs (.bel and/or its descendents) which, if disbelieved by the user, are predicted to cause him to disbelieve _bel, and 2) the system's evidence against_bel itself (_hel.s-attack).","Select-Focus-Modification determines whether to attack _bel's supporting evidence separately, thereby eliminating the user's reasons for holding ..b¢l, to atta~ ..bel itself, or both. However, in evainating the effectiveness of attacking the proposed evidence for.bel, the system must determine whether or not it is possible to successfully refute a piece of evidence (i.e., whether or not the system believes that sufficient evidence is available to convince the user that a piece of proposed evidence is invalid), and if so, whether it is mote effective to attack the evidence itself or its support. Thus the algorithm recursively applies itself to the evidence proposed as support for _bel which was not accepted by the system (step 3). In this recursive process, the algorithm annotates each unaccepted belief or evidential relationship proposed to support _bel with its focus of modification (-beli.focus) and the system's evidence against it (_beli.s-attack). _bell.focus contains the beliefs selected to be addressed in order to change the user's belief about ..beli, and its value will be nil if the system predicts that insufficient evidence is available to change the user's belief about -bell.","Based on the information obtained in step 3, Select.

Thus the algorithm first considers whether or not attacking the user's support for ..bel is sufficient to convince him of--,-bel (step 4.2). It does so by gathering (in cand-set) evidence proposed by the user as direct support for _bel but which was not accepted by the system and which the system predicts it can successfully refute (i.e., =beli.focus is not nil). The algorithm then hypothesizes that the user has changed his mind about each belief in cand-set and predicts how this will affect the user's belief about .bel (step 4.2). If the user is predicted to accept --,..bel under this hypothesis, the algorithm invokes Select-Min-Set to select a minimum subset of cand-set as the unaccepted beliefs that it would actually pursue, and the focus of modification (..bel.focus) will be the union of 140 the focus for each of the beliefs in this minimum subset.","If attacking the evidence for _bel does not appear to be sufficient to convince the user of -~_bel, the algorithm checks whether directly attacking _bel will accomplish this goal. If providing evidence directly against _bel is predicted to be successful, then the focus of modification is _bcl itself (step 4.3). If directly attacking _bel is also predicted to fail, the algorithm considers the effect of attacking both ..bel and its unaccepted proposed evidence by combining the previous two prediction processes (step 4.4). If the combined evidence is still predicted to fail, the system does not have sufficient evidence to change the user's view of_bel; thus, the focus of modification for .bel is nil (step 4.5). 7 Notice that steps 2 and 4 of the algorithm invoke a function, Predict, that makes use of the belief revision mechanism (Galliers, 1992) discussed in Section 4.1 to predict the user's acceptance or unacceptance of..bel based on the system's knowledge of the user's beliefs and the evidence that could be presented to him (Logan et al., 1994). The result of Select-Focus-Modification is a set of user beliefs (in _bel.focus) that need to be modified in order to change the user's belief about the unaccepted top-level belief. Thus, the negations of these beliefs will be posted by the system as mutual beliefs to be achieved in order to perform the Mod/fy actions. 4.2.2 Selecting Justification for a Claim","Studies in communication and social psychology have shown that evidence improves the persuasiveness of a message (Luchok and McCroskey, 1978; Reynolds and Burgoon, 1983; Petty and Cacioppo, 1984; Hampie, 1985). Research on the quantity of evidence indicates that there is no optimal amount of evidence, but that the use of high-quality evidence is consistent with persuasive effects (Reinard, 1988). On the other hand, Cn'ice's maxim of quantity (Grice, 1975) specifies that one should not contribute more information than is required, s Thus, it is important that a collaborative agent selects suffmient and effective, but not excessive, evidence to justify an intended mutual belief.","To convince the user ofa belief,_bel, our system selects appropriate justification by identifying beliefs that could","7In collaborative dialogues, an agent should reject a proposal only ff she has strong evidence against it.

The system must first determine wbether justification for_bel is needed by predicting whether or not merely informing the user of _bel will be sufficient to convince him of _bel. If so, no justification will be presented. If justification is predicted to be necessary, the system will first construct the justification chains that could be used to support _bel. For each piece of evidence t~t could be used to directly support ..bel, the system first predicts whether the user will accept the evidence without justification. If the user is predicted not to accept a piece of evidence (evidi), the system will augment the evidence to be presented to the user by posting evidi as a mutual belief to be achieved, and selecting propositions that could serve as justification for it. This results in a recursive process that returns a chain of belief justifications that could be used to support.bel.","Once a set of beliefs forming justification chains is identified, the system must then select from this set those belief chains which, when presented to the user, are predicted to convince the user of .bel. Our system will first construct a singleton set for each such justification chain and select the sets containing justification which, when presented, is predicted to convince the user of _bel. If no single justification chain is predicted to be sufficient to change the nser's beliefs, new sets will be constructed by combining the single justification chains, and the selection ~ is repeated. This will produce a set of possible candidate justification chains, and three heuristics will then be applied to select from among them. The first heuristic prefers evidence in which the system is most confident since high-quality evidence produces more attitude change than any other evidence form (Luchok and McCroskey, 1978). Furthermore, the system can better justify a belief in which it has high confidence should the user not accept it. The second heuristic prefers evidence that is novel to the user, since studies have shown that evidence is most persuasive ff it is previously unknown to the hearer (Wyer, 1970; Morley, 1987).

The model captures features specific to collaborative negotiation. It also suppom effective and efficient dialogues by identifying the focus of modification based on its predicted success in resolving the conflict about the top-level belief and by using heuristics motivated by research in social psychology to select a set of evidence to justify the proposed modification of beliefs. Furthermore, by capturing collaborative negotiation in a cycle of Propose-Evaluate-Modify actions, the evaluation and modification processes can be applied re, cursively to capture embedded negotiation subdialogues.
