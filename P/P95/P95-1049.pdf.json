However, translating a free order language such as Korean to English is complicated. I present a mechanism to translate scrambled Korean sentences into English by combining the concepts of Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAGs) and Synchronous TAGs (STAGs). 1 Motivation Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) were first developed by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (Joshi et al., 1975). There are other variants of TAGs such as STAGs (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), and MC-TAGs (Weir, 1988). STAGs in particular can be used for machine translation and were applied to Korean-English machine translation in a military message domain (Palmer et al., 1995).","Park (Park, 1995) suggested a way of handling Korean scrambling using MC-TAGs together with a priority concept. However, as scrambled argument structures in Korean were represented as sets using MC-TAGs, a mechanism to combine MC-TAGs and STAGs was necessary to translate Korean scrambled sentences into English."]},{"title":"2 Korean-English Machine Translation Using STAGs","paragraphs":["STAGs are a variant of TAGs introduced to characterize correspondences between tree adjoining languages. They can be used to relate TAGs for two different languages for machine translation (Abeill6 et al., 1990). The translation process consists of three steps. The source sentence is parsed according to the source grammar. Each elementary tree in the derivation is considered with the features given from the derivation through unification. Second, the source derivation tree is transferred to a target derivation. This step maps each elementary tree in the source derivation tree to a tree in the target derivation tree by looking in the transfer lexicon. And finally, the target sentence is generated from the target derivation tree obtained in the previous step.","The transfer lexicon consists of pairs of trees, one from the source language and the other from the target language. Within the pair of trees, nodes may be linked. Whenever adjunction or substitution is performed on a linked node in a source tree, the corresponding operation applies to the linked node in the target tree."]},{"title":"i \"-':1 , \"--', \"i i \"°","paragraphs":["Fibre 1: The K-E Transfer Lexicon","Canonical ordering of the arguments of transitive verbs in Korean is SOV. Whereas the case marker in English is implicit in the word, case markers are explicit in Korean. This is reflected in the transfer lexicon of Figure 1. So, the pair a in Figure 1 shows that Korean has an explicit subject case marker i, and the pair/~ shows that Korean has an explicit object case marker lul. Also, the pair 7 shows the links between SOV structure of Korean to SVO structure of English.","K: Tom-i Jerry-lul ccossnunta. 1 Tom-NOM Jerry-ACC chase","E: Tom chases Jerry.","To translate sentence (1), we start with the pair 7 in Figure 1, and we substitute the pair a on the link from the Korean node SP to the English node NP.

However, Becker and Rambow show that TAGs that obey the co-occurrence constraint cannot handle the full range of scrambled sentences (Becket and Rainbow, 1990).

However, in the case that it is a multi-component structure (e.g., /~AT~), an adjunction node need not necessarily be linked to any node. If it is not linked to any node of the target language, the structure can be freely adjoined onto any available node of the partially derived tree of the source language, which is approximately what scrambling is about. However, substitution nodes will always be linked (the difference between a substitution node and an adjunction node is that an adjunction node does not introduce a new structure to the partially derived tree whereas a substitution node always does)."]},{"title":"t~\"- )'.,'.\" l\" ..... }\" (a)K","paragraphs":["-"]},{"title":"E Lexicon .,::\"\",,~","paragraphs":["/oP..~.-.. ,~m ., .... - \"kr - -.... ~N ' ~p t \" '11 \" ' \" -i"]},{"title":"i : ~:1 : ~) I .,~ I:!","paragraphs":["~ ~ 'i \": . k 2 r / V . \" \" k ~ ] \"..../ I .JL...,,"]},{"title":"~..1","paragraphs":["Y'am"]},{"title":"(b)K - E DerivedTrees After Applying (a)","paragraphs":["Figure 4: K-E Transfer Lexicon and Derived Tree","In Figure 4(a), the root node NP of an English TAG is mapped to the OP node of/~A~G~, of a Korean TAG which is a head structure.
