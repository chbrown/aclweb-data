These theories are usually implemented in a language such as Prolog that can simulate A-term operations with first-order unification. However, there are cases in which this can only be done by obscuring the underlying linguistic theory with the \"tricks\" needed for implementation. For example, Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1990) is a theory of syntax and semantic interpretation that has the attractive characteristic of handling many coordination constructs that other theories cannot. While many aspects of CCG semantics can be reasonably simulated in first-order unification, the simulation breaks down on some of the most interesting cases that CCG can theoretically handle. The problem in general, and for CCG in particular, is that the implementation language does not have sufficient expressive power to allow a more direct encoding. The solution given in this paper is to show how advances in logic programming allow the implementation of semantic theories in a very direct and natural way, using CCG as a case study.","We begin by briefly illustrating why first-order unification is inadequate for some coordination constructs, and then review two proposed solutions. The sentence in (la) usually has the logical form (LF) in (lb).

The crucial aspect for this paper is that together these features permits the usage of abstract syntax to express the logical forms terms computed by CCG. The built-in A-term manipulation is used as a \"meta-language\" in which the \"object-language\" of CCG logical forms is expressed, and variables in the object-language are mapped to variables in the meta-language.","The AProlog code fragment shown in Figure 3 declares how the CCG logical forms are represented.

Instead it is a simple matter of using the meta-level ~-reduction to eliminate ~-redexes to produce the final result (abe x\\(found I harry x)). We won't show the complete declaration of the/~-reducer, but the key clause is simply: red (app (abe N) N) (N N).","Thus, using the abstract syntax capabilities of ~Prolog, we can have a direct implementation of the underlying linguistic formalism, in stark contrast to the first-order simulation shown in Figure 2. 4 Implementation of Coordination A primary goal of abstract-syntax is to support recursion through abstractions with bound variables. This leads to the interpretation of a bound variable as a \"scoped constant\" - it acts like a constant that is not visible from the top of the term, but which becomes visible during the descent through the abstraction. See (Miller, 1991) for a discussion of how this may be used for evaluation of functional programs by \"pushing\" the evaluation through abstractions to reduce redexes that are not at the top-level. This technique is also used in the fl-reducer briefly mentioned at the end of the previous section, and a similar technique will be used here to implement coordination by recursively descending through the two arguments to be coordinated.","Before describing the implementation of coordination, it is first necessary to mention how CCG categories are represented in the ~Prolog code. As shown in Figure 5, cat is declared to be a primitive type, and np, s, conj, noun are the categories used in this implementation, fs and bs are declared 216 type","coord cat -> tm -> tm -> tm -> o.","coord (fs • B) (abs It) (abs S) (abs T) \"- pi x\\ (coord B (~ x) (S x) (T x)).","cooed (be i B) (abe R) (abe S) (abe T) \"- pi x\\ (coord B (R x) (S x) (T x)). coord B R S (and' E S) :- atomic-type B. Figure 6: Implementation of coordination to be constructors for forward and backward slash. For example, the CCG category for a transitive verb (s\\np)/np would be represented as (fs np (bs np s)). Also, the predicate atomic-type is declared to be true for the four atomic categories. This will be used in the implementation of coordination as a test for termination of the recursion.","The implementation of coordination crucially uses the capability of AProlog for universal quantification in the goal of a clause, pi is the meta-level operator for V, and Vz.M is written as pi x\\l|. The operational semantics for AProlog state that pi x\\G is provable if and only if [c/z]G is provable, where c is a new variable of the same type as z that does not otherwise occur in the current signature. In other words, c is a scoped constant and the current signature gets expanded with c for the proof of [c/z]G. Since e is meant to be treated as a generic placeholder for any arbitrary z of the proper type, c must not appear in any terms instantiated for logic variables during the proof of [c/z]G. The significance of this restriction will be illustrated shortly.","The code for coordination is shown in Figure 6. The four arguments to cooed are a category and three terms that are the object-level LF representations of constituents of that category. The last argument will result from the coordination of the second and third arguments. Consider again the earlier problematic example (la) of coordination. Recall that after john is type-raised, its LF will be (abs p\\(app p john')) and similarly for bill. They will both have the category (fs (bs np s) s). Thus, to obtain the LF for John and Bill, the following query would be made: ?- coord (fs (bs np s) s)","(abs p\\(app p john'))","Cabs pkCapp p"]},{"title":"bill')) M.","paragraphs":["This will match with the first clause for coord, with • t instantiated to (be np s) • Btos • It to (p\\(app p john')) •"]},{"title":"S","paragraphs":["to"]},{"title":"(p\\(app p bill'))","paragraphs":["• and T a logic variable waiting instantiation. Then, after the meta-level/~-reduction using the new scoped constant c, the following goal is called: ?- coord s (app ¢ john') (app c bill') II. where II = (T c). Since s is an atomic type, the third coord clause matches with","• B instantiated to s","• R to (app c john')","• S to (app c bill')","• II to (and' (app c john') (app c bill')) Since I = (T c), higher-order unification is used by AProlog to instantiate T by extracting c from II with the result T = x\\(and' (app x john') (app x bill')) and so H from the original query is (abe x\\(and' (app •"]},{"title":"john')","paragraphs":["(app • bill'))) Note that since c is a scoped constant arising from the proof of an universal quantification, the instantiation T = x\\(and' (app"]},{"title":"¢ john')","paragraphs":["(app • bill')) is prohibited, along with the other extractions that do not remove c from the body of the abstraction.","This use of universal quantification to extract out c from a term containing c in this case gives the same result as a direct implementation of the rule for cooordination of unary functions (7a) would. However, this same process of recursive descent via scoped constants will work for any member of the conj rule family. For example, the following query ?- coord","(~s np (be np s))","Cabs obj\\(abs sub\\(like' sub obj)))","(abs obj\\(abs sub\\(hate' sub obj)))","M. 14 = (abe x\\","(abe xl\\","(and' (like' xl x)"]},{"title":"(hate' xl x)))).","paragraphs":["corresponds to rule (7b). Note also that the use of the same bound variable names obj and sub causes no difficulty since the use of scoped-constants, meta-level H-reduction, and higher-order unification is used to access and manipulate the inner terms. Also, whereas (Park, 1992) requires careful consideration of handling of determiners with coordination, here such sentences are handled just like any others. For example, the sentence Mary gave every dog a bone and some policeman a flower results in the LF 12.","12This is a case in which the paxticulax LF assumed here fails to yield another available scoping.

(Steedman, 1990) also discusses \"generalized composition\", and it may well be that a similar implementation is possible for that family of rules as well."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have shown how higher-order logic programming can be used to elegantly implement the semantic theory of CCG, including the previously difficult case of its handling of coordination constructs. The techniques used here should allow similar advantages for a variety of such theories.","An argument can be made that the approach taken here relies on a formalism that entails implementation issues that are more difficult than for the other solutions and inherently not as efficient. However, the implementation issues, although more complex, are also well-understood and it can be expected that future work will bring further improvements. For example, it is a straightforward matter to transform the ,XProlog code into a logic called L~ (Miller, 1990) which requires only a restricted form of unification that is decidable in linear time and space. Also, the declarative nature of ~Prolog programs opens up the possibility for applications of program transformations such as partial evaluation. 6 Acknowledgments This work is supported by ARC) grant DAAL03-89-0031, DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863, and ARO grant DAAH04-94-G-0426.
