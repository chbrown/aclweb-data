Handling of various Semitic error problems is illustrated, with reference to Arabic and Syriac examples. The model handles errors vocalisation, diacritics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies, in addition to Damerau errors. A complementary correction strategy for morphologically sound but morphosyntactically ill-formed words is outlined. 1 Introduction Semitic is known amongst computational linguists, in particular computational morphologists, for its highly inflexional morphology. Its root-and-pattern phenomenon not only poses difficulties for a morphological system, but also makes error detection a difficult task. This paper aims at presenting a morphographemic model which can cope with both issues.","The following convention has been adopted. Mor-phemes are represented in braces, { }, surface (phonological) forms in solidi, //, and orthographic strings in acute brackets, (). In examples of grammars, variables begin with a capital letter. Cs denote consonants, Vs denote vowels and a bar denotes complement. An asterisk, *, indicates ill-formed strings.","The difficulties in morphological analysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts:","* Supported by a British Telecom Scholarship, administered by the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust in conjunction with the Foreign sad Commonwealth Office.","t Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from St John's College. Non-Linearity A Semitic stem consists of a root and a vowel melody, arranged according to a canonical pattern. For example, Arabic/kuttib/ 'caused to write - perfect passive' is composed from the root morpheme {ktb} 'notion of writing' and the vowel melody morpheme {ul} 'perfect passive'; the two are arranged according to the pattern morpheme {CVCCVC} 'causative'. This phenomenon is analysed by (McCarthy, 1981) along the fines of autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976).

Mattes lectionis cannot be omitted from the orthographic string. 24","• Vowel and Diacritic Shifts Semitic languages employ a large number of diacritics to represent enter alia short vowels, doubled letters, and nunation. 3 Most editors allow the user to enter such diacritics above and below letters. To speed data entry, the user usually enters the base characters (say a paragraph) and then goes back and enters the diacritics. A common mistake is to place the cursor one extra position to the left when entering diacritics. This results in the vowels being shifted one position, e.g. *(wkatubi) instead of (wakutib).","• Vocalisms The quality of the perfect and im-perfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semitic verbs are idiosyncratic. For example, the Syriac root {ktb} takes the perfect vowel a, e.g. /ktab/, while the root {nht} takes the vowel e, e.g. /nhet/. It is common among learners to make mistakes such as */kteb/or */nhat/.","• Phonetic Syncopation A consonantal segment may be omitted from the phonetic surface form, but maintained in the orthographic surface from. For example, Syriac (md/nt~)'city' is pronounced/mdit~/.","* Idiosyncrasies The application of a morphographemic rule may have constraints as on which lexical morphemes it may or may not apply. For example, the glottal stop [~] at the end of a stem may become [w] when followed by the relative adjective morpheme {iyy}, as in Arabic /samaaP+iyy/-+/samaawiyy/'heavenly', but /hawaaP+iyy/-~/hawaa~iyy/'of air'.","* Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals, diminutives and deverbal nouns, the user may enter a morphologically sound, but morphosyntactically ill-formed word. We shall discuss this in more detail in section 4. 4 To the above, one adds language-independent issues in spell checking such as the four Damerau transformations: omission, insertion, transposition and substitution (Damerau, 1964). 2 A Morphographemic Model This section presents a morphographemic model which handles error detection in non-linear strings.","3When indefinite, nouns and adjectives end in a phonetic In] which is represented in the orthographic form by special diacritics.","4For other issues with respect to syntactic dependencies, see (Abduh, 1990). Subsection 2.1 presents the formalism used, and sub-section 2.2 describes the model. 2.1 The Formalism In order to handle the non-linear phenomenon of Arabic, our model adopts the two-level formalism presented by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993), with the multi tape extensions in (Kiraz, 1994). Their for-realism appears in (2)."]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["TwO-LEVEL FORMALISM LLC - LEX RLC LSC - SURF - RSC where LLC LEX RLC LSC SURF RSC = left lexical context = lexical form = right lexical context = left surface context = surface form = right surface context The special symbol * is a wildcard matching any context, with no length restrictions.

A lexical string maps to a surface string if[ they can be partitioned into pairs of lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair is licenced by a =~ or ~ rule, and no partition violates a ¢~ rule. In the multi-tape version, lexical expressions (i.e. LLC, LEX and RLC) are n-tuple of regulax expressions of the form (xl, x2, ..., xn): the/th expression refers to symbols on the ith tape; a nill slot is indicated by ~.5 Another extension is giving LLC the ability to contain ellipsis, ... , which indicates the (optional) omission from LLC of tuples, provided that the tuples to the left of... are the first to appear on the left of LEx.","In our morphographemic model, we add a similar formalism for expressing error rules (3)."]},{"title":"(3) ERROR FORMALISM","paragraphs":["ErrSurf =~ Surf { PLC- PRC } where PLC = partition left context","(has been done) PRC = partition right context","(yet to be done)","5Our implementation interprets rules directly; hence, we allow ~.

They happily utilise the multi-tape format and integrate seamlessly into morphological analysis. PLC and PRC above are the left and right contexts of both the lexical and (correct) surface levels. Only the =~ is used (error is not obligatory). 2.2 The Model 2.2.1 Finding the error","Morphological analysis is first called with the as-sumption that the word is free of errors. If this fails, analysis is attempted again without the 'no error' restriction. The error rules are then considered when ordinary morphological rules fail. If no error rules succeed, or lead to a successful partition of the word, analysis backtracks to try the error rules at successively earlier points in the word.","For purposes of simplicity and because oh the whole is it likely that words will contain no more than one error (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora, 1983), normal 'no error' analysis usually resumes if an error rule succeeds. The exception occurs with a vowel shift error (§3.2.1). If this error rule succeeds, an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up, but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequent partitions. For this reason rules are marked as to whether they can occur more than once. 2.2.2 Suggesting a correction","Once an error rule is selected, the corrected surface is substituted for the error surface, and normai analysis continues - at the same position. The substituted surface may be in the form of a variable, which is then ground by the normal analysis sequence of lexical matching over the lexicon tree. In this way only lexical words a~e considered, as the variable letter can only he instantiated to letters branching out from the current position on the lexicon tree. Normal prolog backtracking to explore alternative rules/lexical branches applies throughout. 3 Error Checking in Arabic We demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbal stems shown in (4) (McCarthy, 1981). Verbs are classified according to their measure (M): there are 15 trilateral measures and 4 quadrilateral ones. Moving horizontally across the table, one notices a change in vowel melody (active {a}, passive {ui}); everything else remains invariant. Moving vertically, a change in canonical pattern occurs; everything else remains invariant.","Subsection 3.1 presents a simple two-level grammar which describes the above data.

The data described below was obtained from Daniel Ponsford (personal communication), based on (Wehr, 1971).","Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root morpheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged according to a canonical pattern morpheme.

A common mistake is to choose the wrong pattern.","In such a case, the two-level model succeeds in finding two-level analyses of the word in question, but fails when parsing the word morphosyntactically: at this stage, the parser is passed a root, vocalism and pattern whose feature structures do not unify.","Usually this feature-clash situation creates the problem of which constituent to give preference to (Langer, 1990). Here the vocalism indicates the inflection (e.g. broken plural) and the preferance of vocalism pattern for that type of inflection belongs to the root. For example *(kidaa~)would be analysed as root {kd~} with a broken plural vocalism. The pattern type of the vocalism clashes with the broken plural pattern that the root expects. To correct, the morphological analyser is executed in generation mode to generate the broken plural form of {kd~} in the normal way.","The same procedure can be applied on diminutive and deverbal nouns. 5 Conclusion The model presented corrects errors resulting from combining nonconcatenative strings as well as more standard morphological or spelling errors. It covers Semitic errors relating to vocalisation, diacritics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies. Morphosyntactic issues of broken plurals, diminutives and deverbal nouns can be handled by a complementary correction strategy which also depends on morphological analysis.","Other than the economic factor, an important advantage of combining morphological analysis and error detection/correction is the way the lexical tree associated with the analysis can be used to determine correction possibilities. The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesise lexical strings for a given surface string. The rules are accepted/rejected by checking that the lexical string(s) can extend along the lexical tree(s) from the current position(s). Variables introduced by error rules into the surface string are then instantiated by associating surface with lexical, and matching lexical strings to the lexicon tree(s). The system is unable to consider correction characters that would be lexical impossibilities. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank their supervisor Dr Stephen Pulman.
