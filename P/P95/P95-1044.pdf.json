The framework is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars and it uses the morpheme as the basic building block of the categorial lexicon. 1 Introduction In this paper, we address the problem of modelling interactions between different levels of language analysis. In agglutinative languages, affixes are attached to stems to form a word that may correspond to an entire phrase in a language like English. For instance, in Turkish, word formation is based on suffixation of derivational and inflectional morphemes. Phrases may be formed in a similar way (1).

For instance, causative suffixes change the valence of the verb, mad the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case. Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over the word boundaries, e.g., (2)"]},{"title":"iyi oku-mu~ ~ocuk","paragraphs":["well read-REL child 'well-educated child' In (2), the relative suffix"]},{"title":"-mu~","paragraphs":["(in past form of subject participle) modifies"]},{"title":"[iyi oku]","paragraphs":["to give the scope"]},{"title":"[[[iyi oku]mu~] 9ocuk].","paragraphs":["If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as"]},{"title":"[iyi [okumu~ 6ocuk]]","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"[[iyi okurnu~] ~ocuk]","paragraphs":["which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance.","As pointed out by Oehrle (1988), there is no reason to assume a layered grammatical architecture which has linguistic division of labor into components acting on one domain at a time. As a computational framework, rather than treating morphology, syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we propose an integrated model to capture the high level of interaction between the three domains. The model, which is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG) (Ades and Steedman, 1982; Steedman, 1985), uses the morpheme as the building block of composition at all three linguistic domains. 2 Morpheme-based Compositions When the morpheme is given the same status as the lexeme in terms of its lexical, syntactic, and semantic contribution, the distinction between the process models of morphotactics and syntax disappears. Consider the example in (3). (3)"]},{"title":"uzun kol-lu g5mlek","paragraphs":["long sleeve-ADJ shirt","Two different compositions 1 in CCG formalism are given in Figure 1.

We adopt a representation similar to Hoeksema and Janda's (1988) notation for the operator. The 3-tuple <direction, morpheme type, process type> indicates direction 2 (left, right, unspecified), morpheme type (free, bound), and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e.g., affix, clitic, syntactic concatenation, reduplication).

Semantic composition is also affected by the interplay of morphology and syntax, for instance the change in the scope of modifiers and genitive suffixes, or valency and thematic role change in causatives. To model interactions between domains, we propose a categorial approach in which composition in all domains proceed in parallel. As an implementation, we have been working on the modelling of Turkish causatives using this framework. 6 Acknowledgements I would like to thank my advisor Cem Bozsahin for sharing his ideas with me.
