This paper shows that quantifier scope phenomena can be precisely characterized by a semantic representation constrained by surhce constituency, if the distinction between referential and quantificational NPs is properly observed. A CCG implementation is described and compared to other approaches. 1 Introduction It is generally assumed that sentences with multiple quantified NPs are to be interpreted by one or more unambiguous logical forms in which the scope of traditional logical quantifiers determines the reading or readings. There are two problems with this assumption: (a) without further stipulation there is a tendency to allow too many readings and (b) there is considerable confusion as to how many readings should be allowed arising from contamination of the semantics of many NL quantifiers by referentiality.","There are two well-known techniques for redistributing quantifiers in quantification structures: quantifying-in (Montague, 1974; Cooper, 1983; Keller, 1988; Carpenter, 1994) and quantifier raising (May, 1985). The former provides a compositio-nal way of putting possibly embedded quantifiers to the scope-taking positions, and the latter utilizes a syntactic movement operation at the level of semantics for quantifier placement. There are also approaches that put more emphasis on utilizing contextual information in restricting the generation of semantic forms by choosing a scope-neutral representation augmented with ordering constraints to capture linguistic judgments (Webber, 1979; Kamp, 1981; Helm, 1983; Poesio, 1991; Reyle, 1993). And there are computational approaches that screen unavailable and/or redundant semantic forms (Hobbs Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991). This paper will show that these approaches allow unavailable readings, and thereby miss an important generalization concerning the readings that actually are available.","This paper examines English constructions that allow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NP modifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, that complements, and coordinate structures. Based on a critical analysis of readings that are available from these data, the claim is that scope phenomena can be characterized by a combination of syntactic surface adjacency and semantic function-argument re-lationship. This characterization will draw upon the old distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics (Fodor & Sag, 1982). We choose to use Combinatory Categorial Grammar to show how surface adjacency affects semantic function-argument relationship, since CCG has the flexibility of composing almost any pair of adjacent constituents with a precise notion of syntactic grammaticality (Steedman, 1990; 1993). z","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we discuss in §2 how traditional techniques address availability of readings and note some residual problems. Then we give a brief analysis of available readings (§3), a generalization of the analysis (§4), and finally describe a computational implementation in Prolog (~5). 2 Traditional Approaches All three paradigms of grammar formalisms introduced earlier share similar linguistic judgments for their grammaticality analyses. This section examines quantifying-in to show (a) that quantifying-in is a powerful device that allows referential NP-interpretations and (b) that quantifying-in is not sufficiently restricted to account for the available readings for quantificational NP-interpretations.","Quantifying-in is a technique originally introduced to produce appropriate semantic forms for de re interpretations of NPs inside opaque operators","1 For instance, the result would transfer to Synchronous \"I~ee Adjoining Grammar (Shieber & Schabes, 1990) without much change."]},{"title":"205","paragraphs":["(Montague, 1974). For example, (a) below has two readings, de re and de dicto, depending on the relativity of the existence of such an individual. They are roughly interpretable as (b) and (@2","(1) (a) John believes that a Republican will win. (b) 3r.repub(r) A bel(john, uill(uin(r))) (C) bel(john, 3r.repub(r) A uill(uin(r))) (b) has a binder 3 that is quaati.fving a variable r inside an opaque operator bel, hence the name for the technique. (c) does not have such an intervening operator. Although it is beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss further details of intensionality, it is clear that de re interpretations of NPs are strongly related to referential NP-semantics, in the sense that the de re reading of (a) is about a referred individual and not about an arbitrary such individual. Quantifying-in is designed to make any (possibly embedded) NP take the matrix scope, by leaving a scoped variable in the argument position of the original NP. This would be acceptable for referential NP-semantics.","Montague also proposed to capture purely extensional scope ambiguities using quantifying-in. For example, wide scope reading of a woman in (a) below is accounted for by quantifying-in (with a meaning postulate), patterned after one for (b).","(2) (a) Every man loves a woman. (b) Every man seeks a white unicorn. His suggestion is adopted with various subsequent revisions cited earlier. Since any NP, referential or quantificational, requires quantifying-in to outscope another, quantifying-in consequently confounds referential and quantificational NP-semantics. This causes a problem when there is a distributional difference between referential NPs and non-referential NPs, as Fodor & Sag (1982) have argued, a view which has been followed by the approaches to dynamic interpretation of indefinite NPs cited earlier. It seems hard to reconcile quantifying-in with these observations. 3 Availability of Readings This section proposes a way of sharpening our intuition on available readings and re-examines traditional linguistic judgments on grammatical readings.","While there are undoubted differences in degree of availability among readings dependent upon semantics or discourse preference (Bunt, 1985; Moran, 1988), we will focus on all-or-none structural possibilities afforded by competence grammar. 3","2In this simplistic notation, we gloss over tense analysis, among others.","3Moran's preference-based algorithm treats certain readings as \"highly unpreferred,\" effectively making them structurally unavailable, from those possible sco-","Consider the following unambiguous quantification structure in a generalized quantifier format (hereafter oq, Barwise & Cooper, 1981), where quantifier outscopes any quantifiers that may occur in either restriction or body. (3) quantifier(variable, restriction, body) Logical forms as notated this way make explicit the functional dependency between the denotations of two ordered quantificational NPs. For example~ consider (4) (a) (Partee, 1975). (b) shows one way of representing it in a GQ format. (4) (a) Three Frenchmen visited five Russians.","(b) three(f, frenchmen(f), five(r,","russians (r), visited(f, r) ) ) We can always argue, by enriching the notation, that (4) (b) represents at least four different readings, depending on the particular sense of each involved NP, i.e., group- vs individual-denoting. In every such reading, however, the truth of (4) (b) depends upon finding appropriate individuals (or the group) for f such that each of those individuals (or the group itself) gets associated with appropriate individuals (or a group of individuals) for r via the relation visil;ed. 4 Notice that there is always a functional dependency of individuals denoted by r upon individuals denoted by f. We claim that this explicit functional dependency can be utilized to test availability of readings. 5","First, consider the following sentences without coordination. (5) (a) Two representatives of three companies","saw most samples.","(b) Every dealer shows most customers at","most three cars.","(c) Most boys think that every man danced","with two women. (a) has three quantifiers, and there are 6 different ways of ordering them. Hobbs & Shieber (1987) show that among these, the reading in which two representatives outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes three companies is not available from the sentence. They attribute the reason to the logical structure of English as in (3), as it is considered unable to afford an unbound variable, a constraint known as the unbound variable constraint (uvc). 6 We should note, however, that there is one reading pings generated by a scheme similar to Hobbs & Shieber (1887). We clash that competence grammax makes even fewer readings available in the first place.","4Without losing generality, therefore, we will consider only individual-denoting NPs in this paper.","SSingular NPs such as a company are not helpful to this task since their denotations do not involve multiple individuals which explicitly induce this functional dependency.","eThe reading would be represented as follows, which has the first occurrence of the variable c left unbound. 206 among the remaining five that the uvc allows which in fact does not appear to be available. This is the one in which three companies outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes two representatives (cf. Horn (1972), Fodor (1982)). 7 This suggests that the uvc may not be the only principle under which Hobbs & Shieber's reading is excluded, s The other four readings of (a) are self-evidently available. If we generalize over available readings, they are only those that have no quantifiers which intercalate over NP boundaries. 9","(5) (b) has three quantifiers too, but unlike (5) (a), all the six ways of ordering the quantifiers are available. (5) (c) has only four available readings, where most boys does not intercalate every man and two women. 1°","Consider now sentences including coordination.","(6) (a) Every girl admired, but most boys detested, one of the saxophonists.","(b) Most boys think that every man danced with, but doubt that a few boys talked to, more than two women. As Geach (1970) pointed out, (a) has only two grammatical readings, though it has three quantifiers. In reading 1, the same saxophonist was admired and detested at the same time. In reading 2, every girl admired an arbitrary saxophonist and most boys also detested an arbitrary saxophonist. In particular, missing readings include the one in which every girl admired the same saxophonist and most boys detested the same but another saxophonist.

Crucially, samples seen by representatives of different companies were not necessarily the same.","SThis should not be taken as denying the reality of the uvc itself. For example, as one of the referees pointed out, the uvc is required to explain why, in (a) below, every professor must outscope a friend so as to bind the pronoun his.","(a) Most students talked to a friend of every pro-","fessor about his work. 9One can replace most samples with other complex","NP such as most samples of at least five products to see","this.

In one, most boys outscopes every man and a few boys which together outscope more than two women. In the other, more than two women outscopes every man and a few boys, which together outscope most boys. 4 An Account of Availability This section proposes a generalization at the level of semantics for the phenomena described earlier and considers its apparent counterexamples.","Consider a language £ for natural language semantics that explicitly represents function-argument relationships (Jackendoff, 1972).

This generalization captures the earlier observations about availability of readings. (7), for (4) (a), has two (2!) readings, as viaited has two arguments. (8) is an abstraction for four (2!x2!) readings, as both of and maw have two arguments each. (9) is an abstraction for six (3!) readings, as show has three arguments. Likewise, (10) is an abstraction for four readings.","Coordination gives an interesting constraint on availability of readings. Geach's observation that (6) (a) has two readings suggests that the scope of the object must be determined before it reduces with the coordinate fragment. Suppose that the non-standard constituent for one of the conjuncts in (6) (a) has a semantic representation shown below. (12) ~z adnired(z,svery(girl)) Geach's observation implies that (12) is ambiguous, so that every(girl) can still take wide (or narrow) scope with respect to the unknown argument. A","11The up-operator ̂in (10) takes a term of type t to a term of type e, but a further description of £ is not relevant to the present discussion.","12Nan (1991)'s work is based on a related observation, though he does not make use of the distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics. 207 theory of CCG will be described in the next section to show how to derive scoped logical forms for available readings only.","But first we must consider some apparent counterexamples to the generalization,","(13) (a) Three hunters shot at five tigers. (b) Every representative of a company saw","most samples. The obvious reading for (a) is called conjunctive or cumulative (Partee, 1975; Webber 1979). In this reading, there are three hunters and five tigers such that shooting events happened between the two parties. Here, arguments are not presented in succession to their function, contrary to the present generalization. Notice, however, that the reading must have two (or more) referential NPs (Higginbotham, 1987). 13 The question is whether our theory should predict this possibility as well. For a precise notion of availability, we claim that we must appeal to the distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics, since almost any referential NP can have the appearance of taking the matrix scope, without affecting the rest of scope phenomena. A related example is (b), where in one reading a referential NP a company arguably outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes every representative (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987). As we have pointed out earlier, the reading does not generalize to quantified NPs in general.","(14) (a) Some student will investigate two dialects of every language.","(b) Some student will investigate two dialects of, and collect all interesting examples of coordination in, every language.","(c) * Two representative of at least three companies touched, but of few universities saw, most samples. (a) has a reading in which every language outscopes some student which in turn outscopes two dialects (May, 1985). In a sense, this has intercalating NP quantifiers, an apparent problem to our generalization. However, the grammaticality of (b) opens up the possibility that the two conjuncts can be represented grammatically as functions of arity two, similar to normal transitive verbs. Notice that the generalization is not at work for the fragment of at least three companies touched in (c), since the conjunct is syntactically ungrammatical. At the end of next section, we show how these finer distinctions are made under the CCG framework (See discussion of Figure 5). IZFor example, (a) below lacks such a reading. (a) Several men danced with few women."]},{"title":"5 A CCG Implementation","paragraphs":["This section describes a CCG approach to deriving scoped logical forms so that they range over only grammatical readings.","We will not discuss details of how CCG characterizes natural language syntactically, and refer the interested reader to Steedman (1993). CCGs make use of a limited set of combinators, type raising (T), function composition (B), and function substitution (S), with directionality of combination for syntactic grammaticality. For the examples in this paper, we only need type raising and function composition, along with function application. The following shows rules of derivation that we use. Each rule is associated with a label, such as > or <B etc, shown at the end.

One is to use elementary categories, such as np or s, in encoding both syntactic types and logical forms (Jowsey, 1990; Steedman, 1990; Park, 1992). The other is to associate the entire lexical category with a higher-order expression (Kulick, 1995). In this paper, we take the former alternative to describe a first-order rendering of CCG.","Some lexical entries for every are shown below.

We are using different lexical items, for instance q-every and e-every for every, in order to signify their semantic differences. 14 These lexical entries are just two instances of a general schema for type-raised categories of quantifiers shown below, where T is an arbitrary category.

One derivation of surface structure is that it ties abstraction or the equivalent as closely as possible to derivation. Apparent counterexamples to the generalization can be explained by the well-known distinction between referential and quantificational NP-semantics.

These conditions are typically stated on standard syntactic dominance relations, but these relations are no longer uniquely derivable once CCG allows non-standard surface structures. We can show, however, that by making use of the obliqueness hierarchy (of. Jackendoff (1972) and much subsequent work) at the level of LF, rather than surface structure, it is possible to state such conditions (Steedman, 1993).
