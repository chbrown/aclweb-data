These substrings need not be a contiguous part of the input; in fact, when this tree is used for adjunction then a string is inserted between these two suhstrings.

Theoretical results in this paper and those in (Rajasekaran, 1995) clearly demonstrate that asymptotically fast algorithms can be obtained for TAL parsing with the help of matrix multiplication algorithms. The main objective of the implementation was to check if matrix multiplication techniques help in practice also to obtain efficient parsing algorithms.","The recognizer implemented two different algorithms for matrix multiplication, namely the trivial cubic time algorithm and an algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the matrices.
