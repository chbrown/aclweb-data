The technique ensures that all information that is provided by the original tagset can be restored from the reduced one. This is crucial, since we are interested in the linguistically motivated tags for part-of-speech disambiguation. The reduced tagset needs fewer parameters for its statistical model and allows more accurate parameter estimation. Additionally, there is a slight but not significant improvement of tagging accuracy. 1 Motivation Statistical part-of-speech disambiguation can be efficiently done with n-gram models (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992).

It is an implicit assumption for statistical part-of-speech tagging that words belonging to the same category have similar probability distributions. But this assumption does not hold in many of the cases.","Take for example the word"]},{"title":"cliff","paragraphs":["which could be a proper (NP) 1 or a common noun (NN) (ignoring capitalization of proper nouns for the moment).

However, it does not suffice to assign the combined tag, if we are interested in the distinction between comparative and superlative form for further processing.

On the one hand, more tags mean that there is more information about a word at hand, on the other hand, the more tags, the severer the sparse-data problem is and the larger the corpora that are needed for training.","This paper presents a way to modify a given tagset, such that categories with similar distributions in a corpus are combined without losing information provided by the original tagset and without losing accuracy. 2 Clustering of Tags The aim of the presented method is to reduce a tagset as much as possible by combining"]},{"title":"(clustering)","paragraphs":["two or more tags without losing information and without losing accuracy. The fewer tags we have, the less parameters have to be estimated and stored, and the less severe is the sparse data problem. Incoming text will be disambiguated with the new reduced tagset, but we ensure that the original tag is still uniquely ide:.ltified by the new tag.","The basic idea is to exploit the fact that some of the categories have a very similar frequency distribution in a corpus. If we combine categories with 287 similar distribution characteristics, there should be only a small change in the tagging result. The main change is that single tags are replaced by a cluster of tags, from which the original has to be identified. First experiments with tag clustering showed that, even for fully automatic identification of the original tag, tagging accuracy slightly increased when the reduced tagset was used. This might be a result of having more occurrences per tag for a smaller tagset, and probability estimates are preciser. 2.1 Unique Identification of Original Tags A crucial property of the reduced tagset is that the original tag information can be restored from the new tag, since this is the information we are interested in. The property can be ensured if we place a constraint on the clustering of tags.","Let )'V be the set of words, C the set of clusters (i.e. the reduced tagset), and 7\" the original tagset.

Since we are interested in the reduction of large tagsets, a full search regarding all potential clusterings is not feasible. We compute the local maximum which can be found in polynomial time with a best-first search. We use a slight modification of the algorithm used by (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994) for merging HMMs. Our task is very similar to theirs. Stolcke and Omohundro start with a first order tIMM where every state represents a single occurrence of a word in a corpus, and the goal is to maximize the a posteriori probability of the model. We start with a second order HMM (since we use trigrams) where each state represents a part of speech, and our goal is to maximize the tagging accuracy for a corpus. The clustering algorithm works as follows: 1. Compute tagging accuracy for the clustering","part with the original tagset. 2.

The tags are based on the LOB tagset (Garside et al., 1987).","Three parts are taken from the corpus. Part A consists of about 127,000 words, part B of about 10,000 words, and part C of about 10,000 words. The rest of the corpus, about 10,000 words, is not used for this experiment. All parts are mutually disjunct.","First, part A and B were used for training, and part C for testing. Then, part A and C were used for training, and part B for testing. About 6% of the words in the test parts did not occur in the training parts, i.e. they are unknown. For the moment we only care about the known words and not about the unknown words (this is treated as a separate problem). Table 1 shows the tagging results for known words.","Clustering was applied in the next steps. In the third experiment, part A was used for trigram training, part B for clustering and part C for testing. In the fourth experiment, part A was used for trigram training, part C for clustering and part B for testing.","The baseline experiments used the clustering part for the normal training procedure to ensure that better performance in the clustering experiments is not due to information provided by the additional part.","Clustering reduced the tagset by 33 (third exp.), and 31 (fourth exp.) tags.

Experiments with larger texts and more permutations will be performed to get precise results for the improvement. 3 Conclusions We have shown a method for reducing a tagset used for part-of-speech tagging without losing information given by the original tagset. In a first experiment, we were able to reduce a large tagset and needed fewer parameters for the n-gram model. Additionally, tagging accuracy slightly increased, but the improvement was not significant. Further investigation will focus on criteria for cluster selection. Can we use a similarity measure of probability distributions to identify optimal clusters? How far can we reduce the tagset without losing accuracy? References","Kenneth Ward Church. 1988.
