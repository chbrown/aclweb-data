We present two methods for developing segmentation algorithms from training data: hand tuning and machine learning. When multiple types of features are used, results approach human performance on an independent test set (both methods), and using cross-validation (machine learning). 1 Introduction Many have argued that discourse has a global structure above the level of individual utterances, and that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phrases, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by and reflect this structure (cf. (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Hobbs, 1979; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992; Linde, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Polanyi, 1988; Reichman, 1985; Webber, 1991)). However, an obstacle to exploiting the rela-tion between global structure and linguistic devices in natural language systems is that there is too little data about how they constrain one another. We have been engaged in a study addressing this gap. In previous work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units. We found significant agreement among naive subjects on a discourse segmentation task, which suggests that global discourse units have some objective reality. However, we also found poor correlation of three untuned algorithms (based on features of referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses, respectively) with the subjects' segmentations.","In this paper, we discuss two methods for developing segmentation algorithms using multiple know- *Bellcore did not support the second author's work. ledge sources. In section 2, we give a brief overview of related work and summarize our previous results. In section 3, we discuss how linguistic features are coded and describe our evaluation. In section 4, we present our analysis of the errors made by the best performing untuned algorithm, and a new algorithm that relies on enriched input features and multiple knowledge sources. In section 5, we discuss our use of machine learning tools to automatically construct decision trees for segmentation from a large set of input features. Both the hand tuned and automatically derived algorithms improve over our previous algorithms. The primary benefit of the hand tuning is to identify new input features for improving performance. Machine learning tools make it convenient to perform numerous experiments, to use large feature sets, and to evaluate results using cross-validation. We discuss the significance of our results and briefly compare the two methods in section 6. 2 Discourse Segmentation 2.1 Related Work Segmentation has played a significant role in much work on discourse. The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner's (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure. In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation. In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations. Although all of these approaches have involved detailed analyses of individual discourses or representative corpora, we believe there is a need for more rigorous empirical studies.","Researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmen-108 tation, and to propose methodologies for quantify-ing their findings. Several studies have used expert coders to locally and globally structure spoken discourse according to the model of Grosz and Sidnet (1986), including (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Stifleman, 1995). Hearst (1994) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of expository texts, to indicate topic changes. Moser and Moore (1995) had an expert coder assign segments and various segment features and relations based on RST. To quantify their findings, these studies use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Mo-set and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Isard and Carletta, 1995).","By asking subjects to segment discourse using a non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguistic devices with independently derived segments can then be investigated in a way that avoids circularity. Together, (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995) comprise an ongoing study using three corpora: professionally read AP news stories, spontaneous narrative, and read and spontaneous versions of task-oriented monologues. Discourse structures are derived from subjects' segmentations, then statistical measures are used to characterize these structures in terms of acoustic-prosodic features. Grosz and Hirschberg's work also used the classification and regression tree system CART (Breiman et al., 1984) to automatically construct and evaluate decision trees for classifying aspects of discourse structure from intonational feature values. Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results. Hearst (1994) presented two implemented segmentation algorithms based on term repetition, and compared the boundaries produced to the boundaries marked by at least 3 of 7 subjects, using information retrieval metrics. Kozima (1993) had 16 subjects segment a simplified short story, developed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion, and qualitatively compared the results. Reynar (1994) proposed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion in conjunction with a graphical technique, and used information retrieval metrics to evaluate the algorithm's performance in locating boundaries between concatenated news articles. 2.2","Our Previous Results We have been investigating a corpus of monologues collected and transcribed by Chafe (1980), known as the Pear stories. As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether units of global structure consisting of sequences of utterances could be reliably identified by naive subjects. We analyzed linear segmentations of 20 narratives performed by naive subjects (7 new subjects per narrative), where speaker intention was the segment criterion. Subjects were given transcripts, asked to place a new segment boundary between lines (prosodic phrases) 1 wherever the speaker had a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe the completed segment. Subjects were free to assign any number of boundaries. The qualitative results were that segments varied in size from 1 to 49 phrases in length (Avg.-5.9), and the rate at which subjects assigned boundaries ranged from 5.5% to 41.3%. Despite this variation, we found statistically significant agreement among subjects across all narratives on location of segment boundaries (.114 z 10 -6 < p < .6 z 10-9).","We then looked at the predictive power of linguistic cues for identifying the segment boundaries agreed upon by a significant number of subjects. We used three distinct algorithms based on the distribution of referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses, respectively. Each algorithm (NP-A, CUE-A, PAUSE-A) was designed to replicate the subjects' segmentation task (break up a narrative into contiguous segments, with segment breaks falling between prosodic phrases). NP-A used three features, while CUE-A and PAUSE-A each made use of a single feature. The features are a subset of those described in section 3.","To evaluate how well an algorithm predicted segmental structure, we used the information retrieval (IR) metrics described in section 3. As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, to appear), we also evaluated a simple additive method for combining algorithms in which a boundary is proposed if each separate algorithm proposes a boundary. We tested all pairwise combinations, and the combination of all three algorithms. No algorithm or combination of algorithms performed as well as humans. NP-A performed better than the other unimodal algorithms, and a combination of NP-A and PAUSE-A performed best. We felt that significant improvements could be gained by combining the input features in more complex ways rather than by simply combining the outputs of independent algorithms. 3 Methodology 3.1","Boundary Classification We represent each narrative in our corpus as a sequence of potential boundary sites, which occur between prosodic phrases.

The boxes in the figure show the subjects' responses at each potential boundary site, and the resulting boundary classification. Only 2 of the 7 possible boundary sites are classified as boundary. 3.2","Coding of Linguistic Features Given a narrative of n prosodic phrases, the n-1 potential boundary sites are between each pair of prosodic phrases Pi and P/+I, i from 1 to n-1. Each potential boundary site in our corpus is coded using the set of linguistic features shown in Fig. 2.","Values for the prosodic features are obtained by automatic analysis of the transcripts, whose conventions are defined in (Chafe, 1980) and illustrated in Fig. h .... and \"?\" indicate sentence-final intonational contours; \",\" indicates phrase-final but not sentence final intonation; \"[X]\" indicates a pause lasting X seconds; \"..\" indicates a break in timing too short to be measured. The features before and after depend on the final punctua-tion of the phrases Pi and Pi+I, respectively. The value is '+sentence.final.contour' if \".\" or \"?\", '- sentence.final.contour' if \",\". Pause is assigned 'true' if Pi+l begins with [X], 'false' otherwise. Duration is assigned X if pause is 'true', 0 otherwise.","The cue phrase features are also obtained by automatic analysis of the transcripts. Cue1 is assigned 'true' if the first lexical item in PI+I is a member of the set of cue words summarized in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993).

The two authors coded independently and merged their results. The third feature, global.pro, is computed from the hand coding. FICs are tensed clauses that are neither verb arguments nor restrictive relatives.

For example, phrases beginning discourse segments were correlated with preceding pause duration in (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; ttirschberg and Grosz, 1992). These and other studies (e.g.~ (iiirschberg and Litman, 1993)) also found it useful to distinguish between sentence and non-sentence final intonational contours. Initial phrase position was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993); a potential correlation between discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency patterns between cue words was also suggested. Finally, (Litman, 1994) found that treating cue phrases individually rather than as a class enhanced the results of (iiirschberg and Litman, 1993).","Passonneau (to appear) examined some of the few claims relating discourse anaphoric noun phrases to global discourse structure in the Pear corpus. Resuits included an absence of correlation of segmental structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kameyama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast between full noun phrases and pronouns. As noted in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features largely reflect Passonneau's hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance. 3.3 Evaluation The segmentation algorithms presented in the next two sections were developed by examining only a training set of narratives. The algorithms are then evaluated by examining their performance in predicting segmentation on a separate test set. We currently use 10 narratives for training and 5 narratives for testing. (The remaining 5 narratives are reserved for future research.) The 10 training narratives Traininl~ Set .63 .72 .06 .12 Test Set .64 .68 .07 .11 Table 1: Average human performance. range in length from 51 to 162 phrases (Avg.=101.4), or from 38 to 121 clauses (Avg.=76.8). The 5 test narratives range in length from 47 to 113 phrases (Avg.=S7.4), or from 37 to 101 clauses (Avg.=69.0). The ratios of test to training data measured in narratives, prosodic phrases and clauses, respectively, are 50.0%, 43.1% and 44.9%. For the machine learning algorithm we also estimate performance using cross-validation (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991), as detailed in Section 5.","To quantify algorithm performance, we use the information retrieval metrics shown in Fig. 4. Recall is the ratio of correctly hypothesized boundaries to target boundaries. Precision is the ratio of hypothesized boundaries that are correct to the total hypothesized boundaries. (Cf. Fig. 4 for fallout and error.) Ideal behavior would be to identify all and only the target boundaries: the values for b and c in Fig. 4 would thus both equal O, representing no errors. The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout, and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values are 0, 0, 1, and 1. To get an intuitive summary of overall performance, we also sum the deviation of the observed value from the ideal value for each metric: (1-recall) + (1-precision) + fallout + error. The summed deviation for perfect performance is thus 0.","Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target goal for the performance of our algorithms (Gale et al., 1992). Table 1 shows the average human performance for both the training and test sets of narratives. Note that human performance is basically the same for both sets of narratives. However, two Subjects Algorithm Boundary INon-Doundary Boundary a b Non-Boundary c d Recall = Precision = Fallout ---- b Error ---- ~ Figure 4: Information retrieval metrics. 111 factors prevent this performance from being closer to ideal (e.g., recall and precision of 1). The first is the wide variation in the number of boundaries that subjects used, as discussed above. The second is the inherently fuzzy nature of boundary location. We discuss this second issue at length in (Passonnean and Litman, to appear), and present relaxed IR metrics that penalize near misses less heavily in (Litman and Passonneau, 1995). 4 Hand Tuning To improve performance, we analyzed the two types of IR errors made by the original NP algorithm (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) on the training data. Type \"b\" errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of non-boundaries, were reduced by changing the coding features pertaining to clauses and NPs. Most \"b\" errors correlated with two conditions used in the NP algorithm, identification of clauses and of inferential links. The revision led to fewer clauses (more assignments of 'NA' for the three NP features) and more inference relations. One example of a change to clause coding is that formulaic utterances having the structure of clauses, but which function like in-terjections, are no longer recognized as independent clauses. These include the phrases let's see, let me see, I don't know, you know when they occur with no verb phrase argument. Other changes pertained to sentence fragments, unexpected clausal arguments, and embedded speech.","Three types of inference relations linking successive clauses (Ci-1, Ci) were added (originally there were 5 types (Passonneau, 1994)). Now, a pronoun (e.g., it, that, this) in Ci referring to an action, event or fact inferrable from Ci-1 links the two clauses. So does an implicit argument, as in Fig. 5, where the missing argument of notice is inferred to be the event of the pears falling. The third case is where an NP in Ci is described as part of an event that results directly from an event mentioned in Ci-1.","\"C\" type errors (cf. Fig. 4), mis-classification of boundaries, often occurred where prosodic and cue features conflicted with NP features. The original NP algorithm assigned boundaries wherever the three values '-coref', '-infer', '-global.pro' (defined in section 3) co-occurred, represented as the first conditional statement of Fig. 6. Experiments led to the hypothesis that the most improvement came by as-signing a boundary if the cue-prosody feature had the value 'complex', even if the algorithm would not otherwise assign a boundary, as shown in Fig. 6.

Table 2 presents the average IR scores across the narratives in the training set for both conditions. Reduction of \"b\" type errors raises precision, and lowers fallout and error rate. Reduction of \"c\" type errors raises recall, and lowers fallout and error rate. All scores improve in Condition 2, with precision and fallout showing the greatest relative improvement. The major difference from human performance is relatively poorer precision.","The standard deviations in Table 2 are often close to 1/4 or 1/3 of the reported averages. This indicates a large amount of variability in the data, reflecting wide differences across narratives (speakers) in the training set with respect to the distinctions recognized by the algorithm. Although the high standard deviations show that the tuned algorithm is not well fitted to each narrative, it is likely that it is overspecialized to the training sample in the sense that test narratives are likely to exhibit further variation.","Table 3 shows the results of the hand tuned algorithm on the 5 randomly selected test narratives on both Conditions 1 and 2. Condition 1 results, the untuned algorithm with the initial feature set, are very similar to the training set except for worse precision. Thus, despite the high standard deviations, 10 narratives seems to have been a sufficient sample size for evaluating the initial NP algorithm. Condition 2 results are better than condition 1 in Table 3, and condition 1 in Table 2. This is strong evidence that the tuned algorithm is a better predictor of segment boundaries than the original NP algorithm. Nevertheless, the test results of condition 2 are much worse than the corresponding training results, particularly for precision (.44 versus .62).

Note that quantitatively, the machine learning results are slightly better than the hand tuning results. The main difference on average performance is the higher precision of the automated algorithm. Furthermore, note that the machine learning algorithm used the changes to the coding features that resulted from the tuning methods. This suggests that hand tuning is a useful method for understanding how to best code the data, while mschine learning provides an effective (and automatic) way to produce an algorithm given a good feature representation.","Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that linguistic devices correlate with discourse structure (cf. section 2.1), which itself has practical import. Understanding systems could infer segments as a step towards producing summaries, while generation systems could signal segments to increase comprehensibility/Our results also suggest that to best identify or convey segment boundaries, systems will need to exploit"]},{"title":"multiple","paragraphs":["signals simultaneously.","We plan to continue our experiments by further merging the automated and analytic techniques, and evaluating new algorithms on our final test corpus. Because we have already used cross-validation, we do not anticipate significant degradation on new test narratives. An important area for future research is to develop principled methods for identifying distinct speaker strategies pertaining to how they signal segments. Performance of individual speakers varies widely as shown by the high standard deviations in our tables. The original NP, hand tuned, and machine learning algorithms all do relatively poorly on narrative 16 and relatively well on 11 (both in the test set) under all conditions. This lends support to the hypothesis that there may be consistent differences among speakers regarding strategies for signaling shifts in global discourse structure.
