DTG involve two composition operations called subsertion and sister-adjunction. The most distinctive feature of DTG is that, unlike TAG, there is complete uniformity in the way that the two DTG operations relate lexical items: subsertion always corresponds to complementation and sister-adjunction to modification. Furthermore, DTG, unlike TAG, can provide a uniform analysis for wh-movement in English and Kashmiri, despite the fact that the wh element in Kashmiri appears in sentence-second position, and not sentence-initial position as in English."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG), which arises from work on Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975). A salient feature of TAG is the extended domain of locality it provides. Each elementary structure can be associated with a lexical item (as in Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) (Joshi ~ Schabes, 1991)). Properties related to the lexical item (such as subcategoriza-tion, agreement, certain types of word order varia-tion) can be expressed within the elementary structure (Kroch, 1987; Frank, 1992). In addition, TAG remain tractable, yet their generative capacity is sufficient to account for certain syntactic phenomena that, it has been argued, lie beyond Context-Free Grammars (CFG) (Shieber, 1985). TAG, however, has two limitations which provide the motivation for this work. The first problem (discussed in Section 1.1) is that the TAG operations of substitution and adjunction do not map cleanly onto the relations of complementation and modification. A second problem (discussed in Section 1.2) has to do with the inability of TAG to provide analyses for certain syntactic phenomena. In developing DTG we have tried to overcome these problems while remaining faithful to what we see as the key advantages of TAG (in particular, its enlarged domain of locality). In Section 1.3 we introduce some of the key features of DTG and explain how they are intended to address the problems that we have identified with TAG. 1,1 Derivations and Dependencies In LTAG, the operations of substitution and adjunction relate two lexical items. It is therefore natural to interpret these operations as establishing a direct linguistic relation between the two lexical items, namely a relation of complementation (predicate-argument relation) or of modification. In purely CFG-based approaches, these relations are only implicit. However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes ~ Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate adjunction constraints in TAG. In many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made explicit: LFG (Bresnan & Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g. Mel'~uk (1988)) use these no-tions as the principal basis for syntactic representation. We will follow the dependency literature in referring to complementation and modification as syntactic dependency. As observed by Rambow and Joshi (1992), for TAG, the importance of the dependency structure means that not only the derived phrase-structure tree is of interest, but also the operations by which we obtained it from elementary structures. This information is encoded in the derivation tree (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).","However, as Vijay-Shanker (1992) observes, the TAG composition operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation. Clausal complementation could not be handled uniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic phenomena such as long-distance wh-movement in English. Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in 151 the directionality of the operations used for complementation in TAG@: nominal complements are substituted into their governing verb's tree, while the governing verb's tree is adjoined into its own clausal complement. The fact that adjunction and substitution are used in a linguistically heterogeneous manner means that (standard) \"lAG derivation trees do not provide a good representation of the dependencies between the words of the sentence, i.e., of the predicate-argument and modification structure."]},{"title":"adore S~ adore Mary / OBJ\\ seem hotdog claim SU~ [MOD I sUBJ Mary / OBJ \\ seem spicy","paragraphs":["he hotdog claim"]},{"title":"I MOD MOD~MOD I SUBJ small spicy","paragraphs":["small"]},{"title":"he","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Derivation trees for (1): original definition (left); Schabes & Shieber definition (right)","For instance, English sentence (1) gets the derivation structure shown on the left in Figure 11 .

In the derivation structure, seem is a daughter of adore (the direction does not express the actual dependency), and claim is also a daughter of adore (though neither is an argument of the other)."]},{"title":"claim SUB J~\"~OMP he seem I COMP adore SUB~BJ Mary hotdog MOD ~.~OD spicy small","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Dependency tree for (1) Schabes & Shieber (1994) solve the first problem","1For clarity, we depart from standard TAG notational practice and annotate nodes with lexemes and arcs with grammatical function: by distinguishing between the adjunction of modifiers and of clausal complements. This gives us the derivation structure shown on the right in Figure 1. While this might provide a satisfactory treatment of modification at the derivation level, there are now three types of operations (two adjunctions and substitution) for two types of dependencies (arguments and modifiers), and the directionality problem for embedded clauses remains unsolved.","In defining DTG we have attempted to resolve these problems with the use of a single operation (that we call subsertion) for handling Ml complementation and a second operation (called sister-adjunction) for modification. Before discussion these operations further we consider a second problem with TAG that has implications for the design of these new composition operations (in particular, subsertion). 1.2 Problematic Constructions for TAG TAG cannot be used to provide suitable analyses for certain syntactic phenomena, including long-distance scrambling in German (Becket et hi., 1991), Romance Clitics (Bleam, 1994), wh-extraction out of complex picture-NPs (Kroch, 1987), and Kashmiri wh-extraction (presented here). The problem in describing these phenomena with TAG arises from the fact (observed by Vijay-Shanker (1992)) that adjoining is an overly restricted way of combining structures. We illustrate the problem by considering Kashmiri wh-extraction, drawing on Bhatt (1994). Whextraction in Kashmiri proceeds as in English, except that the wh-word ends up in sentence-second position, with a topic from the matrix clause in sentence-initial position. This is illustrated in (2a) for a simple clause and in (2b) for a complex clause.

In Multi-Component TAG (MCTAG) (Joshi, 1987), trees are grouped into sets which must be adjoined to-gether (multicomponent adjunction). However, MCTAG lack expressive power since, while syntactic relations are invariably subject to c-command or dominance constraints, there is no way to state that"]},{"title":"152","paragraphs":["two trees from a set must be in a dominance relation in the derived tree. MCTAG with Domination Links (MCTAG-DL) (Becker et al., 1991) are multi-component systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints. However, MCTAG-DL share a further problem with MCTAG: the derivation structures cannot be given a linguistically meaningful in-terpretation. Thus, they fail to address the first problem we discussed (in Section 1.1). 1.3 The DTG Approach Vijay-Shanker (1992) points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node s of the adjoined tree. However, adjunction (rather than substitution) is used since, in general, the structure that is substituted may only form part of the clausal complement: the remaining substructure of the clausal complement appears above the root of the adjoined tree. Unfortunately, as seen in the examples given in Section 1.2, there are cases where satisfactory analyses cannot be obtained with adjunction. In particular, using adjunction in this way cannot handle cases in which parts of the clausal complement are required to be placed within the structure of the adjoined tree.","The DTG operation of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation. Subsertion can be viewed as a generalization of adjunction in which components of the clausal complement (the subserted structure) which are not substituted can be interspersed within the structure that is the site of the subsertion. Following earlier work (Becket et al., 1991; Vijay-Shanker, 1992), DTG provide a mechanism involving the use of domination links (d-edges) that ensure that parts of the subserted structure that are not substituted dominate those parts that are. Furthermore, there is a need to constrain the way in which the non-substituted components can be interspersed 3. This is done by either using appropriate feature constraints at nodes or by means of subsertion-insertion constraints (see Section 2).","We end this section by briefly commenting on the other DTG operation of sister-adjunction. In TAG, modification is performed with adjunction of modifier trees that have a highly constrained form. In particular, the foot nodes of these trees are always daughters of the root and either the leftmost or rightmost frontier nodes. The effect of adjoining a","2In these cases the foot node is an argument node of the lexical anchor.","SThis was also observed by Rambow (1994a), where an integrity constraint (first defined for an tD/LP version of TAG (Becket et aJ., 1991)) is defined for a MCTAG-DL version called V-TAG. However, this was found to be in-sufficient for treating both long-distance scrambling and long-distance topicalization in German. V-TAG retains adjoining (to handle topicalization) for this reason. tree of this form corresponds (almost) exactly to the addition of a new (leftmost or rightmost) subtree below the node that was the site of the adjunction. For this reason, we have equipped DTG with an operation (sister-adjunction) that does exactly this and nothing more. From the definition of DTG in Section 2 it can be seen that the essential aspects of Schabes & Shieber (1994) treatment for modification, including multiple modifications of a phrase, can be captured by using this operation 4.","After defining DTG in Section 2, we discuss, in Section 3, DTG analyses for the English and Kashmiri data presented in this section. Section 4 briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms. 2 Definition of D-Tree Grammars A d-tree is a tree with two types of edges: domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges). D-edges and i-edges express domination and immediate domination relations between nodes. These relations are never rescinded when d-trees are composed. Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relationship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation. D-edges and i-edges are not distributed arbitrarily in d-trees. For each internal node, either all of its daughters are linked by i-edges or it has a single daughter that is linked to it by a d-edge. Each node is labelled with a terminal symbol, a nonterminal symbol or the empty string. A d-tree containing n d-edges can be decomposed into n + 1 components containing only i-edges.","D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction. When a d-tree a is subserted into another d-tree/3, a component of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a substitution node) of/3 and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node. For example, consider the d-trees a and /3 shown in Figure 3. Note that components are shown as triangles. In the composed d-tree 7 the component a(5) is substituted at a substitution node in /3. The components, a(1), a(2), and a(4) of a above a(5) drift up the path in/3 which runs from the substitution node. These components are then inserted into d-edges in/3 or above the root of/3. In general, when a component c~(i) of some d-tree a is inserted into a d-edge between nodes ~/1 and r/2 two new d-edges are created, the first of which relates r/t and the root node of a(i), and the second of which relates the frontier","4Santorini and Mahootian (1995) provide additional evidence against the standard TAG approach to modification from code switching data, which can be accounted for by using sister-adjunction."]},{"title":"153","paragraphs":["a =~ insertion [ t"]},{"title":"~ insertion","paragraphs":["[ i i !"]},{"title":"~ substitution","paragraphs":["p i ! t !

It is possible for components above the substituted node to drift arbitrarily far up the d-tree and distribute themselves within domination edges, or above the root, in any way that is compatible with the domination relationships present in the substituted d-tree. DTG provide a mechanism called subsertion-insertlon constraints to control what can appear within d-edges (see below).","The second composition operation involving d-trees is called sister-adjunction. When a d-tree a is sister-adjoined at a node y in a d-tree fl the composed d-tree 7 results from the addition to /~ of a as a new leftmost or rightmost sub-d-tree below 7/. Note that sister-adjunction involves the addition of exactly one new immediate domination edge and that severM sister-adjunctions can occur at the same node.
