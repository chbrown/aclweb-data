Until recently, however, it was difficult to determine the relationship between hand-written phonological rules and actual speech data. The current availability of large speech corpora and pronunciation dictionaries has allowed us to connect rules and speech in much tighter ways. For example, a number of algorithms have recently been proposed which automatically induce phonological rules from dictionaries or corpora (Gasser 1993; Ellison 1992; Daelemans c~ al. 1994).","While such algorithms have successfully induced syllabicity or harmony constraints, or simple oblig-","*Currently at Voice Processing Corp, 1 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142: tajchman@vpro.eom atory phonological rules, there has been much less work on non-obligatory (optional) rules. In part this is because optional rules like flapping, vowel reduction, and various coarticulation effects are postlexi-cal and often products of fast speech, and hence have been considered less central to phonological theory. In part, however, this is because optional rules are inherently probabilistic. Where obligatory rules apply to every underlying form which meets the en-vironmental conditions, producing a single surface form, optional rules may not apply, and hence the underlying form may appear as the surface form, unmodified by the rule. This makes the induction problem non-deterministic, and not solvable by the above algorithms. 1","While optional rules have received less attention in linguistics because of their probabilistic nature, in speech recognition, by contrast, optional rules are commonly used to model pronunciation variation. In this paper, we employ techniques from speech recognition research to address the problem of assign-ing probabilities to these optional phonological rules. We introduce a completely automatic algorithm that explores the coverage of a set of phonological rules on a corpus of lexically transcribed speech using the computational resources of a speech recognition system. This algorithm belongs to the class of techniques we call Exploratory Computational Phonology, which use statistical pattern recognition tools to explore phonological spaces.","We describe the details of our probability estimation algorithm and also present the probabilities the system has learned for ten common phonological rules which model reductions and coarticulation effects. Our probabilities are derived from a corpus of 7203 sentences of read speech from the Wall Street Journal (NIST 1993). We also benchmark the probabilities generated by our system against probabilities from phonetically hand-transcribed data, and show a relatively good fit. Finally, we analyze the probability differences between rule use in male ver-","1Note that this is true whether phonological theory considers these true phonological rules or rather rules of ~phonetic interpretation\". sus female speech, and suggest that the differences are caused by differing average rates of speech. 2 The Algorithm In this section we describe our algorithm which as-signs probabilities to hand-written, optional phonological rules like flapping. The algorithm takes a lexicon of underlying forms and applies phonological rules to produce a new lexicon of surface forms. Then we use a speech recognition system on a large corpus of recorded speech to check how many times each of these surface forms occurred in the corpus. Finally, by knowing which rules were used to generate each surface form, we can compute a count for each rule. By combining this with a count of the times a rule did not apply, the algorithm can compute a probability for each rule.","The rest of this section will discuss each of the aspects of the algorithm in detail. 2.1","The Base Lexicon Our base lexicon is quite large; it is used to generate the lexicons for all of our speech recognition work at ICSI. It contains 160,000 entries (words) with 300,000 pronunciations. The lexicon contains underlying forms which are very shallow; thus they are post-lexical in the sense that there is no represented relationship between e.g. 'critic' and 'criticism' (where critic is pronounced kritik and criticism kritisizrn). However, the entries do not represent flaps, vowel reductions, and other coarticulatory effects.","In order to collect our 300,000 pronunciations, we combined seven different on-line pronunciation dictionaries, including the five shown in Table 12 .

Table 3 gives the 10 phonological rules used in these experiments.","One goal of our rule-application procedure was to build a tagged lexicon to avoid having to implement a phonological-rule parser to p~rse the surface pronunciations. In a tagged lexicon, each surface pronunciation is annotated with the names of the phonological rules that applied to produce it. Thus when the speech recognizer finds a particular pronunciation in the speech input, the list of rules which applied to produce it can simply be looked up in the tagged lexicon.","The algorithm applies rules to pronunciations recursively; when a context matches the left hand side of a phonological rule \"RULE,\" two pronunciations are produced: one unchanged by the rule (marked -RULE), and one with the rule applied (marked +RULE). The procedure places the +RULE pronunciation on the queue for later recursive rule application, and continues trying to apply phonological rules to the -RULE pronunciation. See Figure 1 for details of the algorithm. While our procedure is not guaranteed to terminate, in practice the phonological rules we apply have a finite recursive depth.","The nondeterministic mapping produces a tagged equiprobable multiple pronunciation lexicon of 510,000 pronunciations for 160,000 words.

The idea of using optional phonological rules to construct a speech-recognition lexicon derives from Cohen (1989), who applied optional phonological rules to a baseform dictionary to produce a surface lexicon and then used TIMIT to assign probabilities for each pronunciation. The use of a forced-Viterbi speech decoder to discover pronunciations from a corpus was proposed by Wooters (1993). Weseniek & Sehiel (1994) independently propose a very similar forced-Viterbi-decoder-based technique which they use for measur-ing the accuracy of hand-written phonology. 6 Name Code","Reductions Mid vowels RV1 High vowels RV2 R-vowel RV3 Syllabic n SL1 Syllabic m SL2 Syllabic 1 SL3 Syllabic r SL4","Flapping FL1","Flapping-r FL2","H-voicing VH 1 Rule -stress [aa ae ah ao eh er ey ow uh]--~ ax -stress [iy ih uw] ---* ix -stress er ---* axr [ax ix] n -+ en [ax ix] in ---. em [ax ix] 1 ~ el [ax ix] r ~ axr [tcl dcll It d]---* dx/V __ [ax ix axr] i [tcl dcl] It"]},{"title":"d]-~","paragraphs":["dx/Vr ~ lax ix axr] , • hh --* hv / [+voice] __ [+voice] Table 6: Results of the Rule-Probability-Estimation Algorithm Pr .60 .57 .74 .35 .35 .72 .77 .87 .92 .92 Percent of Phonological Rule Use Percent 90.00 m .... 80.00"]},{"title":",i","paragraphs":["70.00 .... 1 60.00 m 50.00 40.00 20.00 I0.00 0.00 1 1 2 3 1 Rule m female llllll Figure 8: Male vs Female Probabilities for Phonological Rules","Chen (1990) and Riley (1991) model the relationship between phonemes and their Mlophonic realizations by training decision trees on TIMIT data. A decision tree is learned for each underlying phoneme specifying its .surface realization in different contexts. These completely automatic techniques, requiring no hand-written rules, can allow a more fine-grained analysis than our rule-based algorithm. However, as a consequence, it is more difficult to extract generalizations across classes of phonemes to which rules can apply. We think that a hybrid between a rule-based and a decision-tree approach could prove quite powerful. 5 Conclusion and Future Work Although the paradigm of exploratory computational phonology is only in its infancy, we believe our rule-probability estimation algorithm to be a new and useful instance of the use of probabilistic techniques and spoken-language corpora in computational linguistics. In Tajchman et al. (1995) we report on the results of our algorithm on speech recognition performance. We plan in future work to address a number of shortcomings of these experiments, for example including some spontaneous speech corpora, and looking at a wider variety of rules.","In addition, we have extended our algorithm to induce new pronunciations which generalize over pronunciations seen in the corpus (Wooters & Stolcke 1994). We now plan to augment our probability estimation to use the pronunciations from this new HMM-induction-based generalization step. This will require extending our tag-based probability estimation step to parse the phone strings from the forced-Viterbi.","In other current work we have also been using this algorithm to model the phonological component of the accent of non-native speakers. Finally, we hope in future work to be able to combine our rule-based approach with more bottom-up methods like the decision-tree or phonological parsing algorithms to induce rules as well as merely training their probabilities• Acknowledgments","Thanks to Mike Hochberg, Nelson Morgan, Steve Renals, Tony Robinson, Florian Schiel, Andreas Stolcke, and Chuck Woofers.
