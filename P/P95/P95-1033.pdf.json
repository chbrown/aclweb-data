We introduce inversion-invariant transduction grammars which serve as generative models for parallel bilingual sentences with weak order constraints. Focusing on Wansduction grammars for bracketing, we formulate a normal form, and a stochastic version amenable to a maximum-likelihood bracketing algorithm. Several extensions and experiments are discussed. 1 Introduction Parallel corpora have been shown to provide an extremely rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al. 1990; Gale & Church 1991; Gale et al. 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan et al. 1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994). Our thesis in this paper is that the lexical information actually gives sufficient information to extract not merely word alignments, but also bracketing constraints for both parallel texts. Aside from purely linguistic interest, bracket structure has been empirically shown to be highly effective at constraining subsequent training of, for example, stochastic context-free grammars (Pereira & ~ 1992; Black et al. 1993). Previous algorithms for automatic bracketing operate on monolingual texts and hence require more grammatical constraints; for example, tactics employing mutual information have been applied to tagged text (Magerumn & Marcus 1990).","Algorithms for word alignment attempt to find the matching words between parallel sentences. 1 Although word alignments are of little use by themselves, they provide potential anchor points for other applications, or for subsequent learning stages to acquire more interesting structures. Our technique views word alignment","1 Wordmatching is a more accurate term than word alignment since the matchings may cross, but we follow the literature. and bracket annotation for both parallel texts as an integrated problem. Although the examples and experiments herein are on Chinese and English, we believe the model is equally applicable to other language pairs, especially those within the same family (say Indo-European).","Our bracketing method is based on a new formalism called an inversion.invariant transduction grammar. By their nature inversion-invariant transduction grammars overgenerate, because they permit too much constituent-ordering freedom. Nonetheless, they turn out to be very useful for recognition when the true grammar is not fully known. Their purpose is not to flag ungrammatical in-pots; instead they assume that the inputs are grammatical, the aim being to extract structure from the input data, in kindred spirit with robust parsing."]},{"title":"2 Inversion-Invariant Transduction Grammars","paragraphs":["A Wansduction grammar is a bilingual model that generates two output streams, one for each language. The usual view of transducers as having one input stream and one output stream is more appropriate for restricted or deterministic finite-state machines. Although finite-state transducers have been well studied, they are insufficiently powerful for bilingual models. The models we consider here are non-deterministic models where the two languages' role is symmetric.","We begin by generalizing transduction to context-free form. In a context-free transduction grammar, terminal symbols come in pairs that~ are emitted to separate output streams. It follows that each rewrite rule emits not one but two streams, and that every non-terminal stands for a class of derivable substring pairs. For example, in the rewrite rule","A ~ B x/y C z/e the terminal symbols z and z are symbols of the language Lx and are emitted on stream 1, while the terminal symbol y is a symbol of the language L2 and is emitted on stream 2.

A simpler, related idea of penalizing distortion from some ideal matching pattern can be found in the statistical translation (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al. 1993) and word alignment (Dagan et al. 1993; Dagan & Church 1994) models. Unlike these models, however, the BTG aims m model constituent structure when determining distortion penalties. In particular, crossings that are consistent with the constituent tree structure are not penalized. The implicit assumption is that core arguments of frames remain similar across languages, and tha! core arguments of the same frame will surface adjacently. The accuracy of the method on a particular language pair will therefore depend upon the extent to which this language universals hypothesis holds. However, the approach is robust because if the assumption is violated, damage will be limited to dropping the fewest possible crossed word matchings.","We now describe how a dynzmic-programming parser can compute an optimal bxackcting given a sentence-pair and a stochastic BTG. In bilingual parsing, just as with or-dinary monolingual parsing, probabilizing the grammar 247 permits ambiguities to be resolved by choosing the maximum likelihood parse.

Details are given in Wu (1995).","2We are gene~!izing argmax as to allow arg to specify the index of interest. 4.1 Simultaneous segmentation We often find the same concept realized using different numbers of words in the two languages, creating potential difficulties for word alignment; what is a single word in English may be realized as a compound in Chinese. Since Chinese text is not orthographically separated into words, the standard methodology is to first preproce~ input texts through a segmentation module (Chiang et al. 1992; Linet al. 1992; Chang & Chert 1993; Linet al. 1993; Wu & Tseng 1993; Sproat et al. 1994). However, this serionsly degrades our algorithm's performance, since the the segmenter may encounter ambiguities that are unresolvable monolingually and thereby introduce errors. Even if the Chinese segmentation is acceptable moaolingually, it may not agree with the division of words present in the English sentence. Moreover, conventional compounds are frequently and unlmxlictably missing from translation lexicons, and this can furllu~ degrade perfor-Inane.","To avoid such problems we have extended the algorithm to optimize the segmentation of the Chinese sentence in parallel with the ~ting lm~:ess. Note that this treatment of segmentation does not attempt to address the open linguistic question of what constitutes a Chinese \"word\". Our definition of a correct \"segmentation\" is purely task-driven: longer segments are desirable if and only ff no compositional translation is possible. 4.2 Pre/post-positional biases Many of the bracketing errors are caused by singletons. With singletons, there is no cross-lingual discrimination to increase the certainty between alternative brackeaings. A heuristic to deal with this is to specify for each of the two languages whether prepositions or postpositions more common, where \"preposition\" here is meant not in the usual part-of-speech sense, but rather in a broad sense of the tendency of function words to attach left or right. This simple swategcm is effective because the majority of unmatched singletons are function words that","counterparts in the other language. This observation holds assuming that the translation lexicon's coverage is reasonably good. For both English and Chinese, we specify a prepositional bias, which means that singletons are attached to the right whenever possible. 4.3 Punctuation constraints Certain punctuation characters give strong constituency indications with high reliability. \"Perfect separators\", which include colons and Chinese full stops, and \"petfeet delimiters\", which include parentheses and quota-tion marks, can be used as bracketing constraints. We have extended the algorithm to precluded hypotheses that are inconsistent with such constraints, by initializ-ing those entries in the DP table corresponding to illegal sub-hypotheses with zero probabilities, These entries are blocked from recomputation during the DP phase. As their probabilities always remain zero, the illegal bracketings can never participate in any optimal bracketing. 248 5 Postprocessing 5.1 A Singleton-Rebalancing Algorithm We now introduce an algorithm for further improving the bracketing accuracy in cases of singletons.

The problem is that singletons have no discriminative power between alternative bracket matchings--they only contribute to the ambiguity. However, we can minimize the impact by moving singletons as deep as possible, closer to the individual word they precede or succeed, by widening the scope of the brackets immediately following the singleton. In general this improves precision since wide-scope brackets are less constraining.","The algorithm employs a rebalancing strategy remniscent of balanced-tree structures using left and right rotations. A left rotation changes a (A(BC)) structure to a ((AB)C) structure, and vice versa for a right rotation.

To be legal, a rotation must preserve symbol order on both output streams.

Additional examples are shown in Figure 5.","Under the linguistic criterion, the monolingual bracket precision was 80.4% for the English sentences, and 78.4% for the Chinese sentences. Of course, monolinguai grammar-based bracketing methods can achieve higher precision, but such tools assume grammar resources that may not be available, such as good Chinese granuna~. Moreover, if a good monolingual bracketer is available, its output can easily be incorporated in much the same way as punctn~ion constraints, thereby combining the best of both worlds. Under the functional criterion, the parallel bracket precision was 72.5%, lower than the monolingual precision since brackets can be correct in one language but not the other. Grammar-based bracketing methods cannot directly produce results of a comparable nature."]},{"title":"250","paragraphs":["7 Conclusion We have proposed a new tool for the corpus linguist's arsenal: a method for simultaneously bracketing both halves of a parallel bilingual corpus, using only a word translation lexicon. The method can also be seen as a word alignment algorithm that employs a realistic distortion model and aligns consituents as well as words. The basis of the approach is a new inversion-invariant transduction grammar formalism.","Various extension strategies for simultaneous segmentation, positional biases, punctuation constraints, singleton rebalancing, and bracket flattening have been introduced. Parallel bracketing exploits a relatively untapped source of constraints, in that parallel bilingual sentences are used to mutually analyze each other. The model nonetheless retains a high degree of compatibility with more conventional monolingual formalisms and methods.","The bracketing and alignment of parallel corpora can be fully automatized with zero initial knowledge resources, with the aid of automatic procedures for learning word translation lexicons. This is particularly valuable for work on languages for which online knowledge resources are relatively scarce compared with English.
