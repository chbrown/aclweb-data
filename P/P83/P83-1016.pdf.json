Several competing principles, which are based on syntactic and on discourse information, determine the [ineac order of noun phrases. A solution to problems of this sort is a prerequisite for high-quality language generation. The linguistic framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar offers tools for dealing with-word order variation. Some slight modifications to the framework allow for an analysis of the German data that incorporates just the right, degree of interaction between syntactic and pragmatic components and that can account for conflicting ordering statements. I. Introduction","The relatively free order of major phrasal constituents in German belongs to the class of natural-language phenomena that require a closer interaction of syntax and pragmatics than is usually accounted for in formal linguistic frameworks. Computational linguists who pay attention to both syntax and pragmatics will find that analyses of such phenomena can provide valuable data for the design of systems that integrate these linguist ic components.","German represents a good test case because the role of pragmatics in governing word order is much greater than in English while the role syntax plays is greater than in some of the so-called free-word-order languages like Warlpiri. The German data are well attested and thoroughly discussed in the descriptive literature The fact that English and German are closely related makes it easier to assess these data and to draw parallels.","The .~imple analysis presented here for dealing with free word order in German syntax is based on the linguistic framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG}, especially on its Immediate Dominance/Linear Precedence formalism {ID/LP), and complements an earlier treatment of German word order) The framework is slightly modified to accommodate the relevant class of word order regularities.","The syntactic framework presented in this paper is not hound to any particular theory of discourse processing; it enables syntax to interact with whatever formal model of pragmatics one might want to implement. A brief discussion of the framework's implication~ for computational implementation centers Upon the problem of the status of metagrammatical devices. 2. The Problem","German word order is essentially fixed: however, there is some freedom in the ordering of major phrasal categories like NPs and adverbial phrases - for example, in the linear order of subject (SUB J), direct object (DOBJ), and indirect object (lOB J) with respect to one another. All six permutations of these three constituents are possible for sentences like (In). Two are given as {Ib) and (It).","(la) Dann hatte der Doktor dem Mann die Pille gegeben. Then had the doctor the man the pill given","(lb) Dann hatte dec Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben. Then had the doctor the pill the man given","(It) Dann hatte die Pille der Doktor dem Mann gegeben. Then had the pill the doctor the man given All permutations have the same truth conditional meaning, which can be paraphrased in English as: Then the doctor gave the man the pill.","There are several basic principles that influence the ordering of the three major NPs: • The unmarked order is SUBJ-iOBJ-DOBJ • Comment (or focus) follows non-comments * Personal pronouns precede other NPs • Light constituents precede heavy constituents, *This rese.'trch was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant [ST-RI03$50, The views and conclusions expressed in this paper are those ,,r the :tutbor and should not be interpreted as representative of the views of the Nati.,nal Science Foundation or the United States government.

The most complete description of the ordering principles, especially of the conflict between the unmarked order and the topic-commeni, relation, can be found in Lenerz (1977). 3. Implications for Processing Models","Syntactic as well as pragmatic information is needed to determine the right word order; the unmarked-order principle is obviously a syntactic statement, whereas the topiccomment order principle requires access to discourse information. °, Sometimes different ordering principles make contradictory predictions.

Consider the following two English sentences: (2a) I will talk to him after lunch about the offer. (2b) I will talk to him about the offer after lunch. Most semantic frameworks would assign the same truth-conditional meaning to (2a) and (2b), but there are discourse situations in which one is more appropriate than the other. (2a) can answer a que~-tion about the topic of a planned afternoon meeting, but is much less likely to occur after an order to men-tion the offer as soon as possible. 4","Formal linguistic theories have traditionally assumed the existence of rather independent components for syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, s Linguistics not only could afford this idealization but has probably temporarily benefited from it. However, if the idealization is carried over to the computational implementation of a framework, it can have adverse effects on the efficiency of the resulting system. 2The heaviness principle requires access to phonological information in addition, but, :~ discussion of this dependence is beyond the scope of this paper. 3Sentences that differ only in their discourse role assignments, e.g.. do not focus on the same constituent(s}, usually exhibit different sentential stress patterns. 4The claim is not that these sentences are not interchangeable in the menti, .n~.d di.<o-,urse situations under any circumstances. In English. marked in-ton arian can usually overwrite default discourse role assignments associated w~.. the order of the constituents. $Scvera[ more recent theories can account for the interaction among some of the components. Montague Grammar (Montague. 1974) and its successors (incl. GPSG) link semantic and syntactic rules. Work on presuppositions (Karttunen and Peters. 1979), discourse representations (Kamp, If80) and Situati~,n Semantics (Barwise and Perry. 1981) narrows the gap between .,,.'mantics and pragmatics.","If we as.~ume that a language generation system should be able to generate"]},{"title":"all","paragraphs":["grammatical word orders and if we further assume that, every generated order should be appropriate to the given discourse situation, then a truly nonintegrated system, i.e., a system whose semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic components apply in sequence, has to be inel~cient. The syntax will first generate all possibilities, after which the pragmatic component will have to select the appropriate variant. To do so, this component will also need access to syntactic information.","In an integrated model, much unnecessary work can be saved if the syntax refrains from using rules that introduce pragmatically inappropriate orders. A truly integrated model can discard improper parses very early during parsing, thereby considerably reducing the amount of syntactic processing.","The question of integrating grammatical components is a linguistic problem. Any reasonable solution for an integration of syntax and pragmatics has to depend on linguistic findings about the interaction of syntactic and pragmatic phenomena. An integrated implementation of any theory that does not account for this interaction will either augment the theory or neglect the linguistic facts.","By supporting integrated implementations, the framework and analysis to be proposed below fulfill an important condition for effcient treatment of partially free word order. 4. The Framework and Syntactic Analysis 4.1 Tile Framework of CPSG in ID/LP Format","The theory of GPSG is based on the assumption that nat ural languages can be generated by context-free phrase structure (CF-PS) grammars. As we know, such a grammar is bound to exhibit a high degree of redundancy and, consequently, is not the right formalism for encoding many of the linguistic generalizations a framework for natural language is expected to express. However. the presumption is that it is possible to give a condensed inductive definition of the CF-PS grammar, which contains various components for encoding the linguistic regt,laritics and which can be interpreted as a metagrammar, i.e.. a grammar for generating the actual CF-PS grammar.","A GPSG can be defined as a two-leveJ grammar containing a metagrammar and an object grammar. The object grammar combines {CF-PS} syntax and model-theoretic semantics. Its rules are ordered triples (n. r. t) where n is an integer (the rule number}, r is a CF-PS rule. and t is the tramlationoft.he rule, its denotation represented in some version of intensional logic. The translation t is actually an operation that maps the translation of the children nodes into the translation of t.he parent. The nonterminals of r are complex symbols, subsets of a finite set of syntactic features or - as in the latest version of the theory (Gazd:w and Pullum, 1982) - feature trees of finite size. The rules o/' the obJect grammar are interpreted as tree-admissability conditions.","The metagrammar consists of four different kinds of rules that are used by three major components to generate the object 107 grammar in a stepwise fashion.

What is of interest here is the mapping from ID rule (5) to t.he appropriate set of PS rules. Which LP rules are needed to allow for all and only the acceptable linearizations?","The position of the verb is a relatively easy matter: if it is the finite matrix verb it precedes the noun phrases; in all other cases, it follows everything else. We have a feature MC for matrix clause as well as a feature co-occurrence restriction to ensure that +MC will always imply +FIN (finite). Two LP rules are needed for the main verb: (Sa) +MC < NP (8b) NP <-MC The regularities that govern the order of the noun phrases can also be encoded in LP rules, as in (ga)-!ge): (Oa) +NOMINATIVE < +DATIVE (9b) +NOMINATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE (9c) +DATIVE < +ACCUSATIVE (9d) -FOCUS < +FOCUS (9e) +PRONOUN < -PRONOUN (Kart.tunen and Peters, 1979) 8 or a function from discourse situations to the appropriate truth-conditional meaning in the spirit of Barwise and Perry (1981). The analysis here is not concerned with choosing a formalism for an extended semantic component, but rather with demonstrating where the syntax has to provide for those elements of discourse information that influence the syntactic structure directly.","Note, that the new LP rules do not resolve the problem of ordering-principle conflicts, for the violation of one LP rule is enough to rule out an ordering. On the other hand, the absence of these LP rules would incorrectly predict that all permutations are acceptable. The next section introduces a redefinition of LP rules that provides a remedy for this deficiency. 4.3 The Modified Framework","Before introducing a new definition of LP rules, let me suggest, anot.her modification that will simplify things somewhat. The I,P rules considered so far are not really LP rules in the sense in which they were defined by their originators. After all. LP rules are defined as members of a partial ordering on \"v~,¢ U VT'. Our rules are schemata for LP rules at best, abbreviating the huge set of UP rules that are instantiations of these schemata. This definition is an unfortunate one in several respects. It not. only creates an unnecessarily large set of rules IVN contains thousands of fully instantiated complex symbols) but also suppresses some of the important generalizations about the language. Clearly, one could extract the relevant generalizations even from a fully expanded LP relation, e.g., realize that there is no LP rule whose first element has -MC and its second element NP. However, it should not be necessary to extract generalizations from the grammar; the grammar should express these generalizat.ions directly. Another disadvantage follows from the choice of a procedure for arriving at the fully expanded LP rela-Lion. Should all extensions that are compatible instantiations of (Sa), (Sb). and (9a)-(9e} be LP rules: If so. then (10) is an instantiat.ion of (8a):","(I0) +MC' NP +DEF < +FIN ,.\\ feature FOCUS has been added that designates a focused consf it,eat. Despite its name FOCUS is a syntactic'fcature, justified by syntactic Pacts, such as its influence on word order. This syntactic feature needs t,o be linked with the appropriate discourse information. The place to do this is in the rule exteusioq component, where features are instantiated and semantic translations added to ID rules. It is assumed that in so doing the translation part of rules will have to be extended anyway so as to incorporate non-truth-conditional aspects of the meaning. For example, the full translation could be an ordered pair of truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional content, extending Karttunen and Peters's treatment of conventional implicature Yet nothing can be a matrix verb and definite simultaneously, and NPs cannot be finite. (101 is a vacuous rule. Whether il is a LP rule at all will depend on the way the nonterminal vocabulary of the object grammar is defined. If it only includes the nonterminals that actually occur in rules then (10) is not as LP rule. [n this case we would need a component of the metagrammar, the feature instantiation principles, to determine 8T,~ be more precise. Karttunen and Peters actuaJly make their translati,,ns ordered triples of truth-conditiona.l content, impllcatures, and an in-hcrhance expression that plays a role in h~.ndling the projection problem for presuppositions. 109 another compouent of the metagrammar, the LP component. 9 LP will be redefined as a partial order on 2 p, where F is the set of syntactic features I0","The second and more important change can best be described by viewing the LP component as a function from a pair of symbols (which can be characterized as feature sets) to truth values, telling us for every pair of symbols whether the first can precede the second in a linearized ru!e. Given the LP relation {(al,~/t),(a~,B~.) ..... (a~,~)} and a pair of complex symbols (3',6), the function can be expressed as in (11).","(11} cl A c,~ A ... A c,~ where c~ ---- ~(~; _C 6 A #; C: 3') for 1 < i < n ~,Ve call the conjunct clauses LP conditions; the whole conjunction is a complex LP condition. The complex LP condition allows \"T to precede /~ on the right-hand side of a CF-PS rule if every LP condition is true. An LP condition ct derived from the LP rule (a~,//i) is true if it is not the case that 3 has the features ;/~ and 6 has the features a¢. Thus the LP rule NP < VP stanch for the following member of the LP relation {{+N,-V, +2B~R}, l-N, +V, +2BAR}). The LP condition following from this rule prevents a superset of {-N, +V, +2BAR} from preceding a superset of l-N, +V, +2BAR}, i.e., a VP from preceding an NP.","But notice that there is nothing to prevent us from writing a fictitious LP rule such as (12} +PRONOUN < -ACCUSATIVE German has verbs like Ichrcn that take two accusative noun phr~.ses as complements. If {12) were an LP rule then the resulting LP condition defined as in ( l 1 ) would rule out any occurrence of two prouominalized sister NPs because either order would be rejected.l 1","It. is an empirical question if one might ever find it useful to write LP rules as in (12}, i.e., rules a < ~/, where a U 3 could be a ~ubset of a complex symbol. Let me introduce a minor redefinition of the interpretation of LP, which will take care of cases such as (12) and at the same prepare the way for a more substantial modification of LP rules.

The definition can emily be extended to work on feature trees instead of feature sets. 1 lln principle, there is nothing in the original ID/LP definition either that would prevent the grammar writer from abbreviating a set of LP rules by (121.

A complex LP rule {{at, dl), (no_, ,%) ..... {am, B,n)} is interpreted as a LP condition of the following form {(o 1 C 6 A~t C -~)V(a~ C 6 At/= C_ -,)v . vt~.,C6A~,,C_~))--((a, C_3,A3, c_ ~}v(a.. c_ \"l A ,'t= C 6)V ...

This analysis makes a number of empirical predictions. For example, it predicts that (15) and (16) are grammatical, but not (17).","(15) Dann batte der Doktor dem Mann die Pille gegeben","-FOCUS +FOCUS -FOCUS","+NOM +DAT +ACC","Then had the doctor the man the pill given","(18) Dana hatte der Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben","-FOCUS +FOCUS +FOCUS","+NOM - +ACC +DAT","Then had the doctor the pill the man given","(17)??Dann hatte der Doktor die Pille dem Mann gegeben","-FOCUS +FOCUS -FOCUS","+NOM +ACC +DAT","Then had the doctor the pill the man given ii0 In (17) the sub-LP-rules +DAT < +ACC and -FOCUS < +FOCUS are violated. No other sub-LP-rule legitimizes these violations and therefore the sentence is bad.","This agrees with the findings of Lenerz (1977), who tested a large number of sample sentences in order to determine the interaction of the unmarked syntactic order and the ordering preferences introduced by discourse roles. There are too many possible feature iustantiatious and permutations of the three noun phrases to permit making grammaticality predictions here for a larger sample of ordering variants. So far 1 have not discovered any empirical deficiencies in the proposed analysis. 5. Implications for Implementations","The theory of GPSG, a,s described by its creators and as outlined in this paper, cannot be used directly for implementation. The number of rules generated by the metagrammar is just too large. The Hewlett-Packard system (Gawron etal., 1982} as well as Henry Thompson's program, which are both based on a pre-ID/LP version of GPSG, use metarules as metagrammatical devices, but with feature iustantiation built into the processor. Agreement checks, however, which correspond to the work of the metagrammatical feature instantiation principles, are done at parse time. As Berwick and Weinberg (1982] have pointed out, the cont ext-freeness of a grammar might not accomplish much when the number of rules explodes. The more components of the metagrammar that can be built into the processor (or used by it as additional rule sets at parse time), the smaller the resulting grammar will be. The task is to search for parsing algorithms that. incorporate the work of the metagrammar into context-free phrase structure parsing without completely losing the parsing time advantages of the latter. Most PSG parsers do feature handling at parse time. Recently, Shieber (forthcoming) has extended the Earley algorithm (Earley 1970) to incorporate the linearization process without a concomitant loss in parsing c~ciency. The redefinition of the LP component proposed in this paper can be intrusted easily and efficiently into Shieber's extension.","If the parser uses the disjunctive LP rules to accept all ordering variants that are well-formed with respect to a discourse, there still remains the question of how the generator chooses among the disjuncts in the LP rule. It would be very surprising if the different orderings that can be obtained by choosing one LP rule disjua:t over another did in fact occur with equal frequency. Although there are no clear results that might provide an answer to this question, there are indications that certain disjuntas \"win out\" more often than others. However, this choice is purely stylistic. A system that is supposed to produce high-quality output might contain a stylistic selection mechanism that avoids repe, hions or choose~ among variants according to the tyt:e of text or dialogue. 6. Conclusion","The proposed analysis of partially free word order in German makes the accurate predictions about the grammusicality of ordering variants, including their appropriate-ness with respect to a given diseo~se. The 1D/LP format, which has the mechanisms to handle free word order, has been extended to account for the interaction of syntax and pragmat.its, as well as for the mutually competing ordering principles. The modifications are compatible with efficient implementation models. The redefined LP component can be used for the implementation of stylistic choice. References","Barwise, J. and J.
