Derivation trees can then be seen as canonical representatives of classes of derivations producing the s~me string, and di~lering only in the order of application o~ the same productions.","The second interpretation of CF rules is as constraimts on derivation trees: a legal derivation tree is :he where each node is \"admitted\" by a rule, i.e. each node dormnates a sequence of nodes in a way sanctioned by a rule. For CF rules, the two interpretations obviously generate the same strings ~,~ the same set of trees.","Following a suggestion of McCawley's, Peters and ~,itchle [34] showed that if one considered context-se~s~.ve rules from the node-admissibility point of view, the languages defined were still CF Thus the use of CS rules in the base to impose sub-categorization restrict/oRs, for example, does not increase the weak generatlve capacity of the base component.

This requires checking that the \"strictly context-free\" part of the rule holds, and that some proper analysis o[ the tree passing thr~\"g '_ the node ~atisfies the \"context-sensitive\" part of the rule.","The ditlieulty comes h'om the fact that the bottom-up automaton cannot generate the set of proper analyses, but must instead propagate (in its state set) the proper analysis conditions necessary to \"admit\" the nodes of its subtrees. It must, of course, also check that those rules get satisfied.","A more intuitive proof using tree tr~nsduce~rs as well as FSTAs ,s sketched inthe Appendix.","Joshi and Levy [21] strengthened Peters and Ritchie's result by showing that the node admissibility conditions could also include arbitrary Boolean combina-tions of ~mance conditions: a node could specify a bounded set of [abels that must occur immediately above it along a path to the root, or un~r'nediate[y below it on a path to the frontier.","In general the CF grammars constructed [n .the proof of weak equivalence to the CS grammars under node admissibility are much larger than the original, and not useful for practical recognition. Joshi, Levy and Yueh [22], however, show how Eariey's a/gomthm can be extended to a parser that uses the local constraints directly. 8.2. MetaruJes.","The second important mechanism used by Gazdar [ii] is mp~es, or rules that apply to rules to produce other rules. Using standard notation for CF rules, one example of a metarule that could replace the transformation k~lown as \"particle movement\" is: V--> VN Pt X ==> V--> VP~ ~-PRO] X Xhere is a vamable behavmg like vamables in structural analyses of transformations. If such vamables are restricted to being used as cbbTeviaticns, that is if they are only allowed to range over a ]~n~te subset of strings over the vocabulary, then closing the grammar under the metarules produces only a 6nite set of derived rules, arid thus the generative power of the formalism is not increased. If, on the other hand, X is allowed to range over strings of unbounded length, as are the essential ~es of transformational theory, then the consequences are less clear. It is well known, for example, that I[ the right-hand sides of phrase structure rules are allowed to be arbitrary regular expressions, then the generated languages are still context-free. Might something like this not be happening wlth essential variables in metarules? It turns out not.","The formal consequences of the presence of essentie/, variables in metarules depends on the preserice of another device, the so-called phantoms categories. It may be convenient in formulating metarules to allo~, in the left-hand sides of rules, occurrences of syntactic categories that are never introduced by the grammar, 1.e that never appear m the mght-hand sldes of rules. |n standard CFLs, these are called %L.~eLess e¢tego~es, and rules containing them can simply be dropped, with no change Jngenerative capacity Not so ~th metarules: it is possible for metarules to rewrite rules containing phantom categories into rules without them. Such a device was proposed at one time as a ~ay to implement pastures in the GPSG framework. i01","Uszkorelt and Peters [49] have shown that essential variables i.n metarules are powerful devices indeed: CF grammars with metaru[es that use at most one essential variable and allow phantom categories can generate all reeursively enumerab[e sets. Even if phantom categories are banned, as long as the use of at [east one essential variab[es [s allowed, then some non-reeursive sets can be generated.","Possible restrictions on the use of metarules are suggested in Oazdar and Pultum [12]. Shieber et al.[45] discuss some empirical consequences of these moves. 7. Tree Adjunct ~.","The Tree Adjunct Grammars (TAGs) of Joshi and his colleagues presents a different way of accounting for syntactic dependencies ([17], [19]).

The linguistic theory of which the syntactic theory ks a part will want to express well-formedness constraints other than syntactic ones These constraints may be expressed over syntactic representa-tions, or over different representations, presumably related to the syntactic ones. One theory may make this connection possible when another does not. This of course underlies the arguments for strong desempttve adequacy,","Also relevant here Ls how the tmguLstlc theory as a whole is decomposed. The syntactm theory can obviously be made ampler by trans~ermng some of the explanatory burden to a.nother constituent. The c[asmc e×amp[e in programming languages is the constraint that all vamables must be declared before they are used. This constrain[ cannot be Lmposed by a CFG but can be by an indexed grammar, at the cost of a dramatic increase in recognltton complexity. Typically, however, the requirement is slmply not cen~idered part of \"syntax\", which thus remams CF, and imposed separately in this case, the overall recognitmn comp[exlty remams ~ome low-order polynomial, Some arguments of this kind can be found m [3t~]","Separating the eonstralnts into different subtheome~ wlt[ not tn general make the problem of recogntzmg strings that satisfy all the constraints any more eHictent, but tt may allow hailing the power of each constituent.

This Ls probably the most subtle s,~t of issues determining the sigmfieance of the [orm,,l results, and I don't claim to understand them.","Comparison between theories requires agreement between the machine models used to derive the complexity results As mentioned above, the sequential models are all polynomtally related, and no problem not hawng a 102 polynomial time solution on a sequential machine is likely to have one on a parallel machine limited to at most a polynomial number o[ processors, at least if P is not equal to NP. Both these results restrict the improvement one can obtain by changing implementation, but are of little use in comparing algorithms of low complexity. Berwick and Weinberg [6] give examples of how algorithms of low complexity may have different implementations differing by large constant factors. In particular, changes in the form of the grammar and in its representation may have this effect.","But of more interest I believe is the fact that implementation is often accompanied by some form of resource limitation that has two effects. First it is also a change in speeifieaZ~bn. A context-free parser implemented with a bounded stack recognizes only a finite-state language.","Second, very special implementations can be used if one is willing to restrict the size of the probterrt to be solved, or even use special-purpose methods for limited problems. Marcus's parser [28] with its bounded look-ahead is another good example. Sentences parsable ~nthin the allowed look-ahead have \"quick\" parses, but some grammatical sentences, such as \"garden path\" sentences cannot be recognized without an extension to the mechanism that would distort the complexity measures.","There is obviously much more of this story to be told. Allow me to speculate as to how it might go. We may end up with a space of linguistic theories, differing in the idealization of the data they assume, in the way they decompose constraints, and in the procedural specifications they postulate (I take it that two theories may differ tn that the second simply provides more detail than the first as to how constraints specified by the first are to be used.) Our observations, in particular our measurements of necessary resources, are drawn from the \"ultimate implementation\", but this does not mean that the \"ultimately low-level theory\" is necessamly the most reformative, witness many examples in the physical sciences, or that less procedural theories are not useful stepping stones to more procedural ones.","It is also not clear that theories of different computational power may not be useful as descriptions of different parts of the syntactic apparatus. For example, tt may be earner to learn statements o[ constraints within the framework of a general machine. The constraints once learned might then be subjected to transformation to produce more ei=llcient special-purpose processors also imposing resource limitations. Indeed, the \"possible languages\" of the future may be more complex than the present ones, just as earlier ones may have been syntactically simpler Were ancient languages regularO","Whatever we decide to make of existing formal results, Lt is clear that continumg contact with the complexity community is important. The driving problems there are the P = NPquestion, the determination of lower bounds, the study of time-space tradeot~s, and the complexity of parallel computations. We still have some m~thodological house-cleaning to do, but I don't see how we can avoid being affected by the outcome of their investigations.","~ITKNO~E~ENTS Thanks to Bob Bet'wlck, Arawnd Joshi, Jim Hoover,","and Stan Peters for their suggestions.","APPE~IDIX","Rounds [41] proves that context-sensitive rules under node-admissibility generate only context-free languages by constructing a non-deterministic bottom-up .tree automaton to recognize the accepted trees. We sketch here a proof that makes use of several d~tev-r, tin/s-tic O\"a.,~d'uc.e~s instead.","FSTAs can be generalized so that instead of simply accepting or rejecting trees, they transform them, by adding constant trees, and deleting or duplicating sub-trees. Such devices are called ~nite state tree transdueerw (FSTT), and like the FSTA they can be top-down or bottom-up. Flrst motivated as models of syntax-directed translations for compilers, they have been extensively studied (e.g. [47], [48], [40]) but a simple subset is sufficient here.","The idea is this. Let The the set of trees accepted by the CS-based gram/nat. Let t be in 71 F'STTs can be used to label each node ~% of t with the set of all proper analyses passing through n. It will then be simple to check that each node satisfies one of the node admissibility conditions by sweeping through the labelled tree with a bottom-up FSTA.","The node labelling is done by two FST\"Fs ~'l and r e. Let","be the maximum length of any left or right-context of any node adITussibility condition. Thus we need only label nodes with sets of strings of length at most rrL, and over a finite alphabet there are only a fitute number of such strings.","r I operates bottom-up on a tree t, and labels each node 7t of t with three sets Pb'efz(n), Sufj~z(n), and Y'zeld(n) of proper analyses: if P is the set of all proper analyses of the subtree rooted at vt, then Prefix(n) is the set of all substrings of length at most m that are prefixes of strings of P. Similarly, ,~tJ%z(n) is the set of all suGixes of length at most ~,~., and Z'zetd(n) is the set of all strings of P of length at most rrL.

A bottom-up FSTA can now be defined to check at each node that both the context-~ree part of a ru/e as well as its context conditions are satisfied.","This argument also extends easily to cover the dotalnance predicates of ioshi and Levy: transducers can be added to label each node wlth all its \"top contexts\" and all its \"bottom- contexts\" \"['he final ?STA must then check that the nodes satlsf-y whatever Boolean combina-tion of dorrunanee and proper analysis predicates _are requJred by the node admissibility m//es.","REFEEENCES [i] Aho A.V., [ndezed gT~rrLmars., aw eztensiovt o/ the co~ztezt-free ~rr=m~rs, JACM 15, 647-67!. i968.
