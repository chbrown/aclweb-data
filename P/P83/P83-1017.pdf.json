Shieber Abstract","Artificial Intelligence Center","SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025","Native speakers of English show definite and consistent preferences for certain readings of syntactically ambiguous sentences. A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the linguistic performance as well as the linguistic competence of the native speaker. We have developed a parsing algorithm--a variant of the LALR(I} shift.-reduce algorithm--that models the preference behavior of native speakers for a range of syntactic preference phenomena reported in the psycholinguistic literature, including the recent data on lexical preferences. The algorithm yields the preferred parse deterministically, without building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. As a side effect, it displays appropriate behavior in processing the much discussed garden-path sentences. The parsing algorithm has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of our approach to the modeling of these phenomena. 1. Introduction","For natural language processing systems to be useful, they must assign the same interpretation to a given sentence that a native speaker would, since that is precisely the behavior users will expect.. Consider, for example, the case of ambiguous sentences. Native speakers of English show definite and consistent preferences for certain readings of syntactically ambiguous sentences [Kimball, 1973, Frazier and Fodor, 1978, Ford et aL, 1982]. A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect, it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the lineuistie performance as well as the linguistic competence of the native speaker.","This idea is certainly not new in the artificial-intelligence literature. The pioneering work of Marcus [Marcus, 1980] is perhaps the best. known example of linguistic-performance modeling in AI. Starting from the hypothesis that ~deterministic\" parsing of English is possible, he demonstrated that certain performance \"This research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Proiects Agency under Contract NOOO39-80-C-0575 with the Naval Electronic Systems Command. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted a.s representative of the oh~cial policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the United States government. constraints, e.g., the difl]culty of parsing garden-path sentences, could be modeled. His claim about deterministic parsing was quite strong. Not only was the behavior of the parser required to be deterministic, but, as Marcus claimed, The interpreter cannot use some general rule to take a nondeterministic grammar specification and impose arbitrary constraints to convert it to a deterministic specification {unless, of course, there is a general rule which will always lead to the correct decision in such a case). [Marcus, 1980, p.14]","We have developed and implemented a parsing system that. given a nondeterministic grammar, forces disambiguation in just the manner Marcus rejected (i.e. t .hrough general rules}; it thereby exhibits the same preference behavior that psycbolinguists have attributed to native speakers of English for a certain range of ambiguities. These include structural ambiguities [Frazier and Fodor, 1978, Frazier and Fodor, 1980, Wanner,"]},{"title":"1980l","paragraphs":["and lexical preferences [Ford et aL, 1982l, as well as the garden-path sentences as a side effect. The parsing system is based on the shih.-reduee scheduling technique of Pereira [forthcoming].","Our parsing algorithm is a slight variant of LALR{ 1) parsing, and, as such, exhibits the three conditions postulated by Marcus for a deterministic mechanism: it is data-driven, reflects expectations, and has look-ahead. Like Marcus's parser, our parsing system is deterministic. Unlike Marcus's parser, the grammars used by our parser can be ambiguous. 2. The Phenomena to be Modeled","The parsing system was designed to manifest preferences among ,~tructurally distinct parses of ambiguous sentences. It, does this by building just one parse tree--rather than building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. Like the Marcus parsing system, ours does not do disambiguation requir-ing \"extensive semantic processing,\" hut, in contrast to Marcus, it does handle such phenomena as PP-attachment insofar as there exist a priori preferences for one attachment over another. By a priori we mean preferences that are exhibited in contexts where pragmatic or plausibility considerations do not tend to favor one reading over the other. Rather than make such value judgments ourselves, we defer to the psycholinguistic literature {specifically [Frazier and Fodor, 1978], [Frazier and Fodor, 1980] and [Ford et al., 1982]) for our examples. 113 The parsing system models the following phenomena:","Right Association Native speakers of English tend to prefer readings in which constituents are \"attached low.\" For instance, in the sentence","Joe bought the book that I hod been trving to obtain for ~usan. the preferred reaL~lng is one in w~lch the"]},{"title":"prepositional","paragraphs":["phrase \"for Susan ~ is associated with %o obtain ~ rather than %ought. ~","Minlmal Attachment On the other hand, higher attachment in preferred in eerrain cases such as Joe bought the book [or Suean. in which \"for Susan* modifies %he book\" rather than \"bought.\" Frazier and Fodor [1978] note that these are canes in which the higher attachment includes fewer nodes in the parse tree. Ore\" analysis is somewhat different.","Lexical Preference Ford et al. [10821 present evidence that attachment preferences depend on lexical choice. Thus, the preferred reading for The woman wanted the dresm on that rock. has low attachment of the PP, whereas The tnoman positioned the dreu on that rack. has high attachment.","Garden-Path Sentences Grammatical sentences such as The horse raced pamt the barn fell. seem actually to receive no parse by the native speaker until some sort of \"conscioun parsing\" is done. Following Marcus [Marcus, 1980], we take this to be a hard failure of the human sentence-processing mechanism.","It will be seen that all these phenomena axe handled in oux parser by the same general rules. The simple context-free grammar used t (see Appendix I) allows both parses of the ambiguous sentences as well as one for the garden-path sentences. The parser disambiguates the grammar and yields only the preferred structure. The actual output of the parsing system can be found in Appendix II. 3. The Parsing System","The parsing system we use is a shift-reduce purser. Shiftreduce parsers [Aho and Johnson, 19741 axe a very general class of bottom-up parsers characterized by the following architecture. They incorporate a stock for holding constituents built up during IWe make no claims a4 to the accuracy of the sample grammar. It is obviously a gross simplific~t.ion of English syntax. Ins role is merely to show that the parsing system is sble to dis,~mbiguate the sentences under consideration correctly. the parse and a shift-reduce table for guiding the parse, At each step in the parse, the table is used for deciding between two basic types of operations: the shift operation, which adds the next word in the sentence (with its pretcrminal category) to the top of the stack, and the reduce operation, which removes several elements from the top of the stack and replaces them with a new element--for instance, removing an NP and a VP from the top of the stack and replacing them with an S. The state of the parser is also updated in accordance with the shift-reduce table at each stage. The combination of the stack, input, and state of the parser will be called a configuration and will be notated as, for example,"]},{"title":"1 NPv IIMar, 110 1","paragraphs":["where the stack contains the nonterminals NP and V, the input contains the lexical item Mary and the parser is in state 10.","By way of example, we demonstrate the operation of the parser (using the grammar of Appendix I) on the oft-cited sentence \"John loves Mary. ~ Initially the stack is empty and no input has been consumed. The parser begins in state 0."]},{"title":"II ahn 10.. Mar, i0 i","paragraphs":["As elements are shifted to the stack, they axe replaced by their preterminal category.\" T.he shiR-reduce table for the grammar of Appendix I states that in state 0, with a proper noun as the next word in the input, the appropriate action is a shift. The new configuration, therefore, is i PNOUN lo~e8 Mar~l i 4 ! The next operation specified is a reduction of the proper noun to a noun phrase yielding , NP iI loves Mary [2 i The verb and second proper noun axe now shifted, in accordance with the shift-reduce table, exhausting the input, and the proper noun is then reduced to an NP."]},{"title":"NP v !l Ma,, !1o v P. ouN il !,","paragraphs":["NP V NP i] :14 Finally, the verb and noun phrase on the top of the stack are reduced to a VP i NP VP !I ! l II ~6 I which is in turn reduced, together with the subject NP, to an S."]},{"title":"i sJl ,'I )","paragraphs":["This final configuration is an accepting configuration, since all 2But see Section 3.'2. for an exception. 114 the input has been consumed and an S derived. Thus the sentence is grammatical ia the grammar of Appendix I, as expected. 3.1 Differences from the Standard LR Techniques","The shift-reduce table mentioned above is generated automatically from a context-free grammar by the standard algorithm [Aho and Johnson, 1974]. The parsing alogrithm differs, however, from the standard LALR(1) parsing algorithm in two ways. First, instead of assigning preterminal symbols to words as they are shifted, the algorithm allows the assignment to be delayed if the word is ambiguous among preterminals. When the word is used in a reduction, the appropriate preterminal is assigned.","Second, and most importantly, since true LR parsers exist only for unambiguous grammars, the normal algorithm for deriv-ing LALR(1) shift-reduce tables yields a table that may specify conflicting actions under certain configurations. It is through the choice made from the options in a conflict that the preference behavior we desire is engendered. 3.2 Preterminal Delaying","One key advantage of shift-reduce parsing that is critical in our system is the fact that decisions about the structure to be assigned to a phrase are postponed as long as possible. In keeping with this general principle, we extend the algorithm to allow the ~ssignment of a preterminal category to a lexical item to be deferred until a decision is forced upon it, so to speak, by aa encompassing reduction. For instance, we would not want to decide on the preterminal category of the word \"that,\" which can serve as either a determiner (DET) or complementizer (THAT), until some further information is available. Consider the sentences That problem i* important. That problema are difficult to naive ia important. Instead of a.~signiag a preterminal to ~that,\" we leave open the possibility of assigning either DET or THAT until the first reduction that involves the word. In the first case, this reduction will be by the rule NP ~DET NOM, thus forcing, once and for all, the assignment of DET as preterminal. In the second ease, the DET NOM analysis is disallowed oa the basis of number agreement, so that the first applicable reduction is the COMPS reduction to S, forcing the assignment of THAT as preterminal.","Of course, the question arises as to what state the parser goes into after shitting the lexical item ~that.\" The answer is quite straightforward, though its interpretation t,i~ d t,,a the determinism hypothesis is subtle. The simple answer is that the parser enters into a state corresponding to the union of the states entered upon shifting a DET and upon shifting a THAT respectively, in much the same way as the deterministic simulation of a nondeterministic finite automaton enters a ~uniou\" state when faced with a nondeterministic choice. Are we then merely simulating a aoadeterministic machine here. ~ The anss~er is equivocal. Although the implementation acts as a simulator for a nondeterministic machine, the nondeterminism is a priori bounded, given a particular grammar and lexicon. 3 Thus. the nondeterminism could be traded in for a larger, albeit still finite, set of states, unlike the nondeterminism found in other parsing algorithms. Another way of looking at the situation is to note that there is no observable property of the algorithm that would distinguish the operation of the parser from a deterministic one. In some sense, there is no interesting difference between the limited nondeterminism of this parser, and Marcus's notion of strict determinism. In fact, the implementation of Marcus's parser also embodies a bounded nondeterminism in much the same way this parser does.","The differentiating property between this parser and that of Marcus is a slightly different one, namely, the property of qaaM-real-time operation. 4 By quasi-real-time operation, Marcus means that there exists a maximum interval of parser operation for which no output can be generated. If the parser operates for longer than this, it must generate some output. For instance, the parser might be guaranteed to produce output (i.e., structure) at least every three words. However, because preterminal assignment can be delayed indefinitely in pathological grammars, there may exist sentences in such grammars for which arbitrary numbers of words need to be read before output can be produced. It is not clear whether this is a real disadvantage or not, and, if so, whether there are simple adjustments to the algorithm that would result in quasi-real-time behavior. In fact, it is a property of bottom-up parsing in general that quasi-real-time behavior is not guaranteed. Our parser has a less restrictive but similar property, fairneaH, that is, our parser generates output linear in the input, though there is no constant over which output is guaranteed. For a fuller discussion of these properties, see Pereira and Shieber [forthcoming].","To summarize, preterminal delaying, as an intrinsic part of the algorithm, does not actually change the basic properties of the algorithm in any observable way. Note, however, that preterminal assignments, like reductions, are irrevocable once they are made {as a byproduct of the determinism of the algorithm}. Such decisions can therefore lead to garden paths, as they do for the sentences presented in Section 3.6.","We now discuss the central feature of the algorithm. namely, the resolution of shift-reduce conflicts. 3.3 The Disambiguation Rules","Conflicts arise in two ways: aM/t-reduce conflicts, in which the parser has the option of either shifting a word onto the stack or reducing a set of elements on the stack to a new element; reduce-reduce conflicts, in which reductions by several grammar 3The boundedness comes about because only a finite amount or informatie, n is kept per state (an integer) and the nondeterrninlsm stops at the prcterminat level, so that, the splitting of states does not. propogate, 41 am indebted to Mitch Marcus for this .bservation and the previous comparison with his parser. i15 rules are possible. The parser uses two rules to resolve these conflicts: 5 (I) Resolve shift-reduce conflicts by shifting.","(2) Resolve reduce-reduce conflicts by performing the longer reduction.","These two rules suffice to engender the appropriate behavior in the parser for cases of right association and minimal attachment. Though we demonstrate our system primarily with PP-attachment examples, we claim that the rules are generally valid for the phenomena being modeled [Pereira and Shieber, forthcoming]. 3.4 Some Examples","Some examples demonstrate these principles.

The formalization of preterminal delaying and the extensions to the Ionic tl-preference cases and garden-path behavior are due to the author. 8The \"slash-category\" analysis of long-distance dependencies used here is loosely based on the work of Gaadar [lggl]. The Appendix 1 grammar does not incorporate the full range of slashed rules, however, but merely a representative selection for illustrative purposes.

Conclusion","To be useful, aatttral-language systems must model the behavior, if not the method, of the native speaker. We have demonstrated that a parser using simple general rules for disambiguating sentences can yield appropriate behavior for a large class of performance phenomena--right a-~soeiation, minimal attachment, lexical preference, and garden-path sentences--and that, morever, it can do so deterministically wit, hour generating all the parses and choosing among them. The parsing system has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of ottr approach to the modeling of these phenomena. References Aho, A.V.. and S.C.
