In this way. standard chart parsing techniques can be adopted to process allophonic and phonotactic constraints, if the constraints are reformulated in terms of a grammar. How can allophonic and phonotactic constraints be cast in terms of context-free rules? In many cases, the constraints can be carried over in a straightforward way. For example, the following set of roles express the aspiration constraint discussed above. These rules allow aspiration in syllable initial position (under the onset node), but not in syllable final position (under the coda).

For example, there may be a problem with constraintS that depend on rule ordering, since rule ordenng is not supported in the context-free formalism. This topic is discussed at length in I41. 94 The agreement problem also arises in phonology. Consider the example of homorganic nasal clusters (e.g., cam2II2, can't, sank), where the nasal agrees with the following obstruent in place of articulation. That is, the labial nasal /m/ is found before the labial stop /p/, the cor9nal nasal/n/ before the coronal stop/t/, and the velar nasal/7// before the velar stop/k/. This constraint, like subject-verb agreement. poses a problem for pure unaugmented context-free rules; it seems to be necessary to expand out each of the three cases: (13a) homorganic-nasal-cluster ~ labial-nasal labial-obstruent (13b) homorganie-nasal-cluster ~ coronal-nasal coronal-obstruent (13c) homorganic-nasal-cluster---* velar-nasal velar-obstruent In an effort to alleviate this expansion problem, many researchers have proposed augmentations of various sorts (e.g., ATN registers [26], LFG constraint equations [16], GPSG recta-rules till, local constraints [18], bit vectors [6, 22]). My own solution will be suggested after I have had a chance to describe the parser in further detail. 2..2 A Parser Based on Matrix Operations This scction will show how the grammar can be implemented in terms of operations on binary matrices. Suppose that the chart is decomposed into a sum of binary matrices: (14) Chart = syl Msy I + onset Monse t + peak Mpeak + .,. where Msy I is a binary matrix 8 describing the location of syllables and Monse t is a binary matrix describing the location of onsets, and so forth. Each of these binary matrices has a I in position (i,j) if there is a constituent of the appropriate part of speech spanning from the i m position in the input sentence to the jth position.9 (See figure 3). Ph'rase-structure rules will be implemented with simple operations on these binary matrices. For example, the homorganic rule (13) could be implemented as: 8. Fhese matnccs will sometimes be called segmentatton lattices for historical reasons. Techmcally. these matnc~ need not conform to the restrictions of a lattice, and therefore, the weaker term graph L~ more correcL 9 In a probabitisuc framework, one could replace all of the I's and 0's with probabdities. A high prohabdity m loeauon (i. j~ of the s),liable matnx would say that there probably is a ss'llahle from postuon t to position 1: a low probabdity would say that there probably isn't a syllable between i and 1. Most of the following apphcs to probabdity matrices welt as binary ntawices, though the probabdity matnces may be less sparse and consequently less efficient. Fig. 3.

In principle, there could be n 2 entries. However, it can be shown that e (the number of l's) is linearly related to n because syllables have finite length. In Church [4], I sharpen this result by arguing that e tends to be bounded by 4n as a consequence ofa phonotactic principle known as sonority. Many more edges will be ruled out by a number of other linguistic constraints mentioned above: voicing and place assimilation, aspiration, flapping. etc. In short, these mamces are sparse because allophonic and phonotactic constraints are useful","(15) (setq homorganic-nasal-lattice","(M + (M* (phoneme-lattice #/m)labial-lattice)","(M* (phoneme-lattice #/n) coronal-lattice)","(M* (phoneme-lattice #/G) velar-lattice))) illustrating tile use of M + (matrix additit)n) ttt express the uniun of several alternatives and M* (matrix multiplication) to express the concatenation of subparts. It is well known that any finite-state grammar could be implemented in this way with just three matrix operations: M,, M+, and M** (transitive closure). If context-free power were required, Valient's algorithm [25] could be employed. However, since there doesn't seem to be a need tbr additional generative capacity in speech applications, the system is restricted to handle only the simpler finite state case. 1° 2..3 Feature Manipulation Although \"pure\" unaugmented finite state grammars may be adequate fur speech applications (in the weak generative capacity sense), [ may, nevertheless, wish to introduce additional mechanism in order to account for agreement facts in a natural way. As discussed above, the formulation of the homorganic rule in (15) is unattractive because it splits the rule into three cases, one for each place of articulation. It would be preferable to state the agreement constraint just once, by defining a homorganic nasal cluster to be a nasal cluster ]0.
