In interesting applications, the number of rules can be very large. It is then crucial to give a representation of these rules that leads to efficient programs.","Finite-state transducers provide just such a compact representation (Mohri, 1994). They are used in various areas of natural language and speech processing because their increased computational power enables one to build very large machines to model interestingly complex linguistic phenomena. They also allow algebraic operations such as union, composition, and projection which are very useful in practice (Berstel, 1979; Eilenberg, 1974 1976). And, as originally shown by Johnson (1972), rewrite rules can be modeled as","1 Parallel rewrite rules also have interesting applications in biology.

We here present a new algorithm for compiling such rewrite rules which is both simpler to understand and implement, and computationally more efficient. Clarity is important since, as pointed out by Kaplan and Kay (1994), the representation of rewrite rules by finite-state transducers involves many subtleties.

The KK Algorithm","paragraphs":["The rewrite rules we consider here have the following general form: ¢ --, p (2) Such rules can be interpreted in the following way: ¢ is to be replaced by ¢ whenever it is preceded by A and followed by p. Thus, A and p represent the left and right contexts of application of the rules. In general, ¢, ¢, A and p are all regular expressions over the alphabet of the rules. Several types of rules can be considered depending on their being obligatory or optional, and on their direction of application, from left to right, right to left or simultaneous application.","Consider an obligatory rewrite rule of the form ¢ --+ ¢/A p, which we will assume applies left to right across the input string. Compilation of this rule in the algorithm of Kaplan and Kay (1994) (KK for short) involves composing together six transducers, see Figure 1.","We use the notations of KK. In particular, denotes the alphabet, < denotes the set of context labeled brackets {<a, <i, <c}, > the set {>a, >i, >c}, and 0 an additional character representing deleted material. Subscript symbols of an expression are symbols which are allowed to freely appear anywhere in the strings represented by that expression. Given a regular expression r, Id(r) is the identity transducer obtained from an automaton A representing r by adding output labels to A identical to its input labels.","The first transducer, Prologue, freely introduces labeled brackets from the set {<a, <i, <~, >a, >i, >~} which are used by left and right context transducers. The last transducer, Prologue -i, erases all such brackets.","In such a short space, we can of course not hope to do justice to the KK algorithm, and the reader who is not familiar with it is urged to consult their paper. However, one point that we do need to stress is the following: while the construction of Prologue, Prologue -i and Replace"]},{"title":"232","paragraphs":["is fairly direct, construction of the other transducers is more complex, with each being derived via the application of several levels of regular operations from the original expressions in the rules. This clearly appears from the explicit expressions we have indicated for the transducers. The construction of the three other transducers involves many operations including: two intersections of automata, two distinct subtractions, and nine complementations. Each subtraction involves an intersection and a complementation algorithm 3. So, in the whole, four intersections and eleven complementations need to be performed.","Intersection and complementation are classical automata algorithms (Aho et al., 1974; Aho et al., 1986). The complexity of intersection is quadratic. But the classical complementation algorithm requires the input automaton to be deterministic. Thus, each of these 11 operations requires first the determinization of the input. Such operations can be very costly in the case of the automata involved in the KK algorithm 4.","In the following section we briefly describe a new algorithm for compiling rewrite rules. For reasons of space, we concentrate here on the compilation of left-to-right obligatory rewrite rules. However, our methods extend straightforwardly to other modes of application (optional, right-to-left, simultaneous, batch), or kinds of rules (two-level rules) discussed by Kaplan and Kay (1994).","3A subtraction can of course also be performed directly by combining the two steps of intersection and complementation, but the corresponding algorithm has exactly the same cost as the total cost of the two operations performed consecutively.","4 One could hope to find a more efficient way of determining the complement of an automaton that would not require determinization. However, this problem is PSPACE-complete. Indeed, the regular expression non-universality problem is a subproblem of complementation known to be PSPACE-complete (Garey and Johnson, 1979, page 174), (Stockmeyer and Meyer, 1973). This problem also known as the emptiness of complement problem has been extensively studied (Aho et al., 1974, page 410-419). 3. New Algorithm 3.1. Overview In contrast to the KK algorithm which introduces \"brackets everywhere only to restrict their occurrence subsequently, our algorithm introduces context symbols just when and where they are needed. Furthermore, the number of intermediate transducers necessary in the construction of the rules is smaller than in the KK algorithm, and each of the transducers can be constructed more directly and efficiently from the primitive expressions of the rule, ~, ~, A, p.","A transducer corresponding to the left-to-right obligatory rule ¢ --* ¢/A p can be obtained by composition of five transducers:","r o f o replace o 11 o 12 (3)","1. The transducer r introduces in a string a marker > before every instance of p. For reasons that will become clear we will notate this as Z* p --~ E* > p.","2.

In other words, this transducer/harks just those ~b that occur before p.","3. The replacement transducer replace replaces ~b with ~ in the context <1 ~b >, simultaneously deleting > in all positions (Figure 2). Since >, <1, and <2 need to be ignored when determining an occurrence of ~b, there are loops over the transitions >: c, <1: ¢, <~: c at all states of ¢, or equivalently of the states of the cross product transducer ¢ × ~.","4. The transducer 11 admits only those strings in which occurrences of <1 are preceded by A and deletes <l at such occurrences:","5. The transducer 12 admits only those strings in which occurrences of <2 are not preceded by A and deletes <~ at such occurrences: 2*X <2-~ ~*~. Clearly the composition of these transducers leads to the desired result. The construction of the transducer replace is straightforward. In the following, we show that the construction of the other four transducers is also very simple, and that it only requires the determinization of 3 automata and additional work linear (time and space) in the size of the determinized automata. 3.2. Markers Markers of TYPE 1","Let us start by considering the problem of constructing what we shall call a TYPE I transducer, 233 Figure 2: Replacement transducer replace in the obligatory left-to-right case. which inserts a marker after all prefixes of a string that match a particular regular expression. Given a regular expression fl defined on the alphabet E, one can construct, using classical algorithms (Aho et al., 1986), a deterministic automaton a representing E*fl. As with the KK algorithm, one can obtain from a a transducer X = Id(a) simply by assigning to each transition the same output label as the input label. We can easily transform X into a new transducer r such that it inserts an arbitrary marker ~ after each occurrence of a pattern described by ~. To do so, we make final the non-final states of X and for any final state q of X we create a new state q~, a copy of q. Thus, q' has the same transitions as q, and qP is a final state. We then make q non-final, remove the transitions leaving q and add a transition from q to q' with input label the empty word c, and output ~. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the transformation of X into T. a:a cic Figure 3: Final state q of X with entering and leaving transitions. ata ctc Figure 4: States and transitions of r obtained by modifications of those of X. Proposition 1 Let ~ be a deterministic automaton representing E*/3, then the transducer r obtained as described above is a transducer postmarking occurrences of fl in a string ofF* by #. Proof. The proof is based on the observa-tion that a deterministic automaton representing E*/~ is necessarily complete 5. Notice that non-deterministic automata representing ~*j3 are not necessarily complete. Let q be a state of a and let u E ~* be a string reaching q6. Let v be a string described by the regular expression ft. Then, for any a E ~, uav is in ~*~. Hence, uav is accepted by the automaton a, and, since ~ is deterministic, there exists a transition labeled with a leaving q. Thus, one can read any string u E E* using the automaton a. Since by definition of a, the state reached when reading a prefix u ~ of u is final iff u ~ E ~*~, by construction, the transducer r inserts the symbol # after the prefix u ~ iff u ~ ends with a pattern of ft. This ends the proof of the proposition, t3 Markers of TYPE 2","In some cases, one wishes to check that any occurrence of # in a string s is preceded (or followed) by an occurrence of a pattern of 8. We shall say that the corresponding transducers are of TYPE 2. They play the role of a filter. Here again, they can be defined from a deterministic automaton representing E*B. Figure 5 illustrates the modifications to make from the automaton of figure 3. The symbols # should only appear at final states and must be erased. The loop # : e added at final states of Id(c~) is enough for that purpose. All states of the transducer are then made final since any string conforming to this restriction is acceptable: cf. the transducer !1 for A above. #:E Figure 5: Filter transducer, TYPE 2.","5An automaton A is complete iff at any state q and for any element a of the alphabet ~ there exists at least one transition leaving q labeled with a. In the case of deterministic automata, the transition is unique.","6We assume all states of a accessible. This is true if a is obtained by determinization."]},{"title":"234","paragraphs":["Markers of TYPE 3","In other cases, one wishes to check the reverse constraint, that is that occurrences of # in the string s are not preceded (or followed) by any occurrence of a pattern of ft. The transformation then simply consists of adding a loop at each non-final state of Id(a), and of making all states final. Thus, a state such as that of figure 6 is trans-a:a c:c Figure 6: Non-final state q of a. formed into that of figure 5. We shall say that the corresponding transducer is of TYPE 3: cf. the transducer 12 for ~.","The construction of these transducers (TYPE 1-3) can be generalized in various ways. In particular:","• One can add several alternative markers {#1,'\", #k} after each occurrence of a pattern of 8 in a string. The result is then an automaton with transitions labeled with, for instance, ~1,'\" \", ~k after each pattern of fl: cf. transducer f for ¢ above.","• Instead of inserting a symbol, one can delete a symbol which would be necessarily present after each occurrence of a pattern of 8. For any regular expression a, define M arker( a, type, deletions, insertions) as the transducer of type type constructed as previously described from a deterministic automaton representing a, insertions and deletions being, respectively, the set of insertions and deletions the transducer makes. Proposition 2 For any regular expression a, Marker(a, type, deletions, insertions) can be constructed from a deterministic automaton representing a in linear time and space with respect to the size of this automaton. Proof. We proved in the previous proposition that the modifications do indeed lead to the desired transducer for TYPE 1. The proof for other cases is similar. That the construction is linear in space is clear since at most one additional transition and state is created for final or non-final states 7. The overall time complexity of the construction is linear, since the construction of ld(a) is linear in the","~For TYPE 2 and TYPE 3, no state is added but only a transition per final or non-final state. r = [reverse(Marker(E*reverse(p), 1, {>},0))] f = [reverse(Marker((~ U {>})*reverse(C> >), 1, {<1, <u},0))] 11 = [Marker(N*)L 2,0, {<1})]<~:<2 12 = [Marker($*A,3,@, {<2})] Figure 7: Expressions of the r, f, ll, and 12 using Marker."]},{"title":"(4) (5) (6) (7)","paragraphs":["number of transitions of a and that other modifications consisting of adding new states and transitions and making states final or not are also linear.

Extension to Weighted Rules","paragraphs":["In many applications, in particular in areas related to speech, one wishes not only to give all possible analyses of some input, but also to give some measure of how likely each of the analyses is. One can then generalize replacements by considering extended regular expressions, namely, using the terminology of formal language theory, rational power series (Berstel and Reutenauer, 1988; Salomaa and Soittola, 1978).","The rational power series we consider here are functions mapping ~* to ~+ U {oo) which can be described by regular expressions over the alphabet (T~+ U {co}) x ~. S = (4a)(2b)*(3b) is an example of rational power series. It defines a function in the following way: it associates a non-null number only with the strings recognized by the regular expression ab*b. This number is obtained by adding the coefficients involved in the recognition of the string. The value associated with abbb, for instance, is (S, abbb) = 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11.","In general, such extended regular expressions can be redundant. Some strings can be matched","SAs in the KK algorithm we denote by ¢> the set of the strings described by ¢ containing possibly occurrences of > at any position. In the same way, subscripts such as >:> for a transducer r indicate that loops by >:> are added at all states of r. We denote by reverse(a) the regular expression describing exactly the reverse strings of a if a is a regular expression, or the reverse transducer of a if a is a transducer."]},{"title":"235","paragraphs":["in different ways with distinct coefficients. The value associated with those strings is then the minimum of all possible results. S' = (2a)(3b)(4b) + (5a)(3b*) matches abb with the different weights 2+3+4 -- 9 and 5+3+3 = 11. The minimum of the two is the value associated with abb: (S', abb) = 9. Non-negative numbers in the definition of these power series are often interpreted as the negative logarithm of probabilities. This explains our choice of the operations: addition of the weights along the string recognition and min, since we are only interested in that result which has the highest probability 9.","Rewrite rules can be generalized by letting ¢ be a rational power series. The result of the application of a generalized rule to a string is then a set of weighted strings which can be represented by a weighted automaton. Consider for instance the following rule, which states that an abstract nasal, denoted N, is rewritten as m in the context of a following labial:","Y ---* m/__[+labial] (8) z Now suppose that this is only probabilistically true, and that while ninety percent of the time N does indeed become m in this environment, about ten percent of the time in real speech it becomes n. Converting from probabilities to weights, one would say that N becomes m with weight a = -log(0.9), and n with weight fl = -log(0.1), in the stated environment. One could represent this by the following rule:","N --* am + fin/__[+labial] (9) We define Weighted finite-state transducers as transducers such that in addition to input and output labels, each transition is labeled with a weight.","The result of the application of a weighted transducer to a string, or more generally to an automaton is a weighted automaton. The corresponding operation is similar to the unweighted case. However, the weight of the transducer and those of the string or automaton need to be combined too, here added, during composition (Pereira et al., 1994).","9Using the terminology of the theory of languages, the functions we consider here are power series defined on the tropical semiring (7~+U{oo}, min, +, (x), 0) (Kuich and Salomaa, 1986)."]},{"title":"\\\"_/Too","paragraphs":["p:p/O"]},{"title":"N:N/O~","paragraphs":["N:m/a N:n/l~ :0~ N:N/O Figure 8: Transducer representing the rule 9.","We have generalized the composition operation to the weighted case by introducing this com-bination of weights.

All tests were run on a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo 4000, 100 MhZ IP20 Processor, 128 Mbytes RAM, running IRIX 5.2. Figure 9 shows the relative performance of the two algorithms for the left context: apparently the performance of both algorithms is roughly linear in the length of the left context, but KK has a worse constant, due to the larger number of operations involved. Figure 10 shows the equivalent data for the right context. At first glance the data looks similar to that for the left context, until one no-tices that in Figure 10 we have plotted the time on a log scale: the KK algorithm is hyperexponential.","What is the reason for this performance degradation in the right context? The culprits turn out to be the two intersectands in the expression of Rightcontext(p, <, >) in Figure 1. Consider for example the righthand intersectand, namely ~0 > P>0~0- > ~0, which is the complement of ~0 > P>0~0- > ~0- As previously indicated, the complementation Mgorithm. requires determinization, and the determinization of automata representing expressions of the form ~*a, where c~ is a regular expression, is often very expensive, specially when the expression a is already complex, as in this case.","Figure 11 plots the behavior of determinization on the expression Z~0 > P>0Z~0- > ~0 for each of the rules in the set a ~ b/__c k, (k e [0, 10]).

Moreover, the corresponding determinization is independent of ~ which can be very large in some applications. It only depends on the alphabet of the automaton representing ¢.","One can devise an on-the-fly implementation of the composition algorithm leading to the final transducer representing a rule.
