Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy. 1 Introduction Lexical information has been shown to be crucial for many parsing decisions, such as prepositional-phrase attachment (for example (Hindle and Rooth 93)). However, early approaches to probabilistic parsing (Pereira and Schabes 92; Magerman and Marcus 91; Briscoe and Carroll 93) conditioned probabilities on non-terminal labels and part of speech tags alone. The SPATTER parser (Magerman 95; 3elinek et ah 94) does use lexical information, and recovers labeled constituents in Wall Street Journal text with above 84% accuracy - as far as we know the best published results on this task.","This paper describes a new parser which is much simpler than SPATTER, yet performs at least as well when trained and tested on the same Wall Street Journal data.

A statistical approach to this problem consists of two components. First, the statistical model assigns a probability to every candidate parse tree for a sentence. Formally, given a sentence S and a tree T, the model estimates the conditional probability P(T[S). The most likely parse under the model is then: Tb~,, -- argmaxT P(TIS ) (1)","Second, the parser is a method for finding Tbest. This section describes the statistical model, while section 3 describes the parser.","The key to the statistical model is that any tree such as Figure l(b) can be represented as a set of baseNPs 2 and a set of dependencies as in Figure l(c). We call the set of baseNPs B, and the set of dependencies D; Figure l(d) shows B and D for this example. For the purposes of our model, T = (B, D), and: P(TIS ) = P(B,D]S) = P(B[S) x P(D]S,B) (2)","S is the sentence with words tagged for part of speech. That is, S =< (wl,tl), (w2,t2)...(w~,t,) >. For POS tagging we use a maximum-entropy tagger described in (Ratnaparkhi 96). The tagger performs at around 97% accuracy on Wall Street Journal Text, and is trained on the first 40,000 sentences of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93).","Given S and B, the reduced sentence :~ is defined as the subsequence of S which is formed by removing punctuation and reducing all baseNPs to their head-word alone.","~A baseNP or 'minimal' NP is a non-recursive NP, i.e. none of its child constituents are NPs.

Additional context, in particular the relative order of the two words and the distance between them, will also strongly influence the likelihood of one word modifying the other. For example consider the relationship between 'sales' and the three tokens of 'of': Example 2 Shaw, based in Dalton, Ga., has an-nual sales of about $1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong's brands, sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names .","In this sentence 'sales' and 'of' co-occur three times. The parse tree in training data indicates a relationship in only one of these cases, so this sentence would contribute an estimate of 1⁄2 that the two words are related. This seems unreasonably low given that 'sales of' is a strong collocation. The latter two instances of 'of' are so distant from 'sales' that it is unlikely that there will be a dependency.","This suggests that distance is a crucial variable when deciding whether two words are related. It is included in the model by defining an extra 'distance' variable, A, and extending C, F and /~ to include this variable. For example, C( (a, b), (c, d), A) is the number of times (a, b) and (c, d) appear in the same sentence at a distance A apart. (11) is then maximised instead of (10):","rn At(DIS, B) = 1-I P(Rj I ((vj, tj), (~hj, [hj), Aj,ni)","j=l","(11) A simple example of Aj,hj would be Aj,hj = hj - j. However, other features of a sentence, such as punctuation, are also useful when deciding if two words are related. We have developed a heuristic 'distance' measure which takes several such features into account The current distance measure Aj,h~ is the combination of 6 features, or questions (we motivate the choice of these questions qualitatively - section 4 gives quantitative results showing their merit):","Question 1 Does the hjth word precede or follow the jth word? English is a language with strong word order, so the order of the two words in surface text will clearly affect their dependency statistics.","Question 2 Are the hjth word and the jth word adjacent? English is largely right-branching and head-initial, which leads to a large proportion of dependencies being between adjacent words 7. Table 1 shows just how local most dependencies are. Distance 1 < 2 < 5 < 10 Percentage 74.2 86.3 95.6 99.0 Table 1: Percentage of dependencies vs. distance between the head words involved. These figures count baseNPs as a single word, and are taken from WSJ training data. Number of verbs 0 <=1 <=2 Percentage 94.1 98.1 99.3 Table 2: Percentage of dependencies vs. number of verbs between the head words involved.","Question 3 Is there a verb between the hjth word and the jth word? Conditioning on the exact distance between two words by making Aj,hj = hj - j leads to severe sparse data problems. But Table 1 shows the need to make finer distance distinctions than just whether two words are adjacent. Consider the prepositions 'to', 'in' and 'of' in the following sentence: Example 3 Oil stocks escaped the brunt of Friday's selling and several were able to post gains , including Chevron , which rose 5/8 to 66 3//8 in Big Board composite trading of 2.4 million shares.","The prepositions' main candidates for attachment would appear to be the previous verb, 'rose', and the baseNP heads between each preposition and this verb. They are less likely to modify a more distant verb such as 'escaped'. Question 3 allows the parser to prefer modification of the most recent verb - effectively another, weaker preference for right-branching structures. Table 2 shows that 94% of dependencies do not cross a verb, giving empirical evidence that question 3 is useful.","ZFor example in '(John (likes (to (go (to (University (of Pennsylvania)))))))' all dependencies are between adjacent words."]},{"title":"187","paragraphs":["Questions 4, 5 and 6","• Are there 0, 1, 2, or more than 2 'commas' between the hith word and the jth word?

However the baseNP model is needed for two reasons. First, while adjacency between words is a good indicator of whether there is some relationship between them, this indicator is made substantially stronger if baseNPs are reduced to a single word. Second, it means that words internal to baseNPs are not included in the co-occurrence counts in training data. Otherwise, 188 in a phrase like 'The Securities and Exchange Commission closed yesterday', pre-modifying nouns like 'Securities' and 'Exchange' would be included in co-occurrence counts, when in practice there is no way that they can modify words outside their baseNP.","The baseNP model can be viewed as tagging the gaps between words with"]},{"title":"S(tart), C(ontinue), E(nd), B(etween)","paragraphs":["or"]},{"title":"N(ull)","paragraphs":["symbols, respectively meaning that the gap is at the start of a"]},{"title":"BaseNP,","paragraphs":["continues a"]},{"title":"BaseNP,","paragraphs":["is at the end of a"]},{"title":"BaseNP,","paragraphs":["is between two adjacent"]},{"title":"baseNPs,","paragraphs":["or is between two words which are both not in"]},{"title":"BaseNPs.","paragraphs":["We call the gap before the ith word Gi (a sentence with n words has n - 1 gaps).

Four configurations of the parser were tested: (1) The basic model; (2) The basic model with the punctuation rule described in section 2.7; (3) Model (2) with tags ignored when lexical information is present, as described in 2.7; and (4) Model (3) also using the full probability distributions for POS tags. We should emphasise that test data outside of section 23 was used for all development of the model, avoiding the danger of implicit training on section 23. Table 3 shows the results of the tests. Table 4 shows results which indicate how different parts of the system contribute to performance. 4.1 Performance Issues All tests were made on a Sun SPARCServer 1000E, using 100% of a 60Mhz SuperSPARC processor. The parser uses around 180 megabytes of memory, and training on 40,000 sentences (essentially extracting the co-occurrence counts from the corpus) takes under 15 minutes. Loading the hash table of bigram counts into memory takes approximately 8 minutes.","Two strategies are employed to improve parsing efficiency. First, a constant probability threshold is used while building the chart - any constituents with lower probability than this threshold are discarded. If a parse is found, it must be the highest ranked parse by the model (as all constituents discarded have lower probabilities than this parse and could"]},{"title":"190","paragraphs":["calculating scores. not, therefore, be part of a higher probability parse). If no parse is found, the threshold is lowered and parsing is attempted again. The process continues until a parse is found.","Second, a beam search strategy is used.

All other constituents spanning the same words must have probability greater than ~-~ for some constant beam size /3 - constituents which fall out of this beam are discarded.

Model (3) was used for this test on all sentences < 100 words in section 23. 5 Conclusions and Future Work We have shown that a simple statistical model based on dependencies between words can parse Wall Street Journal news text with high accuracy. The method is equally applicable to tree or dependency representations of syntactic structures.","There are many possibilities for improvement, which is encouraging. More sophisticated estimation techniques such as deleted interpolation should be tried. Estimates based on relaxing the distance measure could also be used for smoothing- at present we only back-off on words. The distance measure could be extended to capture more context, such as other words or tags in the sentence. Finally, the model makes no account of valency.
