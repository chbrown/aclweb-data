Our prime concern is to be able to exercise control over the mapping from the task model to the generated text. We set out to establish whether the task model Mone is sufficient to control the linguistic output of a text generation system, or whether additional control is required. In this event, an obvious source to explore is the communicative purpose of the author, which is not necessarily constant throughout a manuM. Indeed, in a typical software manual, it is possible to distinguish at least three sections, each with a different purpose: a tutorial containing exercises for new users, a series of step-by-step instructions for the major tasks to be accomplished, and a ready-reference summary of the commands.","We need, therefore, to characterise the linguistic expressions of the different elements of the task model, and to establish whether these expressions are sensitive or not to their context, that is, the functional section in which they appear. This paper presents the results of an analysis we conducted to this end on a corpus of software instructions in French. 2 Methodology The methodology we employed is similar to that endorsed by (Biber, 1995). It is summarised as follows:","1. Collect the texts and note their situational characteristics.

This initial description was necessary to give us a clear statement of the linguistic potentiM required of our text generator, to which we could relate any restrictions on language imposed by situational variables. Thus we can ac-count for language restrictions by appealing to general discourse principles, in keeping with the recommendations of (Kittredge, 1995) and (Biber, 1995) for the definition of sublanguages.","We then correlated task elements with grammaticM features. Finally, where linguistic realisation was under-determined by task structure alone, we established whether the communicative purpose provided more discriminating control over the linguistic resources available. 3 Linguistic Framework:"]},{"title":"Systemic","paragraphs":["Functional Linguistics Our analysis was carried out within the framework of Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday, 1978; Halliday, 1985) which views language as a re-source for the creation of meaning.

Context thus constrains language.","This framework was chosen for several reasons. First, the organisation of linguistic resources accord-ing to this principle is well-suited to natural language generation, where the starting point is necessarily a communicative goal, and the task is to find the most appropriate expression for the in-tended meaning (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991). Second, a functional perspective offers an advantage for multilingual text generation, because of its ability to achieve a level of linguistic description which holds across languages more effectively than do structurally-based accounts. The approach has been shown capable of supporting the sharing of linguistic resources between languages as structurally distinct as English and Japanese (Bateman et al., 1991a; Bateman et at., 1991b). It is therefore reasonable to expect that at least the same degree of commonality of description is achievable between English and French within this framework. Finally, KPML (Bateman, 1994), the tactical generator we employ, is based on SFL, and it is thus appropriate for us to characterise the corpus in terms immediately applicable to our generator. 4 Coding features Our lexico-grammatical coding was done using the networks and features of the Nigel grammar (Halliday, 1985). We focused on four main concerns, guided by previous work on instructional texts, e.g., (Lehrberger, 1986; Plum et at., 1990; Ghadessy, 1993; Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994).","• Relations between processes: to determine whether textual cohesion was achieved through conjunctives or through relations implicit in the task structure elements. Among the features considered were clause dependency and conjunction type.","• Agency: to see whether the actor performing or enabling a particular action is clearly identified, and whether the reader is explicitly addressed. We coded here for features such as voice and agent types.","• Mood, modality and polarity: to find out the extent to which actions are presented to the reader as being desirable, possible, mandatory, or prohibited. We coded for both true and implicit negatives, and for both personal and impersonal expressions of modality.","• Process types: to see how the domain is construed in terms of actions on the part of the user and the software. We coded for sub-categories of material, mental, verbal and relational processes. 5 The Corpus The analysis was conducted on the French version of the Macintosh MacWrite manual (Kaehler, 1983). The manual is derived from an English source by a process of adaptive translation (Sager, 1993), i.e., one which loealises the text to the expectations of the target readership. The fact that the translation is adaptive rather than literal gives us confidence in using this manual for our analysis. 1 Furthermore, we know that Macintosh documentation undergoes thorough local quality control. It certainly conforms to the principles of good documentation established by current research on technical documentation and on the needs of end-users, e.g., (Carroll, 1994; Hammond, 1994), in that it supplies clear and concise information for the task at hand. Finally, we have been assured by French users of the software that they consider this particular manual to be well written and to bear no unnatural trace of its origins.","Technical manuals within a specific domain constitute a sublanguage, e.g., (Kittredge, 1982; Sager et al., 1980). An important defining property of a sublanguage is that of closure, both lexieal and syntactic. Lexical closure has been demonstrated by, for example, (Kittredge, 1987), who shows that after as few as the first 2000 words of a sublanguage text, the number of new word types increases little if at all. Other work, e.g., (Biber, 1988; Biber, 1989) and (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986) illustrates the property of syntactic closure, which means that generally available constructions just do not occur in this or that sublanguage. In the light of these results, we considered a corpus of 15000 words to be adequate for our purposes, at least for an initial analysis.","The MacWrite manual is organised into three chapters, corresponding to the three different sections identified earlier: a tutorial, a series of step-by-step instructions for the major word-processing tasks, and a ready-reference summary of the commands. We omitted the tutorial because the generation of such text is not our concern, retaining the other two chapters which provide the user with generic instructions for performing relevant tasks, and descriptions of the commands available within MacWrite. The overlap in information between the two chapters offers opportunities to observe differences in the linguistic expressions of the same task structure elements in different contexts.","1We would have preferred to use a manual which originated in French to exclude all possibility of interference from a source language, but this proved impossible. Surprisingly, it appears that large French companies often have their documents authored in English by francophones and subsequently translated into French. One large French software house that we contacted does author its documentation in French, but had registered considerable customer dissatisfaction with its quality. We decided, therefore, that their material would be un-suitable for our purposes. 193 Goals: Functions: Constraints: Results: Substeps: La s~lection Gloss: Selection Pour sdlectionner un mot, (faites un double-clic sur le mot) Gloss: To select a word, (do a double-click on the word) (Fermer -) Cet article permet de fermer une fen~tre activ~e Gloss: (Close -) This command enables you to close the active window Si vous donnez ~ votre document le titre d'un document ddj~ existant, (une zone de dialogue apparait) Gloss: If you give your document the title of an existing document, (a dialog box","appears) (Choisissez Coller dans le menu Edition - ) Une copie du contenu du presse-papiers apparait Gloss: (Choose Paste from the Edit menu -) A copy of the content of the clipboard appears Ferrnez la fen@tre Rechercher Gloss: Close the Find window Ensuite, on ouvre le document de destination Gloss: Next, one opens the target document Figure 1: Examples of task element expressions 6 Task Structure Task structure is constituted by five types of task elements, which we define below. We used the no-tion of task structure element both as a contextual feature for the analysis and to determine the segmentation of the text into units. Each unit is taken to be the expression of a single task element.","Our definition of the task elements is based on the concepts and relations commonly chosen to represent a task structure (a goal and its associated plan), e.g., (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971; Sacerdoti, 1977), and on related research, e.g., (Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994). Our generator produces instructions from an underlying semantic knowledge base which uses this representation (Paris et al., 1995). To generate an instruction for performing a task is to chose some task elements to be expressed and linearise them so that they form a coherent set for a given goal the user might have. We distinguish the following elements, and provide examples of them in Figure 1:2","goals: actions that users will adopt as goals and","which motivate the use of a plan.","functions: actions that represent the functionality","of an interface object (such as a menu item). A","2The text in parentheses in the Figure is part of the linguistic context of the task element rather than the element itself. function is closely related to a goal, in that it is also an action that the user may want to perform. However, the function is accessed through the interface object, and not through a plan.","constraints and preconditions: states which must hold before a plan can be employed successfully. The domain model distinguishes constraints (states which cannot be achieved through planning) and preconditions (states which can be achieved through planning). We do not make this distinction in the linguistic analysis and regroup these related task structure elements under one label. We decided to proceed in this way to determine at first how constraints in general are expressed. Moreover, it is not always clear from the text which type of constraint is expressed. Drawing too fine distinctions in the corpus analysis at this point, in the absence of a test for assigning a unit to one of these constraint types, would have rendered the results of the analysis more subjective and thus less reliable.","results: states which arise as planned or unplanned effects of carrying out a plan. While it might be important to separate planned and unplanned effects in the underlying representation, we again abstract over them in the lexico-grammatical coding. 194","sub-steps: actions which contribute to the execu-tion of the plan. If the sub-steps are not primitive, they can themselves be achieved through other plans. 7 The Coding Procedure No tools exist to automate a functional analysis of text, which makes coding a large body of text a timeconsuming task. We first performed a detailed coding of units of texts on approximately 25% of the corpus, or about 400 units, 3 using the WAG coder (O'Donnell, 1995), a tool designed to facilitate a functional analysis.","We then used a public-domain concordance program, MonoConc (Barlow, 1994), to verify the representativeness of the results. We enumerated the realisations of those features that the first analysis had shown as marked, and produced KWIC 4 listings for each set of realisations. We found that the second analysis corroborated the results of the first, consistent with the nature of sublanguages. 8 Distribution of Grammatical Features over Task Structure and Communicative Purpose","We examined the correlations between lexico-grammatical realisations and task elements and communicative purpose. The results are best expressed using tables generated by WAG: given any system, WAG splits the codings into a number of sets, one for each feature in that system. Percentages and means are computed, and the sets are compared statistically, using the standard T-test. WAG displays the results with an indicator of how statistically significant a value is compared to the combined means in the other sets. The counts were all done using the local mean, that is, the feature count is divided by the total number of codings which select that feature's system. Full definitions of the features can be found in (Halliday, 1985; Bateman et al., 1990).","In some cases, the type of task element is on its own sufficient to determine, or at least strongly constrain, its linguistic realisation. The limited space available here allows us to provide only a small number of examples, shown in Figure 2. We see that the use of modals is excluded in the expression of function, result and constraint, whereas goal and substep do admit modals. As far as the polarity system is concerned, negation is effectively ruled out for function, goal and substep. Finally, with respect to the mood system, only substep can be realised through imperatives. 3The authors followed guidelines for identifying task element units which had yielded consistent results when used by students coding other corpora. 4Key Word In Context","In other cases, however, we observe a diversity of realisations. We highlight here three cases: modality in goal, polarity in constraint, and mood in substep. In such cases, we must appeal to another source of control over the apparently available choices. We have looked to the construct of genre (Martin, 1992) to provide this additional control, on two grounds: (1) since genres are distinguished by their communicative purposes, we can view each of the functional sections already identified as a distinct genre; (2) genre is presented as controlling text structure and realisation. In Martin's view, genre is defined as a staged, goal-oriented social process realised through register, the context of situation, which in turn is realised in language to achieve the goals of a text. Genre is responsible for the selection of a text structure in terms of task elements. As part of the realisation process, generic choices preselect a register associated with particular elements of text structure, which in turn preselect lexico-grammatical features. The coding of our text in terms genre and task elements thus allows us to establish the role played by genre in the realisations of the task elements. It will also allow us to determine the text structures appropriate in each genre, a study we are currently undertaking. This is consistent with other accounts of text structure for text generation in technical do-mains, e.g., (McKeown, 1985; Paris, 1993; Kittredge et al., 1991).","For those cases where the realisation remains under-determined by the task element type, we conducted a finer-grained analysis, by overlaying a genre partition on the undifferentiated data. We distinguished earlier two genres with which we are concerned: ready-reference and step-by-step. In the manual analysed, we recognised two more specific communicative purposes in the step-by-step section: to enable the reader to perform a task, and to in-crease the reader's knowledge about the task, the way to achieve it, or the properties of the system as a whole. Because of their distinct communicative purposes, we again feel justified in calling these genres. We label them respectively procedure and elaboration. The intention that the reader should recognise the differences in function of each section is underscored by the use of distinctive typographi-cal devices, such as fonts and lay-out. 5","The first step at this stage of the analysis was to establish whether there was an effective overlap in task elements among the three genres under consideration. The results of this step is shown in Figure 3. Sub-step and goal are found in all three genres, while constraint, result and function occur in both ready-reference and elaboration but are absent from procedure.","The next step was to undertake a comparative","5See (Hartley and Paris, 1995) for examples extracted from the manuals. 195"]},{"title":"Function Result Constraint Goal Substep Modal-System modal 0% 1% 0% 24% 16%","paragraphs":["non-modal 100% 99% 100% 76% 84%"]},{"title":"polarity","paragraphs":["positive 100% 90% 68% 97% 97%"]},{"title":"negative","paragraphs":["0% 10% 32% 3% 3%"]},{"title":"mood-system","paragraphs":["declarative 100% 100% 100% 100% 24% imperative 0% 0% 0% 0% 76% Figure 2: Selective realisations of task"]},{"title":"elements Ready-Reference","paragraphs":["Procedure"]},{"title":"Elaboration","paragraphs":["Sub-step 37%"]},{"title":"77%","paragraphs":["42% Goal 11% 23% 14%"]},{"title":"Constraint","paragraphs":["10% 0% 14% Result 23% 0% 27% Function 11% 0% 3% Figure 3: Distribution of task structure elements over genres","analysis of the lexico-grammatical features found in","the three genres. This analysis indicated that the","language employed in these different sections of the","text varies greatly. We summarise here the two","genres that are strongly contrasted: procedure and","ready-reference. Elaboration shares features with","both of these.","procedure: The top-level goM of the user is expressed as a nominMisation. Actions to be achieved by the reader are almost exclusively reMised by imperatives, directly addressing the reader. These actions are mostly materiM directed actions, and there are no causatives. Few modals are employed, and, when they are, it is to express obligation impersonally. The polarity of processes is always positive. Procedure employs mostly independent clauses, and, when clause complexes are used, the conjunctions are mostly purpose (linking a user goal and an action) and alternative (linking two user actions or two goals).","ready-reference: In this genre, M1 task elements are always realised through clauses. The declarative mood predominates, with few imperatives addressing the reader. Virtually all the causatives occur here. On the dimension of modality, the emphasis is on personal possibility, rather than obligation, and on inclina-tion. We find in this genre most of the verbM processes, entirely absent from procedure. Ready-reference is more weighted than procedure towards dependent clauses, and is particularly marked by the presence of temporal conjunctions.","The analysis so far demonstrates that genre, like task structure, provides some measure of control over the linguistic resources but that neither of these alone is sufficient to drive a generation system. The finM step was therefore to look at the realisations of the task elements differentiated by genre, in cases where the realisation was not strongly determined by the task element.","We refer the reader back to Figure 2, and the under-constrained cases of modality in goal, polarity in constraint, and mood in substep. Figure 4 shows the realisations the task element goal with respect to the modal system, which brings into sharp relief the absence of modality from procedure. Figure 5 presents the reaiisations by genre of the polarity system for constraint. We observe that only positive polarity occurs in ready-reference. Finally, we note from Figure 6 that the realisation of sub-steps is heavily loaded in favour of imperatives in procedure.","These figures show that genre does indeed provide useful additional control over the expression of task elements, which can be exploited by a text generation system. Neither task structure nor genre alone is sufficient to provide this control, but, taken to-gether, they offer a real prospect of adequate control over the output of a text generator. 196 Non-modal Modal"]},{"title":"Procedure Ready-Reference Elaboration","paragraphs":["100.0% 75.0% 72.6% 0.0% 25.0% 28.4% Figure 4: Genre-related differences in the modal system for goal Negative Positive"]},{"title":"Ready-Reference Elaboration 0.0% 41.7%","paragraphs":["100% 58.3% Figure 5: Genre-related differences in the polarity system for constraint Imperative Declarative"]},{"title":"Procedure Ready-Reference Elaboration 97.3% 44.4% 77.6% 2.7% 55.6% 22.4%","paragraphs":["Figure 6: Genre-related differences in the mood system for substep 9 Related Work The results from our linguistic analysis are consistent with other research on sublanguages in the instructions domain, in both French and English, e.g., (Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994; Paris and Scott, 1994). Our analysis goes beyond previous work by identifying within the discourse context the means for exercising explicit control over a text generator.","An interesting difference with respect to previous descriptions is the use of the true (or direct) imperative to express an action in the procedure genre, as results from (Paris and Scott, 1994) seem to in-dicate that the infinitive-form of the imperative is preferred in French. These results, however, were obtained from a corpus of instructions mostly for domestic appliances as opposed to software manuals. Furthermore the use of the infinitive-form in instructions in general as observed by (Kocourek, 1982) is declining, as some of the conventions already common in English technical writing are being adopted by French technical writers, e.g., (Timbal-Duclaux, 1990).","We also note that the patterns of realisations un-covered in our analysis follow the principle of good technical writing practice known as the minimalist approach, e.g., (Carroll, 1994; Hammond, 1994). Moreover, we observe that our corpus does not exhibit shortcomings identified in a Systemic Functional analysis of English software manuals (Plum et al., 1990), such as a high incidence of agentless passive and a failure to distinguish the function of informing from that of instructing.","Other work has focused on the cross-linguistic realisations of two specific semantic relations (generation and enablement) (Delin et al., 1994; Delia et al., 1996), in a more general corpus of instructions for household appliances. Our work focuses on the single application domain of software instructions. However, it takes into consideration the whole task structure and looks at the realisation of semantic elements as found in the knowledge base, instead of two semantic relations not explicitly present in the underlying semantic model. 10 Conclusion In this paper we have shown how genre and task structure provide two essential sources of control over the text generation process. Genre does so by constraining the selection of the task elements and the range of their expressions. These elements, which are the procedural representation of the user's tasks, constitute a layer of control which mediates between genre and text, but which, without genre, cannot control the grammar adequately.","The work presented here is informing the development of our text generator by specifying the necessary coverage of the French grammar to be implemented, the required discourse structures, and the mechanisms needed to control them. We continue to explore further situational and contextual factors which might allow a system to fully control its available linguistic resources."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Michael Barlow. 1994.
