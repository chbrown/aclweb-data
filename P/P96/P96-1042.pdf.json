This paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by sample selection. In this approach, during training the learning program examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling (annotation) only those that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly annotating examples that contribute little new information. This paper extends our previous work on committee-based sample selection for probabilistic classifiers. We describe a family of methods for committee-based sample selection, and report experimental results for the task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging. We find that all variants achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost, though their computational efficiency differs. In particular, the simplest method, which has no parameters to tune, gives excellent results. We also show that sample selection yields a significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger. 1 Introduction Many corpus-based methods for natural language processing (NLP) are based on supervised training-- acquiring information from a manually annotated corpus. Therefore, reducing annotation cost is an important research goal for statistical NLP. The ultimate reduction in annotation cost is achieved by unsupervised training methods, which do not require an annotated corpus at all (Kupiec, 1992; Merialdo, 1994; Elworthy, 1994). It has been shown, however, that some supervised training prior to the unsupervised phase is often beneficial. Indeed, fully unsupervised training may not be feasible for certain tasks. This paper investigates an approach for optimizing the supervised training (learning) phase, which reduces the annotation effort required to achieve a desired level of accuracy of the"]},{"title":"trained","paragraphs":["model.","In this paper, we investigate and extend the committee-based sample selection approach to minimizing training cost (Dagan and Engelson, 1995). When using sample selection, a learning program examines many unlabeled (not annotated) examples, selecting for labeling only those that are most informative for the learner at each stage of training (Seung, Opper, and Sompolinsky, 1992; Freund et al., 1993; Lewis and Gale, 1994; Cohn, Atlas, and Ladner, 1994). This avoids redundantly annotating many examples that contribute roughly the same information to the learner.","Our work focuses on sample selection for training probabilistic classifiers. In statistical NLP, probabilistic classifiers are often used to select a preferred analysis of the linguistic structure of a text (for example, its syntactic structure (Black et al., 1993), word categories (Church, 1988), or word senses (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993)). As a representative task for probabilistic classification in NLP, we experiment in this paper with sample selection for the popular and well-understood method of stochastic part-of-speech tagging using Hidden Markov Models.","We first review the basic approach of committee-based sample selection and its application to part-of-speech tagging. This basic approach gives rise to a family of algorithms (including the original algorithm described in (Dagan and Engelson, 1995)) which we then describe. First, we describe the 'simplest' committee-based selection algorithm, which has no parameters to tune. We then generalize the selection scheme, allowing more options to adapt and tune the approach for specific tasks. The paper compares the performance of several instantiations of the general scheme, including a batch selection method similar to that of Lewis and Gale (1994). In particular, we found that the simplest version of the method achieves a significant reduction in annotation cost, comparable to that of other versions."]},{"title":"319","paragraphs":["We also evaluate the computational efficiency of the different variants, and the number of unlabeled examples they consume.

Finally, to generate a random HMM given statistics S, we choose values independently for the parameters of each multinomial, since all the different multinomials in an HMM are independent. 4.2 Examples in bigram training Typically, concept learning problems are formulated such that there is a set of training examples that are independent of each other. When training a bigram model (indeed, any HMM), this is not true, as each word is dependent on that before it. This problem is solved by considering each sentence as an individual example. More generally, it is possible to break the text at any point where tagging is unambiguous. We thus use unambiguous words (those with only one possible part of speech) as example boundaries in bigram tagging. This allows us to train on smaller examples, focusing training more on the truly informative parts of the corpus. 5 Selection Algorithms Within the committee-based paradigm there exist different methods for selecting informative examples.

Two member selection seems to have a clear, though small, advantage.","In Figure 2 we investigate further the properties of batch selection. Figure 2(a) shows that accuracy increases with batch size only up to a point, and then starts to decrease. This result is in line with theoretical difficulties with batch selection (Freund et al., 1993) in that batch selection does not account for the distribution of input examples. Hence, once batch size increases past a point, the input distribution has too little influence on which examples are selected, and hence classification accuracy decreases. Furthermore, as batch size increases, computational efficiency, in terms of the number of examples examined to attain a given accuracy, decreases tremendously (Figure 2(5)).","The ability of committee-based selection to focus on the more informative parts of the training corpus is analyzed in Figure 3. Here we examined the number of lexical and bigram counts that were stored (i.e, were non-zero) during training, using the two member selection algorithm and complete training. As the graphs show, the sample selection method achieves the same accuracy as complete training with fewer lexical and bigram counts. This means that many counts in the data are less useful for correct tagging, as replacing them with smoothed estimates works just as well. 6 Committee-based selection ignores such counts, focusing on parameters which improve the model. This behavior has the practical advantage of reducing the size of the model significantly (by a factor of three here). Also, the average count is lower in a model constructed by selective training than in a fully trained model, suggesting that the selection method avoids using examples which increase the counts for already known parameters."]},{"title":"7 Discussion","paragraphs":["Why does committee-based sample selection work?

In this way, we implicitly model the distribution of model parameters used for classifying input examples.

We propose reducing this cost significantly using committee-","rThe use of a single model is also criticized in (Cohn, Atlas, and Ladner, 1994). based sample selection, which reduces redundant annotation of examples that contribute little new information. The method can be applied in a semiinteractive process, in which the system selects several new examples for annotation at a time and updates its statistics after receiving their labels from the user. The implicit modeling of uncertainty makes the selection system generally applicable and quite simple to implement.","Our experimental study of variants of the selection method suggests several practical conclusions. First, it was found that the simplest version of the committee-based method, using a two-member committee, yields reduction in annotation cost comparable to that of the multi-member committee. The two-member version is simpler to implement, has no parameters to tune and is computationally more efficient. Second, we generalized the selection scheme giving several alternatives for optimizing the method for a specific task. For bigram tagging, comparative evaluation of the different variants of the method showed similar large reductions in annotation cost, suggesting the robustness of the committee-based approach. Third, sequential selection, which implicitly models the expected utility of an example relative to the example distribution, worked in general better than batch selection. The latter was found to work well only for small batch sizes, where the method mimics sequential selection. Increas-ing batch size (approaching 'pure' batch selection) reduces both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we studied the effect of sample selection on the size of the trained model, showing a significant reduction in model size. 8.1 Further research Our results suggest applying committee-based sample selection to other statistical NLP tasks which rely on estimating probabilistic parameters from an annotated corpus. Statistical methods for these tasks typically assign a probability estimate, or some other statistical score, to each alternative analysis (a word sense, a category label, a parse tree, etc.), and then select the analysis with the highest score. The score is usually computed as a function of the estimates of several 'atomic' parameters, often binomials or multinomials, such as:","• In word sense disambiguation (Hearst, 1991; Gale, Church, and Varowsky, 1993):"]},{"title":"P(slf ),","paragraphs":["where s is a specific sense of the ambiguous word in question w, and f is a feature of occurrences of w. Common features are words in the context of w or morphological attributes of it.","• In prepositional-phrase (PP) attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993):"]},{"title":"P(alf),","paragraphs":["where a is a possible attachment, such as an attachment to a head verb or noun, and f is a feature, or a combination of features, of the attachment.

In such contexts, committee members might be generated by randomly varying some of the decisions made in the learning algorithm.","Another important area for future work is in developing sample selection methods which are independent of the eventual learning method to be applied. This would be of considerable advantage in developing selectively annotated corpora for general research use. Recent work on heterogeneous uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Catlett, 1994) supports this idea, using one type of model for example selection and a different type for classification. Acknowledgments.
