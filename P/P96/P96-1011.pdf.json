Generating all parses is inefficient and obscures whatever true semantic ambiguities are in the input. This paper addresses the problem for a fairly general form of Combinatory Categorial Grammar, by means of an efficient, correct, and easy to implement normal-form parsing technique. The parser is proved to find exactly one parse in each semantic equivalence class of allowable parses; that is, spurious ambiguity (as carefully defined) is shown to be both safely and completely eliminated. 1 Introduction Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 1990), like other \"flexible\" categorial grammars, suffers from spurious ambiguity (Wittenburg, 1986). The non-standard constituents that are so crucial to CCG's analyses in (1), and in its account of into-national focus (Prevost ~ Steedman, 1994), remain available even in simpler sentences.

In particular, it is proved in §4.2 that the method constructs exactly one syntactic structure per semantic reading--e.g., just two parses for (3). All other parses are suppressed by simple normal-form constraints that are enforced throughout the parsing process. This approach works because CCG's spurious ambiguities arise (as is shown) in only a small set of circumstances. Although similar work has been attempted in the past, with varying degrees of success (Karttunen, 1986; Wittenburg, 1986; Pareschi & Steedman, 1987; Bouma, 1989; Hepple & Morrill, 1989; KSnig, 1989; Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1990; Hepple, 1990; Moortgat, 1990; ttendriks, 1993; Niv, 1994), this appears to be the first full normal-form result for a categorial formalism having more than context-free power. 2 Definitions and Related Work CCG may be regarded as a generalization of context-free grammar (CFG)--one where a grammar has infinitely many nonterminals and phrase-structure rules. In addition to the familiar atomic nonterminal categories (typically S for sentences, N for","1Namely, Mary pretends to like the galoot in 168 parses and the corner in 84. One might try a statistical approach to ambiguity resolution, discarding the low-probability parses, but it is unclear how to model and train any probabilities when no single parse can be taken as the standard of correctness. 79 nouns, NP for noun phrases, etc.), CCG allows infinitely many slashed categories. If z and y are categories, then x/y (respectively z\\y) is the category of an incomplete x that is missing a y at its right (respectively left). Thus verb phrases are an-alyzed as subjectless sentences S\\NP, while \"John likes\" is an objectless sentence or S/NP. A complex category like ((S\\NP) \\ (S\\NP))/N may be written as S\\NP\\(S\\NP)/N, under a convention that slashes are left-associative.","The results herein apply to the TAG-equivalent CCG formalization given in (Joshi et M., 1991). 2 In this variety of CCG, every (non-lexical) phrase-structure rule is an instance of one of the following binary-rule templates (where n > 0): (4) Forward generalized composition >Bn:"]},{"title":";~/y y[nzn''\" [2Z211Zl -'+ ;~[nZn''\" ]2Z211Zl","paragraphs":["Backward generalized composition <Bn:"]},{"title":"yl.z...- 12z2 Ilzl x\\y x I.z.... 12z llzl","paragraphs":["Instances with n -- 0 are called application rules, and instances with n > 1 are called composition rules.

Each of ]1 through In would be instantiated as either / or \\.","A fixed CCG grammar need not include every phrase-structure rule matching these templates. In-deed, (Joshi et al., 1991) place certain restrictions on the rule set of a CCG grammar, including a requirement that the rule degree n is bounded over the set. The results of the present paper apply to such restricted grammars and also more generally, to any CCG-style grammar with a decidable rule set.","Even as restricted by (Joshi et al., 1991), CCGs have the \"mildly context-sensitive\" expressive power of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs). Most work on spurious ambiguity has focused on categorial for-malisms with substantially less power. (Hepple, 1990) and (Hendriks, 1993), the most rigorous pieces of work, each establish a normal form for the syntactic calculus of (Lambek, 1958), which is weakly context-free. (Kbnig, 1989; Moortgat, 1990) have also studied the Lambek calculus case. (Hepple & Morrill, 1989), who introduced the idea of normal-form parsing, consider only a small CCG fragment that lacks backward or order-changing composition; (Niv, 1994) extends this result but does not show completeness. (Wittenburg, 1987) assumes a CCG fragment lacking order-changing or higher-order composition; furthermore, his revision of the combinators creates new, conjoinable constituents that conventional CCG rejects. (Bouma, 1989) proposes to replace composition with a new combinator, but the resulting product-grammar scheme as-","2This formalization sweeps any type-raising into the lexicon, as has been proposed on linguistic grounds (Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1991, and others). It also treats conjunction lexically, by giving \"and\" the generalized category x\\x/x and barring it from composition. 80 signs different types to \"John likes\" and \"Mary pretends to like,\" thus losing the ability to conjoin such constituents or subcategorize for them as a class. (Pareschi & Steedman, 1987) do tackle the CCG case, but (Hepple, 1987) shows their algorithm to be incomplete. 3 Overview of the Parsing Strategy As is well known, general CFG parsing methods can be applied directly to CCG. Any sort of chart parser or non-deterministic shift-reduce parser will do. Such a parser repeatedly decides whether two adjacent constituents, such as S/NP and I~P/N, should be combined into a larger constituent such as S/N. The role of the grammar is to state which combinations are allowed. The key to efficiency, we will see, is for the parser to be less permissive than the grammar--for it to say \"no, redundant\" in some cases where the grammar says \"yes, grammatical.\"","(5) shows the constituents that untrammeled CCG will find in the course of parsing \"John likes Mary.\" The spurious ambiguity problem is not that the grammar allows (5c), but that the grammar allows both (5f) and (5g)--distinct parses of the same string, with the same meaning.","(5) a.

If we slightly constrain the use of the grammar rules, the parser will still produce (5c) and (5d)--constituents that are indispensable in contexts like (1)--while refusing to combine those constituents into (5f). The relevant rule S/I~P NP --* S will actually be blocked when it attempts to construct (5f). Although rule-blocking may eliminate an analysis of the sentence, as it does here, a semantically equivalent analysis such as (5g) will always be derivable along some other route.","In general, our goal is to discover exactly one analysis for each <substring, meaning> pair. By practicing \"birth control\" for each bottom-up generation of constituents in this way, we avoid a population explosion of parsing options. \"John likes Mary\" has only one reading semantically, so just one of its analyses (5f)-(5g) is discovered while parsing (6). Only that analysis, and not the other, is allowed to continue on and be built into the final parse of (6).","(6) that galoot in the corner that thinks [John likes Mary]s","For a chart parser, where each chart cell stores the analyses of some substring, this strategy says that all analyses in a cell are to be semantically distinct. (Karttunen, 1986) suggests enforcing that property directly--by comparing each new analysis semantically with existing analyses in the cell, and refusing to add it if redundant--but (Hepple & Morrill, 1989) observe briefly that this is inefficient for large charts. 3 The following sections show how to obtain effectively the same result without doing any semantic interpretation or comparison at all."]},{"title":"4 A Normal Form for \"Pure\" CCG","paragraphs":["It is convenient to begin with a special case. Suppose the CCG grammar includes not some but all instances of the binary rule templates in (4). (As always, a separate lexicon specifies the possible categories of each word.) If we group a sentence's parses into semantic equivalence classes, it always turns out that exactly one parse in each class satisfies the following simple declarative constraints:","(7) a. No constituent produced by >Bn, any n ~ 1, ever serves as the primary (left) argument to >Bn', any n' > 0.","b. No constituent produced by <Bn, any n > 1, ever serves as the primary (right) argument to <Bn', any n' > 0.","The notation here is from (4). More colloquially, (7) says that the output of rightward (leftward) composition may not compose or apply over anything to its right (left). A parse tree or subtree that satisfies (7) is said to be in normal form (NF).","As an example, consider the effect of these restrictions on the simple sentence \"John likes Mary.\" Ignoring the tags -OT, -FC, and -Be for the moment, (8a) is a normal-form parse.

But it is hardly obvious that (7) eliminates all of CCG's spurious ambiguity. One might worry about unexpected interactions involving crossing composition rules like A/B B\\C--~ A\\C.

The 24 templates schematized in (10) replace the two templates of (4). Any CFG-style method can still parse the resulting spuriosity-free grammar, with tagged parses as in (8).

First it shows, by a simple induction, that since c~ and ~' disagree they must disagree in at least one of these ways: (a) There are trees/?, 3' and rules R # R' such that","<R, fl, 7> is a subtree of a and <R',/3, 7> is a","subtree of a'.

Either condition, the proof shows, leads to different \"immediate scope\" relations in the full trees ~ and ~' (in the sense in which f takes immediate scope over 9 in f(g(x)) but not in f(h(g(x))) or g(f(z))). Condition (a) is straightforward. Condition (b) splits into a case where 7 serves as a secondary argument inside both cr and a', and a case where it is a primary argument in c~ or a'. The latter case requires consideration of 7's ancestors; the NF properties crucially rule out counterexamples here.","The notion of scope is relevant because semantic interpretations for CCG constituents can be written as restricted lambda terms, in such a way that constituents having distinct terms must have different interpretations in the model (for suitable interpretations of the words, as in §4.1). Theorem 2 is proved by showing that the terms for a and a' differ some-where, so correspond to different semantic recipes.","Similar theorems for the Lambek calculus were previously shown by (Hepple, 1990; ttendriks, 1993). The present proofs for CCG establish a result that has long been suspected: the spurious ambiguity problem is not actually very widespread in CCG. Theorem 2 says all cases of spurious ambiguity can be eliminated through the construction given in theorem 1. But that construction merely ensures a right-branching structure for \"forward constituent chains\" (such as h/B B/C C or h/B/C C/D D/E/F/G G/H), and a left-branching structure for backward constituent chains. So these familiar chains are the only source of spurious ambiguity in CCG. 5 Extending the Approach to \"Restricted\" CCG The \"pure\" CCG of §4 is a fiction. Real CCG grammars can and do choose a subset of the possible rules. For instance, to rule out (14), the (crossing) backward rule N/N ~I\\N ---* I~/N must be omitted from English grammar.

Theorem 2 remains true (< 1 NF per reading). Whether theorem 1 (>_ 1 NF per reading) remains true depends on what set of rules is removed. For most linguistically reasonable choices, the proof of theorem 1 will go through, 5 so that the normal-form parser of §4 remains safe. But imagine removing only the rule B/a C --~ B: this leaves the string A/B B/C C with a left-branching parse that has no (legal) NF equivalent.","In the sort of restricted grammar where theorem 1 does not obtain, can we still find one (possibly non-NF) parse per equivalence class? Yes: a different kind of efficient parser can be built for this case.","Since the new parser must be able to generate a non-NF parse when no equivalent NF parse is available, its method of controlling spurious ambiguity cannot be to enforce the constraints (7). The old parser refused to build non-NF constituents; the new parser will refuse to build constituents that are semantically equivalent to already-built constituents.","This idea originates with (Karttunen, 1986). However, we can take advantage of the core result of this paper, theorems 1 and 2, to do Karttunen's redundancy check in O(1) time--no worse than the normal-form parser's check for -FC and -Be tags. (Karttunen's version takes worst-case exponential time for each redundancy check: see footnote §3.)","The insight is that theorems 1 and 2 establish a one-to-one map between semantic equivalence classes and normal forms of the pure (unrestricted) CCG:","(15) Two parses a, ~' of the pure CCG are semantically equivalent iff they have the same normal form: gF(a) = gF(a'). The NF function is defined recursively by §4.2's proof of theorem 1; semantic equivalence is also defined independently of the grammar. So (15) is meaningful and true even if a, a' are produced by a restricted CCG. The tree NF(a) may not be a legal parse under the restricted grammar. How-ever, it is still a perfectly good data structure that can be maintained outside the parse chart, to serve","5For the proof to work, the rules S and T must be available in the restricted grammar, given that R and Q are. This is usually true: since (7) favors standard constituents and prefers application to composition, most grammars will not block the NF derivation while allow-ing a non-NF one. (On the other hand, the NF parse of A/B B/C C/D/E uses >B2 twice, while the non-NF parse gets by with >B2 and >B1.) as a magnet for a's semantic class. The proof of theorem 1 (see (13)) actually shows how to construct NF(a) in O(1) time from the values of NF on smaller constituents. Hence, an appropriate parser can compute and cache the NF of each parse in O(1) time as it is added to the chart. It can detect redundant parses by noting (via an O(1) array lookup) that their NFs have been previously computed.","Figure (1) gives an efficient CKY-style algorithm based on this insight. (Parsing strategies besides CKY would Mso work, in particular (Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1993).) The management of cached NFs in steps 9, 12, and especially 16 ensures that duplicate NFs never enter the oldNFs array: thus any alternative copy of a.nfhas the same array coordinates used for a.nfitself, because it was built from identical subtrees.","The function Pre:ferableTo(~, r) (step 15) provides flexibility about which parse represents its class. PreferableTo may be defined at whim to choose the parse discovered first, the more left-branching parse, or the parse with fewer non-standard constituents. Alternatively, PreferableTo may call an intonation or discourse module to pick the parse that better reflects the topic-focus division of the sentence. (A variant algorithm ignores PreferableTo and constructs one parse forest per reading. Each forest can later be unpacked into in-dividual equivalent parse trees, if desired.)","(Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1990) also give a method for removing \"one well-known source\" of spurious ambiguity from restricted CCGs; §4.2 above shows that this is in fact the only source. However, their method relies on the grammaticality of certain intermediate forms, and so can fail if the CCG rules can be arbitrarily restricted. In addition, their method is less efficient than the present one: it considers parses in pairs, not singly, and does not remove any parse until the entire parse forest has been built. 6 Extensions to the CCG Formalism In addition to the Bn (\"generalized composition\") rules given in §2, which give CCG power equivalent to TAG, rules based on the S (\"substitution\") and T (\"type-raising\") combinators can be linguistically useful. S provides another rule template, used in the analysis of parasitic gaps (Steedman, 1987; Szabolcsi, 1989): (16) a. >s: x/yllz yllz • Ilz / g b. <S: yllz x\\yIlz --* xIlz","Although S interacts with Bn to produce another source of spurious ambiguity, illustrated in (17), the additional ambiguity is not hard to remove.
