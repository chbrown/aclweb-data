Although this restriction is intuitive and linguistically wellmotivated, it does not provide a general theoretical framework for extra-semantic constraints.","In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Coloured Unification (HOCU, (cf. sections 3,6), a restricted form of HOU developed independently for theorem proving, provides the needed general framework. We start out by showing that the HOCU approach allows for a precise and intuitive modeling of DSP's Primary Occurrence Restriction (cf. section 3.1). We then show that the POR can be extended to capture linguistic restrictions on other phenomena (focus, second occurrence expressions and adverbial quantification) provided that the notion of primary occurrence is suitably adjusted (cf. section 4). Obviously a treatment of the interplay of these phenomena and their related notion of primary occurrence is only feasible given a precise and well-understood theoretical framework. We illustrate this by an example in section 4.4.

For the typed A-calculus, the problem is undecidable, but there is an algorithm which - given a solvable equation - will enumerate a complete set of solutions for this equation (Huet, 1975).","Note that in (1), unification yields a linguistically valid solution (ld) but also an invalid one: (le).

For instance, discourse (la) above is assigned the semantic representation (3a) and the equation (3b) with unique solution (3c).

(function) applications of the form MN and A-abstractions of the form Ax.M. Note that only variables without colours can be abstracted over. We call a formula M c-monochrome, if all symbols in M are bound or tagged with c.","We will need the so-called colour erasure IMI of M, i.e. the formula obtained from M by erasing all colour annotations in M. We will also use various elementary concepts of the A-calculus, such as free and bound occurrences of variables or substitutions without defining them explicitly here. In particular we assume that free variables are coloured in all formulae occuring. We will denote the substitution of a term N for all free occurrences of x in M with [N/x]M.","It is crucial for our system that colours annotate symbol occurrences (i.e. colours are not sorts!), in particular, it is intended that different occurrences of symbols carry different colours (e.g. f(xb, Xa)) and that symbols that carry different colours are treated differently. This observation leads to the notion of coloured substitutions, that takes the colour information of formulae into account. In contrast to traditional (uncoloured) substitutions, a coloured substitution a is a pair (at,at), where the term substitution a t maps coloured variables (i.e. the pair xc of a variable x and the colour c) to formulae of the appropriate type and the colour substitution a c maps colour variables to colours. In order to be legal (a g-substitution) such a mapping a must obey the following constraints:","• If a and b are different colours, then [a(xa)[ = [a(xb)[, i.e. the colour erasures have to be equal.","• If c E C is a colour constant, then a(x¢) is c-monochrome. The first condition ensures that the colour erasure of a C-substitution is a well-defined classical substitution of the simply typed A-calculus. The second condition formalizes the fact that free variables with constant colours stand for monochrome subformulae, whereas colour variables do not constrain the substitutions. This is exactly the trait, that we will exploit in our analysis.","1Colours axe indicated by subscripts labeling term occurrences; whenever colours axe irrelevant, we simply omit them.","Note that/37/-reduction in the coloured A-calculus is just the classical notion, since the bound variables do not carry colour information. Thus we have all the known theoretical results, such as the fact that/~/-reduction always terminates producing unique normal forms and that /3T/-equality can be tested by reducing to normal form and comparing for syntactic equality. This gives us a decidable test for validity of an equation.","In contrast to this, higher-order unification tests for satisfiability by finding a substitution a that makes a given equation M = N valid (a(M) =~ a(N)), even if the original equation is not (M ~Z, N). In the coloured A-calculus the space of (semantic) solutions is further constrained by requiring the solutions to be g-substitutions. Such a substitution is called a C-unifier of M and N. In particular, C-unification will only succeed if comparable formulae have unifiable colours. For instance, introa (Pa, jb, Xa) unifies with introa (Ya, jA, Sa) but not with introa (Pa, ja, sa) because of the colour clash on j.","It is well-known, that in first-order logic (and in certain related forms of feature structures) there is always a most general unifier for any equation that is solvable at all. This is not the case for higher-order (coloured) unification, where variables can range over functions, instead of only individuals. Fortunately, in our case we are not interested in general unification, but we can use the fact that our formulae belong to very restricted syntactic subclasses, for which much better results are known. In particular, the fact that free variables only occur on the left hand side of our equations reduces the problem of finding solutions to higher-order matching, of which decidability has been proven for the subclass of third-order formulae (Dowek, 1992) and is conjectured for the general case. This class, (intuitively allowing only nesting functions as arguments up to depth two) covers all of our examples in this paper. For a discussion of other subclasses of formulae, where higher-order unification is computation-ally feasible see (Prehofer, 1994)."]},{"title":"3","paragraphs":["Some of the equations in the examples have multiple most general solutions, and indeed this multiplicity corresponds to the possibility of multiple different interpretations of the focus constructions.

But isn't this restriction fairly idiosyncratic? In this section, we show that the restriction which was originally proposed by DSP to model VP-ellipsis, is in fact a very general constraint which far from being idiosyncratic, applies to many different phenomena. In particular, we show that it is necessary for an adequate analysis of focus, second occurrence expressions and adverbial quantification.","Furthermore, we will see that what counts as a primary occurrence differs from one phenomenon to the other (for instance, an occurrence directly associated with focus counts as primary w.r.t focus semantics but not w.r.t to VP-ellipsis interpretation). To account for these differences, some machinery is needed which turns DSP's intuitive idea into a fullyblown theory. Fortunately, the HOCU framework is just this: different colours can be used for different types of primary occurrences and likewise for different types of free variables. In what follows, we show how each phenomenon is dealt with. We then illustrate by an example how their interaction can be accounted for. 4.1 Focus Since (Jackendoff, 1972), it is commonly agreed that focus affects the semantics and pragmatics of utterances. Under this perspective, focus is taken to be the semantic value of a prosodically prominent element. Furthermore, focus is assumed to trigger the formation of an additional semantic value (henceforth, the Focus Semantic Value or FSV) which is in essence the set of propositions obtained by making a substitution in the focus position (cf. e.g. (Kratzer, 1991)). For instance, the FSV of (4a) 2 is (4b), the set of formulae of the form l(j,x) where x is of type e, and the pragmatic effect of focus is to presuppose that the denotation of this set is under considera-tion. (4) a. Jon likes SARAH","b. {l(j,x) l x e wife}","In (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996), we show that HOU can successfully be used to compute the FSV of an utterance.

For in-stance, given (4a) above, the required equation will be l(j, s) = Gd(s) with two possible values for Gd: Ax.l(j, x) and Ax.l(j, s). Given definition (4.1), (4a) is then assigned two FSVs namely (5) a. Gd= {l(j,x) l x e Wife} b. G'--d = {l(j,s) l x ~ Wife}","That is, the HOU treatment of focus overgenerates: (5a) is an appropriate FSV, but not (5b). Clearly though, the POR can be used to rule out (5b) if we assume that occurrences that are directly associated with a focus are primary occurrences. To capture the fact that those primary occurrences are different from DSP's primary occurrences when deal-ing with ellipsis, we colour occurrences that are directly associated with focus (rather than a source parallel element in the case of ellipsis) pf. Consequently, we require that the variable representing the FSV be -~pf coloured, that is, its value may not contain any pf term. Under these assumptions, the equation for (4a) will be (6a) which has for unique solution (6b). (6) a. l(j, Spf) = FSV~pf(Spf) b. FSV~pf = Ax.l(j, x) 4 4.2 Second Occurrence Expressions A second occurrence expression (SOE) is a partial or complete repetition of the preceding utterance and is characterised by a de-accenting of the repeating part (Bartels, 1995). For instance, (Tb) is an SOE whose repeating part only likes Mary is deaccented. (7) a. Jon only likes MARY.","b. No, PETER only likes Mary.","In (Gardent, 1996; Gardent et al., 1996) we show that SOEs are advantageously viewed as involving a deaccented anaphor whose semantic representation must unify with that of its antecedent. Formally, this is captured as follows. Let SSem and TSem be the semantic representation of the source and target clause respectively, and TP 1 ... TP n, SP 1 ... SP n be the target and source parallel elements 3, then the interpretation of an SOE must respect the following equations: An(Sp1,..., SP n) = SSem An(Tp1,..., TP '~) = TSem","Given this proposal and some further assumptions about the semantics of only, the analysis of (Tb) in-volves the following equations: (8) An(j)= VP[P e {)~x.like(x,y) l y • wife}","A P(j) ~ P = ~x.like(x, m)]","An(p) = VP[P • FSV A P(p)","--+ P = Ax.like(x, m)]","Resolution of the first equation then yields two solutions: An = )~zVP[P • {;kx.like(x,y) l Y • wife}","A P(z) ~ P = )~x.like(x, m)] An = AzVP[P • {)~x.like(x,y) l Y • wife}","A P(j) ~ P = )~x.like(x, m)]","Since An represents the semantic information shared by target and source clause, the second solution is clearly incorrect given that it contains information (j) that is specific to the source clause. Again, the POR will rule out the incorrect solutions, whereby contrary to the VP-ellipsis case, all occurrences that are directly associated with parallel elements (i.e. not just source parallel elements) are taken to be primary occurrences. The distinction is implemented by colouring all occurrences that are directly associated with parallel element ps, whereas the corresponding free variable (An) is coloured as --ps. Given these constraints, the first equation in (8) is reformulated as: An~ps(jps) = VP[P • {)~x.like(x,y) l Y • wife}","A P(Jps) --+ P = Ax.like(x, m)] with the unique well-coloured solution","An.,s = )~z.VP[P • {Ax.like(x,y) l y • wife} A P(z) --~ P = )~x.like(x, m)] 4.3 Adverbial quantification Finally, let us briefly examine some cases of adverbial quantification. Consider the following example from (von Fintel, 1995): Tom always takes SUE to Al's mother. Yes, and he always takes Sue to JO's mother.","In (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996), we suggest that such cases are SOEs, and thus can be treated as involving a deaccented anaphor (in this case, the anaphor he always takes Sue to _'s mother).

Consider the following discourse (9) a. Jon likes SARAH","b. Peter does too","Such a discourse presents us with a case of interaction between ellipsis and focus thereby raising the question of how DSP' POR for ellipsis should interact with our POR for focus.","As remarked in section 3.1, we have to interpret the colour -~pe as the concept of being not primary for ellipsis, which includes pf (primary for focus). In order to make this approach work formally, we have to extend the supply of colours by allowing boolean combinations of colour constants. The semantics of these ground colour formula is that of propositional logic, where -~d is taken to be equivalent to the disjunction of all other colour constants.","Consequently we have to generalize the second condition on C-substitutions","• For all colour annotations d of symbols in a(xc) d ~ c in propositional logic. Thus X.d can be instantiated with any coloured formula that does not contain the colour d.

That is, not only do colours allow us to correctly capture the interaction of the two PORs restricting the interpretation of ellipsis of focus, they also permit a natural modeling of focus projection (cf. (Jackendoff, 1972)). 5 Another constraint An additional argument in favour of a general theory of colours lies in the fact that constraints that are distinct from the POR need to be encoded to prevent HOU analyses from over-generating. In this section, we present one such constraint (the so-called weak-crossover constraint) and show how it can be implemented within the HOCU framework.","In essence, the main function of the POR is to ensure that some occurrence occuring in an equation appears as a bound variable in the term assigned by substitution to the free variable occurring in this equation. However, there are cases where the dual","4Note that this equation falls out of our formal system in that it is untyped and thus cannot be solved by the algorithm described in section 6 (as the solutions will show, we have to allow for FSV and F to have different types). However, it seems to be a routine exercise to augment HOU algorithms that can cope with type variables like (Hustadt, 1991; Dougherty, 1993) with the colour methods from (Hutter and Kohlhase, 1995). 6 constraint must be enforced: a term occurrence appearing in an equation must appear unchanged in the term assigned by substitution to the free variable occurring in this equation. The following example illustrates this.","(Chomsky, 1976) observes that focused NPs pattern with quantified and wh-NPs with respect to pronominal anaphora: when the quantified/wh/focused NP precedes and c-commands the pronoun, this pronoun yields an ambiguity between a co-referential and a bound-variable reading. This is illustrated in example (10) We only expected HIMi to claim","that he~ was brilliant","where the presence of the pronoun hei gives rise to two possible FSVs s FSV = {Ax.ex(x,y,i) l Y E wife} FSV = {Ax.ex(x,y,y) [ y E Wife} thus allowing two different readings: the corefential or strict reading VP[P E {Ax.ex(x,y,i) I Y E Wife}","A P(we) --+ P = Ax.ex(x, i, i)] and the bound-variable or sloppy reading. VP[P E {Ax.ex(x,y,y)) [ y E wife}","̂P(we) ~ P = Ax.ex(x, i, i))] In contrast, if the quantified/wh/focused NP does not precede and c-command the pronoun, as in (11) We only expected himi to claim","that HEi was brilliant there is no ambiguity and the pronoun can only give rise to a co-referential interpretation. For in-stance, given (11) only one reading arises VP[P E {Ax.ex(x,i,y) l Y E Wife}","A P(we) ~ P = Ax.ex(x, i, i)]","where the FSV is {Ax.ex(x,i,y) l Y E wife}.","To capture this data, Government and Binding analyses postulate first, that the antecedent is raised by quantifier raising and second, that pronouns that are c-commanded and preceded by their antecedent are represented either as a A-bound variable or as a constant whereas other pronouns can only be represented by a constant (cf. e.g. (Kratzer, 1991)'s binding principle). Using HOCU, we can model this restriction directly. As before, the focus term is pf-and the FSV variable -~pf-coloured. Furthermore, we assume that pronouns that are preceded and c-commanded by a quantified/wh/focused antecedent are variable coloured whereas other pronouns are -~pf-coloured. Finally, all other terms are taken to","5We abbreviate exp( x, cl(y, blt( i) ) ) to ex( x, y, i) to in-crease legibility. be --pf-coloured.

For a formal account including all details and proofs see (Hutter and Kohlhase, 1995).","Just as in the case of unification for first-order terms, the algorithm is a process of recursive decomposition and variable elimination that transform sets of equations into solved forms. Since C-substitutions have two parts, a term- and a colour part, we need two kinds (M =t N for term equations and c =c d for colour equations). Sets g of equations in solved form (i.e. where all equations are of the form x = M such that the variable x does not occur anywhere else in M or g) have a unique most general C-unifier a~ that also C-unifies the initial equation.","There are several rules that decompose the syntactic structure of formulae, we will only present two of them. The rule for abstractions transforms equations of the form )~x.A =t )~y.B to [c/x]A =t [c/y]B, and Ax.A =t B to [c/x]A =t Bc where c is a new constant, which may not appear in any solution. The rule for applications decomposes ha(s1,... ,s n) =t hb(tl,...,t '~) to the set {a =c b, sl =t tl,...,s,~ =t tn}, provided that h is a constant. Furthermore equations are kept in 13~/-normal form.","The variable elimination process for colour variables is very simple, it allows to transform a set g U {A =c d} of equations to [d/A]g U {A =c d}, making the equation {A =c d} solved in the result. For the formula case, elimination is not that simple, since we have to ensure that la(XA)l = la(xs)l to obtain a C-substitution a. Thus we cannot simply transform a set gU{Xd =t M} into [M/Xd]EU{Xd __t M}, since this would (incorrectly) solve the equations {Xc = fc,Xd = gd}. The correct variable elimination rule transforms $ U {Xd =t M} into a(g) U {Xd =1 M, xc, = M1,...,Xc~ =t Mn}, where ci are all colours of the variable x occurring in M and g, the M i are appropriately coloured variants (same colour erasure) of M, and a is the g-substitution that eliminates all occurrences of x from g.","Due to the presence of function variables, systematic application of these rules can terminate with equations of the form xc(sl,...,s n) =t hd(tl,...,tm). Such equations can neither be further decomposed, since this would loose unifiers (if G and F are variables, then Ga = Fb as a solution Ax.c for F and G, but {F = G,a = b} is unsolv-able), nor can the right hand side be substituted for x as in a variable elimination rule, since the types would clash. Let us consider the uncoloured equation x(a) ~t a which has the solutions (Az.a) and (Az.z) for x.","The standard solution for finding a complete set of solutions in this so-called flex/rigid situation is to substitute a term for x that will enable decomposition to be applicable afterwards.

In this paper, we have argued that Higher-Order Coloured Unification allows a precise specification of the interface between semantic interpretation and other sources of linguistic information, thus preventing over-generation. We have substantiated this claim by specifying the linguistic, extra-semantic constraints regulating the interpretation of VP-ellipsis, focus, SOEs, adverbial quantification and pronouns whose antecedent is a focused NP.","Other phenomena for which the HOCU approach seems particularly promising are phenomena in which the semantic interpretation process is obviously constrained by the other sources of linguistic information. In particular, it would be interesting to see whether coloured unification can appropriately model the complex interaction of constraints govern-ing the interpretation and acceptability of gapping on the one hand, and sloppy/strict ambiguity on the other.","Another interesting research direction would be the development and implementation of a monostratal grammar for anaphors whose interpretation are determined by coloured unification. Colours are tags which decorate a semantic representation thereby constraining the unification process; on the other hand, there are also the reflex of linguistic, non-semantic (e.g. syntactic or prosodic) information. A full grammar implementation would make this connection more precise. 8 Acknowledgements The work reported in this paper was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in Sonderforschungsbereich SFB-378, Project C2 (LISA)."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Christine Bartels. 1995.
