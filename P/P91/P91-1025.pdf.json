Therefore translation must sometimes be a matter of approximating the meaning of a source language text rather than finding an exact counterpart in the target language. We propose a translation framework based on Situation Theory. The basic ingredients are an information lattice, a representation scheme for utterances embedded in contexts, and a mismatch resolution scheme defined in terms of information flow. We motivate our approach with examples of translation between English and Japanese."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The focus of machine translation (MT) technology has been on the translation of sentence structures out of context. This is doomed to limited quality and generality since the grammars of un-like languages often require different kinds of contextual information. Translation between English and Japanese is a dramatic one. The definiteness and number information required in English grammar is mostly lacking in Japanese, whereas the honorificity and speaker's perspectivity information required in Japanese grammar is mostly lacking in English. There are fundamental discrepancies in the extent and types of information that the grammars of these languages choose to encode. An MT system needs to reason about the context of utterance. It should make adequate assumptions when the information required by the target language grammar is only implicit in the source language. It should recognize a particular discrepancy between the two grammars, and systematically react to the needs of the target language. We propose a general reasoning-based model for handling translation mismatches. Implicit information is assumed only when required by the target language grammar, and only when the source language text allows it in the given context. Translation is thus viewed as a chain of reactive reasoning *Linguistic Systems, Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. between the source and target languages. 1 An MT system under this view needs: (a) a uniform representation of the context and content of utterances in discourse across languages, (b) a set of well-defined reasoning processes within and across languages based on the above uniform representation, and (c) a general treatment of translation mismatches. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Situation Theory (Barwise and Perry 1983). First we will define the problem of translation mismatches, the key translation problem in our view. Second we will define the situated representation of an uttermace. Third we will define our treatment of translation mismatches as a flow of information (Barwise and Etchemendy 1990). At the end, we will discuss a translation example."]},{"title":"2 What is a translation mismatch?","paragraphs":["Consider a simple bilingual text: EXAMPLE I: BLOCKS (an AI problem) EWGLISH: Consider the blocks world wiCh three blocks, A, B, and C.

We thank him for stimulating our thinking. 193 glish, the fact that C is on top of A is expressed using the preposition on and verb is. In Japanese, the noun _1= (ue) alone can mean either \"on top of\" or \"above\", and there is no word meaning just \"on top of\". Thus the Japanese translation narrows the relationship to the one that is needed by bringing in the verb j~-~ 77 w ~ (notteirn) 'riding'. This phenomenon of the same information being attached to different morphological or syntactic forms in different languages is a well-recognized problem in translation. TRANSLATION DIVERGENCES 2 of this kind manifest themselves at a particular representation level. They can be handled by (i) STRUCTURE-TO-STRUCTURE TRANSFERS, e.g., structural transformations of Nagao (1987), the sublanguage approach of Kosaka et al (1988), or by (ii) TRANSFER VIA A \"DEEPER\" COMMON GROUND, e.g., the entity-level of Carbonell and Tomita (1987), the lexical-conceptual structure of Dorr (1990). A solution of these types is not general enough to handle divergences at all levels, how-ever. More general approaches to divergences allow (iii) MULTI-LEVEL MAPPINGS, i.e., direct transfer rules for mapping between different representation levels, e.g., structural correspondences of Kaplan et al. (1989), typed feature structure rewriting system of Zajac (1989), and abduction-based system of Hobbs and Kameyama (1990).","We want to call special attention to a less widely recognized problem, that of TRANSLATION MISMATCHES. They are found when the grammar of one language does not make a distinction required by the grammar of the other language. For instance, English noun phrases with COUNT type head nouns must specify information about definiteness and number (e.g. a town, the town, towns, and the towns are well-formed English noun phrases, but not town). Whereas in Japanese, neither definiteness nor number information is obligatory.

This information must be made explicit for each of these references in translating from Japanese into English whether or not it is decidable. It gets lost (at least on the surface) in the reverse direction. Two important consequences for translation follow from the existence of major mismatches between languages. First in translating a source language sentence, mismatches can force one to draw upon information not expressed in the sentence information only inferrable from its context at best. Secondly, mismatches may necessitate making information explicit which is only implicit in the source sentence or its context. For instance, the alterna-tion of viewpoint between user and system in the FTP example is implicit in the English text, detectable only from the definiteness of noun phrases like \"a/the user name\" and \"a password,\" but Japanese grammar requires an explicit choice of the user's viewpoint to use the reflexive pronoun zibsn. When we analyze what we called translation divergences above more closely, it becomes clear that divergences are instances of lexical mismatches. In the blocks example above, for instance, there is a mismatch between the spatial relations expressed with English on, which implies contact, and Japanese 194"]},{"title":"ue,","paragraphs":["which implies nothing about contact. It so happens that the verb \"notteiru\" can naturally resolve the mismatch within the sentence by adding the information \"on top of\". Divergences are thus lexical mismatches resolved within a sentence by coocurring lexemes. This is probably the preferred method of mismatch resolution, but it is not always possible. The mismatch problem is more dramatic when the linguistic resources of the target language offer no natural way to match up with the information content expressed in the source language, as in the above example of definiteness and number. This problem has not received adequate attention to our knowledge, and no general solutions have been proposed in the literature. Translation mismatches are thus a key translation problem that any MT system must face. What are the requirements for an MT system from this perspective? First, mismatches must be made recognizable. Second, the system must allow relevant information from the discourse context be drawn upon as needed. Third, it must allow implicit facts be made explicit as needed. Are there any system-atic ways to resolve mismatches at all levels? What are the relevant parameters in the \"context\"? How can we control contextual parameters in the translation process? Two crucial factors in an MT system are then REPRESENTATION and REASONING. We will first describe our representation. 3 Representing the translation content and context Translation should preserve the information content of the source text. This information has at least three major sources: Content, Context, Language. From the content, we obtain a piece of information about the relevant world. From the context, we obtain discourse-specific and utterance-specific information such as information about the speaker, the addressee, and what is salient for them. From the linguistic forms (i.e., the particular words and structures), through shared cooperative strategies as well as linguistic conventions, we get information about how the speaker intends the utterance to he interpreted.

Two additional factors bring us to the basis for a general translation framework. One is multi-linguality. The knowledge of any new language can be added to the given lattice by inserting new infons in appropriate places and adding more instances of the \"signifies\" relations. The other factor is grammatical and discourse-functional notions. Infons can be formed from any theoretical notions whether universal or language-specific, and placed in the same lattice.

A translation should preserve as far as practical the information carried by the source text or discourse.

This cross-referencing of parameters between types constitutes further support for combining all four situation types in a unified SUR. In order for the analysis and generation of an utterance to be associated with an SUIt, the grammar of a language should be a set of constraints on mappings among the values assigned to these parameters. 4 Translation as information flow","3 repeated here: Type the user name for your .... d , - ~ Translation must often be a matter of approxi-","accoun~ on ~ne remo~e system an press Lre~urnj ..........","It occurs in a type of DISCOURSE SITUATION where mating the meaning oI a source mnguage ~ex~ ramer","than finding an exact counterpart in the target lan- there has previously been mention of a remote sys-","tem and where a pattern has been established of","alternating the point of view between the addressee","and another agent (the local computer system).

See, e.g., Scha and Polanyi (1988) and Hobbs (1990) for discourse structure models. guage since languages differ in the concepts and real-world entities for which they have words and grammatical constructs. In the cases where no translation with exactly the same meaning exists, translators seek a target language text that accurately describes the same real world situations as the source language text. 12 The situation described by a text normally includes additional facts besides those the text explicitly states. Human readers or listeners recognize these additional facts by knowing about constraints that hold in the real world, and by getting collateral information about a situation from the context in which a description is given of it. For a translation to be a good approximation to a source text, its \"fleshed out\" set of facts--the facts its sentences explicitly state plus the additional facts that these entail by known real-world constraints--should be a maximal subset of the \"fleshed out\" source text facts. Finding a translation with the desired property can be simplified by considering not sets of facts (infons) but infon lattices ordered by involvement relations including known real-world constraints. If a given infon is a fact holding in some situation, all infons in such a lattice higher than the given one (i.e., all further infons it involves) must also be facts in the situation. Thus a good translation can be found by looking for the lowest infons in the lattice that the source text either explicitly or implicitly requires to hold in the described situation, and finding a target language text that either explicitly or implicitly requires the maximal number 12In some special cases, translation requires mapping between different hut equivalent real world situations, e.g., cars drive on different sides of the street in Japan and in the US. 197 of them to hold. 13 THE INFORMATION FLOW GRAPH. Translation can be viewed as a flow of information that results from the interaction between the grammatical constraints of the source language (SL) and those of the target language (TL). This process can be best modelled with information flow graphs (IFG) defined in Barwise and Etchemendy 1990. An IFG is a semantic formalization of valid reasoning, and is applicable to information that comes from a variety of sources, not only linguistic but also visual and other sensory input (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1990b). By modelling a treatment of translation mismatches with IFGs, we aim at a semantically correct definition that is open to various implementations. IFGs represent five basic principles of information flow: Given Information present in the initial assump-","tions, i.e., an initial \"open case.\" Assume Given some open case, assume something","extra, creating an open subcase of the given","case. Subsume Disregard some open case if it is sub-","sumed by other open cases, any situation that","supports the infons of the subsumed case sup-","ports those of one of the subsuming cases. Merge Take the information common to a number","of open cases, and call it a new open case. Recognize as Possible Given some open case, rec-","ognize it as representing a genuine possibility,","provided the information present holds in some","situation.","RESOLVING MISMATCHES. First~ a trans-","lation mismatch is recognized when the generation","of a TL string is impossible from a given set of in-","fons. More specifically, given a Situated Utterance Representation (SUIt), when no phrasal situations of TL support SUR because no string of TL signifies infon a in SUR, The TL grammar cannot generate a string from SUR, and there is a TRANSLATION MISMATCH on 0 r.","A translation mismatch on ~, above is resolved in","one of two directions: Mismatch Resolution by Specification: Assume a specific case r such that r =:~ and there is a Phrasal Situation of TL that supports v. A new open case SUR' is then generated, adding r to SUR. 13As more sophisticated translation is required, We could make use of the multiple situation types to give more importance to some aspects of translation than others depending on the purpose of the text (see Hauenschild (1988) for such translaion needs).","This is the case when the Japanese word ~ (e) is","translated into either painting or drawing in English.","The choice is constrained by what is known in the","given context. Mismatch Resolution by Generaliza-tion: Assume a general case r such that a =~ r and there is a Phrasal Situation of TL that supports r. A new open case SUR' is then generated, adding 7- to SUR. This is the case when the Japanese word ~ (e) is translated into picture in English, or English words ppainting and drawing are both translated into (e) in Japanese. That is, two different utterances in English, I like this painting and I like this drawing, would both be translated into ~J~l'~ ~ Otl~ff ~'~ (watasi wa kono e ga suki desn) in Japanese according to this scheme. Resolution by generalization is ordinarily less constrained than resolution by specification, even though it can lose information. It should be blocked, how-ever, when generalizing erases a key contrast from the content. For example, given an English utterance, I like Matisse's drawings better than paintings, the translation into Japanese should not generalize both drawings and paintings into ~ (e) since that would lose the point of this utterance completely. The mismatches must be resolved by specification in this case, resulting in, for instance, $J~1\"~'¢~\" 4 gO ~tt~e~A~ ]: 9 ~ ~t~ ~'t?'J\" ( watasi wa Matisse no abnrae ya snisaiga yorimo senbyou ga suki dest 0 'I like Matisse's line_drawings(P7) better than oil_paintings(P4) or water-colors(P5)'. There are IFGs for the two types of mismatch resolution. Using o for an open (unsubsumed) node and • for a subsumed node, we have the following: Mismatch Resolution by Specification: (given r :~ a) Given: o{a} Assume: ?{a}","/","6{¢, ~} Mismatch Resolution by Generalization: (given o\" :¢, ¢) Given: o{a} Assume: l{a} Subsume: l{a} 6{¢,¢} ~{q,T} Both resolution methods add more infons to the given SUR by ASSUMPTION, but there is a differ-ence. In resolution by specification, subsequent subsurnption does not always follow. That is, only by contradicting other given facts, can some or all of the newly assumed SUR's later be subsumed, and only by exhaustively generating all its subcases, the original SUR can be subsumed. In resolution by generalization, however, the newly assumed general case immediately subsumes the original SUR. 14 14Resolution by specification models a form of abductive inference, and generalization, a form of deductive inference 198 Source Language Target L~ngu@ge Discourse Situations DiS 1 ..

Our approach to translation combines SURs and IFGs (see Figure 4). Each SUR for a possible interpretation of the source utterance undergoes a FLOW OF TRANSLATION as follows: A set of infons is initially GIVEN in an SUR. It then grows by mismatch resolution processes that occur at multiple sites until a generation of a TL string is RECOGNIZED AS POSSIBLE. Each mismatch resolution involves AS-SUMING new SUR's and SUBSUMING inconsistent or superfluous SUR's. ~s Our focus here is the epistemologicai aspect of translation, but there is a heuristically desirable property as well. It is that the proposed mismatch resolution method uses only so much additional information as required to fill the particular distance between the given pair of linguistic systems. That is, the more similar two languages, leas computa-tion. This basic model should be combined with various control strategies such as default reasoning in a sltuation-theoretic context. One way to implement these methods is in the abduction-based system proposed by Hobbs and Kameyama (1990). ~SA possible use of MERGE in this application is that two different SUit's may be merged when an identical TL string would be generated from them.

In the initial SUR are infons for 9 -~-- b \":I ~ ~\""]},{"title":"(rimoofo sisutemu)","paragraphs":["'remote system', 7' ~"]},{"title":":I i. (akaunfo)","paragraphs":["'account', and :'---'~"]},{"title":"(yu~zaa","paragraphs":["mei) 'user name'. All of thesewords signify properties that are signified by English COUNT nouns but the Japanese SUR lacks definiteness and number information.","2. Generation of English from the SUR fails because, among other things, English grammar requires NPs with COUNT head nouns to be of the type, Sg-Def, Sg-Indef, PI-Def, or Pl-Indef. (translation mismatch)","3. This mismatch cannot be resolved by generalization. It is resolved by assuming four subcases for each nominal, and subsuming those that are inconsistent with other given information. The \"remote system\" is a singular entity in focus, so it is Sg-Def, and the other three subcases are subsumed. The \"user name\" is an entity in center, so Definite. The \"account\" is Definite despite its first mention because its possesser (addressee) is definite. Both \"user name\" and \"account\" can be either Singular or Plural at this point. Let's assume that a form of default reasoning comes into play here and concludes that a user has only one user name and one account name in each computer.","4. The remaining open case permits generation of English noun phrases, so the translation of this utterance is done.","OUTPUT STRING: \"Type the user name for your","account on the remote system and ...\" 6 Conclusions In order to achieve high-quality translation, we need a system that can reason about the context of utterances to solve the general problem of transla-199 tion mismatches. We have proposed a translation framework based on Situation Theory that has this desired property. The situated utterance representation of the source string embodies the contextual information required for adequate mismatch resolution. The translation process has been modelled as a flow of information that responds to the needs of the target language grammar. Reasoning across and beyond the linguistic levels, this approach to translation respects and adapts to differences between languages. 7 Future implications We plan to design our future implementation of an MT system in light of this work. Computational studies of distributive lattices constrained by multiple situation types are needed. Especially useful linguistic work would be on grammaticized contextual information. More studies of the nature of translation mismatches are also extremely desirable. The basic approach to translation proposed here can be combined with a variety of natural language processing frameworks, e.g., constraint logic, abduction, and connectionism. Translation systems for multi-modal communication and those of multiple languages are among natural extensions of the present approach. 8 Acknowledgements We would like to express our special thanks to Hidetoshi Sirai.
