Limitations of the Current Plan-Based Dialogue Understanding Model","paragraphs":["The current plan-based model of dialogue understanding [Litman and Allen, 1987] assumes a single plan library that contains the domain plans of the two speakers, and a shared plan stack mechanism to track the current plan structure of the dialogue. The shared stack contains the domain plans and the discourse plans from the plan library that are activated by the inference module of the dialogue understanding system. The domain plan is a joint plan shared by the two dialogue speakers.

Tracking the Currently Active Plan","paragraphs":["The Litman and Allen model lacks a mechanism to track which plan is the currently active plan in mixed-initiative dialogue where the two speakers have very different domain plan schemata in their individual plan libraries. The currently active plan is the plan or action that the dialogue processing system is currently considering. In Dialogue I, after utterance (2), What am I supposed to do?, by SpA, the stack should look like Figure 14. Although the manner in which the conference registration domain plans may be expanded on the stack depends upon which domain plan schemata are avail-able in a speaker's domain plan library, we assume that a rational agent would have a schema containing the plan to attend a conference, Attend-Conference. This plan is considered the currently active plan and thus marked [Next]. When processing the subsequent utterance, (3), First, you must register for the conference., the currently active plan should be understood as registration, RegS.zt:er, since SpB clearly states that the action 5 of registration is necessary to carry out the plan to attend the conference.

If this were a joint domain plan, SpA's utterance What am I supposed to do?, could not be explained. It can be inferred that SpA does not have a domain plan for at-tending a conference, or at least that the system did not activate it in the stack. The fact that SpA asks SpB What am I supposed to do? gives evidence that SpA and SpB do not share the Register domain plan at that point in the dialogue.","Another example of speaker planning that the Litman and Allen model cannot explain, occurs in Dialogue II. After a series of interactions between SpA and SpB, SpB says in utterance (3), Couldn't we leave in the morning ... instead of at night?, as an active response to SpA. In order to explain the speaker planning behind these utterances, the current model would include the schemata shown in Figure 36 . Utterance (3), however, does not stem from speaker action. One way to correct this situation within the current model would be to allow for the ad hoc addition of the schema,","6This is a simplified list of schemata, excluding prerequisite conditions and effects. Like the Litman and Allen model, our schema definition follows that of NOAH [Sacerdoti, 1977] and STRIPS [Fikes and Nilsson, 1971]. 27 State-Preference. The consequence, however, of this approach is that too large a number of schemata are required, and stored in the plan library, This large number of schemata will explode exponentially as the size of the domain increases."]},{"title":"2.3. Tracking Conversational Initiative Control","paragraphs":["A third problem in the Litman and Allen model is that it cannot track which speaker controls the conversational initiative at a specific point in the dialogue, nor how initiatives are nested within a dialogue segment, e.g., within a clarification subdialogue. This is self-evident since the model accounts only for single-initiative dialogues. Since the model calls for a joint plan, it does not track which of the two speakers maintains or initiates the transfer of the conversational initiative within the dialogue. Thus, that the conversational initiative is transferred from SpA to SpB at utterance (3) in Dialogue II, Couldn't we leave in the morning ... instead of at night?, or that SpA maintains the initiative during SpB's request for clarification about the weather, utterance (6), Really?, cannot be explained by the Litman and Allen model."]},{"title":"3.

These modifications include:","• Speaker-Specific Domain Plan Libraries and the Individual Placement of Speaker-Specific Plans on the Stack. • Incremental Domain Plan Expansion.","First, our model assumes a domain plan library for each speaker and the individual placement of the speaker-specific domain plans on the stack. Figure 4 shows how the stack is organized in our model. The domain plan, previously considered a joint plan, is separated into two domain plans, each representing a domain plan of a specific speaker. Each speaker can only be represented on the stack by his or her own domain plans. Progression from one domain plan to another can only be accomplished through the system's recognition of speaker utterances in the dialogue. Discourse Plan Domain Plans Domain Plans Speaker A Speaker B Figure 4: New Stack Structure","Second, our model includes an incremental expansion of domain plans. Dialogue speakers use domain plans stored in their individual plan library in response to the content of the previous speaker's utterance. The domain plans can be further expanded when they ac-Ovate additional domain plans in the plan library of the current speaker. For example, if a domain plan is marked [Next] (currently active), the system decomposes the plan into its component plan sequence. Then the first element in the component plan sequence (which is an action) is marked [Next] and the previous plan is no longer marked. Figure 5 illustrates how the domain plans in Dialogue I can be incrementally expanded. In Figure 5(a), Attend-Conference is the only plan activated, and it is marked [Next]. As the plan is expanded, [Next] is moved to the first action of the decomposition sequence (Figure 5(b)).

Explaining Speaker Planning Behind Utterances","paragraphs":["Second, our model explains a speaker's active planning behind an utterance. In the Litman and Allen model, SpA's utterance (2) in Dialogue I, What am I supposed to do ?, cannot be explained if the domain plan Attend-Conference is shared by the two speakers. In such a jointplan both speakers would know that a conference participant needs to register for a conference. However, the rational agent will not ask What am I supposed to do? if he or she already knows the details of the registration procedure. But, if such an expansion is not made on the stack, the system cannot process SpB's reply, First, you must register for the conference., because there would be no domain plan on the stack for Register. This dilemma cannot be solved with ajointplan. It, however, can be resolved by assuming individual domain plan libraries and an active domain plan for each speaker. As shown in Figure 6, when SpA asks What am I supposed to do?, the active domain plan is solely Attend-Conference, with no decomposition. SpB's domain plan, on the other hand, contains the full details of the conference registration procedure. This enables SpB to say First, you must register for the conference. It also enables SpB to ask Do you have a registration form?, because the action to ask whether SpA has a form or not (notHave) is already on the stack due to action decomposition.","Our model also explains speaker planning in Dialogue II.

Tracking Conversational Initiative Control Third, our model provides a consistent mechanism to track who controls the conversational initiative at any given utterance in the dialogue. This mechanism provides an explanation for the initiative control rules proposed by [Walker and Whittaker, 1990], within the plan-based model of dialogue understanding. Our data allow us to state the following rule:","• When Sp-X makes an utterance that instantiates a discourse plan based on his or her domain plan, then Sp-X controls the conversational initiative. This rule also holds in the nesting of initiatives, such as in a clarification dialogue segment:","• When Sp-X makes an utterance that instantiates a discourse plan based on his or her domain plans and Sp-Y replies with an utterance that instantiates a discourse plan, then Sp-X maintains control of the conversational initiative.","In Dialogue II, illustrated in Figure 8, SpB's question, utterance (3), Couldn't we leave in the morning ... instead of at night?, instantiates discourse Plan 5. It stems from SpB's domain plan State-Depart-Preference.

Their interaction, communica-tion, and dialogue plans operate at a level above our speaker-specific domain plans. Their plans serve as a type of meta-planning to their and our domain plans. An extension enabling their plan hierarchy to operate orthogonally to our model would be possible.","Our model is consistent with the initiative control rules presented in [Walker and Whittaker, 1990]. In their control rules scheme, however, the speaker controis the initiative when the dialogue utterance type (surface structure analysis) is an assertion (unless the utterance is a response to a question), a command, or a question (unless the utterance is a response to a question or command). In our model, the conversational initiative control is explained by the speaker's planning. In our model, control is transferred from the INITIATING CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (ICP) tO the OTHER CONVERSATIONAL PARTICIPANT (OCP) when the utterance by the OCP is made based on the OCP's domain plan, not as a reply tO the utterance made by the ICP based on the ICP's domain plan. Cases where no initiative control transfer takes place despite the utterance type (assertion, command or question) substantiate that these utterances are (1) an assertion which is a response by the ICP through rD-PARAM tO answer a question, and (2) a question to clarify the command or question uttered by the ICP, and which includes a question functioning as a clarification discourse plan. Our model provides an explanation for the initiative control rules proposed by [Walker and Whittaker, 1990] within the framework of the plan-based model of dialogue understanding.
