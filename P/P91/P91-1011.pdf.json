We suggest a new calculus which, though 'designed' in relation to categorial interpretatious of some notions of dependency grammar, seems to provide a degree of flexibility that is highly appropriate for incremental interpretation. We demonstrate how this grammar may be used for efficient incremental parsing, by employing normalisation techniques. Introduction A range of categorial grammars (CGs) have been proposed which allow considerable flexibility in the assignment of syntactic structure, a characteristic which provides for categorial treatments of extrac-tion (Ades & Steedman, 1982) and non-constituent coordination (Steedman, 1985; Dowty, 1988), and that is claimed to allow for incremental processing of natural language (Steedman, 1989). It is this latter possibility that is the focus of this paper.","Such 'flexible' CGs (FCGs) typically allow that grammatical sentences may be given (amongst others) analyses which are either fully or primarily left-branching. These analyses have the property of designating many of the initial substrings of sentences as interpretable constituents, providing for a style of processing in which the interpretation of a sentence is generated 'on-line' as the sentence is presented. It has been argued that incremental interpretation may provide for efficient language processing -- by both humans and machines -- in allowing early filtering of thematically or referentially implausible readings. The view that human sentence processing is 'incremental' is supported by both introspective and experimental evidence.","In this paper, we discuss FCG approaches and some problems that arise for using them as a basis for incremental processing. Then, we propose a grammar that avoids these problems, and demonstrate how it may be used for efficient incremental processing.

Firstly, a categorial functor specifies an ordering over its 'dependents' (function-argument order, that is, rather than constituent order) where no such ordering is identified by a DG head. Secondly, the arguments of a categorial functor are necessarily phrasal, whereas by the standard view in DG, the dependents of a head are taken to be words (which may themselves be heads of other head/dependent complexes). Thirdly, categorial functors may specify arguments which have complex types, which, by the analogy, might be described as a head being able to make stipulations about the dependency requirements of its dependent and also to 'absorb' those dependency requirements. 5 For example, a type x/(y\\z) seeks an argument which is a \"y needing a dependent z\" under the head/functor analogy. On combining with such a type, the requirement \"need a dependent z\" is gone. Contrast this with the use of, say, composition (i.e. x/y, y/z =~ x/z), where a type x/y simply needs a dependent y, and where composition allows the functor to combine with its dependent y while the latter still requires a dependent z, and where that requirement is inherited onto the result of the combination and can be satisfied later on.","Barry & Pickering (B&P, 1990) explore the view of dependency that arises in CG when the functor-argument relationship is taken as analogous to the traditional head-dependent relationship.

The 'dependency requirements' stated by any lexical type will constitute the sum of the 'thematically contentful' relationships into which it may enter. In allowing all DP combinations (subject to the limit of preserving linear order requirements), the DC ensures that lexieally 82 originating dependency structure is both preserved and also exploited in full. Consequently, the DC is well suited to incremental processing. Note, however, that there is some extent of divergence between the DC and the (admittedly vague) criterion of 'contentful' combination defined earlier. Consider the LC-valid combination in (15), which is not admitted by the DC. This combination would appear to be 'contentful' since no hypothetical semantic functor intervenes between land g (although g has undergone a change in its relationship to its own argument which depends on such a hypothetical functor).

Firstly, the search space to be addressed in checking for possible combinations of two types is considerably greater than for CCG or MCG. Also, the DC will suffer spurious ambiguity in a fashion directly comparable to CCG and MCG (obviously, for the latter case, since the above MCG is a subsystem of the DC). For example, the combination x/y, y/z, z ::~ x has both left and right branching derivations.","However, a further equivalence problem arises due to the interderivability of types under the unary subsystem U. For any unary transformation x :=~ y, the converse y :~ x is always possible, and the semantics of these transformations are always inverses. (This obviously holds for a, and can be shown to hold for more complex transformations by a simple induction.)

Our solution to this problem involves specifying normal forms (NFs) for terms -- to act as privileged members of their equivalence class -- at three different levels of the system: (i) types, (ii) binary combinations, (iii) proofs. The resulting system allows for efficient categorial parsing which is incremental up to the limit allowed by the DC.","A standard way of specifying NFs is based on the method of reduction, and involves defining a contraction relation (I>1) between terms, which is stated as a number of contraction rules of the form X !>1 Y (where X is termed a redez and Y its contractum). Each contraction rule allows that a term containing a redex may be transformed into a term where that occurrence is replaced by its contractum. A term is said to be in NF if and only if it contains no redexes. The contraction relation generates a reduction relation (1>) such that X reduces to Y (X I> Y) iff Y is obtained from X by a finite series (possibly zero) of contractions. A term Y is a NF of X iff Y is a NF and X 1> Y. The contraction relation also generates an equivalence relation which is such that X = Y iff Y can be obtained from X by a sequence of zero or more steps, each of which is either a contraction or reverse contraction.","Interderivability of types under U can be seen as giving a notion of equivalence for types. The contraction rule (17) defines a NF for types. Since contraction rules apply to any redex subformula occurring within some overall term, this rule's do-main of application is as broad as that of the associativity axioms in the unary calculus given the generalising effects of the unary metarules. Hence, the notion of equivalence generated by rule (16) is the same as that defined by interderivability under U. It is straightforward to show that the reduction relation defined by (16) exhibits two important properties: (i) strong normalisation 1°, with the 1°To prove strong normalisation it is sufficient to give a metric which assigns each term a finite non-negative integer score, and under which every contraction reduces the score for a term by a positive integer amount.

Knowing this, we can easily sketch out the schematic form of the three element combinations corresponding to (29c,d,g) which have equivalent left and right branching proofs, as shown in Figure 1.","We can define a NF for proofs under B I (that use only NF combinations) by stating three contraction rules, one for each of the three cases in Figure 1, where each rule rewrites the right branching three-leaf subproof as the equivalent left branching subproof. This will identify the optimally left branching member of each equivalence class of proofs as its NF exemplar. Again, it is easily shown that reduction under these rules exhibits strong normalisation and the Church-Rosser property, so that every proof must have a unique normal form. However, it is not so easy to prove the stronger claim that there is only a single NF proof that assigns each distinct reading for any combination. 13 We shall not attempt 12Note that various other conceivable patterns of dependency do not need to be considered here since they do not correspond to any Lambek-valid combination. ~3 Thls holds if the contraction relation generates an equiv-to demonstrate this property, although we believe that it holds. We can identify the redexes of these three contraction rules purely in terms of the rules used to combine types, i.e. without needing to examine the schematic form of the types, since the rules themselves identify the relevant structure of the types. In fact, the right-branching subproofs for cases (29c,g) collapse to the single schematic redex (32), and that for (29d) simplifies to the schematic redex (33).

In seeking combinations of some sequence of types, we first begin by transforming the types into their NFs. 14 Then, we can search for proofs using only the NF binary combinations. Any proof that is found to contain a proof redexes is discontinued, so that only NF proofs are returned, avoiding the problems of spurious ambiguity. Any result types assigned by such proofs stand as NF exemplars for the set of non-NF types that could be derived from the original input types under the DC. We may want to know if some input types can combine to give a specific result type x. This will be the case if the parser returns the NF of x.","Regarding incremental processing, we have seen that the DC is well-suited to this task in terms of allowing combinations that may usefully contribute to a knowledge of the semantic relations amongst the phrases combined, and that the NF proofs we have defined (and which the parser will construct) are optimally left-branching to the limit set by the calculus. Hence, in left-to-right analysis of sentences, the parser will be able to combine the presented material to the maximal extent that doing so usefully contributes to incremental interpretation and the filtering of semantically implausible analyses. alence relation that equates any two proofs iff these assign extenslonally equivalent readings. 14The complexity of this transformation is constant in the complexity of the type. 85 C~."]},{"title":"(2s~): (a) x/y y/wa..w.
