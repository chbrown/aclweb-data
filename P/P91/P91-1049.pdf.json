In a recent study, Georgia Green (personal communication) estimated that 17% to 20% of the content word senses encountered in various types of normal English text are not fisted in the dictionary. While these novel word senses are generally valid, they occur in such great numbers, and with such little individual frequency that it is impractical to explicity include them all within the lexicon. Instead, mechanisms are needed which can derive novel senses from existing ones; thus allowing a program to recognize a significant set of potential word senses while keeping its lexicon within a reasonable size.","Spreading activation is a mechanism that allows us to do this. Here the program follows paths from existing word senses stored in a semantic network to other closely associated word senses. By examining the shape of the resultant path, we can determine the relationship between the senses con- ~ned in the path; thus deriving novel composite meanings not contained within any of the original lexical entries. This process is similar to the spreading activation and marker passing techniques of Hirst [1988], Charniak [1986], and Norvig [1989] and is embodied in the Prolog program metallel based on Fass' program meta5 (Fass [1988]).","Metallel's lexicon is written as a series of sense frames, each containing information about a particular word sense. A sense frame can he broken into two main parts: genera and differentiae. Genera are the genus terms that function as the ancestors of a word sense. Differentiae denote the qualities that distinguish a particular sense from other senses of the same genus. Differentiae can be broken down into source and target which hold, respectively, the preferences t and properties of a sense. Source con- =dns differentiae mform~on concen~g another word sense. Target infocma~on concerns the sense itself.","Connections can be found to other word senses in one of two ways: through an ancestor relationship (genus) er through a preference or property relationship (differentia). In the case of differentiae, it is necessary to extract the word senses from a higher order structure. For example, [it (n, z), contain (v, l), n~asic (n, Z) ] is not a word sens¢ ~at is LL~ted in the lexicon, while ~asic (n, i) is Us~L It is therefore necessary to ex~act rausic (n,Z) from the larger dfffereada s~ucmre which it occurs and add it to the path.","Not all paths are valid, indicating that some criteria of acceptability are needed during analysis. In addition, paths that are superficially different often end up being quite similar upon further analysis. Keeping this in mind, we have attempted to identify path schemata and associate them wkh types of non-literal usage. Specifically, we have concentrated on identifying instances of metaphor and metonymy.","A metaphorical path schema is one in which the preference of a verb and the actual target of the preference both reference different 3 place differentiae 2 which can be said to be related.
