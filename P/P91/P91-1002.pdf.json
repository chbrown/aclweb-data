Our inheritance networks are constructed from only the most rudimentary primitives: basic concepts and ISA and ISNOTA links. By applying general algebraic techniques, we show how to generate a meet semilattice whose nodes correspond to consistent conjunctions of basic concepts and where meet corresponds to conjunction. We also show how to embed this result in a distributive lattice where the elements correspond to arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions of basic concepts and where meet and join correspond to conjunction and disjunction, respectively. While we do not consider either role- or attribute-based reasoning in this paper, our constructions are directly applicable as a front-end for the combined attribute-and concept-based formalisms of Ait-Kaci (1986), Nebel and Smolka (1989), Carpenter (1990), Carpenter, Pollard and Franz (1991) and Pollard (in press).","The fact that terms in distributive lattices have disjunctive normal forms allows us to factor our construction into two stages: we begin with the consistent conjunctive concepts generated from our primitive concepts and then form arbitrary disjunctions of these conjunctions. The conjunctive construction is useful on its own as its result is a semilattice where meet corresponds to conjunction. In particular, the conjunctive semilattice is ideally suited to conjunctive logics such as those employed for unification, as in HPSG.","We will consider the distinction between primitive and defined concepts, a well-known distinction expressible in terminological reasoning systems such as KL-ONE (Brachman 1979, Brachman and Schmolze 1985), and its descendants (such as LOOM (MacGregor\" 1988) or CLASSIC (Borgida et"]},{"title":"al.","paragraphs":["1989)).

One result of our construction will be a demonstration that the systemic classification and ttPSG systems are variant graphical representations of the same kind of underlying information regarding inclusion, disjointness and choice."]},{"title":"Inheritance Networks","paragraphs":["Our inheritance networks are particularly simple, being constructed from basic concepts and two kinds of \"inheritance\" links.

Our primary interest is in the logical relationships between concepts rather than in the actual extensions of the concepts themselves.

Our characterization of the concepts expressible in a systemic net instead relies on the translation of systemic notation into an inheritance network with IsAand ISNOTA links. The resulting conjunctive concepts correspond to the concepts that can be expressed in the systemic net. An example of a systemic choice network in the notation of Mellish (1988), is Figure 4. The connective I, of which there are three in the diagram, signals disjoint alternatives; for instance, the connective for gender is taken to indicate that a gender must be exactly one of masculine, feminine or neuter. The connective }, of which there is one before gender, indicates necessary preconditions for a choice; in this case, a gender is only chosen if the number is singular and the person is third. Finally, the connective {, of which there is one labeled agr, indicates that a choice for an agreement value requires a choice for both number and person.","We construct an inheritance hierarchy from a systemic network by taking a basic primitive concept for every choice in the network. The choices in Figure 4 are those items in bold face; the italicized items simply label connectives and are only for convenience (alternatively, we could take the italicized elements to be defined basic concepts). The ISNOTA relation between basic concepts is defined so that P ISNOTA Q if P and Q are connected by the choice connective I. For example, we have 3rd ISNOTA 1st and msc ISNOTA neu. Finally, the ISA relation is defined so that if P is one of the choices for a connective which has a precondition P~ attached to it, then we include P ISA P~.

Each partition may also have dependencies which must be fulfilled for the choice to be made; in our case, before an element of the gender partition is chosen, singular must be chosen for number and third for person. These dependencies generate our basic IsA relation. For instance, we must have plu ISA agr and fern ISA sng.

In the hierarchy in Figure 6, it is most natural to consider the basic concept agr to be defined rather than primitive; it could simply be eliminated with the same effect.

In this case, we can add more specific concepts to a disjunctive concept 79 without affecting its information content.

Note that the upper-closed sets of a partial ordering form a distributive lattice when ordered by inclusion, since it is a sub-lattice of a powerset lattice. Proposition 6 The structure (DisjConc, C) is a distributive lattice. Unions (joins) represent disjunctions in in DisjConc. Likewise, intersections (meets) represent conjunctions. Furthermore, the function ¢ that maps a conjunctive concept P to the disjunctive concept ¢(P) = {P' I P' _D P} is an embedding of ConjConc into DisjConc that preserves existing meets, so that ¢(P n P') = ¢(P) n ¢(P'). Note that this embedding coincides with the standard embedding of a domain into its upper (Smyth) powerdomain (Gunter and Scott in press), with the only difference being that we have reversed the orders of both domains (with the in-formationally more specific elements toward the bottom), as is conventional in inheritance networks.","More than 30 disjunctive concepts result from the conjunctive concepts in Figure 3, so we will not provide a graphic display of the results of the disjunctive construction applied to a realistic example (for examples of the general construction, see Davey and Priestley 1990)."]},{"title":"Closed World Reasoning","paragraphs":["In HPSG, Pollard and Sag (1987) partition the concept sign into two sub-concepts, phrase and 14 word. This arrangement generates the conjunctive concepts {sign}, {phrase} and {word}. Applying the disjunctive construction to this result, though, gives us a disjunctive concept {{word}, {phrase}} which is strictly more informative than {{sign}}. This distinction demonstrates the open-world nature of our construction; it allows for the possibility of signs which are neither words nor phrases. This form of open-world reasoning is the standard in terminological reasoning systems such as KL-ONE or CLASSIC, though LOOM provides a notion of disjoint-covering which provides the kind of closed-world reasoning we require.","In dealing with linguistic grammars, on the other hand, we clearly wish to exclude any expression from signhood that is neither a phrase nor a word; these choices are meant to be exhaustive in a grammar. The fact that signs can be either words or phrases is explicit; what we need is a way to say that nothing else can be a sign.","In general, we require a set ClosConc C BasConc of closed concepts to be specified. When constructing the disjunctive concepts, we identify a closed concept with the disjunction of its immediate subconcepts. In particular, we can replace every occurence of a closed concept with the disjunction of its immediate subconcepts, so that {P} and {P' [ P' IsA P} are identified. Closed concepts are treated dually to defined concepts; a defined concept is taken to be the conjunction of its immediate superconcepts, while a closed concept is identified with the disjunction of its immediate subconcepts. The simplest way to achieve this effect is to generate the disjunctive concepts from the subset of conjunctive concepts which contain at least one subconcept of every closed concept which they contain. This leads to the following restriction:","(2) 79 E OisjConc only if for every P E 79 and P E P f3 ClosConc there is some P~ E P such that P~ ISA P Thus if sign E ClosConc, we would only consider the conjunctive concepts {phrase} and {word}; the concept {sign} contains a closed concept sign, but none of its subconcepts. Consequently, the set {{sign}} is no longer a disjunctive concept, while {{phrase}, {word}} would be allowed (assuming for this example that phrase and word are not themselves closed).","In grammar development, it will often be the case that all but the maximally specific concepts are closed. In this case, the disjunctive construction will produce the boolean algebra with maximally specific conjunctive concepts as atoms. Such maximally specific conjunctive concepts were simply taken as primitive by King (1989), who generated a boolean algebra of types corresponding to disjunctions of maximal concepts."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Bob Kasper for invaluable suggestions."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A'/t-Kaci, Bassan (1986).
