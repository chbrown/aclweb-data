This work suggests that a distributional approach can be effective in resolving parsing problems that apparently call for complex reasoning."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["Prepositional phrase attachment is the canonical case of structural ambiguity, as in the time worn example, (1) I saw the man with the telescope","The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for understanding and for language models. It looks like it might require extremely complex computation to determine what attaches to what. In-deed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text must be reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988). Of course, if attachment ambiguity demands reference to semantics and discourse models, there is little hope in the near term of building computational models for unrestricted text to resolve the ambiguity."]},{"title":"Structure based ambiguity resolution","paragraphs":["There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains. The two main ones are:","• Right Association - a constituent tends to attach to another constituent immediately to its right (Kimball 1973).","• Minimal Attachment - a constituent tends to attach so as to involve the fewest additional syntactic nodes (Frazier 1978).","For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb + object context as in sentence (1), these two principles - at least in the version of syntax that Frazier assumes - make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.","Psycholinguistic work on structure-based strategies is primarily concerned with modeling the time course of parsing and disambiguation, and proponents of this approach explicitly acknowledge that other information enters into determining a final parse. Still, one can ask what information is relevant to determining a final parse, and it seems that in this domain structure-based disambiguation is not a very good predictor. A recent study of attachment of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a \"Wizard of Oz\" travel information experiment shows that neither Right Association nor Minimal Attachment account for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore et al. 1990). And experiments by Taraban and McClelland (1988) show that the structural models are not in fact good predictors of people's behavior in resolving ambiguity."]},{"title":"Resolving ambiguity through lexical associations","paragraphs":["Whittemore et al. (1990) found lexical preferences to be the key to resolving attachment ambiguity. Similarly, Taraban and McClelland found lexical content was key in explaining people's behavior. Various previous proposals for guiding attachment disambiguation by the lexical content of specific 229 words have appeared (e.g. Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; Marcus 1980). Unfortunately, it is not clear where the necessary information about lexical preferences is to be found. In the Whittemore et al. study, the judgement of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for exactly the cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was available. Thus, we are posed with the problem: how can we get a good list of lexical preferences.","Our proposal is to use cooccurrence of with prepositions in text as an indicator of lexical preference. Thus, for example, the preposition to occurs frequently in the context send NP --, i.e., after the object of the verb send, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to. Similarly, from occurs frequently in the context withdrawal --, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the noun withdrawal with the preposition from. Of course, this kind of association is, unlike lexical selection, a symmetric notion. Cooccurrence provides no indication of whether the verb is selecting the preposition or vice versa. We will treat the association as a property of the pair of words. It is a separate matter, which we unfortunately cannot pursue here, to assign the association to a particular linguistic licensing relation. The suggestion which we want to explore is that the association revealed by textual distribution -","whether its source is a complementation relation, a modification relation, or something else - gives us information needed to resolve the prepositional attachment."]},{"title":"Discovering Lexical Associa- tion in Text","paragraphs":["A 13 million word sample of Associated Press new stories from 1989 were automatically parsed by the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983), using Church's part of speech analyzer as a preprocessor (Church 1988).

For each noun phrase head, we recorded the following preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or","not the parser attached the preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the object of that verb. Thus, we generated a table with entries including those shown in Table 1.","In Table 1, example (a) represents a passivized instance of the verb blame followed by the prepo-VERB blame control enrage spare grant determine HEAD NOUN PASSIVE money development government military accord radical WHPRO it concession flaw Table h A sample of the Verb-Noun-Preposition table. sition"]},{"title":"for.","paragraphs":["Example (b) is an instance of a noun phrase whose head is money; this noun phrase is not an object of any verb, but is followed by the preposition for.

There are three potential sources of noise in the model. First, the parser in some cases gives us false analyses. Second, when a preposition follows a noun phrase (or verb), it may or may not be structurally related to that noun phrase (or verb). (In our terms, it may attach to that noun phrase or it may attach some-where else). And finally, even if we get accu-rate attachment information, it may be that fre-230 quency of cooccurrence is not a good indication of strength of attachment. We will proceed to build the model of lexical association strength, aware of these sources of noise.","We want to use the verb-noun-preposition table to derive a table of bigrams, where the first term is a noun or verb, and the second term is an associated preposition (or no preposition). To do this we need to try to assign each preposition that occurs either to the noun or to the verb that it occurs with. In some cases it is fairly certain that the preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, it is far less certain. Our approach is to assign the clear cases first, then to use these to decide the unclear cases that can be decided, and finally to arbitrarily assign the remaining cases. The procedure for assigning prepositions in our sample to noun or verb is as follows:","1. No Preposition - if there is no preposition, the noun or verb is simply counted with the null preposition.

From the AP new stories, we randomly selected 1000 test sentences in which the parser identified an ambiguous verb-noun-preposition triple. (These sentences were selected from stories included in the 13 million word sample, but the particular sentences were excluded from the calculation of lexical associations.) For every such triple, each author made a judgement of the correct attachment on the basis of the three words alone (forced choice - preposition attaches to noun or verb). This task is in essence the one that we will give the computer - i.e., to judge the attachment without any more information than the preposition and the head of the two possible attachment sites, the noun and the verb. This gave us two sets of judgements to compare the algorithm's performance to.","a V is the number of distinct preposition contexts for either soldier/N or send/V; in this c~se V = 70.

To derive this standard, we to-gether judged the attachment for the 1000 triples a second time, this time using the full sentence context.","It turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task to assign attachment preferences for the test sample. Of course, many decisions were straightforward; sometimes it is clear that a prepositional phrase is and argument of a noun or verb.

The ambiguity in (9) arises from the fact that if someone is one of the joint agents in the signing of an agreement, that person is likely to be a party to the agreement. In general, we call an attachment systematically ambiguous when, given our understanding of the semantics, situations which 232 make the interpretation of one of the attachments true always (or at least usually) also validate the interpretation of the other attachment.","It seems to us that this difficulty in assigning attachment decisions is an important fact that deserves further exploration.

There are reasons to anticipate difficulties in this regard. Typically, dictionaries have concentrated on the 'interesting' phenomena of English, tending to ignore mundane lexical associations. However, the Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary (Sinclair et al. 1987) seems particularly appropriate for comparing with the AP sample for several reasons: it was compiled on the basis of a large text corpus, and thus may be less subject to idiosyncrasy than more arbitrarily constructed works; and it provides, in a separate field, a direct indication of prepositions typically associated with many nouns and verbs. Nevertheless, even for Cobuild, we expect to find more concentration on, for example, idioms and closely bound arguments, and less attention to the adjunct relations which play a significant role in determining attachment preferences.","From a machine-readable version of the dictionary, we extracted a list of 1535 nouns associated with a particular preposition, and of 1193 verbs associated with a particular preposition after an object noun phrase. These 2728 associations are many fewer than the number of associations found in the AP sample. (see Table 5.)","Of course, most of the preposition association pairs from the AP sample end up being non-significant; of the 88,860 pairs, fewer than half (40,869) occur with a frequency greater than 1, and only 8337 have a t-score greater than 1.65. So our sample gives about three times as many significant preposition associations as the COBUILD dictionary. Note however, as Table 5 shows, the overlap is remarkably good, considering the large space of possible bigrams. (In our bigram table Source [ COBUILD AP sample AP sample (f > 1) AP sample (t > 1.65) Total I NOUN I VERB 2728 88,860 40,869 8,337 COBUILD n AP 1,931 COBUILD N AP 1,040 (t > 1.65) 1535 1193 64,629 24,231 31,241 9,628 6,307 2,030 1,147 784 656 384 Table 5: Count of noun and verb associations for COBUILD and the AP sample there are over 20,000 nouns, over 5000 verbs, and over 90 prepositions.) On the other hand, the lack of overlap for so many cases - assuming that the dictionary and the significant bigrams actually record important preposition associations - indicates that 1) our sample is too small, and 2) the dictionary coverage is widely scattered.","First, we note that the dictionary chooses attachments in 182 cases of the 880 test sentences. Seven of these are cases where the dictionary finds an association between the preposition and both the noun and the verb. In these cases, of course, the dictionary provides no information to help in choosing the correct attachment.","Looking at the 175 cases where the dictionary finds one and only one association for the preposition, we can ask how well it does in predicting the correct attachment. Here the results are no better than our human judges or than our bigram procedure. Of the 175 cases, in 25 cases the dictionary finds a verb association when the correct association is with the noun. In 3 cases, the dictionary finds a noun association when the correct association is with the verb. Thus, overall, the dictionary is 86% correct.","It is somewhat unfair to use a dictionary as a source of disambiguation information; there is no reason to expect that a dictionary to provide information on all significant associations; it may record only associations that are interesting for some reason (perhaps because they are semantically unpredictable.)

The particular approach to deciding attachment by t-score gives results nearly as good as human judges given the same information. Thus, we conclude that it may not be necessary to resort to a complete semantics or to discourse models to resolve many pernicious cases of attachment ambiguity.","It is clear however, that the simple model of attachment preference that we have proposed, based only on the verb, noun and preposition, is too weak to make correct attachments in many cases.
