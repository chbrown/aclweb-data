These considerations have provoked interest in applying to the lexicon AI knowledge representation techniques involving the notions of inheritance and default. 2 The sys-","*current address: Cambridge University Computer Laboratory, New Museums Site, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QG, UK.","OWe are indebted to Af-.al Ballim, Mark Johnson, and anonymous referees for valuable comments on this paper.","tin the general case, the relation between forms and information is many-to-many (rather than one-to-many as often assumed) and this observation has influenced the choice of facilities incorporated within the system. See 3.2 below for an example of how distinct forms share identical morphosyntactic specifications.","2See e.g. Daelemaus and Gazdar eds. (1990), and the references in Gazdar (1990). The work of Hudson (1984) extends this general approach to sentence syntax. tem described here is part of the ELU s unification grammar development environment intended for research in machine translation, comprising parser, generator, transfer mechanism and lexical components. The user language resembles that of PATR-II (Shieber, 1986), but provides a larger range of data types and more powerful means of stating relations between them. Among the requirements imposed by the context within which this system is used are (i) the ability to both analyse and generate complex word forms, (ii) full integration with existing parts of the ELU environment, and (iii) the ability to accommodate a relatively large number of words."]},{"title":"2 Classes and Inheritance","paragraphs":["An ELU lexicon consists of a number of 'classes', each of which is a structured collection of constraint equations and macro calls encoding information common to a set of words, together with links to other more general 'superc]asses'. For example, if an 'intransitive' class is used to express the common syntactic properties shared by all in-transitive verbs, then particular instances of in-transitive verbs can be made to inherit this information by specifying the 'intransitive' class as one of their superclasses - it then becomes unnecessaw to specify the relevant properties individually for each such verb. The lexicon may be thought of as a tangled hierarchy of classes linked by inheritance paths, with, at the most specific level, lexicai classes and, at the most general, classes for which no superclasses have been defined, and which therefore inherit no information from elsewhere.","S \"Environnement Linguistique d'Unlfication\" - see Estival (1990), and, for a description of the earlier UD system on which E~u is based, Johnson and Rosner (1989). 215 Lexical entries are themselves classes, 4 and any information they contain is standardly specific to an individual word; lexical and non-lexical classes differ in that analysis and generation take only the former as entry points to the lexicon.","Inheritance of a feature value from a superclass may be overridden by a conflicting value for that feature in a more specific class. This means, for example, that it is possible to place in the class which expresses general properties of verbs an equation such as '<* aux> = no' (i.e. \"typical verbs are not auxiliaries\"), while placing the contradictory specification '<* aux> = yes' in s subclass from which only anTiliaries inherit. The ability to encode exceptional properties of lexical items is extremely attractive from the linguistic point of view; the lower the position in the hierarchy at which the property appears, the more exceptional it may be considered.","A class definition consists of the compiler directive '#Class' (for a non-lexicai class) or '#Word' (for a lexical class), followed by the name of that class, a possibly empty list of direct superclasses, a possible empty 'main' or default equation set, and sere or more 'variant' equation sets. The superclass declaration states from which classes the current class inherits; if more than one such superclass is specified, their order is significant, more specific classes appearing to the left of more general ones. If the current class is one of the most general in the lexicon, it inherits no information, and its superclass list is empty.","Following the superclass declaration are sere or more equations representing default information, which we refer to as the 'main' equation set. These may be overridden by eontlleting information in a more specific class. Each equation in a main set functions as an independent constraint, in a msnner which will be clarified below.","Variant equation sets, loosely speaking, correspend to alternatives at the same conceptual level in the hiersrchy, and in msny cases reflect the traditional ides of 'paradigm'. Equations within a variant set are absolute constraints, in contrast to those in the main set; if they conflict with informs-tion in a more specific class, failure of unification occurs in the normal way. Also, unlike the main set, each variant set functions as a single, possibly complex, constraint (see section"]},{"title":"2.2).","paragraphs":["A feature","4Thus no distinction is made between classes and 'instances', as in e.g. KL-ONE (Schmolse and Lipkis, 1983) structure is created for each variant set that successfully unifies with the single structure arising from the main set. Each variant set is preceded by the vertical bar ' ['. The order of variant sets within a class is not significant, although, if a main set is employed, it must precede any variant sets.","The following simplified example illustrates the form and interaction of class definitions. In equs. tions, unification variables have initial capitals, and negation of constants is indicated by ' '. 'kk' is the string concatenation operator - an equation of the form X = Y kk Z unifies X nondeterministically with the result of concatenating ¥ and Z. #Word walk (Intransitive Verb) <stem>= walk #Class Intransitive () <sub©at> = [SubJ] <$nbJ cat> =np","#Class Verb () <aOX> m no <cat> m V I <tense> = past <~onO = <stem> kk ed I","=presont <form>= <steuO kk s i <aSr> = \"s83 <tense> - present <form> = <stem> The lexiesl class walk is declared as having two direct superclasses, Intransitive and Verb; its main set contains just one equation, which sets the value of the feature stem to be walk. Intransitive has no direct superclasses, and its main equation set assigns to the value of subcat a list with one element, a feature structure in which the value of cat is rip. Neither walk nor Intransitive has sny variant equation sets. Verb, by contrast, has three, in addition to two main set equations. The latter assign, by default, the values of cat and aux. The three variants accounted for by this example are the past tense verb, in which the value of form unifies with the result of concatenatin 8 the value of stem with the string 'ed', the third person singular form, in which the suffix string is 's', and the form representing other combinations of person and number in the present tense; in the last case, the form value is simply identical to the stem value. 5","5We ignore for the moment the question of morphogrsphemic effects in sufllxstion - see section 3.3 below. 216 2.1 Class Precedence In an ELU lexicon, a class may inherit directly from more than one superclass, thus permitting 'multiple inheritance' (Touretsky, 1986: 7ft.), in contrast to 'simple inheritance' in which direct inheritance is allowed from only one superclass at a time. The main advantage that multiple inheritance offers over simple inheritance is the ability to inherit several (orthogonal or complementary) sets of properties from classes in more than one path through the hierarchy. In the lexical context, it has often been observed that morphological and syntactic properties are essentially disjoint; the subeategorisation class of a verb is not predictable from its conjuga-tion class, and vice versa, for example. Multiple inheritance permits the two types of information to be separated by isolating them in distinct subhierarchies.","The question to be resolved in systems employing multiple inheritance is that of precedence: which of several superclasses with conflicting properties is to be inherited from? ELU employs the class precedence algorithm of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) to compute a total ordering on the superclasses of a lexicsl class, s The resulting 'class precedence list' (CPL) contains the class itself and all of its superclasses, from most specific to most general, and forms the basis for the defaulting behaviour of the lexicon. As an example, consider the following lexicon: #Word It (B D) #Class B (C) ZClass C (Y) #Class D (E) #Class E (P) #Class F () Here, the superclass declarations embody the or-derin 8 constraints A < B, A < D, B < D, B < C, C < F, D < E, and E < F; from these are derived a total order assigning to the lexical class A the CPL (A,B,C,D,E,F). 2.2 Inheritance of Properties A lexical class such as walk in the example above corresponds to a family offeature structures. Here, as in most analyses, members of this family represent morphosyntactically distinct realizations of a single basic lexeme. Consulting the lexicon in-volves determining membership of the set of feature structures associated with a given lexical class;","s See Steele (1990: 782ff.) for details of the aIgorithm, and Keene (1989:118ff.) for discussion. In circumstances where no such total ordering is possible, the system reports an error. the precedence relation encoded in the CPL controls the order in which defeasible information is considered, each class in the CPL adding first default and then non-default information to each FS produced by the previous class.","More formally, we define default eztension, superclass eztension, and global ez~e~sion as follows: 7","(1) The default eztension of a FS ~ with respect to a set of FSs • is if U ({~b} U ~) :f: _1_, and .1_ otherwise.","(2) The superclass ez~ension of a FS ~b with respect to a class c having a main equation set M and variant sets Vl,...v, is the set I ~be"]},{"title":"J.},","paragraphs":["where M s is the smallest set of FSs such that each m E M describes some m ~ E M s, ¢~s is the default extension of~b with respect to M e, and v~ is the feature structure described by vl. We refer to this set as E(~b, c).","(3) The global eztensio~, of a lexlcvd class having the CPL (cl,...c,) is F~, where Fo = {T}, and r,>0= U{~ IVY, ~ r,_l, • = E(~, c,)}.","With regard to (I), each of the FSs in W that can unify with ~b does so - those that cannot, because they conflict with information already present, are ignored. The condition requiring ~ to be unifiable with the result of unifying the elements of • takes account of the potential order-sensitivity of the defaulting operation - only those main sets having this property can be applied without regard to or-def. If this condition is met then the application of defaults always succeeds, producing a feature structure which, if no member of the default set is applicable, is identical to ~b. This interpretation of default unification is essentially that of Bouma (1990).","The superclass extension E(~, c) is formed by applying to ~ any default equations in the main set of c, and then applying to the result each variant set in c; for variant sets Vl,... v,,, the result of this","7'A U B' here denotes the unification of A and B, 'T' denotes the most general, 'empty' FS, which unifies with all others, and '_L' denotes the inconsistent FS, equated with failure of unification. 217 second stage is the set of FSs {@1,...@~}, where each ~ is the result of successfully unifying ~b with some different vj.","To speak in procedural terms, the global extension of a lexicai class L with the CPL C is computed as follows: T is the empty FS which is input to C; each c~ in C yields as its superelass extension a set of FSs, each member of which is input to the remainder of C, (c~+l,...c,). The global extension of L is then the yield of the most general class in its CPL - expressed in a slightly different way, the global extension of L is the result of applying to T the CPL of L.","It is possible to exert quite fine control over inheritance; one property may override another when assigned in a main equation set, but cause failure when assigned in a variant set. Normally, variant sets are defined so as to be mutually exclusive; a FS that unifies with more than one of the variant sets is in effect multiplied, s The inheritance systems of Calder (1989) and Flickinger (1987) make use of lexical rules - the ELU lexicon does not provide such devices, although some of their functionality may be reproduced by the variant set mechanism.","The approach described here differs from some previous proposals for default inheritance in unification-based lexicons in that the process of building FSs is monotonic - classes may add information to a FS, but are unable to remove or alter it. Thus, given a CPL (ci,...c.), any FS F admitted by a class c~ subsumes every FS that can be created by applying to F the classes (c~ + I,... c,~), m n. Karttunen (1986) and Shieber (1986) describe systems in which FSs may be modified by default statements in such a way that this property does not automatically hold. These schemes permit default statements to override the effect of earlier statements, whereas default information in the ELU lexicon may itself be overridden.","We now turn to some examples illustrating the r61e of defeasible inheritance in the lexicon."]},{"title":"3 Example Analyses","paragraphs":["3.1 German Separable Verbs Two large classes of German verbs are the separable and inseparable prefixed compound verbs.

Past participle formation also interacts with the presence of separable and inseparable prefixes. 218 The lexical classes weglaufen and verlaufen each have two immediate superclasses, containing information connected with the prefix and stem. The classes weg and vet set the value of the morph:prefix path of the verb (overriding the value given in the main set of verb), and specify inheritance from the separable and non.separable classes respectively. The former of these unifies the variable Prefix with either the empty string (in the case of tensed 'inverted' verbs) or the value of morph : prefix (for other variants), while the latter sets the value uniquely for all forms of the verb in question. As the value of sere is fixed in the main equation set ofweglaufen and verlaufen, the corresponding equation in laufen is overridden, but Base.stem unifies with lauf. Finally, in verb, the main set supplies default values for Prefix and morph : prefix (which in the cases under consideration will not be applicable), unifies P_bs with the result of concatenating the strings Prefix and Base_stem, and for each value of syn infl assigns to form the concatenation of P_bs with the appropriate sufftx string.","Values for sere (antics) are provided in main set equations; those in weglaufen and verlaufen are thus correctly able to override that in laufen. 3.2 English Irregular Verbs In most cases, lexical items that realize certain morphosyntactic properties in irregular forms do not also have regular realizations of those properties; thus *sinked is not a well-formed alternative to sank or sunk, on the analogy of e.g. walked. This phenomenon has frequently been discussed in both theoretical and computational morphology, under the title of 'blocking', and it appears to provide clear motivation for a default-based hierarchical approach to lexical organization. 11 There are exceptions to this general rule, however, and inheritance mechanisms must be sufficiently flexi-ble to permit deviation from the strict behaviour illustrated above.","Consider the small class of English verbs includ-ing dream, lean, learn and burn; these have, for many speakers, alternate past finite and past participle forms: e.g. dreamed and dreamt. The following fragment produces the correct pairings of strings and feature structures, the written form of the word being encoded as the value of the form llSee e.g. Calder (1989). feature: 12","#Word walk (verb) <bass> = walk","#Word sink (verb) <bass> = sink P_Fin_Form = silk PSP_Form = sunk","#Word dream (dual-past verb) <base> = dream","#Class dual-past 0 I PSP_Form = <base> k& t P_Fin_Form = <bass> &k t ~morph> = pasttinlts/pastnon~inits I","#Class verb () <oat> = v PSP_Porm = <bass> It& sd P_Fin_Form = <bass> &k od J <morplO = present_nones3 <~orm~ = <bass> <morph> = prsssnt_ss3 <~orm> = <bass> &k s ~rph~ - ptstnon:einito <form> = PSP_Fozm <nOXl~lO . ptstflnlts <fo~O = p_F4e_Fo~n The main set equations in s/nk override those in its superclass verb, so that the variants in the latter class which give rise to past participle and past tensed forms associate the appropriate information with the strings sunk and sank, respectively. The class walk, on the other hand, contains nothing to pre-empt the equations in verb, and so its past forms are constructed from its value for base and the suffix string ed.","The lex/cai class dream differs from these in hay-ing as one of its direct superclasses dual-past, which contains two variant sets, the second of which is empty (recall that variant sets are preceded by the vertical bar 'I'). Moreover, this class is more specific than the other superclass verb, and so its equations assigning to PaP_Form and P_Fin_Form the string formed by concatenating the value of base and t have precedence over the contradictory statements in the main set of verb.
