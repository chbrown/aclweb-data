We described a tool, Xtract, that implements these methods and able to retrieve a wide range of collocations in a two stage process. These methods a.s well as other related methods however have some limitations. Mainly, the produced collocations do not in-clude any kind of functional information and many of them are invalid. In this paper we introduce methods that address these issues. These methods are implemented in an added third stage to Xtract that examines the set of collocations retrieved during the previous two stages to both filter out a number of invalid collocations and add useful syntactic information to the retained ones. By combining parsing and statistical techniques the addition of this third stage has raised the overall precision level of Xtract from 40% to 80% With a precision of 94%.

He then used these relations for disambiguation in parsing. Since then, the advent of robust parsers such as Cass [Abney, 1990], Fidditeh [Itindle, 1983] has made it possible to process large amounts of text with good performance. This enabled Itindle and Rooth [Hindle and Rooth, 1990], to improve Debili's work by using bigram statistics to enhance the task of prepositional phrase at-tachment. Combining statistical and parsing methods has also been done by Church and his colleagues. In [Church et al., 1989] and [Church'et ai., 1991] they consider predicate argument relations in the form of questions such as What does a boat typically do? They are preprocessing a corpus with the Fiddlteh parser in order to statistically analyze the distribution of the predicates used with a given argument such as \"boat.\"","Our goal is different, since we analyze a set of collocations automatically produced by Xtract to either enrich them with syntactic information or reject them. For example, if, bigram collocation produced by Xtract involves a noun and a verb, the role of Stage 3 of Xtract is to determine whether it is a subject-verb or a verb-object collocation. If no such relation can be identified, then the collocation is rejected. This section presents the algorithm for Xtract Stage 3 in some detail. For illustrative purposes we use the example words takeover and thwart with a distance of 2. 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM Input: A bigram with some distance information in-dicating the most probable distance between the two words. For example, takeover and thwart with a distance of 2. Output/Goah Either a syntactic label for the bigram or a rejection. In the case of takeover and thwart the collocation is accepted and its produced label is VO for verb-object. The algorithm works in the following 3 steps: 3.1.1 Step 1: PRODUCE TAGGED CONCORDANCES All the sentences in the corpus that contain the two words in this given position are produced. This is done with a concord,acing program which is part of Xtraet (see [Smadja, 1991]). The sentences are labeled with part of speech information by preprocessing the corpus with an automatic stochastic tagger. 1 3.1.2 Step 2: PARSE THE SENTENCES","Each sentence is then processed by Cass, a bottom-up incremental parser [Abney, 1990]. 2 Cass takes input sentences labeled with part of speech and attempts to identify syntactic structure. One of Cass modules identifies predicate argument relations. We use this module to produce binary syntactic relations (or labels) such as \"verb-object\" (VO), %erb-subject\" (VS), \"noun-adjective\" (N J), and \"noun-noun\" ( N N ). Consider Sentence (1) below and all the labels as produced by Cass on it.","(1) \"Under the recapitalization plan it proposed to thwart the takeover.\" label bigrarn SV it proposed NN recapitalization plan VO thwart takeover For each sentence in the concordance set, from the output of Cass, Xtract determines the syntactic relation of the two words among VO, SV, N J, NN and assigns this label to the sentence. If no such relation is observed, Xtract associates the label U (for undefined) to the sentence. We note label[ia~ the label associated","1For this, we use the part of speech tagger described in [Church, 1988]. This program was developed at Bell Laboratories by Ken Church.","UThe parser has been developed at Bell Communication Research by Steve Abney, Cass stands for Cascaded Analysis of Syntactic Structure.

For these examples, the threshold T was set to 80%. For each collocation, the first line is the output of the first stage of Xtract. It is the seed bigram with the distance between the two words. The second line is the output of the second stage of Xtract, it is a multiple word collocation (or n-gram). The numbers on the left indicate the frequency of occurrence of the n-gram in the corpus. The third line indicates the syntactic label as determined by the third stage of Xtract. Finally, the last lines simply list an example sentence and the position of the collocation in the sentence. Such collocations can then be used for various purposes including lexicography, spelling correction, speech recognition and language generation. Ill [Smadja and McKeown, 1990] and [Smadja, 1991] we describe how they are used to build a lexicon for language generation in the domain of stock market reports. The third stage of Xtract can thus be considered as a retrieval system which retrieves valid collocations from a set of candidates.

The lexicographer came up with three simple tags, YY, Y and N. Both Y and YY are good collocations, and N are bad collocations. The difference between YY and Y is that Y collocations are of better quality than YY collocations. YY collocations are often too specific to be included in a dictionary, or some words are missing, etc. After Stage 2, about 20% of the collocations are Y, about 20% are YY, and about 60% are N. This told us that the precision of Xtract at Stage 2 was only about 40 %. Although this would seem like a poor precision, one should compare it with the much lower rates currently in practice in lexicography. For the OED, for example, the first stage roughly consists of reading numerous documents to identify new or interesting expressions. This task is performed by professional readers. For the OED, the readers for the American program alone produce some 10,000 expressions a month. These lists are then sent off to the dictionary and go through several rounds of careful analysis before actually being submitted to the dictionary. The ratio of proposed candidates to good candidates is usually low. For example, out of the 10,000 expressions proposed each month, less than 400 are serious candidate for the OED, which represents a current rate of 4%. Automatically producing lists of candidate expressions could actually be of great help to lexicographers and even a precision of 40% would be helpful. Such lexicographic tools could, for example, help readers retrieve sublanguage specific expressions by providing them with lists of candidate collocations. The lexicographer then manually examines the list to remove the irrelevant data. Even low precision is useful for lexicographers as manual filtering is much faster than manual scanning of the documents [Marcus, 1990]. Such techniques are not able to replace readers though, as they are not designed to identify low frequency expressions, whereas a human reader immediately identifies interesting expressions with as few as one occurrence.","The second stage of this experiment was to use Xtract Stage 3 to filter out and label the sample set of collocations. As described in Section 3, there are several valid labels (VO, VS, NN, etc.). In this experiment, we grouped them under a single label: T. There is only one non-valid label: U (for unlabeled}. A T collocation is thus accepted by Xtract Stage 3, and a U collocation is rejected. The results of the use of Stage 3 on the sample set of collocations are similar to the manual evaluation in terms of numbers: about 40% of the collocations were labeled (T) by Xtract Stage 3, and about 60% were rejected (U).","Figure 3 shows the overlap of the classifications made by Xtract and the lexicographer. In the figure, the first diagram on the left represents the breakdown in T and U of each of the manual categories (Y - YY and N). The diagram on the right represents the breakdown in Y - YY and N of the the T and U categories. For example, the first column of the diagram on the left represents the application of Xtract Stage 3 on the YY collocations. It shows that 94% of the collocations accepted by the lexicographer were also accepted by Xtract. In other words, this means that the recall ofthe third stage of Xtract is 94%. The first column of the diagram on the right represents the lexicographic evaluation of the collocations automatically accepted by Xtract. It shows that about 80% of the T collocations were accepted by the lexicographer and that about 20% were rejected. This shows that precision was raised from 40% to 80% with the addition of Xtract Stage 3. In summary, these experiments allowed us to evaluate Stage 3 as a retrieval system. The results are: I Precision = 80% Recall = 94% ]"]},{"title":"5 SUMMARY AND CONTRIBUTIONS","paragraphs":["In this paper, we described a new set of techniques for syntactically filtering and labeling collocations. Using such techniques for post processing the set of collocations produced by Xtract has two major results. First, it adds syntax to the collocations which is necessary for computational use.
