The approach is based on the \"distributional hypothesis\". Our approach is characterized by distinguishing among senses of the same word in order to resolve the \"polysemy\" issue. The classification result demonstrates that our approach is successful. 1. INTRODUCTION","Sets of semantically similar words are very useful in natural language processing. The general approach toward classifying words is to use semantic categories, for example the thesaurus. The \"is-a\" relation is connected between words and categories. However, it is not easy to acquire the \"is-a\" connection by hand, and it becomes expensive.","Approaches toward automatically classifying words using existing dictionaries were therefore attempted[Chodorow] [Tsurumaru] [Nakamura]. These approaches are partially successful. However, there is a fatal problem in these approaches, namely, existing dictionaries, particularly Japanese dictionaries, are not assembled on the basis of semantic hierarchy.","On the other hand, approaches toward automatically classifying words by using a large-scale corpus have also been attempted[Shirai][Hindle]. They seem to be based on the idea that semantically similar words appear in similar environments. This idea is derived from Harris's \"distributional hypothesis\"[Harris] in linguistics. Focusing on nouns, the idea claims that each noun is characterized by Verbs with which it occurs, and also that nouns are similar to the extent that they share verbs. These automatic classification approaches are also partially successful. However, Hindle says that there is a number of issues to be confronted. The most important issue is that of \"polysemy\". In Hindle's experiment, two senses of\"table\", that is to say \"table under which one can hide\" and \"table which can be commuted or memorized\", are conflated in the set of words similar to \"table\". His result shows that senses of the word must be distinguished before classification. (1)I sit on the table. (2)I sit on the chair. (3)I fill in the table. (4)I fill in the list.","For example, the above sentences may appear in the corpus. In sentences (1) and (2), \"table\" and \"chair\" share the same verb \"sit on\". In sentences (3) and (4), \"table\" and \"list\" share the same verb \"fill in\". However, \"table\" is used in two different senses. Unless they are distinguished before classification, \"table\", \"chair\" and \"list\" may be put into the same category because \"chair\" and \"list\" share the same verbs which are associated with \"table\". It is thus necessary to distinguish the senses of \"table\" before automatic classification. Moreover, when the corpus is not sufficiently large, this must be performed for verbs as well as nouns. In the following Japanese sentences, the Japanese verb \"r~ < \"is used in different senses.

Our approach is characterized by distinguishing among senses of the same word by using Japanese-English word pairs extracted from a bilingual database. We suppose here that some senses of Japanese words are distinguished when Japanese sentences are translated into another language. For example, The following Japanese sentences (7),(8) are translated into English sentences (9),(10), respectively. (7)~ ~J~ ~: ~"]},{"title":"(8)~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~-","paragraphs":["(9)He sends a letter. (t0)He publishes a book.","The Japanese word \" ~ T\" has at least two senses. One is \"to cause to go or be taken to a place\" and the other is \"to have printed and put on sale\". In the above example, the Japanese word\" ~ ~-\" corresponds to \"send\" from sentences (7) and (9). The Japanese word \" ~ -~\" also corresponds to \"publish\" from sentences (8) and (10). That is to say, the Japanese word\" ~ T\" is translated into 202 different English words according to the sense. This example shows that it may be possible to distinguish among senses of the same word by using words from another language. We used Japanese-English word pairs, for example,\" ~ ~-send\" and\" ~ ~- publish\", as senses of Japanese words.","In this paper, these word pairs are acquired from ATR's large scale database. 2. CONTENT OF THE DATABASE","ATR has constructed a large-scale database which is collected from simulated telephone and keyboard conversations [Ehara]. The sentences collected in Japanese are manually translated into English. We obtain a bilingual database. The database is called the ATR Dialogue Database(ADD). ATR aims to build ADD to one million words covering two tasks. One task is dialogues between secretaries and participants of international conferences. The other is dialogues between travel agents and customers. Collected Japanese and English sentences are morphologically analyzed. Japanese sentences are also dependency analyzed and given deep semantic relations. We use 63 deep semantic cases[Inoue]. Correspondences of Japanese and English are made by several linguistic units, for example words, sentences and so on.","Figure 1 shows an example of deep semantic relations and correspondences of Japanese and English words. The sentence is already morphologically analyzed. The solid line shows deep semantic relations. The Japanese nouns\" ') 7\" ~ 4 7 ~r -- ~\" and \"~ ~'~\" modify the Japanese verbs \"~ v~\" and \"~","\", respectively. The semantic relations are \"space at\" and \"object\", which are almost equal to \"locative\" and \"objective\" of Fillmore's deep case[Fillmore]. The dotted line shows the word correspondence between Japanese and English. The Japanese words \"V 7\"~ 4 7 ~- --./~\",\"~\",\"~,~)\"and\"~ L\" correspond to the English words \"reply form\", \"fill out\", \"summary\" and \"submit\", respectively. Here, \" ~ v,\" and \" ~i [~\" are conjugations of\" ~ < \" and \" ~ -¢\", respectively. However, it is possible to extract semantic relations and word correspondence in dictionary form, because ADD includes the dictionary forms. 3. CLASSIFICATION OF NOUNS 3.1 Using Data","We automatically extracted from ADD not only deep semantic relations between Japanese nouns and verbs but also the English word which corresponds to the Japanese word. We used telephone dialogues between secretaries and participants because the scale of analyzed words was largest. Table 1 shows the current number of analyzed words. Table I Analyzed words counts of ADD Media Task Words Conference 139,774 Telephone Travel 11,709 Conference 64,059 Keyboard Travel 0","Figure 2 shows an example of the data extracted from ADD. Each field is delimited by the delimiter \"1\"- The first field is the dialogue identification number in which the semantic relation appears. The second and the third fields are Japanese nouns and their corresponding English words. The next 2 fields are Japanese verbs and their corresponding English words. The last is the semantic relations between nouns and verbs.","Moreover, we automatically acquired word pairs from the data shown in Figure 2. Different senses of nouns appear far less frequently than those of verbs because the database is restricted to a specific task. In this experiment, only word pairs of verbs are used. Figure 3 shows deep semantic relations between nouns and word pairs of verbs. The last field is raw frequency of co-occurrence. We used the data shown in Figure 3 for noun classification. 1[ ~J $,~ ~ [registration"]},{"title":"feel • •","paragraphs":["Ipay[object 151~ ¢.'~ Isummaryl ~ ~-Isend]object 15717\" ~ ~/- ~\" 4 ~ ~f[proceedingl~ lissuelobject 41~ ~lconferencel~ ;5 Ibe heldlobject 8] ~ r~9 Iquestionl~ ;5 Ihavelobject 31J~ ~ Ibusl~ ~ Itakelobject 1801~: ~ Inewspaperl~! ;5 Iseelspace at Figure 2 An example of data extracted from ADD","The experiment is done for a sample of 138 nouns which are included in the 500 most frequent words.

Based on this semantic theory, nouns are similar to the extent that they share verb senses. The aim of this paper is to show the efficiency of using the word pair as the word sense. We therefore used the following expression(l), which was already defined by Shirai[Shirai] as the distance between two words.

The distance is normalized from 0.0 to 1.0. If one noun (a) shares all verb senses with the other noun (b) and the frequency is also same, the distance is 0.0. If one noun (a) shares no verb senses with the other noun (b), the distance is 1.0. 3.3 Classification Method","For the classification, we adopted cluster analysis which is one of the approaches fn multivariant analysis. Cluster analysis is generally used in various fields, for example biology, ps.ychology, etc.. Some hierarchical clustering methods, for example the nearest neighbor method, the centroid method, etc., have been studied. It has been proved that the centroid method can avoid the chain effect. The chain effect is an undesirable phenomenon in which the nearest unit is not always classified into a cluster and more distant units are chained into a cluster. The centroid method is a method in which the cluster is characterized by the centroid of categorized units. In the following section, the result obtained by the centroid method is shown. 4.EXPERIMENT 4.1 Clustering Result","All 138 nouns are hierarchically classified. However, only some subsets of the whole hierarchy are shown, as space is limited. In Figure 4, we can see that semantically similar nouns, which may be defined as \"things made from paper\", are grouped together. The X-axis is the semantic distance defined before. Figure 5 shows another subset. All nouns in Figure 5, \"~ ~_ (decision)\", \"~ ~(presentation)\", \";~ ~\" - ~\" (speech)\" and \" ~(talk)\", have an active concept like verbs. Subsets of nouns shown in Figures 4 and 5 are fairly coherent. However, all subsets of nouns are not coherent. In Figure 6, \" ~ ~ 4 b ° (slide)\", \"~, ~ (draft)\", \" ~\" ~ (conference site)\", \"8 E (8th)\" and\" ~R (station)\" are grouped together. The semantic distances are 0.67, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8. The distance is upset when \"~ ~(conference site)\" is attached to the cluster containing \":~ ~ 4 b'(slide)\" and \"~ ~(draft)\". This is one characteristic of the centroid method. However, this seems to result in a semantically less similar cluster. The word pairs of verbs, the deep semantic relations and the frequency are shown in Table 2. After \"~ ~ 4 b ~ (slide)\" and \"~ ~(draft)\" are grouped into a cluster, the cluster and \" ~ (conference site)\" share two word pairs, \" fE \") -use\" and \"~ ~ -be\". \"~ Yo -be\" contributes more largely to attach \" ~ ~(conference site)\" to the cluster than \"tE ~) -use\" because the frequency of co-occurrence is greater. In this sample, \" ~ ~-be\" occurs with more nouns than \"f~ \") -use\". It shows that \"~J~ Yo - be\" is less important in characterizing nouns 204 though the raw frequency of co-occurrence is greater. It is therefore necessary to develop a means of not relying on the raw frequency of co-occurrence, in order to make the clustering result more accurate. This is left to further study. 4.2 Estimation of the Result","All nouns are hierarchically classified, but some semantically separated clusters are acquired if the threshold is used.","It is possible to compare clusters derived from this experiment with semantic categories which are used in our automatic interpreting telephony system.

The other (dotted line} is the result of using the verb form itself. The X-axis is the number of classified nouns and the Y-axis is the value derived from the above expression.Figure 7 shows that it is better to use word pairs of verbs than not use them, when fewer than about 30 nouns are classified. However, both are almost the same, when more than about 30 nouns are classified. The result proves that the distinction of senses of verbs is successful when only a few nouns are classified."]},{"title":"I Word Pain of Verbs","paragraphs":["B"]},{"title":"..........","paragraphs":["Verb Form 0.3 0.2 | h\" 0.1 ' = ' ; ~J 0.0 z"]},{"title":"...:.","paragraphs":["L.'!"]},{"title":"/ • ~~./, .~","paragraphs":[", in 50 100 Number of Nou,us Figure 7 Estimation result 5. CONCLUSION","Using word pairs of Japanese and English to distinguish among senses of the same verb, we have shown that using word pairs to classify nouns is better than not using word pairs, when only a few nouns are classified. However, this experiment did not succeed for a sufficient number of nouns for two reasons. One is that the raw co-occurrent frequency is used to calculate the semantic distance. The other is that the sample size is too small. It is thus necessary to resolve the following issues to make the classification result more accurate. (1)to develop a means of using the frequency normalized by expected word pairs. (2)to estimate an adequate sample size.","In this experiment, we acquired word pairs and semantic relations from our database. However, they are made by hand. It is also preferable to develop a method of automatically acquiring them from the bilingual text database.","Moreover, we want to apply the hierarchically classified result to the translated word selection problem in Machine translation.
