The expert system design methodology develops a domain definition, called GLIB, in the form of a semantic grammar. This grammar format enables GLIB to be used with the INGLISH interface, which constrains users to create statements within a subset of English. Incremental patting in INGLISH allows immediate remedial information to be generated if a user deviates from the sublanguage. Sentences are translated into production rules using the methodology of lexical-functional grammar. The system is written in Sms/ltalk and, in INK,A, produces rides for a Prolog inference engine. INTRODUCTION","The ides/ natural language interface would let any user, without any prior training, interact with a computer.

This process is time-consuming and expensive.","INKA (INglish Knowledge Acquisition) permits task experts to express their knowledge in a subset of English, and have it automatically translated into the appropriate representational formalism. In particular, the version of INKA to be discussed here accepts input in a sublanguage called GLIB which permits the statement of facts and rules relevant to the troubleshooting of electronic systems (Freiling et al., 1984), and translates these statements into Prolog unit clauses for later proce~ng by a specialized inference mechanism. Experiments with INKA to date have enabled us to construct mfflcient troubleshooting rules to build a localizing troubleshooter for a simple circuit.","INKA is designed as one of the tools of DETEKTR, an environment for building knowledge based electronic instru. ment troubleshooters (Freiling & Alexander, 1984). DETEKTR supports an expert system development methodology which is outlined below. The design goal of INKA is that it serve as a natural language input system to facilitate transfer of knowledge during the knowledge acquisition phase of expert system development.

It is unfeasible to assume that any task expert can simply perform a ~memory dump\" of expertise into some natural language interface and be done with it.","This paper discusses the natural language technology used in building INKA. The system incorporates a diverse collec-tion of natural language technologies in its construction. Specifically, INKA utilizes a semam/c grammar (Burton, 1976) to characterize the domain sublanguage, lexical-functional sem~aics (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982) to translate to the internal form of representation, and an interface that includes left-corner parsitlg with in-line guidance to address the Linguistic coverage problem that aris~ with sublanguages. We feel this eclectic approach is a useful for building application-oriented natural language interfaces. Although we are describing a knowledge acquisition application, the methodology can be used for any application whose sublanguage can be stated in the prescribed grammar formalism.","Tereisias (Davis, 1977) provides a natural language environment for debugging a knowledge base. INKA at present contains no facilities to modify an existing rule or to test the evolving knowledge base for some level of integr/ty; these are to be future additions.","INKA is written in Smalltalk (Goidberg & Robson, 1983) and runs on both the Tekuroulx Magnolia Workstation and the 4404 Artificial Intelligence System. INKA makes extensive use of the bit-mapped display and three-button mouse on these systems.

A bottleneck arises here because in current practice, the presence of the knowledge engineer is required throughout this time-consuming process.","In the course of defining a viable methodology for the construction of expert systems (Frelling & Alexander 1984; Alexander et al. 1985), we have identified cermia classes of problems where the task of definin$ the knowledge structures and the task of actually building them can be effectively separated, with only the former being performed by a trained knowledge engineer. The problem of building a large collec-tion of knowledge-based troubleshooters for electronic instrumeats is an example.

The major issue is how to gee started defining the forms into which knowledge is to be cast.","We have found it an effect/ve technique tO begin this procem by recording statements made by task experts on tape, and transcribing these to fairly natural En~)i~. When enough recording has been done, the statements begin to take on recognizable patterns. It is then pom/ble to build a formal grammar for much of the relevant utterances, using linguistic engineering techniques such as semantic grammars The symbols of this grammar and the task specific vocabulary provide convenient points for defining formal sub-structures, which are pieced together to define a complete symbolic representation. Once the grammar is reasonably well-defined, the mapping to symbolic representation can be carried out with mapping tenhniques such as the f-structure constraints of lexical-fuactioaal grammar.","Up to this point, we can imagine that the entire task has been carried out on paper, or some machine-readable equivalent. Even in such a rudimentary form, the exercise is useful, because it provides a conveniently formal documenta-tion for the knowledge representation decisions that have been made. However, it is also the case that these formal definitions, if appropriately constructed, provide all that is necessary to construct a problem specific interface for acquiring utterantes expressed in this sublanguage. In fact, the idea of using"]},{"title":"this","paragraphs":["technique to build acquisition interfaces, using INGLISH, actually occurred as a result of wondering what to do with a grammar we had constructed simply in order to document our representation structures (Freiling et al. 1984).","We do not intend to imply that it is possible in complex knowledge based system applications to simply build a gram. mar and immediately begin acquirin~ knowledge. Often the process leading to construction of the grammar can be quite complex. In our case, it even involved building a simple prototype troubleshooting system before we had gained sufficient confidence in our representation structures to attempt a knowledge acquis/tion interface.","Nor do we intend to claim that all the knowledge necessary to build a complete expert system need be computed in this fashion.

It also ma~es possible the establishment of very strong constraints on the formal language developed by this process. Two of the design constraints we find it advisable to impose are that the language be unambiguous (in the formal sense of a unique derivation for each legal sentence) and that it be context-free.

Once a selection is made from the menu using the mouse, the fragment is extended. This sequence can be repeated until the sentence is completed. Creating a sentence in this manner compares with the NLMENU system (Tennant etal., 1983). Unlike NLMENU, keyboard entry is also possible with IHGLISH. Gilfoil (1982) found that users prefer a command form of entry to menu-driven dialogue as their experience increases. When typing, a user who is unsure of the coverage can invoke a menu, either by a mouse-click or by typing a second space character, to find out what INGLISH expects next without aborting the current statement. Similarly, any unacceptable word causes the menu to appear, giving immediate feedback of a deviation and suggestions for correct continuation. A choice from the menu can be typed or selected u~ng the mouse. |NGLISH in fact allows all actions to be performed from the keyboard or with the mouse and for them to be freely intermingled. As only valid words are accepted, all completed sentences are well-formed and can be translated into the internal representation.","Figure 5, in the \"INGLISH\" window, shows a complete sentence and its translation, and a partial sentence with a menu of continuations. The numbers associated with each menu item provide a shorthand for entry, i.e., \"~12\" can be typed instead of \"RESISTANCE\". As menu entries can be phrases, this can save significant typing effort.","Input is processed on a word-by-word basis. Single spaces and punctuation characters serve as word terminators. Words are echoed as typed and overwritten in uppercase when accepted. Thus, if lowercase is used for typing, the progress of the sentence is easily followed. An invalid entry remains visible along with the menu of acceptable continuations then is replaced when a selection is made.","The spelling corrector (a Smalltalk system routine is used) only corrects to words that would be acceptable in the current syntactic/semantic context. As Carbonell and Hayes (1983) point out, this is more efficient and accurate than attempting to correct against the whole application dictionary.","Word completion is provided with the \"escape\" character (cf. DEC, 1971). When this is used, INGLISH attempts to complete the word on the basis of the characters so far typed. If there are several possibilities, they are displayed in a menu.","Automatic phrase completion occurs whenever the context permits no choice. The completion will extend as far as poss/ble In an extreme case a dngle word could yield a whole sentence! The system will \"soak-up\" any words in the completion that have also been typed.","The spelling cot'rector and automatic phrase completion can interact in a disturbing manner. Any word that is outside the coverage will be treated ~s an error and an attempt will be made to correct it. If there [s a viable correction, it will be made. Should phrase completion then be possible, a portion of a sentence could be constructed that is quite different from the one intended by the user. Such behavior will probably be less evident in large gramman. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to have a \"cautious\" and \"trusting\" mode, as in Interlisp's DWIM (Xerox, 1983), for users who resent the precocious impat/ence of the interface.","The system does not support anaphora, and ellipsis is offe:ed indirectly. The interface has two modes: \"ENTRY\" and \"EDIT\" (Figure 5). These are selected by clicking the mouse while in the pane at the top right of the interface window. Rules are normally entered in the Enter mode. When in Edit mode, the window gives access to the SmalltaLk editor. This allows any text in the window to be modified to create a new statement. After editing, a menu command is used to pass the sentence to the paner as if it were being typed. Any errc;\" in the constructed sentence causes a remedial menu to be displayed and the tail of the edited sentence to be thrown away.","The 1HGLISH interface alleviates the problem of linguistic coverage for designers and users of natural language interfaces. A natural language interface user composes his entries bearing in mind a model of the interface's capabilities. If his model is not accurate, his interactions will be error-prone. He may excerd the coverage of the system and have his entry rejected. If this happens frequently, use of the interface may be abandoned in frustration. On the other hand he may form an overly conservative model of the system and fail to ur~ize the full capabifities of the interface (Tennant, 1980). An interface designer is confronted by many linguistic phenomena, e.g., noun groups, retative rlauses, ambiguity, reference, ellipsis, anaphora, and paraphrases. On account of performance requirements or on a lack of a theoretical understand-ing, many of these constructions will not be in the interface. INGLISH allows designers to rest more comfortably with the compromises they have made, knowing that users can systematically discover the coverage of the interface. 256 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INGLISH","INGLISH parses incrementally from left to right and performs all checking on each word as it is entered. The parser follows the Left-Corner Algorithm (Gr/ffiths & Petrick, 1965), modified to a pseudo-parallel format so that it can follow all parses simultaneously (Phillips, 1984). Th/s algorithm builds phrases bottom-up from the left-comer, i.e., rules are selected by the first symbol of their r/ght-hand-s/des. For example, given a phrase initial category e, a rule of the form X --e -- will be chosen. The remaining rule segments of the right-hand s/de are predictions about the structure of the remainder of the phrase and are processed left-to-right. Subsequent inputs will directly match success/ve rule segments ff the latter are term/- aal symbols of the grammar. When a non-terminal symbol is encountered, a subparse is initiated. The subparse is also constructed bottom-up from the left-corner, following the rule selection process just described. When an embedded rule is completed, the phrase formed may have the structure of the non-terminal category that or/ginated the subparse and so complete the subparse. If there is no match, it will become the left-corner of a phrase that will eventually match the originating category.","The parser includes a Re,whabiliry Mmriz (Griffiths & Petrick, 1965) to provide top-down filtering of rule selection. The mntrix indicates when a category A can have a category B as a left-most descendant in a passe tree. The matrix is static and can be derived from the grammar in advance of any pan. ing. It is computable as the transitive closure under multiplica-tion of the boolean matrix of left daughters of non-terminal categories in the grammar. It is used as a further constraint on rule selection. For example, when the goal is to construct a sentence and the category of the lust word of input is e, then rule selection, giving X - c --, will also be constrained to have the property S * X -- The filtering is applicable whenever a rule is selected: during subparses the constraint is to reach the category originating the subparse.","A semantic grammar formalism is used in INGLISH, which make the grammar application dependent. As was mentioned earlier, this format was independently chosen as pan of the knowledge engineering methodology for describing the avplication domain. The rationale for the choice for INGLISH was that the simultaneous syntactic and semantic checking assists in achieving real-time processing. A fragment of the grammar is shown in Figure 1.","Pre-processing on the grammar coasu'uc:s the terminal and non-terminal vocabularies of the grammar, the reachabllity matrix, and an inverse dictionary. The set of all possible initia/ words and phrases for sentences can also be precomputed.","The Smafltalk system contnin~ controllers that manage activity on a variety of input devices and from these a controller was readily constructed\" to coordinate mouse and key- • Smalltalk is an"]},{"title":"object-oriented","paragraphs":["language. Instead of creating a procedure that controls system operation, the user creates an object (usually a data structure), and a set of methods (operations that transform, and communicate with the object). Smalitalk programs create objects or send messages to other objects. Once received, messages result in the execution of a method.","Programmers do not create each object and its methods individually. Instead, classes of objects are de-board activity in INGLISH. Either form of entry increments an intermediate buffer which is inspected by the parser. When a complete word is found in the buffer it is parsed.","Every phra~ in an on-going analys/s is contained in a Smalltalk object. The final parse is a tree of objects. The intermediate state of a parse is represented by a set of objects containing partially instantiated phrases. After the first word has established an initial set of phrase objects, they are Dolled by the pa~er for their next segments. From these and the rever~; dictionary, a \"lookahead dictionary\" is estabfished that assoc/ates expected words with the phrasal objects that would accept them. Using this dictionary an incoming word will only be sent to those ob~'ts that will accept it. If the word in not in the set of expected words, the dict/onary keys sre used to attempt spelling correction and, iI correction fails, to make the menu to be displayed. If the dictionary contains only a single word, this indicates that automatic phrase completion should take place. A new lookahead dictionary is then formed from the updated phrase objects, and so On. KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION","The internal form of a diagnostic role is a clause in Prolog. Sentences are translated using functional stigmata, as in lexicai-functioaal grammar.

As a result, propagation of functional structure is handled very quickly in a post-proce~ng step since the appficable grammatica/ rules have already been chosen by the parsing process. Further, by restricting the input to strictly prescribed sublanguage GLIB, not Engl~h in general, the Ur~n~Intioa process is s/mplified. fined.
