There is no notion of derivation from deep structure in the theory of TAG's--the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwise changed once they are introduced into a text, only combined with other primitive trees. As Kmch and Jmhi point out, this means that a TAG is incomplete ms an account of the structure of a natural language, e.g. a TAG grammar wW contain ~th an active and a passive form of the same verbal sutx:ategurization pattern, without an theory-mediated description of the very clme relationship between them.","To our minds this is by uo means a deficit. The p~c~lural machinery that generative grammars have traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of employing tho~ characterizations in processing models of generation. This is because a generation model, like any theory of performance, has a procedural m'ucture of its own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at least not while still operating efficiently or while retainin 5 a simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual machine that its authors put forward ms their ao~unt of psycholinguistic data.","Our own generator uses surface structure ms its only expficifly represented linguistic level. Thus grammatical formalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface form are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a deep to surface transformational process.","A TAG Involves the manlpulatlea of very mmail demantary m'uctures. This is _'~'__~_use of the stipulation that elementary trees may not include recumve nodes. It implies that the sentences one ~ in everyday usage, e.g. aewpaper texts, are the result of many _o_,__e~6_ 're adjunctions. This melds nicely with a move that we have made in recent years to view the conceptual representation from which generation proceeds ms consisting of a heap of very small, redundantly related information units that have been defiberately selected by a text plannin~g ~ from the total state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance; each such unit will correspond in the final te~ to a head lexical item plus selected thematic arguments--a linguistic entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a TAG.","TAG U~n7 Indudes ~ly ow operm~oa, mqemetlom, and otherwim .--~-, u .4,.,,.~ to the elemantary trees that go tnts• text. This compom well with the indefibllity mpulatiou in our mode/ of gene~uion, tince adected text fragments ~ be ~ di~y all ~ by th@ gl~mm~r without the need for any later transformation. The composition options delimited by the constraints on adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative text forms which can correspond directly in generation to alternative conceptual relations among information units, alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in t,,~me style. 3. Adapting TAG's to Generation","The mapping from TAG's as a formaligm for competence theories of language to our formalism for generation is strikingly direct. As we described in Section 5 their adjunction operation corresponds to our attachment Wcgess; their constraints ou adjunction correspond to our attachment points; their surface structure trees correspoad to our surface structure trees, t We further hypothesize that two quite strong correspondence claims can be made, though considerably more experimentation and theorizing will have to be done with both formalisms before these claims can be c~nfirmed. I. The primitive information units in renlization specifications can be realized exclusively ms one or another elementary tree ms def'med by a suitable TAG, i.e. linguistic criteria can be used in derermmmg the proper modularity of the conceptual structure. 2 2.

Two of the mo~ important generation systems that have been deveJoped, PROTEUS ~Davey 1974] and NIGEL [Mann & Manhie~en 1983], am systemic grammar, and others, including ourselves, have been mongly influenced by it. The reasons for this entb,,tlatm are central to the special concerns of generation. Systemic grammars employ a functional vocabulary: they empha~/ze the uses to which language can be put--how languages achieve their speakers\" goaLs-rather than its formal structure. Since the generation pmcem begins with goals, unlike the comprehension process which begins with structure, this orientation makes systemic grammars more immediately useful than, for example, tramffotmationai generatb,+ grammars or even procedurally oriented AI fogmali-qa~s |of language such as ATN's.","The generation researcher's primary question is why use one construction rather than another--active instead of pa~ive, \"the\" instead of \"a'. \"toe principle device of a systemic grammar, the \"choice system\", mppom this question by highlighting how the constructions of the language are gmupud into met of altemativet Choice systems pro~tde an anchoring point for the rules of a theory of language u~ tin,-,, it it natural to associate the vaziotm romantic, disgou~, or rhetorical criteria that bear oa the mlection of a given ~on or feature with the choice system to which the consmmtion belongs, thus providing the basis of a decision-Wm:edure for rejecting from its Listed atternatives; the NIGEL sy~em does ~y this in its \"chooser\" p~c~_~M_ures.","In our formalism ~ make tt~e o~ ttu~ saint i~l'ormatWn a.¢ a sy~emic grammar captures, however we have choosen to bundle it quite differemly.
