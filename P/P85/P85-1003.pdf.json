The interesting point is that both the rewsed RP and the locality property of SOT can be easily implemented ,n processing systems which have certain Oounoeoness constraint on the phrase structure rules (e.g., ,nformation cannot move across more than one bounding node).

In the case of LOC, we have a neat answer .. the constraint need NOT be learned at all!

Finally, as we have shown =n the previous section, the boundeQness of the flow of information ol a orocessmg system leads directly to ~he locality orooerty of the SOT.

Important relationships between al~s;ract constra,nts governing lingu=st,c behavior and a computational scheme to reason aDout temporal relationships are discussed. In particular, I have shown that certain formal constraints, such as the Linear Order Constraint on tense, fall out naturally as a consequence of some computational assumptions.
