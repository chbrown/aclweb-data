Shieber Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International and Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford University Abstract 1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Grammar formalisms based on the encoding of grammatical information in complex-valued feature systems enjoy some currency both in linguistics and natural-language-processing research. Such formalisms can be thought of by analogy to context-free grammars as generalizing the notion of nonterminal symbol from a finite domain of atomic elements to a possibly infinite domain of directed graph structures nf a certain sort. Unfortunately, in moving to an infinite nonterminal domain, standard methods of parsing may no longer be applicable to the formalism. Typically, the problem manifests itself ,as gross inefficiency or ew, n nonterminat icm of the alg~,rit hms. In this paper, we discuss a solution to the problem of extending parsing algorithms to formalisms with possibly infinite nonterminal domains, a solution based on a general technique we call restriction. As a particular example of such an extension, we present a complete, correct, terminating extension of Earley's algorithm that uses restriction to perform top-down filtering. Our implementation of this algorithm demonstrates the drastic elimination of chart edges that can be achieved by this technique. Fit,all.v, we describe further uses for the technique--including parsing other grammar formalisms, including definite.clause grammars; extending other parsing algorithms, including LR methods and syntactic preference modeling algorithms; anti efficient indexing.

In Section 2, we summarize traditional proposals for solutions and problems inherent in them and propose an alternative approach to a solution using restriction.

This solution has been recommended for functional unification grammars (FI,G) by Martin Kay"]},{"title":"[61;","paragraphs":["its legacy can be seen in the context-free skeleton of LFG, and the Hewlett-Packard GPSG system"]},{"title":"[31,","paragraphs":["and in the cat feature requirement in PATR-[I that is described below.","However, several problems inhere in this solution of mandating a context-free backbone. First, the move from context-free to complex-feature-based formalisms wan motivated by the desire to structure the notion of nonterminal. Many analyses take advantage of this by eliminating men-tion of major category information from particular rules a or by structuring the major category itself (say into binary N and V features plus a bar-level feature as in ~-based theories). F.rcing the primacy and atomicity of major category defeats part of the purpose of structured category systems.","Sec, m,l. and perhaps more critically, because only certain ,ff the information in a rule is used to guide the parse, say major category information, only such information can be used to filter spurious hypotheses by top-down filtering. Note that this problem occurs even if filtering by the rule information is used to eliminate at the earliest possible time constituents and partial constituents proposed during parsing {as is the case in the PATR-II implementation and the ~Se~'. [or instance, the coordination and copular \"be\" aaalyses from GPSG [4 I, the nested VP analysis used in some PATR-ll grammars 11.5 I, or almost all categorial analyse~, in which general roles of combination play the role o1' specific phlr~se-stroctur¢ roles. Earley algorithm given below; cf. the Xerox LFG system}. Thus, if information about subcategorization is left out of the category information in the context-free skeleton, it can-not be used to eliminate prediction edges. For example, if we find a verb that subcategorizes for a noun phrase, but the grammar rules allow postverbal NPs, PPs, Ss, VPs, and so forth, the parser will have no way to eliminate the building of edges corresponding to these categories. Only when such edges attempt to join with the V will the inconsistency be found. Similarly, if information about filler-gap dependencies is kept extrinsic to the category information, as in a slash category in GPSG or an LFG annotation concern-ing a matching constituent for a I~ specification, there will be no way to keep from hypothesizing gaps at any given vertex. This \"gap-proliferation\" problem has plagued many attempts at building parsers for grammar formalisms in this style.","In fact, by making these stringent requirements on what information is used to guide parsing, we have to a certain extent thrown the baby out with the bathwater. These formalisms were intended to free us from the tyranny of atomic nonterminal symbols, but for good performance, we are forced toward analyses putting more and more information in an atomic category feature. An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the author's paper on LR syntactic preference parsing [14]. Because the LALR table building algorithm does not in general terminate for complex-feature-based grammar formalisms, the grammar used in that paper was a simple context-free grammar with subcategorization and gap information placed in the atomic nonterminal symbol."]},{"title":"2.2 Limiting grammars and parsers","paragraphs":["On the other hand, the grammar formalism can be left unchanged, but particular grammars dew,loped that happen not to succumb to the problems inhere, at in the g,,neral parsing problem for the formalism.

Unpublished work by Kent Witwnburg and by Robin Cooper has attempted to solve the gap proliferation problem using special grammars.","In building a general tool for grammar testing and debugging, however, we would like to commit as little ,as possible to a particular grammar or style of grammar.: Furthermore, the grammar designer should not be held down in building an analysis by limitations of the algorithms. Thus a solution requiring careful crMting of grammars is inadequate.","Finally, specialized parsing alg~withms can be designed that make use of information about the p;trtictd;tr grammar being parsed to eliminate spurious edges or h vpotheses.

Second, the subcategorization information used in top-down filtering removed all hypotheses of constituents except for those directly subcategorized [or. Finally, the grammar used contained constructs that would cause nontermination in the unrestricted extension of Earley's algorithm. 5.2 Other Applications of Restriction This technique of restriction of complex-feature structures into a finite set of equivalence cla~ses can be used for a wide variety of purposes.","First. parsing Mg<,rithnls such ~ tile ;d~<)ve (:all be modified for u~e by grain<nat (ortnalintus other than P.\\TR-ll.

The indexing can be done by discrimination nets, or specialized hashing functions akin to the partial-match retrieval techniques designed for use in Prolog implementations [16]. 6 Conclusion We have presented a general technique of restriction with many applications in the area of manipulating complex- feature-based grammar formalisms. As a particular exam- ple, we presented a complete, correct, terminating exten- sion of Earley's algorithm that uses restriction to perform top-down filtering. Our implementation demonstrates the drastic elimination of chart edges that can be achieved by this technique. Finally, we described further uses for the technique--including parsing other grammar formalisms, in- cluding definite-clause grammars; extending other parsing algorithms, including LR methods and syntactic preference modeling algorithms; and efficient indexing. We feel that the restriction technique has great potential to make increasingly powerful grammar formalisms compu- tationally feasible. References [I] Ades, A. E. and M. J. Steedman.
