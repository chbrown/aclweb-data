The main idea behind this theory is to apply tilt. notion that coordination remdts from *he union of phr,~e markers to the reduced I)hrmse marker. Since R PMs axe sets, this h,'m the desirable property that the union of RI'Ms wouhl just be the falltiliar set union operation. For a computer intplemeutation, the set union operation can be realized inexpensively. In contr,-Lst, the corresponding operation for trees would necessitate a much less simple and efficient union operation than set union. However, the original definition of the R.PM did not ~nvisage the union operation necessary for coordination. \"['he RPM w~ used to represent 2-dimensional structure only. But under set union the RPM becomes a representation of 3-dimensional structure. The admissibility predicates dominates zmd precedes delined on a set of monustrings with a single non-terminal string were inadequate to describe 3-dimensional structure.","B;~ically, Goodall's original idea w~ to extend the dominates ~m(l precedes predicates to handle RPMs under the set union operation.

In the actual system, an optimized but equivalent alternative definition is used. Although these definitions suffice for most examples of coordination, it is not sufficiently constrained enough to reject stone ungr,'mzmatical examples. For exaanple, fig. 5 gives the RPM representation of \"*John sang loudly and a carol\" in terms of the union of the RPMs for the two constituent sentences :- John sang loudly John sang a carol","{ {John.sang.loudly, S, John.V.Ioudly, John.VP, John.sang.AP, NP.sang.loudly} {John.sang.a.carol, S, John.V.a.carol, John.VP, John.sang.NP, NP.sang.a.caroi } (When thcse two I[PM.q are merged some of the elements o[ the set do not satisfy La.snik & gupin '~ ongimd deAuitiou - thc.~e [rdrs arc :-) {John.sang.loudly.
