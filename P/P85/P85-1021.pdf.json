Unlike other product-oriented efforts in the natural language understanding field, the HPSG system was designed and implemented by linguists on the basis of recent theoretical developments. But, unlike other implementations of linguistic theories, this system is not a toy, as it deals with a variety of practical problems not covered in the theoretical literature. We believe that this makes the HPSG system ,nique in its combination of linguistic theory and practical application.","The HPSG system differs from its predecessor GPSG, reported on at the 1982 ACL meeting (Gawron et al. 119821), in four significant respects: syntax, lexical representation, parsing, and semantics. The paper focuses on parsing issues, but also gives a synopsis of the underlying syntactic formalism."]},{"title":"1 Syntax","paragraphs":["HPSG is a lexically based theory of phrase structure, so called because of the central role played by grammlttical heads and their associated complements.' Roughly speaking, heads are linguistic forms (words and phrases) tl, at exert syntactic and semantic restrictions on the phrases, called complements, that characteristically combine with them to form larger phrases. Verbs are the heads of verb phrm~es (apd sentences), nouns are the heads of noun phra~es, and so forth.","As in most current syntactic theories, categories are represented as complexes of feature specifications. But the [IPSG treatment of lcxical subcategorization obviates the need in the theory of categories for the no-tion of bar-level (in the sense of X-bar theory, prevalent in much current linguistic research}. [n addition, the augmentation of the system of categories with stack-valued features - features whose values ~re sequences of categories - unilies the theory of lexical subcategoriz~tion with the theory of bi,~ding phenomena. By binding pimnomena we meaa essentially noJL-clausebounded delmndencies, ,'such a.~ th~rse involving dislocated constituents, relative ~Lnd interrogative pronouns, and reflexive and reciprocal pronouns [12 I. * iIPSG ul a relinwlJ~i¢ ~ld ¢zt.,~nsioll ,,f th~ clu~dy rel~tteu Gt~lmr~dilmd Ph¢.'tme Structulm Gran|n|ar lTI. The detaaJs uf lily tllt~J/-y of HPSG ar~ Nt forth in Ii|[.","More precisely, the subcategorization of a head is encoded as the value of a stack-valued feature called ~SUBCAT\". For example, the SUBCAT value of the verb persuade is the sequence of three categories IVP, NP, NP I, corresponding to the grammatical relations (GR's): controlled complement, direct object, and subject respectively. We are adopting a modified version of Dowty's [19821 terminology for GR's, where subject \"LS last, direct object second-to-last, etc. For semantic reasons we call the GR following a controlled complement the controller.","One of the key differences between HPSG and its predecesor GPSG is the massive relocation of linguistic information from phrase structure rules into the lexicon [5]. This wholesale lexicalization of linguistic information in HPSG results in a drastic reduction in the number of phrase structure rules. Since rules no longer handle subcategorization, their sole remaining function is to encode a small number of language-specific principles for projecting from [exical entries h, surface constituent order.","The schematic nature of the grammar rules allows the system to parse a large fragment of English with only a small number of rules (the system currently uses sixteen), since each r1,le can be used in many different situations. The constituents of each rule are sparsely annotated with features, but are fleshed out when taken together with constituents looked for and constituents found.","For example the sentence The manager works can be parsed using the single rule RI below. The rule is applied to build the noun phrase The manager by identifying the head H with the [exical element manaqer and tile complement CI with the lexical element the. The entire sentence is built by ideutifying the H with works and the C1 with the noun phrase described above. Thus the single rule RI functions as both the S -* NP VP, and NP ~ Det N rules of familiar context fRe grammars. R1. x -> ci hi(CONTROL INTRANS)] a* Figure I. A Grammar Rule."]},{"title":"167","paragraphs":["]Feature Passing","The theory of HPSG embodies a number of substantive hypotheses about universal granunatical principles, Such principles as the Head Feature Principle, the Binding Inheritance Principle, and the Control Agreement Principle, require that certain syntactic features specified on daughters in syntactic trees are inherited by the mothers. Highly abstract phrase structure rules thus give rise to fully specified grammatical structures in a recursive process driven by syntactic information encoded on lexical heads. Thus HPSG, unlike similar ~unification-based\" syntactic theories, embodies a strong hypothesis about the flow of relevant information in the derivation of complex structures. Unification","Another important difference between HPSG and other unification based syntactic theories concerns the form of the expressions which are actually unified. In HPSG, the structures which get unified are (with limited exceptions to be discussed below) not general graph structures as in Lexical Functional Qrammar [1 I, or Functional Unification Granmaar IlOI, but rather fiat atomic valued feature matrices, such as those ~hown below. [(CONTROL 0 INTRANS) (MAJ N A) (AGR 3RDSG) (PRD MINUS) (TOP MINUS)] [(CONTROL O) (MAJ H V) (INV PLUS)] Figure 2. Two feature matrices.","In the implementation of [[PSG we have been able to use this restrictiou on the form of feature tnatrices to good advantage. Since for any given version of the system the range of atomic features and feature values is fixed, we are able to represent fiat feature matrices, such as the ores above, as vectors of intcKers, where each cell in the vector represents a feature, and ~he integer in each cell represents a disjunctioa of tile possible values for that feature.

This is accomplished simply by a~ign-ing each possible value an index which is an integral power of 2 in this range and then adding up the indices so derived for each disjunction of values encountered. Unification in such cases is thus reduced to the \"logical and\" of the integers in each cell of the vector represent-ing the feature matrix. In this way unification of these flat structures can be done in constant time, and since =logical and\" is generally a single machine instruction the overhead is very low.

The unification of such structures could, in theory, involve arbitrary recursion on the general unification algorithm, and it would seem that we had not progressed very far from the problem of unifying general graph structures. Happily, the features for which this property of embedding holds, constitute a small finite set (basically tlte so called \"binding features\"). Thus we are able to segregate such features from the rest, and recurse only when such a \"category valued ~ feature is present. [n practice, therefore, the time performance of the general uailication algorithm is very good, essentially the sanze a.s that of the lint structure unification algorithm described above."]},{"title":"2 Parsing","paragraphs":["As in the earlier GPSG system, the primary job of the parser in the HPSG system is to produce a semantics for the input sentence. This is done compositionally as the phrase structure is built, and uses only locally available information. Thus every constituent which is built syntactically has a corresponding semantics built for it at the same time, using only information available in the phrasal subtree which it immediately dominates. This locality constraint in computing the semantics for constituents is an essential characteristic of HPSG. For a more complete description of the semantic treatment used in the HPSG system see Creary and Pollard [2]. Head-driven Active Chart Parser","A crucial dilference between the HPSG system and its predecessor GPSG is the importance placed on the head constituent in HPSG. [n HPSG it is the head constituent of a rule which carries the subcategorization information needed to build the other constituents of"]},{"title":"168","paragraphs":["the rule. Thus parsing proceeds head first through the phrase structure of a sentence, rather than left to right through the sentence string.","The parser itself is a variation of an active chart parser [4,9,8,13], modified to permit the construction of constituents head first, instead of in left-to-right order. In order to successfully parse \"head first\", an edge* must be augmented to include information about its span (i.e. its position in the string). This is necessary because heaA can appear as a middle constituent of a rule with other constituents (e.g. complements or adjuncts) on either side. Thus it is not possible to record all the requisite boundary information simply by moving a dot through the rule (as in Earley), or by keeping track of just those constituents which remain to be built (as in Winograd). An example should make this clear.","Suppose as before we are confronted with the task of parsing the sentence The manager works, and again we have available the grammar rule R1. Since we are parsing in a ~head first\" manner we must match the H constituent against some substring of the sentence. But which substring? In more conventional chart parsing algorithms which proceed left to right this is not a serious problem, since we are always guaranteed to have an anchor to the left. We simply try building the [eftmost constituent of the rule starting at the [eftmost position of the string, and if this succeeds we try to build the next [eftmost constituent starting at one position to the right of wherever the previous constituent ended. However in our case we cannot ausume any such anchoring to the left, since as the example illustrates. the H is not always leftmost.","The solution we have adopted in the HPSG system is to annotate each edge with information about the span of substring which it covers. In the example below the inactive edge E1 is matched against the head of rule R1, and since they unify the new active edge E2 is created with its head constituent instantiated with the feature specifications which resulted from the unification. This new edge E2 is annotated with the span of the inactive edge El. Some time later the inactive edge I,:3 is matched against the \"np\" constituent of our active edge E2, resulting in the new active edge E.I. The span of E4 is obtained by combining the starting position of E3 {i.e. t) with the finishing postion of E2 (i.e. 3). The point is that edges ~Lre constructed from the head out, so that at any given tame in Lhe life cycle of an edge the spanning informatiun on the edge records the span of contiguous substring which it covers.","Note that in the transition from rule ill to edge 1~2 we have relabeled the constituent markers z, cl, ~nd h with the symbols ~, np, ~utd VP respectively. This is done merely a.s ~t mnemouic device to reflect the fact that once the head of the edge is found, the subcategorization information on that head (i.e. the values of the \"SUHCAT\" feature of the verb work.s) is","An edi[e is, Iooe~y spea&ing, ,-tn inlCantiation of a nile witll ~nnle of tile [e~urml on conlltituentll m~de ntore spm:ifl¢. propagated to the other elements of the edge, thereby restricting the types of constituents with which they can be satisfied. Writing a constituent marker in upper case indicates that an inactive edge has been found to instantiate it, while a lower case (not yet found) constituent in bold face indicates that this is the next constituent which will try to be instantiated.

Using Semantics Restrictions","Parsing ~head first\" offers both practical and theoretical advantages. As mentioned above, the categories of the grammatical relations subcategorized for by a particular head are encoded as the SUBCAT value of the head. Now GR's are of two distinct types: those which are ~saturated\" (i.e. do not subcategorize for anything themselves), such as subject and objects, and those which subcategorize for a subject (i.e. controlled complements). One of the language-universal grammatical principles (the Control Agreement Principle) requires that the semantic controller of a controlled complement always be the next grammatical relation (in the order specified by the value of the SUBCAT feature of the head) after the controlled complement to combine with the head. But since the HPSG parser always finds the head of a clause first, the grammatical order of its complements, as well as their semantic roles, are always specified before the complements are found. As a consequence, semantic processing ~f constituents can be done on the fly as the constituents are found, rather than waiting until an edge has been completed. Thus semantic processing can be do.e extremely locally (constituent-to-constituent in the edge, rather than merely node-to-node in the parse tree as in Montague semantics), and therefore a parse path ,an be abandoned on semantic grounds (e.g. sortal iltconsistency) in the rniddle of constructing an edge. la this way semantics, as well as syntax, can be used to control the parsing process. Anaphora ill HPSG","Another example of how parsing ~head first\" pays oil is illustrated by the elegant technique this strategy makes possible for the binding of intr~entential a~taphors. This method allows us to assimilate cases of bound anaphora to the same general binding method used iu the HPSG system to handle other non-lexicallygoverned dependencies ~uch a.s ~ap.~, ~,ttt~ro~,t.ive pronouns, and relative pronouns. Roughly, the unbound dependencies of each type on every constituent are en- • coded as values of a,n appropriate stack-valued feature 169 (\"binding feature\"). In particular, unbound anaphors axe kept track of by two binding features, REFL (for reflexive pronouns) and BPRO ['or personal pronouns available to serve as bound anaphors. According to the Binding Inheritance Principle, all categories on binding-feature stacks which do not get bound under a particular node are inherited onto that node. Just how binding is effected depends on the type of dependency.","In the case of bound anaphora, this is accomplished by merging the relevant agreement information (stored in the REFL or BPRO stack of the constituent contain-ing the anaphor) with one of the later GR's subcategorized for by the head which governs that constituent. This has the effect of forcing the node that ultimately unifies with that GR (if any) to be the sought-after antecedent. The difference between reflexives and personal pronouns is this. The binding feature REFL is not allowed to inherit onto nodes of certain types (those with CONTROL value [N'rRANS}, thus forcing the reflexive pronoun to become locally bound. In the case of non-reflexive pronouns, the class of possible antecedents is determined by n,,difying the subcategorization information on the hel,,l governing the pronoun so that all the subcategorized-fl~r GR's later in grammatical order than the pronoun are \"contra-indexed\" with the pronoun (and thereby prohibited front being its antecedent). Binding then takes place precisely as with reflexives, but somewhere higher in the tree.","We illustrate this d~ttttction v, ti, kh I.~O examples. [n sentence S I below told subcategorizes for three constituents: the subject NP Pullum, the direct object Gazdar, and the oblique object PP about himself.' Thus either PuUum or f;uzdur are po~ible antecedents of himself, but not Wasow.","SI. Wasow was convinced that Pullum told Gazdar about himself. $2. Wasow persuaded Pullum to shave him.","[n sentence 52 shave subcategorizes for tile direct object NP him and an NP subject eventue.tly tilled by the constituent Pullum via control. Since the subject position is contra-indexed with tile pronoun, PuUum is blocked from serving a~ the a,tecedent. The pro,mun is eventually bound by the NP WanouJ higher up in the tree. Heuristics to Optiudze .\"Joareh","'['he liPS(; system, based as it is upon a carefully developed hngui~tic theory, has broad expressive power. In practice, how-ver, much of this power is often not necessary. To exploit this fact the IiPSC, system u.~cs heuristics to help r,,duve the search space implicitly defined by the grammar. These heuristics allow the parser to produce an optimally ordered agenda of edges to try ba.sed on words used in tile sentence, and on constituents it has found so far. • The pNpOlltiOll tl treltt~| eel~lttt~tllF :is a c:~se tam'king.","One type of heuristic involves additional syntactic information which can be attached to rules to determine their likelihood. Such a heuristic is based on the currently intended use for the rule to which it is attached, and on the edges already available in the chart. An example of this type of heuristic is sketched below. RI. x -> cl h a* Heuristic-l: Are the features of cl +QUE? Figure 6: A rule with an attached heuristic.","Heuristic-I encodes the fact that rule RI, when used in its incarnation as the S -- NP VP rule, is primarily intended to handle declarative sentences rather than questions. Thus if the answer to Heuristic-1 is \"no\" then this edge is given a higher ranking than if the answer is \"yes\". This heuristic, taken together with others, determines the rank of the edge instantiated from this rule, which in turn determines the order in which edges will be tried. The result in this case is that for a sentence such as 53 below, the system will prefer the reading for which an appropriate answer is \".a character in a play by Shakespeare\", over the reading which has as a felicitous answer \"Richard Burton\". S3. Who is Hamlet?","It should be empha~sized, however, that heuristics are not an essential part of the system, as are the feature passing principles, but rather are used only for reasons of efficiency. In theory all possible constituents permitted by the grammar will be found eventually with or without heuristics. The heuristics siu,ply help a linguist tell the parser which readings are most likely, and which parsing strategies are usually most fruitful, thereby allowing the parser to construct the most likely reading first. We believe that this clearly diifereutiares [IPSG from \"ad hoc\" systems which do not make sharp the distinction between theoretical principle and heuristic guideline, and that this distinction is an iznportant one if the natural language understanding programs of today are to be of any use to the natural language programs and theories of the future.
