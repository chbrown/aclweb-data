This paper presents a pragmatics-based framework for interpreting such utterances, ~ncluding identAfication of the spoa~r' s discourse ~oel in employing the fra~ent. We claim that the advantage of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone. INTRODOCTION","The fraRmentary utterances that are common in communication between humans also occur in man-Nachi~e OOmmUlLCcation. Humans perslat in using abbreviated statements and queries, even in the presence o/ explicit and repeated instructions to adhere to syntactically and semantically complete sentences (Carbonell, 1983) • Thus a robust natural langua@e interface must handle ellipsis.","We have studied one class of elliptical utterances, Intersentential fragments, in the context of an Information-seeklng dialogue. As noted by Allen(1980), such utterances differ from other forms of ellipsis in that interpretation often depends more heavily upon the speaker's inferred underlying task-related plan than upon preceding syntactic forms. For example, the fcllowlng elliptical fra@ment can only be interpreted within the context of the speaker's goal as communicated in the first utterance:","[EX1 ] aT want to cash this check. Smell bills only. * Furthermore, intersententiel fragments are often employed to communicate discourse 8oals, such as expressing doubt, which a syntactically complete form of the same utterance may not convey as effectively. In the following alternative responses to the initial statement by SPEAKER-I, F1 expresses doubt regarding the proposition seated by 3PEAEZB-I whereas F2 merely asks about the jet's contents. • This work has been partially supported by a grant from the National 3cAence Foundation, XST-8311~00, and a subeontraot from Bolt Beranek and Newmm'l Inc. of a grant flwm the Nationa~ ScAence Foundation, T~T-8~19162","S~A~R-I : \"The Korean Jet shot down by the Soviets was a spy plane.\" FI: \"With 269 people on board?\"~ F2: \"With infrared cameras on board?\" Previous research on ellipsis has neglected to address the speaker's discourse Eoals in employing the frasment but reel understanding requires that these be identified (Mann, Moore, and Levin, 1977) (Webber, PoZlack, and Hirschberg, 1982).","In this paper, we investlgate a framework for interpreting Intersententlal ellipsis that occurs in task-orlented dialogues.

Three possibilities exist: the syntactic ee Ta.~n fr'~ Flowers and Dyer(198~)"]},{"title":"188","paragraphs":["form ar precedlug utterances, the seaantlo representation of preceding utterances, and expectations gleaned from understanding the preceding disQourse.","The first two strategies are exemplified by the work oC Carbosoll and Hayes(1983), Hendrlx, Sacerdot¢, and Sloc,~( 1976), Waltz( 1978), and Velschedel and 3ondhelmer( 1982 ). Several limita-tions exist in these approaches, includiug an inabilit 7 to handle utterances that rely upon an assumed communication of the underlying task and difficulty in resolving ambiguity =\"oug multiple interpretations. Consider the following two dislo~e sequences:","SPEAE~R: \"I want to take a bus. The cost?\"","SPEAKER: \"I want to purchase a bus. The cost?\" Zf a semantic strategy is employed, the case frame representation for \"bus\" may have a \"cost of bus\" and a \"cost of bus ticket\" slot; a~hlgulty arises regardlug to which slot the elliptical fr~sment \"The cost?\" refers. Althou~ one might suggest extensions far handling this fra~ent, a semantic strategy alone does not provide an adequate frame~- wurk for Interpreting intersentential ellipsis. The third potential strategy utilizes a model c~ the information-seeker's inferred tank-related plan and discourse ~oals. The power of this approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversetiona~ goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterances alone.","Allen(1980) was the first to relate ellipsis processlug to the domain-dependent plan underlying a speaker's utterance. Allen views the speaker's utterance as part of a plan which the speaker has constructed and is executlug to accomplish his overall task-related goals. To interpret elliptical fragments, Allen first constructs a set of possible surface speech act representations for the elliptical fragment, limited by syntactic clues appearing within the fragment. The task-related ~oals which the speaker might pursue form a set o1\" expectations, and Allen attempts to infer the speaker's ~al-related plan which resulted in execution of the observed utterance. A part of this inference process involves determining which of the partially constructed plans connecting expectations (goals) and obeerved utterance are 'reasonable given the knovled~ and mutual beliefs of the speaker and hearer. Allen selects the surface speech act which produced the most reasonable inferred plan as the correct interpretation.","Allen notes that the speaker's fragment must identif7 the subg~als which the spea~er is pursu-Lug, but claims that in very restricted dmaains, identifying the speaker's overall ~ from the utterance ls sufficient to identify the appropriate response in terms of the obstacles present in such a plan. For his restricted do~aln involving train arrivals and departures, Allen's Interpretstlon strategy vurke well. In more complex domains, it Is necessary to identify the particular aspect of the speaker's overall task-related plan addressed by the clliptlcal frasment in order to interpret It properly. More recently, Litman and Allen(198q) have extended Allen's model to a hierarchy of task-plans and meta-plans. Litman is currently studying the interpretation of elliptical frasments within this enhanced framework. In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and plan-based strategies, a few other heuristics have been utilized. Carbusoll(1983) uses discourse expectation rules that suggest a set of expected user utterances and relate elliptical f~a~ents to these expected patterns. For example, if the syst~a asks the user whether a particular value should be used an the filler o£ a slot in a case frane, the system then expects the user's utterance to contain a confirmation or disson~Irmatlon pattern, a different filler for the slot, a comparative pattern such as \"too hard\", and so forth. Although these rules use expectations about how the speaker m~ght respond, they seem to have llttle to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker. Real understanding consists sot only of resognlzAr~","the particular surface-request or surface-lnform, but also of inferring what the speaker wants to accomplish and the relationship of each utterance to this task. Interpretation of ellipsis based upon the speaker's inferred under~ lying task-related plan and discourse Eoals facilitates a richer interpretation of elliptical utterances. REQUISITE KNCWLEDG E","A speaker can felicitously employ intersententlal ellipsis only Lf he believes his utterance will be properly understood. The motivation for this work is the hypothesis that speaker and hearer mutually believe that certain knowledge has been acquired during the course of the dialogue and that this factual knowledge along with other processing knowledge will be used to deduce the speaker,s intentions. We claim that the requisite factual knowledge includes the speaker,s inferred task-related plan, the speaker's inferred beliefs, and the anticipated discourse Eoala of the speaker; We claim that the requisite processing knowledge includes plan recognltlon strategies and focuslng techniques. 1. Task-Related Plan","In a cooperative information-seeking dAelogue, the ln~ormation-provider is expected to infer the ir~ors~ation-seeker, s underlying task-related plan an the dialogue pro~-eases. At any point An the dialo~e, ZS (the information-seeker) believes that soae subset of this plan has been coemunAmated to IP (the in~ormation-provider); therefore Y~ feeAa Juatl.rled in ~ormuAating utterances under the assumption that IP will use this inferred task model to interpret utterances, includIDg elliptleLL frasmente."]},{"title":"189","paragraphs":["An example will illustrate the importance of IS's inferred task-related plan in interpreting ellipsis. In the following, IS is conslderi~ purchase of a home mentioned earlier in the dialo- ~ue:","IS: \"What elementary school do children in Rolling Hills attend?\" ZP: \"They attend Castle Elementary.\" IS: \"Any nearby seim clubs?\" An informal poll indicates that most people interpret the last utterance as a request for swim clubs near the property under consideration in Rolling Hills and that the reason for such an interpretation is their inference that IS is investigating recreational facilities that might be used if IS were to purchase the home. However, if we substitute the frasment","• An~ nearby day-care centers?\" for the last utterance in the dialogue, then interpretation depen~ upon whether one believes IS wants hls/her children to be bused, or perhaps even walk, to day-care directly from school. 2. Shared Beliefs","Shared beliefs of facts, beliefs which the listener believes speaker and iistecer mutually hold, are a second component of factual knowledge required for processing intersentential elliptical fra6ments. These shared beliefs either represent presueed a priori knowledge of the domain, such as a pres~ptlon that dialogue participants in a unAvereity domain know that each course has a teacher, or beliefs derived from the dialogue itself. An e~ple of the latter occurs i~ IP tells IS that C3360 is a 5 credit hour course; IS may not himself believe that C3360 is a 5 credit hour course, but as a result of IP's utterance, he does believe it is mutually believed that IP believes this.","Understanding utterances requires that we identify the speaker's discourse goal in making the utterance. Shared beliefs, often called mutual beliefs, form a part of communicated knowledge used to interpret utterances and identify discourse goals in a cooperative dlalogue. The following e~a~le illustrates how IP' s beliefs about IS influence usderstan~Ing. IS: \"Who is teaching C~O0?\" IP: \"Dr. Brown is teaching C.~O0.\" IS: \"At ni~t?\" The frasmentar~ utterance \"At ni~t?\" is a request to know whether CS~O0 is meeting at night. Hc~- ever, if one precedes the above utterances with a quer~ whose rms~onse informs IS that CS~O0 meets only at ni~t, then the last utterance,","• At ni~t? = becomes an objection and request for corroboration or e~lanatlon. The reason for this difference in interpretation is the difference in beliefs regarding IS at the time the elliptical fragment is uttered. In the latter case, IP believes it As mutually believed that IS already knows IP' s beliefs regarcling when C/~O0 meets, so a request for that informatlon is not felicitous and a different intention or discourse goal is attributed to L~.","Allen and Perrault(1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and sug- ~sted their use in clarification and correction dlalogues. ~idner(1983) models user beliefs about system capabilities in her work on recognlzlng speaker intention in utterances. 3. Anticipated Discourse Goals","The speaker' s anticipated discourse goals form a third compocent of factual knowledge required for processing elliptical frasmenta. The dlalogue precedlng an elliptical utterance may sugEest discourse goals for the speaker; these sugEested discourse gcals become shared knowledge between speaker and hearer. As a result, the listener is on the lookout for the speaker to pursue these anticipated discourse goals and inter~ ~rets utterances accordingly. Consider for example the following dialogue: IP: \"Have you taken C3105 or C3170?\" I~: wit the Unlversity of Delaware?\" IP: \"No, anywhere.\" IS: \"Yes, at Penn State.\" In this example, IP's inlt~al query produces a strong anticipation that IS will pursue the discourse 8oal of provldlng the requested i~formatlon. There/ore subsequent utterances are interpreted with the expectation that IS will eventually address this 8oal. IS's first utterance is interpreted as ~u-sulng a discourse Eoal of seeking clarification of the question posed by IP; IS' s last utterance ansMers the initial query posed by IP. However discourse expectatlons do not persist forever with intervening utterances. . Processing ~owledp P1 an- recognl tlon strategies and focusing techniques are necessary components of processing knowledge for interpreting intersententlal eillpsis. Plan-recognltion strategies are essential I- order to In/er a model of the speaker's underlying task-related plan and focusing techniqces are necessary in order to identIDi that portion of the underlying plan to which a frasmentar7 utterance refers.","Focusing mechanAas have been employed by Gross(1977) in identifying the referents of definite noun phrases, by Robinson(1981) in interpreting verb p~vases, by ~ner( 1981 ) in anaphora resolution, by CarberrT(1983) in plan inference, and by McKeown(19fl~) in natural lan&uage generat~on."]},{"title":"190","paragraphs":["FRAmeWORK FOR PROCESSING ELLIPSLS","If an utterance is parsed as a sentence fragment, ellipsis processing begins. A model of any preceding dialogue contains a context tree (Carberry, 1983) corresponding to IS's inferred underlying task-related plan, a space containing IS's anticipated discourse goals, and a belief model representing IS's inferred beliefs.","Our framework is a top-down strategy which uses the informatlon-seeker' s anticipated discourse goals to guide interpretation of the fragment and relate it to the underlying task-related plan. The discourse component first analyzes the top element of the discourse stack and suggests potential discourse goals which IS might be expected to pursue. The plan analysis component uses the context tree and the belief model to suggest possible associations of the elliptical fragment with aspects of IS's inferred task-related plan. If multiple associations are suggested, the evaluation component applies focusing strategies to select the interpretation believed intended by the speaker --- namely, that most appropriate to the current focus of attention in the dialogue. The discourse component then uses the results produced by the analysis component to determine if the fragment accomplishes the proposed discourse goal; if so, it interprets the fragment relevant to the identified discourse goal. PLAN-ANALYSIS COMPONENT I. Association of Fragments","The plan-analysls component is responsible for associating an elliptical fragment with a term or conjunction of propositions in Is's underlying task-related plan. The analysis component determines, based upon the .current focus of attention, the particular aspect of the plan highlighted by IS's fragment and the discourse goal rules infer hcw IS intends the fra@Rent to be interpreted. This paper will discuss three classes of elliptical fragments; a description of how other fragments are associated with plan elements is provided in (Carberry, 1985).","A constant fragment can only associate with terms whose semantic type is the same or a super-set of the semantic type of the constant. Further-more, each term has a limited set of valid instantlations within the existing plan. A constant associates with a term only if IP's beliefs indicate that IS might believe that the uttered constant is one of the te.,-m's valid instantiations. For example, if a plan contains the proposition","Starting-Date( AI-CONF, JAN/5) the elliptical fragment","• February 2?\" wall associate w~th this proposition only if IP believes I3 might believe that the starting date for the AS conference is in February. Recourse to such a belief model is necessary in order to allow for Yes-No questions to which the answer is \"No\" and yet eliminate potential associations which a human listener would reCOgnize as unlikely. Although this discarding of possible associations does not occur often in interpreting elliptical fragments, actual human dialogues indicate that it is a real phenomenon. (Sidner(1981) employs a similar strategy in her work on anaphora resolution. A co-specifler proposed by the focusing rules must be confirmed by an inference machine; if any contradications are detected, other co-specifiers are suggested. )","A propositional fragment can be of two types. The first contains a proposition whose name is the same as the name of a proposition in the plan domain. The second type is a more general propositional fragment which cannot be associated with a specific plan-based proposition until after analyzing the relevant propositions appearing in IS's plan. The semantic representations of the\" utterances \"Taught by Dr. Smith?\" \"With Dr. Smith?\" would produce respectively the type I and type 2 pro pc si ti ons Teaches (_as : &SECTIONS, SMITH ) Genpred( SMITH ) The latter indicates that the name of the specific plan proposition is as yet unknown but that one of its parameters must associate with the constant Sml th.","A proposition of the first type associates with a proposition of the same name if the parameters of the propositions associate. A proposition of the second type associates with any proposition whose ~arameters include terms associating with the known parameters of the propositional fragment.","The semantic representation of a term such as \"The meeting time?\" is a variable term","_~me : &MTG- TMES Such a term associates with terms of the same semantic type in IS's plan. Note that the exlst-ing plan may contain constant instantiatlons in place of former variaOles. A term fragment still associates with such constant terms. 2. Results of Plan-Analysis Component","The plan-analysis component constructs a conjunction of propositions PLPREDS and/or a term PLTERM representing that aspect of the informatlon-seeker' s plan highlighted by the elliptical fragment; STERM and SPREDS are produced by substituting into PLTERM and PLPREDS the terms in IS's fragment for the terms with which they are associated in IS's plan."]},{"title":"191","paragraphs":["(1)mEarn-Credit(IS,CS360,FALL85)","such that Course-Offered(CS360,FALL85)"]},{"title":"] i","paragraphs":["(1)~Earn-Cre~t-Sectlon(IS,_ss:&SECTIONS)","such that Is- ~ection-Of(_ss: &3ECTION S, ~360 ) Is- Of fere,~(_ss: &SECTION S, FALL85 )","(1)~iearn-Materlal(IS,_ss:&SEcTIONS,_s~l:&SYLBI)","such that Is-Syllabus-Of(_ss:&SECTIONS,_s~l:&SYLBI)"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["(1)ILearn-Frem(I~,_fac:aSECTIONS,_ss:&SECTIONS)","such that Teaches(_fae:&FACULTY,_ss:&SECTIONS)"]},{"title":"[ i","paragraphs":["(1)IAttend-CIass(IS,_day:&MTG-DAYS,_tme:&MTG-T~S,~Ic:&MTG-PLC3)","such that Is- Mt g-Day (_ss: &SECTION S, day: &MTG- T~S ) Is-Mtg-Time (_ss: &SECT ION S,_tme: &~- T~S ) Is-Mtg-PIc(_ss:&SECTIONS,_plc:&MTG-~C~)"]},{"title":"J","paragraphs":["(1)'iearn-Text(IS,_txt:&TEXTS)","such that Uses(_ss:&SECTIONS,_txt:&TEXTS) Figure I: A Portion of the Expanded Context Tree for","It appears that h,-,ans retain as much of the established context as possible in interpreting intersententlal ellipsis.

The set of ACTIVE nodes in the context model form a stack of plans, the toP-most of whlca is the current focused plan; each of these plans is the expanslon of an action appearing in the plan Immediately beneath it in this stack.

EVALUATION COMPONENT","The analysis component proposes a set of potential associations of the elliptical fragment with elements of IS' s underlying task-related plan. The evaluation component employs focusing strategies to select what it believes to be the interpretation intended by 13 --- namely, that interpretation most relevant to the current focus of attention in the dialogue.","We employ the notion of focus domains in order to group finely grained actions and associated plans into more general related structures. A focus domain consists of a set of actions, one of which is an ancestor of all other actions in the focus domain and is called the root of the focus domain. If as action is a member of a focus domain and that action is not the root action of another focus domain, then all the actions contalnad in the plan associated with the first action are also members of the focus domain. (This is similar to Grosz's focus spaces and the notion of an object being in implicit focus.)","The use of focus domains allows the groupin8 together of those actions that appear to be at approximately the sa~me level of Impllcit focus when a plan is explicitly focused. For example, the actions of learnlr~ from a particular teacher, learning the material in a given text, and attend-Ing class will all reside at the same focus level within the expanded plan for earning credit in a course. The action of going to the cashler's office to pay one's tuition also appears within this expanded plan; however it will reside at a different focus level since it does not come to mind nearly so readily when one thinks about taking a course.","The following are two of seven focusing rules used to select the association deemed most relevant to the existing plan context.","[F1] Within the current focus space, prefer assoclatlons which occur within the current focused plan.","IF2] Within the current focus space and current focused plan, prefer associations within the actions to achieve the most recently considered action.

These Aatlcipated Discourse Goals provide very strong expectations for IS and may often be accomplished implicitly as well as explicitly.","The discourse ~als of the previous section also serve as anticipated discourse goals. Three additional anticipated discourse goals appear tO play a major role in determining how elliptical fragments are interpreted. One such anticipated discourse ~al is:"]},{"title":"193","paragraphs":["Accept-Questlon: IP has posed a question to IS; IS must now accept the question either explicitly, implicitly, or indicate that he does not as yet accept it. Normally dialogue participants accept such questions implicitly by proceding to answer the question or to seek information relevant to formulating an answer. However IS may refuse to accept the question posed by IP because he does not understand It (perhaps he is unable to identify some of the entities mentioned in the question) or because he is surprised by it. This leads to discourse goals such as seeking confirmation, seeking the identity of an entity, seeking clarification of the posed question, or expressing surprise at the question. THE DISCOURSE STACK The discourse stack contains anticipated discourse goals which IS is expected to pursue. Anticipated discourse goals are pushed onto or popped from the stack as a result of utterances made by IS and IP. We have identified a set of stack processing rules which hold for simple utterances. Three examples of such stack process-Ing rules are:","[SP1]When IP asks a question of IS, Answer-Question and Accept-Questlon are pushed onto the discourse stack.","[SP2]When IS poses a question to IP, Expand-Question is pushed onto the discourse stack. Once IP begins answering the question, the stack is popped up to and including the Expand-Questlon discourse goal.","[SP3]When IS's utterance does not pursue a goal sugEested by the top entry on the discourse stack, this entry is popped from the stack. The motivation for these rules is the following. When IP asks a question of IS, IS is first expected to accept the question, either implicitly or expllcltly, and then answer the question. Upon posing a question to ~P, IS is expected to expand upon this question with subsequent utterances or wait u~tll IP produces an answer to the question. Alt~oug~ the strongest expectations are that IS will pursue a goal suggested by the top element of the discourse stack, this anticipated discourse goal can be passed over, at which point it no longer sug~sts expectations for utterances. DISCOURSE INTERPRETATIOM COMPOM~T","The discourse component employs discourse expectation rules and discourse goal rules. The discourse expectation rules use the discourse stack to suggest possible discourse goal s for L~ and activate the associated discourse goal rules. These disnourse goal rules ttse the plan-analysis component to help determine the best interpretation of the fra~entar7 utterance relevant to the sug~sted discourse goal. If a discourse goal rule succeeds in producing an interpretation, then the discourse component identifies that discourse goal and its associated interpretation as its understanding of the utterance. I. Discourse Expectation Rules The top element of the discourse stack activates the discourse expectation rule with which it is associated; this rule in turn suggests discourse goals which the information-seeker' s utterance may pursue and activates these discourse goal rules. The following is an example of a discourse expectation rule:","[DE1]If the top element of the discourse stack is Answer-Question, then I. Apply discourse goal rule DG-Answer-Quest to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of answering the question. 2. If no interpretation is produced, apply rule S-Suggest-Answer-Questlon to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of suggesting an answer to the question. 3. If no interpretation is produced, apply discourse goal rule DG-Obtaln-Info to determine if the elliptical fragment is being used to accomplish the discourse goal of seeking information in order to construct an answer to the posed question. Once IS understands the question posed to him, IP's strongest expectation is that IS will answer the question; therefore first preference is given to interpretations which accomplis~ this goal. If IS does not immediately answer the question, then we expect a cooperative dialogue participant to work towards answering the question. This entails gathering information about the underlying task-related plan in order to construct a response. 2. Discourse Goal Rules","Discourse goal rules determine if an elllptl-cal fragment accomplishes the associated discourse goal and, if so, produce the appropriate interpretation of the fragment. These discourse goal rules use the plan-analysls component to help determine the best interpretation of the frasmentary utterance relevant to the suggested discourse goal. However these interpretations are not actual representations of surface speech acts; instead they generally indicate elements of the plan whose values the speaker is querying or specifying. In many respects, this provides a better \"understanding\" of the utterance since it describes what the speaker is trying to accompli~.","The following is an example of a rule associated with a discourse goal suggested by the stack entry Accept-Response; the latter is pushed onto the discourse stack when IP responds to a question posed by IS. 194 Obtain-Corrob The discourse component calls the plan-analysis component to associate the elliptical fragment with a term STERM or a conjunction of propositions SPREDS in IS's underlying task-related plan. If IP believes it is mutually believed that IS already knows IP's beliefs about the value of the term STERM or the truth of the propositions $PREDS, then identify the elliptical fragment as accomplishing the discourse ~al of expressing surprise at the preceding response; in partlcular, IS is surprised at the known values of STEP=M or SPREDS in li@~t of the new informet.lon provided by IP' s preceding response and the known aspect queried by IS's fragment.","The followin8 is one of several rules associated with the discourse ~al Answer-Question.

Our model cannot currently handle such fragments. This limitation is partially due to the fact that our mechanlems for retaining dialogue context are based upon the view that IS constructs a plan for a task in a deptb-flrst fashlon, completing Investlgation of a plan for C3200 before moving on to investigate a plan for CS263. Since the teacher of C3200 has nothing to do with the plan for taking C3263, the mechanisms for retaining dialogue context will fail to identify • teacher of CS263\" as the information requested by IS. One might argue that the elliptical fragment in the above dialogue relies heavily upon the syntactic representation of the preceding utterance and thus a syntactic strategy is required for interpretation. This may be true. However if we view dialogues such as the above as investigating task-related plans in a kind of \"breadth-flrst\" fa~hlon, then IS is analyzing the teachers of each course under consideration first, and will then move to considering other attributes of the courses. It appears that the plan-based framework can be extended to handle many such dialogues, perhaps by using meta-plans to represent how IS is constructing his task-related plan. CON CL USION S","This paper ha~ described a pragmatlcs-based approach to interpreting intersententlal elliptical utterances during an information-seeking dialogue in a task domsin. Our framework coordlnares many knowledge sources, including the informatlon-seeker' s inferred task-related plan, his inferred beliefs, his anticipated discourse goals, and focusing strategies to produce a rich interpretation of ellipsis, including identifica-tion of the Ir~ormatlon-seeker's d/scourse goal. This framework can handle many e-~mples wblch pose problems for other strate~Les. We claim that the advantage of tbls approach is its reliance upon pragmatic information, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than upon precise representations of the preceding utterance alone.
