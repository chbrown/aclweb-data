This attitude becomes true as a result of uttering a sentence with that feature.

Such derivations will be \"summarized\" as lemmas of the form \"If (conditions) are true, then any action making (antecedent) true also makes (consequent) true] These lemmas will be used to characterize illocutionary acts. though they are not themselves acts. For example, the lemma called REQUEST will characterize a derivation that shows how a heater's knowing that the speaker has certain goals can cause the hearer to act. The conditions licensing that chain will be collected in the REQUEST lemma, and will be shown to subsume those stipulated by Searle [261 as felicity conditions. However, they have been derived here from first principles, and without the need for a primitive action of requesting.","The benefits of this approach become clearer as other illocutionary arts are derived. We have derived a characterization of the speech act of informing, and have used it in deriving the speech act of questioning. The latter derivation also allows us to disting~tish real questions from teacher/student questions, and rhetorical questions. However. for brevity, the discussion of the.,e speech acts has been omitted.","Indirect speech acts can be handled within the framework. although, again, we cannot present the analyses here. Briefly, axioms similar to those of Perrauh and Allen {22] can be supplied enabling one to reason that an agent has a goal that q, ~iven that he also has a goal p. When the p's and q's are themselves goals of the hearer (i.e.. the speaker is trying to get the hearer to do something), then we can derive a set of lemmas for i,,lirect requests. Many of these indirect request lemmas correspond to what have been called %herr-circuited\" implicatures. which, it was suggested [211 underlie the processing of utterances of the form \"Can you do X?'. \"Do you know y?\", etc. l,emma formation and lemma application thus provide a familiar model of-herr-circuiting. Furthermore. this approach shows how one ran use general purpose reasoning in concert with conventionalized b~rms (e.g., how one can reason that \"Can you reach the salt\" is a request to pass the salt), a problem that has plagnwd most theories of speech acts.","The plan for the paper is to construct a formalism based on a theory of action that is sufficient for characterizing a request.

W~th these, we shall characterize what agents need to know to perform actions that art, intended to achieve their ~oals. The .zgents do so with Ihe knowledge that other agents operate similarly. Thus, agents have beliefs about .'her'~ gcals, and they have goals to influence others' beliefs and goals. The integration of these operators follows that of Moore {20l, who analyzes how an agent's knowledge affects and is affected by his actions, by meshing a possible-worlds model of knowledge with a situation calculus model of action [18]. By adding GOAL, we can begin to talk about an agent's plans, which can include his plans to influence the beliefs and goals of others.","Intuitively, a model for these operators includes courses of events (i.e., sequences of primitive acts) \" that characterize what has happened.

First, we have the usual consequential closure problems that plague possible-worlds models for belief. These, however, will be accepted for the time being. Second, the formalism will describe agents as satisfying certain properties that might generally he true, but for which there might be exceptions. Perhaps a process of non-monotonic reasoning could smooth over the exceptions, but we will not attempt to specify such reasoning here. Instead, we assemble a set of basic principles and examine their consequences for speech act use. Third, we are willing to live with the difficulties of the situation calculus model of action - e.g., the lack of a way to capture tnse parallelism, and the frame problem. Finally. the formalism should be regarded as a de,~eription or specification Bran agent, rather than one that any agent could or should use.","Our approach will be to ground a theory of communication in a theory of rational interaction, itself supported by a theory, of rational action, which is finally grounded in mental states. Accordingly, we first need to describe the_behavior of BEL, BMB. GOAL and AFTER. Then, these operators will be combined to describe how agents' goals and plans influence their actions. Then. we characterize how having beliefs about the beliefs and goals of othe~ can affect one's own beliefs and goals.
