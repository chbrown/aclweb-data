Mass. 02238 ABSTRACT","The goal of thls work is the enrichment of human-machlne mteractIons in a natural language envlronment. 1 We want to provide a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a speaker leeway tn forming an utterance about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it, A speaker and listener cannot be assured to have the same beliefs, contexts, backgrounds or goals at each point in a conversation. As a result, dlfflcultles and mistakes arise when a listener interprets a speakers utterance. These mistakes can lead to various kinds of mlsunderstandlngs between speaker and hstener. including reference failures or failure to understand the speaker's mtentlon. We call these mtsunderstandlngs mlscommunmatlon Such m~stakes constitute a klnd of \"ill-formed\" input that can slow down end possibly break down communication. Our goal ~s to recognize and Isolate such mlscommunlcattons and circumvent them. Thls paper will hlghhght a particular class of mlscommunlcatlon - reference problems - by descrlbmg a case study, includlng techniques for avoldlng failures of reference I Introduction","Cohen, Perrault and Allen showed in thelr paper \"Beyond Question Answering\" [8~ that \",.. users of cluestlon-answerzng systems expect them to do more than just answer isolated questions -- they expect systems to engage tn conversation. In doing ~o, the system ts expected to allow users to be less than meticulously hteral ~n conveying their zntentlons, and tt is expected to make hnguxstlc and pragmatic use of the previous discourse.\" Following in thelr footsteps, we want to build robust natural language processing systems that can detect and recover from mlsc~mmunlcatton. The development of such systems requires s study on how people communicate and how they recover from problems In communication. This paper summarizes the results of a dissertation [13] that tnvestlgates the kinds of mlscommunlcatlon that occur in human communication with a special emphasis on reference prooiems, i.e.. problems a listener has determining whom or what a speaker ts talking about. We have written computer programs and algorithms that demonstrate h~w one could handle such problems m","IThis reseorcn was suDDorted in port by the Oefenee Advonce4 Reseorch Pro~ect Aqency under ¢ontr=ct Neee14--77-- C-~378. the context of a natural language understand2ng system. The study of mzscommunlcatlon is a necessary task wlthm such a context since any computer capable of communlcat~ng with humans tn natural language must be tolerant of the tmprecIse, lll-devlsed or complex utterances that people often use.","Our current research [25, 26] views most dialogues as being cooperatlve and goal directed, l,e.. a speaker and hstener work together to achieve a common goal. The interpretation of an utterance involves Identifying the underlying plan or goal that the utterance reflects [5. I, 23]. Thls plan, however, is rarely, d ever, obvious at the surface sentence level. A central issue In the interpretation of utterances ts the transformation of sequences of imprecise, zlldevised or complex utterances into well-speclhed plans that might be carried out by dialogue participants. Within thls context, mlscommunlcatlon can occur.","We ere particularly concerned with cases of mxscommunlcatlon from the heater's viewpoint, such as when the hearer is mattentlve to. confused about, or misled about the zntentlons of the speaker. In ordinary exchanges speakers usually make assumptions regarding what thelr listeners know about a topic of discussion. They w111 leave out details thought to be superfluous [2. 19]. Since the speaker really does not know exactly what a listener knows about a topic, tt ts easy to make statements that can be misinterpreted or not understood by the listener because not enough details were presented. One principal source of trouble Is the description constructed by the speaker to refer to an actual object in the world. The descmptlon can be tmpreclse, confused, ambiguous or over!v speclflc. It might be interpreted under the wrong context. This leads to dlfflculty for the hstener when figuring out what oblect ~s being described, that Is. ref.erence identification errors. Such descriptions are \"all-formed\" input, the blame for ill-formedness may lie partly with the speaker and partly with the listener The speaker may have been sloppy or not taken the hearer into consideration, the listener may be either remiss or unwilling to admit he can't understand the speaker and to ask the speaker for clarification, or may slmply feel that he has understood when he zn fact has not.","Thls work ts part of an on-going effort to develop a reference Identlfzcatmn and plan recognition mechanism that can exhibit more \"human-hke ' tolerance of such utterances. Our goal zs to build a more robust system that can handle errorful utterances, and ~hat can be incorporated in exlstlng systems. As a start, we have concentrated on reference tdentlflcatzon. In conversation people use imperfect descriptions to communicate about objects; sometimes their partners succeed zn understanding and occasionally they fail.

We are developing a theory of the use of extensional descrlptlons that will help explam how people successfully use such imperfect descriptions. We call thls the theory of reference mlscommunlcation","Section 2 of this paper highlights some aspects of normal communication and then provides a general discussion on the types of miscommunlcatlon that occur In conversation, concentrating primarily on reference problems and motivating many of them with Illustrative protocols. Section 3 presents possible ways around some of the problems of miscommunxcation in reference. Motivated there is a partial Implementation of a reference mechanism that attempts to overcome many reference problems.","We are following the task-omented paradigm of Grosz [14] since it Is easy to study (through videotapes). It places the world In front of you (a primarily extensional world), and It limits the dlscusslon whlle still providing a rlch environment for complex descriptions. The task chosen as the target for the system Is the assembly of a toy water pump. The water pump Is reasonably complex, containing four subassemblies that are built from plastic tubes, nozzles, valves, plungers, and caps that can be screwed or pushed together. A large corpus of dialogues concerning thls task was collected by Cohen (see [7. 8. 9]). These dialogues contained instructions from an \"expert\" to an \"apprentice\" that explain the assembly of the toy water pump, Both participants were working to achieve a common goal - the successful assembly of the pump Thls domain Is rlch m perceptual information, allowing for complex descriptions of elements in it. The data provide examples of imprecision, confusion, and ambiguity as we!l as attempts to correct these problems","The following exchange exemplifies one such situation. Here A Is instructing J to assemble part of the water pump. Refer to Figure l(a) for a picture of the pump. A and J are communicating verbally but neither can see the other. (The bracketed text In the excerpt tells what was actually occurring while each utterance was spoken.) Notlce the complexity of the speaker's descriptions and the resultant processing required by the listener, Thls dialogue illustrates when listeners repair the speakers description in order to flnd a referent, when they repair their mztlal reference choice once they are given more information, and when they fall t ~. choose a proper referent In Linp 7, A :[,=scribes the two holes on the BAjEVALVE as \"the httle hoie\" J must repair the descrlptlon, reahzmg that A doesnt really mean \"one hole but is referring to t,~e 'two' holes.

Sometimes thls resolutlon Is postponed until the questlonable part of the utterance is actually needed. Shll. when all these fail. the hstener can ask the speaker to clarlfy what was said. 2","There are many aspects of an utterance that the hstener can become confused about and that can lead to mascommunacatton. The hstener can become confused about what the speaker intends for the referents, the actaons, and the goals described by the utterance, Confuslons often appear to result from confhct between the current state of the conversation. the overall goal of the speaker, or the manner In which the speaker presented the anformatlon. However, when the hstener steps back and is able to discover what k~nd of confuslon ~s occurring, then the confusion can qulte possibly be resolved. 2.1 Causes of mlscommunication","Thls sectaon attempts to motlvate a paradlgm for the kinds of conversation that we studled and traes to point out places m the paradlgm that leave room for mlscommumcatlon.","~'.1.1 Effects of the structure of task-oriented dialogues Task-oriented conversatlons have a speclfic goal to be achleved: the performance of a task (e.g.. [14]). The partlclpants in the dlalogue can have the same skill level and they can slmply work together to accomplish the task; or one of them, the expert, could know more and could direct the other, the apprentlce. to perform the task. We have concentrated prlmarlly on the latter case - due to the protocols that we examlned - but many of our observations can be generahzed to the former case, too. We will refer to thls as the apprentlce-expert domaln.","The vlewpomts of the expert and apprentlce differ greatly In apprentlce-expert exchanges. The expert, having an understandlng of the functlonahty of the elements in the task. has more of a feel for how the elements work together, how they go together, and how the indlvldual elements can be used. The apprentlce normally has no such knowledge and must base hls declslons on perceptual features such as shape [15].","The structure of the task affects the structure of the dlalogue [14}. partlcularly through the center of attentlon of the expert and apprentlce. Thls is the phenomenon called focus [14. 20. 24]. whlch, in task-orlented dlalogues Is a very real and operational thlng (e.g., focus is used In resolving anaphorac references). Shafts ~n focus correspond dlrectly to the task, ats subtasks, the oblects an a task and the subpleces of each object Focus and focus shifts are governed by many rules [14. :~0, 24] Confusaon may result when expected shafts do not take place. For example. If the expert changes focus to an object but never discusses Its subpaeces ~such as an obvaous attachment surface) or never bothers to talk about the object reasonably soon after its antroductlon (Le., between the tame of ~ts mtroductlon and its use. without digressing in a well-structured way In between (see [20])), then the apprentlce may become confused, leavang hlm r~pe for mlscommunlcatlon. The reverse anfluence between focus and oblects can lead to trouble, too. A shzft In focus by the expert that does not have a manHestatlon In the apprentlce's world wall also perplex the apprentice","Focus also influences how descr:ptlons are formed [15, 2]. The level of detail requlred in a description depends directly on the elements currently highlighted by the focus If the oblect to be descrabed Is samflar to other element~ m focus, the expert must be more speclhc m the formulation of the descraptlon or may conslder shlftmg focus away from the posslbly ambiguous objects to one where the amblgulty wont occur. 2.2 Consequences of miscommunicatlon In thls section we will make It clear that people do m:scommunlcate and yet they often manage to flx thlngs. We will look at speclfic forms of mlscommunlcatlon and descrlbe ways to detect them. We will hzghhght relatlonsh;ps between different mlscommunzcat;on problems but won't necessarzly demonstrate ways to resolve each of them. 2An analysis of clarification suodialogues can be found ;n [17)."]},{"title":"206","paragraphs":["2.2.1 Instances of mtscommun/cation","There are many ways hearers can get confused during a conversation. Figure 2 outlines some of them that were derived from analyzing the water pump protocols. This section defines and illustrates many of them through numerous excerpts. Each excerpt is marked in parentheses to show what modality of communication was used (see [9] for a description about the collection of these excerpts). Each bracketed portion of the excerpt explains what was occurring at that point in the dialogue. The confusions themselves, coupled with the description at the end of this section on how to recognize when one of them is occurring, provides motivation for the use of the algorithm outlined in Section 3 as a means for repairing communication problems. We will only discuss referent confusion tn this paper. The other forms of confusion - Action. Goal, and Cogmtive Load - are described in [11. 13]. Another categorization of confusmns that lead to conversation failure can be found in [22]. • Figure 2: A taxonomy of confusmns","Referent ~onfuslon occurs when the listener is unable to correctly determine what the speaker is referring to with a particular descrlptmn. [t occurs when the descriptions In the utterance are ambiguous or imprecise, when there IS confusion between the speaker and listener about what the current focus or context Is, or when the descriptions in the utterance are either incorrect or incompatible with the current or global context. Erroneous Specificity","Ambiguous (and. thus, imprecise) descnptxons can cause confusion about the referent. Excerpt 2 below illustrates a case where the speaker's description is underspecxfled - it does not provide enough dated to prune the set of possible referents down to one. Excerpt 2 (Pace-to-Face) S 1. And now take the little red 3. peg,","[P takes PLUG] 3. Yes, 4. and place it xn the hole at the 5. green end.","[P starts to put PLUG into OUTLETR of MAINTUBE] 6. no 7. the--in the green thing [P puts PLUG into green part of PLUNGER] P: 8. Okay. In Line 4 and 5, S describes the location to place a peg into a hole by giving spatial information. Since the location is given relative to another location by \"in the hole at the green end\", it defines a region where the peg might go instead of a specific location. In this particular case, there are three possible holes to choose from that are near the green end. The listener chooses one - the wrong one - and inserts the peg into it. Because this dialogue took place face to face, S is able to correct the ambiguity in Lines 6 and 7.","A speaker's description can be imprecise in several possible ways. (1) It may contain features that do not readily apply in the domain. In fine 3, Excerpt 3, the feature \"funny\" has no relevance to the listener. It is not until A provides a fuller description in Lines 5 to 8 that E is able to select the proper piece. (2) It may use a vague head noun coupled with few or no feature values (and context alone does not necessarily suffice to distinguish the object). In Excerpt 4, Line 9, \"attachment\" is vague because all objects in the domain are attachable parts. The expert's use of \"attachment\" was most likely to signal the action the apprentice can expect to take next. The use of the feature value \"clear'* provides little benefit either because three clear, unused parts exist. The size descriptor \"little\" prunes this set of possible referents down to two contenders. (3) Enough feature values are provided but at least one value is too vague leading to trouble. In Excerpt 5, Line 3, the use of the attribute value \"rounded\" to describe the shape does not sufficiently reduce the set of four possible referents (though, in this particular instance, A correctly identifies it) because the term is applicable to numerous parts In the dommn.

Improper Focus Focus confusion can occur when the speaker sets up one focus and then proceeds with another one without letting the listener know of the switch (i.e., a focus shift occurs without any indication). An opposite phenomenon can also happen - the listener may feel that a focus shift has taken place when the speaker actually never intended one. These really are very similar - one Is viewed more strongly from the perspective of the speaker and the other from the listener.","Excerpt 6 below lUustrates an mstance of the first type of focus confusion. In the excerpt, the speaker (S) shifts focus without notifying the listener (P) of the switch. As the excerpt begins, P ,s holding the TUBEBASE. S provides in Lines 1 to 16 mstructzons for P to attach the CAP and the SPOUT to outlets OUTLETI and OUTLET2, respectively, on the MAINTUSE. Upon P's successful completion of these attachments. S switches focus m Lines 17 to 20 to the TUSESASE assembly and requests P to screw tt on to the bottom of the M,e/NTUSE. White P completes the task. S realizes she left out a step in the assembly - the placement of the SLIDEVALVE into OUTLET2 of the M,eJNTUSE before the SPOUT ts placed over the same outlet. S attempts to correct her mistake by requesting P to remove \"the pies \"~ piece in ~nes 22 and 23.

Thus, Line 15 refers to \"the lower side hole in the M,41NTUBE\" for S and \"the hole in the TUBEBASE\" for J.

The \"nozzle-looklng\" part of the description convinced the listener that what he was looking for was something specific like a nozzle (which xs a small spout). Sometimes, when an oblect xs a clear representative of a specified analogy class, the apprent2ce may become confused, wondering why the expert bothered to form an analogy mstead of just directly describing the object as a member of the class. Hence, tt would not be surprising d the apprentice tgnoreu the best representatnve of the class for some less obvious exemplar.

The incompatibility of a referent or action is one signal of possible trouble. The appearance of an obstacle that blocks one from achieving a goal is another indication of a problem. Incompatibillty","Two kinds of incompat~btltty, action or referent. appear In the taxonomy of confusions. The strongest hint that there is a reference problem occurs when the listener finds no real world object to correspond to the speaker's description. This can occur when (1) one or more of the specified feature values xn the description are not satisfied by any of the pieces (e.g. saying \"the orange cap\" when none of the objects are orange~. {2) when one or more specified constraints do not hold (e.g., saying \"the red plug that fits loosely\" when all the red plugs attach tightly), or (3) If no one object satisfies all of the features specified m the description (I.e., ther'e-ts, for each feature, an object that exhibits the specified feature value, but no one object exhibits all of the values). An action problem xs likely ~f I l) the listener cannot perform the action specified by the speaker because of some obstacle; (2) the hstener performs the action but does not arrlve at its intended effect (I.e., a specified or default constramt lsnt satisfied); or (3) the current action affects a previous action tn an adverse way, yet the speaker has given no sign of any importance to this side-effect.

I Introduction","The previous section dlustrated how task-oriented natural language mteractlons in the real world can induce contextually poor utterances. Given all the possibilities for confusion, when confusions do occur, they must be resolved If the task is to be performed. This section explores the problem of fixing reference failures.","Reference Identification is a search process where a listener looks for something in the world that satisfies a speaker's uttered description. A computatlonal scheme for performing reference has evolved from work by other artificial intelligence researchers (e.g., see [14]). That tradltlonal approach succeeds if a referent ~s found, or falls d no referent ts found {see Figure 3(a)). However, a reference identlficatlon component must be more versatile than those constructed m the traditional manner.

First. It can occur between the listener and the speaker. The listener can step back, expand greatly on the speaker's descrlptlon of a plausible referent, and ask for conhrmatlon that he has indeed found the correct referent. For example, a hstener could mltlate negotiation wlth 'Tin confused. Are you talking about the thlng that is klnd of flared at the top? Couple inches long. It's kind of blue.\" Second. negotiation can be wlth oneself. Thls type of negotiation, called self-negotlatlon. Ls the one that we are most concerned wlth in thls research. The listener conslders aspects of the speaker's descrzptlon, the context of the commumcatlon, and the listener's own abdltles. He then apphes that dehberatlon to determine whether one referent candldate :s better than another or. if no candidate Is found, what are the most likely places for error or confuslon. Such negotlatlon can result in the listener testing whether or not a partlcular referent works. For example, linguistic descrlptlons can influence a listener's perception of the world. The listener must ask himself whether he can percelve one of the oblects in the world the way the speaker described it. in some cases, the listener's perceptlon may overrule the descrlptlon because the listener can't percelve ~t the way the speaker described it.","To repair the traditional approach we have developed an algorithm that captures for certain cases the listener's abdity to negotiate with himself for a referent It can look for a referent and.

[n our program we are uslng \"relaxation\" techniques to capture this behavior. Our reference identlhcatlon module treats descriptions as approximate It relaxes a description in order to find a referent when the hteral content of the description falls to provide the needed Information. Relaxation. however, is not performed blindly on the description We try to model a person's behavior by drawlng on sources of knowledge used by people. We have developed a computational model that can relax aspects of a descrlptlon using many of these sources of knowledge. Relaxation then becomes a form of commumcatlon repair [4] that hearers can use. 3.2 The relaxation component","When a description fails to denote a referent In the real world properly, It Is possible to repair tt by a relaxatlon process that ignores or modifies parts of the descrlptlon. Since a description can speclfy many features of an object, the order In which parts of It are relaxed Is crucial (i.e.. relaxing Ln different orders could yield matches to different objects) There are several kinds of relaxation possible One can ignore a constituent, replace It with something close, replace it with a related value, or change focus (i.e.. consider a different group of objects.). This section descrlbes the overall relaxatlon component that draws on knowledge sources about descriptions and the real world as it tries to relax an errorful description to one for which a referent can be sdentlfied. 3.2.1 Find a referent using a reference mechamsm","Identifying the referent of a description requires finding an element in the world that corresponds to the speaker's description (where every feature specified in the description is present In the element in the world but not necessarily vice versa). The initial task of our reference mechanism Is to determine whether or not a search of the (taxonomic) knowledge base that we use to model the world Is necessary. For example, the reference component should not bother searching - unless specifically requested to do so - for a referent for indefinite noun phrases (which usually describe new or hypothetical objects) or extremely vague descriptions (which do not clearly describe an oblect because they are composed of imprecise feature values). A number of aspects of discourse pragmattcs can be used in that determination (eg., the use of a delctlc In a definite noun phrase, such as \"thls X\" or \"the last X\", hints that the object was either mentioned previously or that it probably was evoked by some previous reference, and that it is searchable) but we will not examine them here.","The knowledge base contains linguistic descriptions and a descrlptton of the listener's vlsual scene itself. In our Implementation and algorithms, we assume It is represented In KL-One [3], a system for describing taxonomic knowledge. KL-One is composed of CONCEPTs, ROLEs on concepts, end links between them. A CONCEPT Is like a set. representing those elements described by it. A SUPERC link ('==>\") is used between concepts to show set Inclusion. For example, consider Figure 3. The SuperC from Concept B to Concept A is like stating BCA for two sets A and B An INDIVIDUAL CONCEPT ts used to guarantee that the subset speclhed by a concept Is unique The [ndlvldual Concept D shown m the figure Is dehned to be a unique member of the subset specified by Concept C ROLEs on concepts are like normal attributes and slot hllers m other knowledge representation languages.

If exactly one descr~ptlon Is below it, then the intended referent is assumed to have been found. Finally, if no referent is found below the classified descrxption, the relaxation component is invoked. We will only consider the last case in the rest of the paper.","3.2.2 Collect votes for or against relaxing the description","It is necessary to determine whether or not the lack of a referent for a description has to do with the description itself (i.e.. reference failure) or outside forces that are causing reference confusion. For example, the problem may be with the flow of the conversation and the speaker's and hsteners perspectives on it; it may be due to mcorrect attachment of a modifier; it may be due to the action requested; and so on. Pragmatic rules are Invoked to decide whether or not the descrxptlon should be relaxed. These rules will not be discussed here so we will assume that the problem lies in the speakers description. 3.2.3 Perform the relaxation of the description If relaxation Is demanded, then the system must (1) find potential referent candidates, (2l determine which features in the speaker's description to relax and in what order, and use those ordered features to order the potential candidates with respect to the preferred ordering of features, and (3~ determine the proper relaxation techniques to use and apply them to the description. Find potential referent candidates","Before relaxation can take place, potential candidates for referents (which denote elements in the listener's visual scene) must first be found These candidates are discovered by performing a \"walk\" tn the knowledge base taxonomy in the general vlclmty of the speakers classified description. A KL-One partial marcher is used to determme how close the candidate descriptions found during the walk are to the speakers description, The partial metcher generates a numerical score to represent how well the descrlptlons match (after first generating scores at the feature level to help determme how the features are to be aligned end how well they match). This score is based on information about KL-One and does not take mto account any information about the task domain.

We represent information from each knowledge source as a set of relaxation rules. These rules are written in a PROLOG-Iike language. Figure 5 illustrates one such linguistic knowledge relaxation rule. This rule is motivated by the observation in the excerpts that speakers typ~cally add more important informatlon at the end of a descrlpt~on (where they are separated from the ma~n part of the descrlpt~on and thus provided more emphasis). Since the syntactic constituents often at the end are relatlve clauses or predicate complements, we created this more specdic relaxatlon rule.

In these cases, the relaxation mechanism utilizes the part-whole relation in object descriptions to suggest a way to relax the speaker's description.","Relaxation of a description has a few global strategies that can be followed for each part of the description: (I) drop the errorful feature value from the description altogether, (2) weaken or tighten the feature value but keep its new value close to the specified one, or (S) try some other feature value.","These strategies are realized through a set of procedures (or reLa=,,tion methods) that are organized hierarchically. Each procedure is an expert at relaxing its particular type of feature. For example, a Generat e- Similar- Feature-Values procedure is composed of procedures llke Generate-Similar-Shape-Values, Generate-Similar-Color-Values and Generate-Similar-Size-Values. Each of those procedures are specialists that attempt to first relax the feature value to one \"near\" the current one (e.g., one would prefer to first relax the color \"red\" to \"pink\" before relaxing it to \"blue\") and then. d that fails, to try relaxing it to any of the other possible values.

The reference system can find a unique referent for the first obJect but not for the second. The relaxation algorithm will be shown below to reduce the set of referent candidates for the second description down to two. It. then. requires the system/listener to try out those candidates to determine if one. or both, fits loosely. The protocols exhibit a similar result when the listener uses \"fits loosely\" to get the correct referent (eg.. Excerpt 6 exemplifies where the \"fit\" can confirm that the proper referent was found).","Figure 7 provides a simplified and hnearlzed vlew of the actual KL-One representatlon of the speaker's descriptions after they have been parsed and semantically interpreted. A representation of each of the water pump objects that are currently under consideration is presented in Figure 8 Each provides a physical description of the object - in terms of its dimensions, the basic 3-D shapes composing it, and its physical features - and a basic functional description of the obJect. The first entry in each representation tn Figure 8 {that entry is shown in uppercase) defines the basic kind of entity being described {e.g.. \"TUBE\" means that the object being described is some kind of tube) The words in mixed case refer to the names of features and the words in uppercase refer to possible fillers of those features from things in the water pump world. The \"Subpart\" feature provides a place for an embedded description of an object that is a subpart of a parent object. Such subparts can be referred to on their own or as part of the parent object. The \"Orientation\" feature, used in the representations in Figure 8. provides a rotation and translation of the object from some standard orientation to the oblects current orientation in 3-D space. The standard orientation provides a way to define relative positions such as \"top,\" \"bottom,\" or \"slde.\"","Dlaerl:","I DCVIC~ ITrensperency C~ARI *Composition PL.ASTIC) iSuSpert I(~PL~NilIi ISUDpiTI 10111)) ISulleirt {T~ADS Ilii-Politlon [NDIt) IDlm4,nilonl I~nlth S.OII ilAiloli©il-~hlll T$111Jlilll","(FIT-INTO IOuter (D[VIC/ (Trlnsperencv C'~TARI ;Compos,t ,on PLASTIC) Shape R~O ) ( Ail@lo| I ¢li -.~hllpe 'r~.~ljt~R ) (Subpirl ~SA. ~¢ q('olor T'~T~QtrOl.~T);Ib)","¢ Inner )","ir,tCond|t~on LOOSEI ) Figure 7: The speaker's descriptions The first step in the reference process ts the actual search for a referent in the knowiedge base The reference identification process is incremental in nature, l.e,, the listener c~n begin the search process before he hears the complete description This was observed throughout the videotape excerpts and the algorithm presented here is actually deslgned to be incremental.

These rules attempt to order the feature values m the speaker's description for relaxation. First. we'll order the features m DescrZ using lingulstlc knowledge.

Whenever a feature has feature values that are close, then one should be prepared to relax any of them to any of the others (we call thls the \"clustered feature value rule\") [n thls example. smce the colors are all very close - BLUE. TURQUOISE, and VIOLET - then Color may be a reasonable thing to relax. Hxerarchlcal Information about how closely related one feature value Is to another can also be used to determine what to relax. The Shape values are a good example. A CYLINDRICAL shape Is also a CONICAL shape, which Is also a 3-D ROUND shape. Hence. It Is very reasonable to match ROUNDED to CYLINDRICAL. All of these suggestions can be put together to form the order:","~Sho~e.Co~or| < ~Su~l)art~ < |Trangporeflcy ,Compos i t i on.","Ana| og i ca I--Shope. F i I: |.","The referent candldates MAINTUBE. STAND, and .41R CHAMBER can be examined and possibly ordered for relaxation using the above feature ordering For this example, the relaxation of Descr2 to any of the candidates requires relaxing their SHAPE and COLOR features. Since they each require reiaxmg the same features, the candidates can not be ordered w, th respect to each other (i.e., none of the possible feature orders is better for relaxing the candidates). Hence. no one candidate stands out as the most likely referent.","While no orderlng of the candidates was posslble. the order generated to relax the features In the speaker's description can be used to guide the relaxation, of each candldate. The relaxation methods mentioned at the end of the last section come Into use here. Generate-Simdar-Shape-Values can determine that HEMISPHERICAL and CYLINDRICAL shapes of the AIR CHAMBER are close to the 3D-ROUND shape.. This holds equally true for the cyhndrlcal shapes of the MAINTUBE and the STAND. Generate-Similar-Color-Values next trms relaxing the Color TURQUOISE. It determmes the colors BLUE and GREEN as the best alternates. Here only two clear winners exist - the AIR CHAMBER and the STAND - while the MAINTUBE is dropped as a candidate smce it Is reasonable to relax TURQUOISE to BLUE or to GREEN but not to VIOLET Subpart, Transparency, Analoglcal- Shape, and Composition provide no further help {though. the fact that the AIR CHAMBER has both CLEAR and OPAQUE subparts mght put it slightly lower than the ST,hVD whose subparts are all CLEAR. Thls difference. however, is not slgndicant.). Thls leaves trial and error attempts to try to complete the FIT action. The one (if any) that fits - and fits loosely - Is selected as the referent. The protocols showed that people often do just that - reducing their set of choices down as best they can and then taking each of the remalnmg chmces and trying out the requested action on them 4 Conclusion","Our goal m thls work Is to budd robust natural language understanding systems, allowmg them to detect and avold mlscommunlcatlon. The goal is not to make a perfect listener but a more tolerant one that could avold many mistakes, though still wrong on occasion. In Section 2, we mtroduced a taxonomy of mlscommunlcatlon problems that occur tn expert - apprentice dialogues. We showed that reference mistakes are one kind of obstacle to robust communication. To tackle reference problems, we descrlbed how to extend the succeed/fad paradigm followed by previous natural language researchers","We represented real world objects hlerarchlcallv in a knowledge base using a representation language, KL-One. that follows in the tradition of semantlc networks and frames. In such a representatlon framework, the reference identification task looks for a referent by comparing the representation of the speakers Input to elements in the knowledge base by using a matching procedure. Failure to find a referent in previous reference identlhcatlon systems resulted In the unsuccessful termination of the reference task We claim that people behave better than this and exphcltly illustrated such cases in an expert-apprentlce domain about toy water pumps. We developed a theory of relaxation for recovering from reference failures that provides a much better model for human performance. When people are asked to identify objects, they go about it m a certain way. flnd candidates, adjust as necessary, re-try, and, if necessary, glve up and ask for help. We claim that relaxation is an Integral part of this process and that the particular parameters of relaxation differ from task to task and person to person. Our work models the relaxation process and provldes a computatlonal model for experimenting w~th the different parameters. The theory incorporates the same language and physical knowledge that people use m performing reference identification to guide the relaxation process. Thls knowledge Is represented as a set of rules and as data m a hierarchical knowledge base. Rule-based relaxation provided a methodical way to use knowledge about language and the world to find a referent. The hlererchxcal representation made It posslble to tackle issues of Impreclslon and over-specification In a speakers description. It allows one to check the position of a description in the hierarchy and to use that position to fudge Imprecision and over-speclfication and to suggest possible repairs to the descriptlon."]},{"title":"216","paragraphs":["Interestingly. one would expect that \"closest\" match would suffice to solve the problem of finding a referent. We showed, however, that it doesn't usually provide you with the correct referent. Closest match isn't sufficient because there are many features associated wlth an object and, thus. determimng whlch of those features to keep and which to drop Is a difficult problem due to the combinatorlcs and the effects of context. The relaxation method described circumvents the problem by using the knowledge that people have about language and the physical world to prune down the search space.
