Andrew David Beale","Unit for Computer Research on the English Language Bowland College, University of Lancaster","Bailrigg, Lancaster, England LA1 aYT. ABSTRACT","Research has been under way at the Unit for Computer Research on the ~hglish Language at the University of Lancaster, England, to develop a suite of computer programs which provide a detailed grammatical analysis of the LOB corpus, a collection of about 1 million words of British English texts available in machine readable form.","The first phrase of the pruject, completed in September 1983, produced a grammatically annotated version of the corpus giving a tag showing the word class of each word token. Over 93 per cent of the word tags were correctly selected by using a matrix of tag pair probabilities and this figure was upgraded by a further 3 per cent by retagging problematic strings of words prior to disambiguation and by altering the probability weightings for sequences of three tags. The remaining 3 to ~ per cent were corrected by a human post-editor.","The system was originally designed to run in batch mode over the corpus but we have recently modified procedures to run interactively for sample sentences typed in by a user at a terminal. We are currently extending the word tag set and improving the word tagging procedures to further reduce manual intervention. A similar probabilistic system is being developed for phrase and clause tagging.","~qE STI~JCTURE A~D PURPOSE OF THE LOB CORPUS.","The LOB Corpus (Johansson, Leech and Goodluck, 1978), like its American ~/gl~sh counterpart, the Brown Corpus LKucera and Francis, 196a; Hauge and ;Iofland, 1978), is a collection of 500 samples of British ~hglish texts, each containing about 2,000 word tokens. The samples are representations of 15 different ~ext categories: A. Press (Reportage); B. Press (Editorial); C. Press (Reviews); D. Religion; E. ~ills and Hobbies; F. Popular Lore; G. Belles Lettres, Biography, r'[emoirs,"]},{"title":"293","paragraphs":["etc. ; H. Miscellaneous ; J. Learned and Scientific; K. General Fiction; L. Mystery and Detective Fiction; M. Science Fiction; N. Adventure and Western Fiction, Romance and Love Story; R. Humour. There are two main sections, informative prose and imaginative prose, and all the texts contained in the corpus weee printed in a single year (1961).","The structure of the LOB corpus was designed to resemble that of the Brown corpus as closely as possible so that a systematic comparison of British and American written English could be made. Both corpora contain samples of texts published in the same year (1961) so that comparisons are not distorted by diachronic factors.","The LOB corpus is used as a database for linguistic research and language description. Historically, different ]inguists have been concerned to a greater or lesser extent with the use of corpus citations, to some degree, at least, because of differences in the perceived view of the descriptive requirements of grammar. Jespersen (1909-A9), Kruisinga and Erades (1911) gave frequent examples of citations from assembled corpora of written texts to illustrate grammatical rules. Work on text corpora is, of course, very much alive toda~v. Storage, retrieval and processing of natural language text is a more efficient and less laborious task with modern computer hardware than it was with hand-written card files but data capture is still a significant problem (Francis, 1980). The forthcoming work, A Comprehensive Grammar of the ~Elish Lan~la~e (Quirk, Greenbaum, leech, and ~arr.vik, 1985) contains many citations from both LOB and Brown Corpora.","A GRAF~ATICALLY ANNOTA~ VERSION OF ~E CORPUS","Since 1981, research has been directed towards writing programs to grammatically annotate the LOB cor~is. From 1981-83, the research effort produced a version of the corpus with every word token labelled by a grammatical tag showing the word class of each word form. Subsequent research has attempted to build on the techni~les used for automatic word tagging by using the output from the word tagging programs as input to phrase and clause tagging and by using probabilistic methods to provide a constituent analysis of the LOB corpus.","~e programs and data files used for word tagging were developed from work done at Brown University (Greene and BAbin, 1971). Staff and research associates at Lancaster undertook the programming in PASCAL while colleagues in Oslo revised and extended the lists used by Greene and R~bin (op.cit.) for word tag assignment. Half of the corpus was post-edited at Lancaster and the other half at the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities. How word tagging works.","~he major difficulties to be encountered with word tagging of written English are the lack of distinctive inflectional or derivational endings and the large proportion of word forms that belong to more than one word class. ~hdings such as -able, -ly and -ness are graphic realizations\"---of morphologlc'-~l units indicating word class, but they occur infrequently for the purposes of automatic word tag assignment; the reader will be able to establish exceptions to rules assigning word classes to words with these suffixes, because the characters do not invariably represent the same morphemes.","The solution we have adopted is to use a look up procedure to assign one or more potential ~ags to each input word. ~e appropriate word tag is then selected for words with more than one potential tag by ca]culatLug the probability of the tag's occurrence ~iven neighbouring potential tags. ~otential word tag assignment.","In cases where more than one potential tag is assigned to the inpu~ word, the tags represent word classes of the word without taking the syntactic environmeat into account. A list of one to five word flnal characters, known as the 's~ffixlist', is used for assignment of appropriate word class tags to as many word types as possible. A list of full word forms, known as the 'wordlist', i& used for exceptions to the suffixlist, and, in addition, word forms that occur more than 50 times in the corpus are included in the wordlist, for speed of processing. The term 'suffixlist' is used as a convenient name, and the reader is warned that the list does not necessarily contain word final morphs; strings of between one and five word final characters are included if their occurrence as a gagged form in the Brown corpus merits it.","~e 'suffixlist' used by Greene and Rubin (op.cit.) was substantially revised and extended by Johansson and Jahr (1982) using reverse alphabetical lists of approximately 50,000 word types of the Brown Corpus and 75,000 word types of both Brown and LOB corpora. Frequency lists specifying the fre~uehcy of tags for word endings consistlng of 1 to 5 characters were used to establish the efficiency of each rule. Johansson and J~r were guided by the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary ~hglish (1978) and other dictionaries and grammars including ~/irk, Greenbaum, Leech and ~art-vik (1972) in identifying tags for each item in the wordlist. For the version used for Lancaster-Oslo/BerEen word tagging (1985), the suffixlist was expanded to about 7~90 strings of word final characters, the wordlist consisted of about 7,000 entries and a total of 135 word tag types were used. Potential ~ag disambiguation.","~%e problem of resolving lexical ambiguity for the large proportion of English words that occur in more than one word class, (BLOW, CONTACT, HIT, LEFT, RA2~, RUN, REFUSE, RDSE, 'dALE, WATCH ...), is solved, whenever possible by examining the local context. '~rd tag selection for homographs in Greene a~d Rubin (op. cir.) was attempted by using 'context frame rules', an ordered list of 5,300 rules designed to take into account the tags assigned to up to two words preceding or following the ambiguous homograph. ~3~e program was 77 per cent successful but several errors were due to appropriate rules being blocked when adjacent ambi~lities were encountered (Marshall, 1983: 140). Moreover, about 80 per cent of rule application took just one immediately neighbouring tag into account, even though only a quarter of the context frame rules specified only one immediately neighbouring tag.","To overcome these difficulties, research associates at Lancaster have devised a transition probability matrix of tag pairs to compute the most probable"]},{"title":"294","paragraphs":["tag for an ambiguous form given the immediately preceding and following tags. ~his method of calculating one-step transition probabilities is suitable for disambiguating strings of ambiguously tagged words because the most likely path through a string of ambiguously tagged words can be calculated.","The likelihood of a tag being selected in context is also influenced by likelihood markers which are assigned to entries with more than one tag in the lists. Only two markers, '@' and '%', are used, '@' notionally Ludicat~ng that the tag is correct for the associated form less than 1 in lO occasions, '%' notionally indicating that the tag occurs less than 1 in lOO occasions. The word tag disambiguation program uses these markers to reduce the probability of the less likely tags occurring Lu context; '@' results in the probability being halved, '%' results in the probability being divided by eight. Hence tags marked with '@' or '%' are only selected if the context indicates that the tag is very likely. Error analysis.","At several stages during design and implementation of the tagging software, error analysis was used to improve various aspects of the word tagging system. Error statistics were used to amend the lists, the transition matrix entries and even the formula used for calculating transition probabilities (originally this was the frequency of potential tag A followed by potential tag B divided by the frequency of A. Subsequently, it was changed to the frequency of A followed by B divided by the product of the frequency of A and the frequency of B (Marshall,"]},{"title":"1983: l~w~ff)).","paragraphs":["Error analysis indicated that the one-step transition method for word tag disambiguation was very successful, but it was evident that further gains could be made by including a separate list of a small set of sequences of words such as accordin~ to, as well as, and so as to which were retagged prior to word tag disambigu.~ t ior~. Another modification was to include an algorithm for altering the values of sequences of three tags, such as constructions with an intervening adverb or simple co-ordinated constructions such that the two words on either side of a co-ordinating conjunction contained the same tag where a choice was available.","No value in the matrix was allowed to be as little as zero, by providing a minimum positive value for even extremely unlikely tag co-occurrences; this allowed at least some kind of analysis for unusual or eccentric syntax and prevented the system from grinding to a halt when confronted with a construction that it did not recognize.","Once these refinements to the suite of word tagging programs were made, the corpus was word-tagged. It was estimmted that the number of manual post-editing interventions had been reduced from about 230,000 required for word tagging of the Brown corpus to about 35,000 required for the IDB corpus (Leech, Garside and Atwell, 1983: 36). The method achieves far greater consistency than could be attained by a human, were such a person able to labour through the task of attributing a tag to every word token in the corpus.","A record of decisions made at the post-editing stage was kept for the purpose of recording the criteria for judging whether tags were considered to be correct or not (Atwell, 1982b). Improving word tagging.","Work currently being undertaken at Lancaster includes revising and extending the word tag set and improving the suite of programs and data files required to carry out automatic word tagging. Revision of the word tag set.","The word tag set is being revised so that, whenever possible, tags are mnemonic such that the characters chosen for a tag are abbreviations of the grammatical categories they represent. This criterion for word tag improvement is solely for the benefit of human intelligibility and in some cases, because of conflicting criteria of distinctiveness and brevity, it is not always possible to devise clearly mnemonic tags. For instance, nouns and verbs can be unequivocally tagged by the first letter abbreviations 'N' and 'V', but the same cannot be said for articles, adverbs and adjectives. These categories are represented by the tags 'AT', 'RR', and 'JJ'.","It was decided, on the grounds of improving mnemonicity, to change representation of the category of number in the tag set. In the old tag set, singular forms of articles, determiners, pronouns and nouns were unmarked, and plural forms had the same tags as the singular forms but with 'S' as the end character denoting plural. As far as mnemonicity is concerned, this is confusing, especially to someone uninitiated in the refinements of LOB tagging. In the new tag set, number is"]},{"title":"295","paragraphs":["now marked by having 'I' for singular forms, 'P' for plural forms and no number character for nouns, articles and determiners which exhibit no singular or plural morpLolo~ical distJnctJveaess (COD,","A~ is d~siralC,_e, both for the purposes of human intelligibility and for mechanical processing, to make the tagged system as hierarchized as possible. In the old tag set m,xial verbs, and forms of the verbs BE, DO and HAVE were tagged as 'r~,'', 'B\", 'D\", and 'H\" (where ''' ~epresents any of the characters used for these tags denoting sub~lasses of each tag class).

There is a~ essential distributional restriction on subclasses of adjectives occurring only attributively or predicatively, and it was considered appropriate t~notate this in the tag set in a consistent manner. The attributive category has been introduced for comparative adjectives, 'JBR', (bq=PER, ~;T~ ...) and superlative adjectives, 'JBT', (U~OST, UTTEI~OST ... ).","As a further example of improving the linguistic categorization without affecting the proportion of correctly tagged word forms, consider the word ONE. In the old tagging system, this word was always assigned the tag 'CDI'. This is unsatisfactory, even though ~TE is always assigned the tag it is supposed to receive, because O~FE is not simply a singular cardinal number.

It is ~herefore approprl'~e f-To'~ ~,~C~,~o be assigned 5 potential tags, 'CDI', '~TI', and '~TNI', one of which is to be selected by the transition probability procedure. Revision of the programs and data files.","Revision of the word tag set has necessitated extensive revision of the word- and suffixlists. The transition matrix will be adapted so that the corpus can be retagged with tags from the new word tag set. In addition, programs are being revised to reduce the need for special pre-editing and input format requirements. In this way, it will be possible for th~ system to tag ~glJsh tex~s or:her than the LOB corpus without pre-edJ ring. Reducing Pre-editing.","For the 1983 version of the ta~ged corpus, a pre-editin E stage was carried out partly by computer and partly by a h,~man pre-editor (Atwell, 1982a). As part of this stage, the computer automatically reduced all sentence-initial capital letters and the hum~ pre-editor recapitalizsd those sentence initial characters that began proper nouns. We are now endeavourin E to cut out this phase so that the automatic tagg~n E suite can process inp, xt text in its normal orthographic form as mixed case characters.","Eentence boundaries were explicitly • ~arked, an part of thp input ~eq~:irements ::o the tag~.in~ procedures, and since the word class of a word with an initial capital letter is significantly affected by whether it occurs at the beginning of a sentence, it was considered appropriate to make both sentence boundary recognition and word class assignment of words with a word init.ial capital automatic. All entries in the"]},{"title":"296","paragraphs":["word list now appear entirely in lower case and words which occur with different tags according to initial letter status (board, march, may, white ...) are assigned tags accordzng t~---\"o a field selection procedure: the appropriate tags are given in two fields, one for the initial upper case form (when not acting as the standard beginning-of-sentence marker) and the other for the initial lower case form. The probability of tags being selected from the alternative lists is weighted according to whether the form occurs at the beginning of the sentence or elsewhere.","Knut Hofland estimated a success rate of about 9a.3 per cent without pre-editing (Leech, Garside and Atwell, 1983: 36). Hence, the success rate only drops by about 2 per cent without pre-editing. Nevertheless, the problems raised by words with tags varying according to initial capital letter status need to be solved if the system is to become completely automatic and capable of correct tagging of standard text. Constituent ;alalysis.","The high success rate of word tag selection achieved by the one-step probability disambiguation procedure prompted us to attempt a similar method for the more complex tasks of phrase and clause tagging. The paper by Garside and Leech in this volume deals more fully with this aspect of the work.","Rules and symbols for providing a constituent analysis of each o£ the sentences in the corpus are set ~t in a Case-law Manual (Sampson, 198~) and a series of associated documents give the reasoning for the choice of rules and symbols (Sampson, 1983 - ). Extensive tree drawing was ,mdertaken while the Case-Law ~anual was beinz written, partly to establish whether high-level tags and rules for hig~h-level tag assignment needed to be modified in the light of the enormous variety and complexity of ordinary sentences in the corpus, and partly to create a databank of manually parsed samples of the LOB corpus, for the purposes of providing a first-approximation of the statistical data required to disambiguate alternative parses.","To date, about 35,O00 words (I,500 sentences) have been manually parsed and keyed into an ICL ~/E 2900 machine. W~ are presently aimin~ for a tree bank of about 50,0OO words of evenly distributed samples taken from different corpus categories r,presenting a cross-section of about 5 per cent of the word tagged c or!m~ s. The future.","It should be made clear to the reader that several aspects of the research are cumulative. For instance, the statistics derived from the tagged Brown corpus were used to devise the one-step probability program for word tag disambiguation. Similarly, the word tagged LOB corpus is taken as the input to automatic parsing.","At present, we are attempting to : provide constituent structures for the LOB corpus. Many of these constructions are long and complex; it is notoriously difficult to summarise the rich variety of written ~hg!ish, as it actually occurs in newspapers and books, by using a limited set of rewrite rules. Initially, we are attempting to parse the LOB corpus using the statistics provided by the tree bank and subsequently, after error analysis and post-editing, statistics of the parsed corpus can be used for further research.
