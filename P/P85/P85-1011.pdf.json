Adjoining does not depend on thn context (tree context) around the node n. In this sense, adjoining is context-free.","In [Jmhi ,19831, I~al constraints on adjoining similar to those investigated by [Joshi and Levy ,1977] were considered.These are a generalization of the context-sensitive constraints studied by [Peters and Ritchie ,1~9]. It was soon recognized, however, that the full power of these constraints was never fully utilized, both in the linguistic context as well as in the \"formal languages' of TAG's. The so-called proper analysis contexts and domination contexts (as defined in [Jmhi and Levy ,197T]) as used in [Joshi ,1983J always turned out to be such that the context elements were always in a specific elementary tree i.e., they were further localized by being in the same elementary tree. Based on this observation and a suggestion in [Jaehi, Levy and Takahashi ,1975], we will deseribe a new way of introducing local constraints. This approach not only captures the insight stated above, but it is truly in the spirit of TAG's. The earlier approach was not so, although it was certainly adequate for the investigation in [Jmhi ,1983J. A precise characterization of that approach still remains an open problem.","G -- (I,A) be a TAG with local constraints if for each elementary tree t E l t.J A, and for each node, n, in t, we specify the set ~ of auxiliary trees that nan be adjoined at the node n. Note that if there is no constraint then all auxiliary trees are adjoinable at n (of course, only those whose root has the same label as the label of th* node s). Thus, in general, ~ is a subset o( the set of all the auxiliary trees adjoiuable at n. We will adopt the following conventions. 1. Since. by definition, no auxiliary trees are adjoinable to a node labelled by a terminal symbol, no constraint has to be stated for node labelled by a terminal.","2. If there is no constraint, i.e., all auxiliary trees (with the appropriate root label} are adioinable at a node, say, u, then we will not state this explicitly.","3. if no auxiliary trees are adjoinable at a node n, then we will write the constraint as ($~, where $ denotes the null set. We will alE.~ allow for the possibility that for a node at least one adjoining is obligatory, of course, from the set of all ixxmible auxiliary trees adjoiuable at that node. Hence, a TAG with Meal constraints is defined as follows. G = (I, A) is a TAG with local constraints dr for each node, n. in each tree t, be speeify one (and only one) of the following constraints. 1.

This seems to be in co•trust with our definition of how to associate local constraints with the •odes in a se•te•tial tree. We should have added the root of the auxiliary tree instead to the element of the array being computed, since so far u the local constraints are concerned,this •ode decides the local constraints at this node in the derived tree. However, this scheme cannot be adopted in oar algorithm for obvious reasons. We let pairs of the form (g,C) belong to elements of the array, where g is -- before and C represents the local constraints to be associated with this •ode.","We then alter the algorithm as follows.

Adjoining ~ at the root of the sub-tree ~ gives us the senteutiaJ tree in Fig 5.1. We eros, now see how the string whx has • wrapped around* the sub-tree i.e,the string ugv. This seems to suggest that there is something similiar m the role played by the foot in an auxilliary tree and the head in a Head Grammar how the adjoining operations and head-wrapping operations operate on strings. We could say that if X is the root of ~ auxilliary tree t~ and al...x i X a~+t...a ~ is the frontier o( a derived tree ~ E D(~}, then the derivation of 7 would correspond to a derivation from a non-terminal X to the string al...a 4 1ai÷t...a~ in HG and the use of 7 in some senteutial tree would correspond to how the strings al... a 5 and ~÷t...a~ are used in deriving, string in HL. a=","S /\\ / \\ / X \\ / /-\\ \\","/ /-- - \\ \\~_~_'7 ugv $ /\\ / \\ ! \\ / x \\"]},{"title":",hT-~-x u~","paragraphs":["~= X"]},{"title":"/\\","paragraphs":["/ \\ / \\ / X \\ v h •"]},{"title":"ri~r, s.J1","paragraphs":["91","Based on this observation, we attempt ¢4) show the close relationship of TAL'o and HL's.
