Appelt","Artificial Intelligence Center, SRI International","and","Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford University"]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["In this paper we examine the pragmatic knowledge an utterance-planning system must have in order to produce certain kinds of definite and indefinite noun phrases. An utterance.planning system, like other planning systems, plans actions to satisfy an agent's goals, but allows some of the actions to consist of the utterance of sentences. This approach to language generation emphasizes the view of language as action, and hence assigns a critical role to pragmatics.","The noun phrases under consideration in this paper are those that presuppose the existence of an individual that could be described by the description D. In other words, when a speaker uses a noun phrase with description P, it makes sense to ask the question \"Which x is P? ~ This criterion includes more than strictly referential uses of noun phrases, because it is not necessary for the speaker or hearer to k'now what individual is described by D -- it is merely necessary that the existence of such an individual is presupposed. Consider the attributive description in sentence"]},{"title":"(l}:","paragraphs":["The runner who wins tomorrow's race will qualify (I) for the semifinals. The description \"runner who wins tomorrow's race\" cannot be referential, because, under ordinary circumstances, the speaker could not possibly know who it is that wouid fit the description. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to ask which runner will win tomorrow's race, because the description is objectively true of some individual.","This qualification excludes noun phrases whose referents are bound within the scope of a universal quantifier, such as \"the woman ...\" in (2) Every man wants to meet the woman of his dreams. For a similar reason, indefinites within the scope of a sentential negation axe excluded because they introduce an existential quantifier, which, under the scope of negation, is really a universal quantifier. Therefore, \"a screwdriver\" in (3) John does not have a screwdriver. is excluded because, under most circumstances of its use, there is no screwdriver that the description in sentence (3) denotes. Predicate nnminal~ are excluded, as in the sentence (4) John wants to be a doctor. because one would not ask the question \"Which doctor does John want to be?*","The choice of this particular class of noun phrases is motivated by considerations relevant to planning. When a speaker communicates with a hearer, he often intends the hearer to hold some attitudes toward individuals in the do-main. This is particularly true in task-oriented dialogues where the hearer may have to locate and manipulate things in his environment.","The theory of utterance planning assumed for the purpose of this analysis is the one embodied in KAMP lAppelt, 1985). Individuals are represented by terms in an intensional logic of knowledp~e and acti,m. A metalanguage is used to axiomatize the relationship that holds between the terms and the individuals they denote. The terms can consist of predicates combined with an iota operator, as in Lz D(z), where D{z) = D,(z) A...A D.(.c). The predicates O~ are called descriptor.9, and their conjunction. D, is called a description. Because most noun phrases employ terms that are constructed from ;x description, often the words \"term\" and \"description ~ aro ,,sed interchangeably.","The propositional content ~,f the spe;~ker'~ ~ltterance is represented by a sentence in the intensi~,nal [ogm involving the terms discussed above. Uttering a sentence entails performing a number of actions, called concept activation actions, which result in the terms constituting the proposition receiving a special status called \"active. \" The proposition"]},{"title":"198","paragraphs":["that the speaker intends to convey is a predication involving the active terms. Referring is a particular type of concept activation action with relatively strict conditions on what must be mutually believed by the speaker and hearer for the action to succeed. Searle {1969) presents an analysis of referring as a speech act and dismisses many uses of noun phrases as nonreferring. Such nonreferring noun phrases occur very frequently, and the considerations that underly their planning share much in common with those that underly actual referring. Therefore, the concept activation action provides a suitable generalization that allows a plan-based treatment of many more uses of noun phrases."]},{"title":"2 Research Objectives","paragraphs":["The analysis presented in this paper represents one of the first steps toward a plan-based account of definite and indefinite noun phrases. Ideally, such an account would (1) provide a semantics for noun phrases, (2) define an actions like \"uttering a definite noun phrase, ~ and (3) provide an analysis that shows how the speaker's intentions follow directly from the semantics of the noun phrase he utters, plus conditions on mutual knowledge and general principles of rationality. This program is very much in the spirit of the analysis of illocutionary acts provided by Cohen and Levesque (1980), who demonstrate how illocutionary acts can be defined in terms of the kinds of inferences made, given a semantic analysis of an utterance, facts about mutual knowledge, and general principles of rational behavior.","Cohen ( 1984} provided such an analysis for referring actions by postulating a semantics for the definite determiner that would give the semantics of a definite noun phrase as a request to identify the referent of a description. This analysis would be impossible to extend to the more general concept activation actions, because, in some cases, the speaker intends that the hearer"]},{"title":"not","paragraphs":["identify the denotation of the description, even when a definite noun phrase is used. A complete analysis along these lines that subsumes both referring and nonreferring noun phrases has yet to be worked out.","As an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal, we shall propose a taxonomy of concept activation actions that convey the various intentions a speaker may have with respect to a hearer and a description. This taxonomy is of theoretical interest, because it characterizes differences and similarities among uses of noun phrases that current theories do not characterize. It is also of practical interest for utterance planning, because the set of actions to be proposed provides a useful level of abstraction for the reasoning processes of an utterance-planning system. For example. certain planning strategies such as action subsumption {Appelt. 1985} axe applicable only to certain kinds of concept activation actions and not to others. Therefore, even if the complete plan-based analysis of noun ph~ is worked out, the taxonomy of actions presented here will still be of practical importance.","Until an analysis like Cohen and Levesque's is worked out, the concept activation actions here will be treated like illocutionary acts in a speech-act theory. When a hearer understands an utterance, he reasons about whether it constitutes an assertion, a request, a warning, etc. Therefore, understanding one of the definite or indefinite noun phrases under consideration in this paper is assumed to entail recognition of what concept activation action the speaker intends to perform."]},{"title":"3 Summary of Actions Underlying Noun Phrases","paragraphs":["There are many distinctions that one could draw between noun phrases, only some of which are relevant to planning. For example, one could distinguish noun phrases that refer to amorphous substances from those that refer to discrete entities. Such a distinction may have some valid motivation, but it is not necessarily so from the standpoint of planning. It would be well motivated only if there were a clear difference in the preconditions and effects of the concept activation actions-underlying mass terms, or in the strategy for the selection of descriptors. This does not seem to be the case for mass versus discrete entities.","However, there are two criteria that clearly affect the relevant preconditions, intended effects, and planning strategies of concept activation actions: {l) whether the speaker intends that the hearer"]},{"title":"identify","paragraphs":["the denotation of the description, and {2) how much mutual knowledge the speaker and hearer share about the description's denotation. The first criterion is what {roughly} distinguishes referring noun phrases from nonreferring noun phrases. The necessity, of the hearer performing the identification constrains the description to be one that facilitates the hearer's formulation of a plan to do so.","The second criterion is the knowledge that is shared by the speaker and the hearer at the time of the utterance. Planning strategies are influenced by whether or not the speaker and hearer mutually believe appropriate facts about the intended referent. In particular, if the speaker and hearer share enough knowledge about the descriptions denotation and the contextual situation, it may be possible for the hearer to recognize the speakers intenrt,~as using only a subset of the descriptors in the n~mn phrase's description.

Seaxle (1969) sta~es that \"So identification ... rests squarely on the speaker's ability to supply an expression ... which is satisfied uniquely by the object to which he intends to refer.\" What counts as an identifying description depends on the purpose for which the agent is identifying the description:s denotation. For example, the description that one must know to carry out a plan requiring the identification of ~John's residence\" may be quite different depending on whether one is going to visit him, or mail him a letter. If I want to speak to a guest at a Halloween party, I need only a description capable of distinguishing him from the other guests at the party, not to know who it really is wearing the disguise.","Identification of the denotation of a term D is therefore defined as finding another term /P (called a"]},{"title":"prima facie (PF) identifiable","paragraphs":["term) that has the same denotation as/~ according to the bearer's knowledge, but that meets certain syntactic criteria for being the \"right kind\" of term. It is stipulated that any two distinct PF identifiable terms must denote different individuals in the same situation. The simplest criterion for PF identifiability that meets this require-ment is that the term be a 81andsrd name. Because each standard name denotes the same individual in any context, knowing that a particular standard name is equivalent to a term implies that the agent knows the denotation of the term. Furthermore, any two distinct standard names denote different individuals.","The standard name approach was taken by the KAMP system. The standard name assumption has two difficulties. First, it is extremely implausible to believe that an agent has a unique name for anything that can be referred to. Also, knowing a standard name implies having made an absolute identification. Therefore, to refer to a guest at a costume party, it is a consequence of successful identification that the speaker and the hearer mutually know the identity of the person in the disguise, which is obviously too strong a condition for successful reference. Developing adequate criteria for PF identifiable terms is an important research problem; however, none of the points in this paper depend on what the criteria for PF identifiability are.","The importance of mutual belief to the successful use of referring expressions was demonstrated by Clark and Marshall (1981). It was shown by a series of rather complex examples that, if one did not observe an infinite number of preconditions of the form \"A believes that B believes that A believes that B believes ... description P applies to R,\" then it is impossible to guarantee that description D can be used to refer felicitously to R, because it would always be possible to construct some set of circumstances in which the hearer would believe the speaker intended to refer to something else. Perrau[t and Cohen (1981) show that a s}ightly weaker condition is adequate: the mutual belief preconditions have to hold in all but a finite number of cases. Nadathur and Josh| (1983) adopt a s(rat%oS\" that amounts to assuming that if D is believed to apply to R. then it is also mutually believed to apply to R unless there is reason to believe that it is not.","The case for some form of mutual belief ~ a prerequisite to a successful referring action is strong; however, spoakers oRen use noun phrases that should be analyzed .~s r,~fcrential in which it is clear from the context that. n(~l ~ml.v i~ the description not mutually believed tc~ h~d,l ~)f 'he }nt,m,led referent, but the speaker knows this is the ,':me ~vhcn he plans the utterance.

The hearer knows that the speaker can formulate a plan at the time of the utterance that will guarantee that he will have identified the referent of the description at the time that it is needed.","This observation is one motivation for the distinction dra~n along the horizontal axis of Figure 1. There are really' two kinds of definite referring actions: one is that in which the precondition is mutual knowledge of a description. and the other in which there is mutual knowledge of a plan incorporating the description to acquire additional knowledge."]},{"title":"5 Definitions of Concept Activation Actions","paragraphs":["This section discusses each of the four major types of con- ,-ept activation actions outlined in Section 3.

Consistency with the Gricean maxim of quantity requires that the planned description be as simple or efficient as possible. There are several ways to measure the complexity of a description, including the number of descriptors involved and the ease with which these descriptors can be incorporated into the utterance. When planning an SI action, the planner's most important task is reasoning about the efficiency of the description.","Concept activation actions that involve shared belief about the denotation of the description at the time of the utterance have the property that they are candidates for action subsumption. Because the information required to perform the identification can be communicated through a subset of the descriptors in the noun phra.se, or extralinguistically through pointing actions or strong contextual cues, and because the precondition Denotation(D) = Denotation(D') is known to hold, the speaker can use the additional descriptors to inform the hearer that the dos,'riptors are true of the intended referent."]},{"title":"5.2 Nonshared Concept Activation with Identification Intention (NSI)","paragraphs":["This action is what a speaker does when he wants to refer to an object that is not known to the hearer, or for which the speaker and hearer do not mutually believe enough properties at the time of the utterance so that identification can take place based on mutual knowledge.

Also, as is the case in example (7), the speaker may not be able to identify the referent, but nevertheless knows of a plan the hearer can execute that will lead to. the identification of the referent at the appropriate time.

However, it is conceivable that he had a particular tomato in mind, and chose that description because he believed it would lead to the best plan for the hearer to identify it, and would, in that case, be referential. One can see from this example that the referential-attributive distinction is orthogonal to the distinctions motivated by utterance planning, In both referential and attributive cases, the speaker knows that the right conditions on mutual knowledge are not satisfied for an SI action, and plans a description that he knows the hearer can use successfully. It does not matter to the planner whether the description is referential or attributive -- the same reasoning takes place in both cases with the same results.","The NSI action depends on the hearer's ability to find the plan P.

In the case of the NSI action, the speaker and hearer mutually know of a plan that will result in identification of the intended referent, and in the case of the S[ action, the plan is simply to do nothing, because the referent of the term is already mutually known. This is not the case, because the precondition of the SI action is that the speaker and hearer mutually believe both the description in the noun phrase and the PF identifiable description. In the case of the NSI action, the speaker and he=rer mutually believe that executing plan P will result in the hearer acquiring the required information, but, since only the hearer is actually executing the plan, the speaker and hearer may never meet the mutual belief condition of the SI action. Therefore it is possible to have an NSI action with a null plan, which is not equivalent to an SI action with the same description.

However, because the preconditions are different, no intention to identify the description is communicated, ~md the ultimate effect of the action on the hearer's beliefs and intentions is therefore quite different. This type of action underlies the use of an attributive description when no identification is intended. This type of action has been discussed in the literature (Donellan, 1966: Kripke, 1977) with the situation of two people discovering Smith's badly mutilated body, and one saying \"The man who murdered Smith is insane.\" In this situation, the speaker is informing the hearer of something about the referent of the description ~man who murdered Smith.\" but does not know who this individual is, nor does he intend that the hearer identify him.
