Syllable weight is perhaps the most interesting, and will be the main focus of this paper. Most of what follows has been implemented. I. Back~e,,sd A speech synthesizer is a machine that inputs a text stream and outputs an accoustic signal. One small piece of this problem will be discussed here: words -- phonemes. The resulting phonemes are then mapped into a sequence of Ipe dyads which are combined with duration and pitch information to produce speech. text -- intonation phrases -- words phonemes -- Ipc dyads + prosody -- accousti¢ -~ There are two general approaches to word -- phonemes: • Dictionary Lookup • Letter to Sound (i.e.. sound the word out from basic principles) Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages; the dictionary approach fails for unknown words (e.g.. proper nouns) and the letter to sound approach fails when the word doesn't follow the rules, which happens all too often in English. Most speech synthesizers adopt a hybrid strategy, using the dictionary when appropriate and letter to sound for the rest. Some people have suggested to me that modern speech synthesizers should do away with letter to sound rules now that memory prices are dropping so low that it ought to be practical these days to put every word of English into a tiny box. Actually memory prices are still a major factor in the cost of a machine. But more seriously, it is not possible to completely do away with letter to sound rules because it is not possible to enumerate all of the words of English. A typical college dictionary of 50,000 hcadwords will account for about 93% of a typical newspaper text. The bulk of the unknown words are proper flOUfl-q. The difficulty with pmpor nouns h demonstrated by the table below which compares the Brown Corpus with the surnames in the Kansas City Telephone Book. The table answers the question: how much of each corpus would be covered by a dictionary of n words? Thus the first line shows that a dictionary of 2000 words would cover 68% of the Brown Corpus, and a dictionary of 2000 names would cover only 46% of the Kansas City Telephone Book. It should be clear from the table that a dictionary of surnames must be much targar than a typical college dictionary ('20,000 entries). Moreover. it would be a lot of work to consu'u~ such a dictionary since there are no existing computer readable dictionaries for surnames.

To increase the coverage beyond this, it is probably neceqsary to apply alternative methods such as letter to sound rules. Over the past year l have been developing a set of letter to sound rules as part of a larger speech synthesis project currently underway at Murray Hill. Only one small piece of my letter to sound rules, orthography ~ stress, will be discussed here. The output streu assignment is then used to condition a number of rules such as palatalization in the mapping from letters to phonemes. 2. we/ght as ~ i,termt~tm ~ of Relm~mmutm Intuitively, stre~s dependencies come in two flavors: (a) those that apply locally within a syllable, and (b) throe that apply globally between syllables. Syllable weight is an attempt to represent the local stress constraints. Syllables are marked either heavy or light, depending only on the local 'shape' (e.g., vowel length and number of Ix~t-vocalic consonants). Heavy syllables are more likely to be","• Admittedly. this teat is somewhat unfair to the dictionary appma©h sinca: thu ethnic mzxture in gamuut City is very differeat from that found here at Bell t.aboflltot~ stressed than light syllables, though the actual outcome depends upon contextual constraints, such as the English main stress rule, which will be d~ shortly. The notion of weight is derived from Chomsky and Halle's notion of strong and weak clusters [Chonuky and Halle] (SPE). In phonological theory, weight is used as an intermediate level of representation between the input underlying phonological representation and the output stress aaignment. In a similar fashion, [ will use weight as an intermediate level of representation between the input orthography and the output strew. The orthography -- stress problem will be split into two subproblems: • Orthography -- Weight • Weight ~ Stress 3. What is Sy~ Weight: Weight is a binary feature (Heavy or Light) assigned to each syllable. The final syllables of the verbs obey, maintain, erase, torment. collapse, and exhaust arc heavy because they end in a long vowel or two consonants, in constrast, the final syllables of develop, astonish. edit. consider, and promise are light because they end in a short vowel and at moat one consonant.

Otherwise, the syllable ends in an open short vowel and it is marked light. Determining syllable weight from the orthography is considerably more difficult than from the underlying phonological form. I will return to this question shortly. 4. we/slt -- Stnm Global stress assignment rules apply off\" the weight representation. For example, the main stress rule of English says that verbs have final stress if the final syllable is heavy syllable (e.g., obey), and penultimate stress if the final syllable light syllable (e.g., develop). The main stress rule works similarly for nouns, except that the final syllable is ignored (extrametrical [Hayes]). Thus, nouns have penultimate stress if the penultimate syllable is heavy (e.g, aroma) and antipenultimate stress if the penultimate syllable is light (e.g., cinema). £x~l~ Pesmilimte Wei~lst R~ heavy long vowel verr6nda heavy closed syllable cinema light open syllabic & short vowel"]},{"title":"247","paragraphs":["Adjectives stress just like verbs except suffixes are ignored (extrametrical).

SWeat's WeiOt Table A large number of phonological studies (e.g., [Chomsky and HalleL [Liberman and PrineeL [Hayes]) outline a deterministic procedure for assigning stress from the weight representation and the number of extrametrical syllables (1 for nouns, 0 for verbs). A version of this procedure was implemented by Richard Sproat last summer. For efficiency purposes. Sproat's program was compiled into a table,, which associated each possible input with the appropriate stress pattern. Sweat's Weight Table Part of Speech","Weight Verb Noun H .I I L l I HH 31 I0 HL I0 I0 LH 01 I0 1 LL I0 I I0 1 HHH 103 ] 3101 HHL 310 I 310 HLH 103 1(30 HLL 310 10O LHH 103 010 LHL 010 010 LLH I03 10O LLL 010 100 etc. Note that the table is extremely small. Assuming that words have up","N to N syllables and up to E extrametrical syllables, there are E~2 ~ possible inputs. For E - 2 and N - 8, the table has only 1020 entries, which is not unreasonable. 6. Amlolff with Walt-' Comtndat Prolmptiea Paradigm Recall that Waltz was the first to showed how contraints could be used effectively in his program that analyzed line drawings in order to separate the figure from the ground and to distinguish concave edges from convex ones. He first assigned each line a convex label (+), a concave label (-) or a boundary label (<, >), using only ~ocal information. If the local information was ambiguous, he would assign a line two or more labels. Waltz then took advantage of the constraints impmed where multiple lines come together at a common vertex. One would think th~ t there ought to be 42 ways to label a vertex of two lines and 4 '~ ways to label a vertex of three lines and so on. By this argument, there ought to be 208 ways to label a vertex. But Waltz noted that there were only 18 vetex labelings that were consistent with certain reasonable assumptions about the physical world. Because the inventory of possible labelings was so small, he could disambiguate lines with multiple assignments by checking the junctures at each end of the line to see which of the assignments were consistent with one of the 18 possible junctures. This simple test turned out to be extremely powerful. Sproat's weight table is very analogous with Waltz' list of vertex constraints; both define an inventory of global contextual constraints on a set of local labels (H and L syllables in this application, and +. -, >, < in Waltz application). Waltz' constraint propagation paradigm depends on a highly constrained inventory of junctures. Recall that only 18 of 208 possible junctures turned out to be grammatical. Similarly, in this application there are very strong grammatical constraints. According to Spmat's table, there are only 51 distinct output stress a.udgnmeats, a very small number considering that there are 1020 distinct inputs.

This means that I only have to determine the weight for about half of the syllables in a word in order to assign stress. The redundancy of the weight representation can also been seen directly from Sproat's weight table as shown below For a one syllable noun, the weight is irrelevant.

Ore~ - w~ For practical purposes, Sproat's table offers a complete solution to the weight -- stress subtask. All that remains to be solved is: orthography","weight. Unfortunately, this problem is much more dif~cult and much less well understood. 1'11 start by discussing some easy _~_,-e~, and then introduce the pseudo-weight heuristic which helps in some o[ the more di~icuit cas~. Fortunately, l don't need a complete solution to orthography ~ weight since weight ~ stress is so well constrained. In easy cases, it is pmsible m determine the weight directly for the orthography. For example, the weight of torment must be \"HH\" because both syllables arc cloud (even after stripping off the final consonant). Thus, the stress of torment is either \"31\" or \"13\" stress depending on whether is has 0 or I extrametricai final syllables:\" (strop-from-weights \"HH\" 0) -- ('31\") ; verb (stress-from-weights \"HH\" l) -- ('13\") ; noun However, meet cases are not this easy. Consider a word like record where the first syllable might be light if the first vowel is reduced or it might be heavy if the vowel is underlyingly long or if the first syllable includes the /k/. It seems like it is imix~sstble to say anything in a case like this. The weight, it appears is either \"LH\" or \"HH'.

Syllables ending with sonorant consonants are marked N; other closed syllables are marked H. d. Open syllables are marked -. In practice. I have observed that there are remarkably few stress assignments meeting all of the constraints. After analyzing over 20.000 words, there were no more than 4 possible stress assigments for any particular combinatton of pseudo-weight and number of extrametrical number of syllables. Most observed combinations had a unique stre~ assignment, and the average (by observed combination with no frequency normalization) has 1.5 solutions. In short, the constraints are extremely powerful; words like record with multiple stress patterns are the exception rather than the rule. 9. Order~ Muitipte Selmime Generally, when there are multiple stress assignments, one of the possible stress assigments is much more plausible than the others. For instance, nouns with the pseudo-weight of \"H--L* (e.g., difference) have a strong tendency toward antipenultimate stress, even though they could have either 100 or 310 stress depending on the weight of the penultimate. The program takes advantage of this fact by returning a sorted list of solutions, all of which meet the constraints, but the solutions toward the front of the list are deemed more plausible than the solutions toward the rear of the list. (stress-from-weights \"l-I--L\" I) -- ('100\" \"3 I0\") Sorting the solution space in this way could be thought of as a kind of default reasoning mechanism. That is, the ordering criterion, in effect, assigns the penultimate syllable a default weight of L. unless there is positive evidence to the contrary. Of course, this sorting technique is not as general as an arbitrary default reasoner, but it seems to be general enough for the application. This limited defaulting mechanism is extremely efficient when there are only a few solutions meeting the constraints. This default mechanism is also used to stress the following nouns Hottentot Jackendoff balderdash ampersand Hackensack Arkansas Algernon mackintosh davenport merchandise cavalcade palindrome nightingale Appelbaum Aberdeen misanthrope where the penultimate syllable ends with a sonorant consonant (n. r, t). According to what has been said so far, these sonorant syllables are closed and so the penultimate syllable should be heavy and should therefore be stressed. Of course, these nouns all have antipenultimate stress, so the rules need to be modified. Hayes suggested a Sonorant Dnstressing rule which produced the desired results by erasing the foot structure (destressing) over the penultimate syllable so that later rules will reanalyze the syllable as unstressed. I propose instead to assign these sonorant syllables the pseudo-weight of N which is essentially identical to -.* In this way. all of these words will have the pseudo-weight of HNH which is most likely stressed as 103 (the correct answer) even though 313 also meets the constraints, but fair worse on the ordering criteron. (stress-from-weights \"HNH\" I) -- ('I03\" \"313\") Contrast the examples above with Adirondack where the stress does not back ap past the sonorant syllable. The ordering criterion is adjusted to produce the desired results in this case, by assuming that two binary feet (i.e., 2010 stress) are more plausible than one tertiary foot (i.e., 0100 stress). (weights-from-orthography \"Adirondack') -- \"L-NH\" (stress-from-weights \"L-NH') -- ('2013\" \"0103\") It ought to be possible to adjust the ordering criterion in this way to produce (essentially) the same results as Hayes\" rules. tO. M~ Thus far, the di~-usion has assumed monomorphemic input. Morphological affixes add yet another rich set of constraints. Recall the examples mentioned in the abstract, degrhde/dlrgrudhtion and tklegruphkei~grophy, which were used to illustrate that stress alternations are conditioned by morphology. This section will discuss how this is handled in the program. The task is divided into two questions: (I) how to parse the word into morphemes, and (2) how to integrate the morphological parse into the rest of stress assignment procedure discussed above.","~\" N s-d - used to I~ idlm\"aL I sm -,ill am mm du~ differeeczs us just~'=d.

The pseudo-accent approach presupposes that there is a method for distinguishing native from non-native words, and for identifying the etymological distinctions required for selecting the appropriate pseudo-accent.
