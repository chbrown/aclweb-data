The coptflar intcrconstnlint algorithm introduced in this paper provides a basis lbr acquiring large taxonomics from unrestricted texts. A filter can be used to quickly pmnc all non-copt.lar sentences :t~ well as (lilfictflt copular sentences involving hclicl: and perhaps, time contexts. The remaining scntc))ccs can be parsed, quantified and represented in a large semantic model.","This research would not only advance our knowledge of natur'd laxonomics and selection rc.~tricti~)ns h,t it woultl also generate empirical"]},{"title":"data","paragraphs":["tt:)clitl I~)r ttlose studying \"dcfault logics' and stereotype hierarchies [Minsky, 1975; Keil, 1979: Rotter, 1980; l-',rachrnan, 1982; Etherington and Rotter, 1983]. One dil'l]ct.ity with this research program is that an uncertainty principle is at work: The taxonomy used to determine selection restrictions itself depends on recognition of nlctaphors fllrottgh selection restrictions. Success in this lexicographical task will require the careful development of effective research strategies. Acknowledgments","This paper was improved by comments rrom Jonathan Connetl, Gavan Daffy.
