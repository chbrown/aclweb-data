In this paper i propose s logical notation which is first-order and uonintensional, sad for which semantic tnmslation can be naively compositional. The key move is to expand what kinds of entities one allows in one's ontology, rather than complicating the logical notation, the logical form of sentences, or the semantic translation process. Three classical problems - opaque adverbials, the distinction between de re and de ditto belief reports, and the problem of identity in intensional contexts - are examined for the dil~cuities they pose for this logical notation, and it is shown that the difficulties can be overcome. The paper closes with s statement about the view of semantics that is presupposed by this appro,-'h."]},{"title":"1 Motivation","paragraphs":["The real problem in natural language processing is the interpretation of discourse. Therefore, the other aspects of the total process should be in the service of discourse interpretation. This includes the semantic translation of sentences into s logical form, and indeed the logical notation itsel£ Discourse interpretation processes, as ! see them, are inferential processes that manipulate or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding the information in the text and on other logical expressions encoding the speaker's and helper's background knowledge. These considerations lead to two principal criteria for • logical notation.","Criterion I: The notation should be as close to English as possible. This makes it easier to specify the rules for translation between English and the formal language, mad also makes it easier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of in English. The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself, but it fails monumentally on the second criterion.","Criterion lh The notation should be syntactically simple. Since discourse processes are to be defined primarily in terms of manipulations performed on expressions in the logical notation, the simpler that notation, the easier it will be to define the discourse operations.","The development of such a logical notation is usually taken to be a very hard problem, i believe this is because researchers have imposed upon themselves several additional constraints - to adhere to stringent ontological scruples, to explain a number of mysterious syntactic facts ms a by-product of the notation, and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation. Most representational difficulties go •way if one rejects these constraints, and there are good reasons for rejecting each of the constr~nts.","Ontological scruples: Researchers in philosophy and lint~uistics have typically restricted themselves to very few (altho*Igh • strange assortment of) kinds of entities - physical objects, numbers, sets, times, possible worlds, propositions, events, and situations - mad all of these but the first have been controversial. Quine has been the greatest exponent of ontological chastity, ills argument is that in any scientific theory, \"we adopt, at [east in-sofas* as we are reasonable, the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of our experience can be fitted and arranged.* (Quine, 1953, p. 16.) But he goes on to say that \"simplicity ... is not a clear and unambiguous idea; and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.\" (Ibid., p. 17.) Minimising kinds of entities is not the only way to achieve simplicity in a theory. The aim in this enterprise is to achieve simplicity by minimizing the complexity of the rules in the system. It turns out this can be achieved by multiplying kinds of entities, by' allowing as an entity everything that can be referred to by a noun phrase.","Syntactic explanation: The argument here is easy. It would be pleasant if an explanation of, say, the syntactic behavior of count nouns and mass nouns fell out of our underlying ontological structure at no extra cost, but if the extra cost is great complication in statements of discourse operations, it would be quite unpleasant. In constructing a theory of discourse interpretation, it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiring syntsctie explanations as well. The problem of discourse is at least an order of maguitude harder than the problem of syntax, and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat.","Efficient deduction: There is • long tradition in artificial intelligence of building control information into the notation. and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven by this consideration. Semantic networks and other notational systems built ,round hierarchies (Quillian, 1068; .~immons, 1973; Hendrix, 1975) implicitly assign a low cost to certain types of syllogistic remmning. The KL-ONE representation language (Schmolze and Brat.brunn, 1982) has a variety of notational de-vices, each with an associated efficient deduction procedure. Hayes (1979) has argued that frame representations (Minsky, 1975; Bobrow and Winogrsd, 1977) should be viewed am sets of predicate calculus axioms together with a control component for drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly. In quite a different vein, Moore (1980) uses a possible worlds notation to model knowledge mad action in part to avoid inefficiencies in theoremproving.","By contrast, l would argue against building et§ciencies into the notation. From a psychological point of view, this allows us to abstract away from the details of implementation on a particular computational device, increasing the generality of the theory. From a technological point of view, it reflects a belief that we must first determine empirically the must common classes of inferences required for discourse processing and only then seek algorithms for optimizing them.","In this paper I propme s flit logical notation with an ontologically promiscuous semantics. One's first naive guess as to how to represent a simple sentence like A boy builds s boat. is as follows: (3z,"]},{"title":"y)build(z, g) A boy(z) ̂boat(v)","paragraphs":["This simple approach seems to break down when we encounter the more ditcuit phenomena of natural language, like tense, intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentence A boy wanted to build a boat quickly. These phenomena have led students of language to introduce significant complications in their logical notations for representing sentences. My approach will be to maintain the syntactic simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity.

Predicates will be identical or nearly identical to natural language morphemes. There will be no ftmctious, fun¢*ionals, nested quantifiers, disjunctions, negations, or modal or inteusional op erators."]},{"title":"3 The Logical Notation","paragraphs":["Davidson (1967) proposed a treatment of action sentences in which events are treated as individuals. This facilitated the representation of sentences with time and place adverbials. Thus we can view the sentences John ran on Monday. John ran in Sin Fnmciaco. as mmerting the existence of & ruxming event by John and assert-ing a relation between the event and Monday or San Francisco. We can similarly view the sentence John ran slowly. as expressing an attribute about a running event. Treating events as individuals is abe useful beemme they can be acgumerits of statements about cremes: Because he wanted to get there first, John ran. Because John ran, he arrived sooner than anyone else. They can be the objects of propositional attitudes: Bill was surprised that John ran. Finally, this approach accomodates the facts that events can be nominalized and can be referred to pronominally: John's running tired him out. John ran, and Bill saw it.","But virtually every predication that can he made in natural language can be specified u to time and place, be modified adverbially, function a~ a cause or effect of something else, be the object of a propositional attitude, be nominalized, and be referred to by a pronoun. It is therefore convenient to extend Davidson's approach to all predications. That is, corresponding to any predication that can he made in natural lan~tage, we will say there is an event, or state, or condition, or sitl=ation. or \"eventuality', or whatever, in the world that it refer~ to. This approach might he called \"ontnlogical promiscuity'. 0lie abandons all ontological scruples.","Thus we would like to have in our logical notation the possibility of an extra argument in e~h predication referring to the \"condition\" that exists when that predication is true. However. especially for expository convenience, we would like to retain the option of not specifying that extra argument when it is not needed and would only get in our way. Ilence, I propose a logical notation that provides two sets of predicates fhat are ~ystematically related, by introducing what might I)e railed a \"nominalization\" operator '.

The effect of this notational maneuver is to provide handles by which various predications can be grasped by higher predications. A similar approach haL~ been","in many AI systems.","In discourse one not only makes predications about such ephemera as events, states and conditions. One also refers to crttities that do not actually exist. Our notation must thus have a way of referring to such entities. We therefore take our model to he a Platonic universe which contains everything that can he spoken of - objects, events, states, conditions - whether they exist in the real world or not. It then may or may not be a property of such entities that they exist in the real world. In the sentence ( l ) John worships Zeus, the worshipping event and John, but not Zeus, exist in the real world, but all three exist in the (overpopulated) Platonic univeto. Similarly, in John wants to fly."]},{"title":"62 John's flying exists in the Platonic universe but not in the real world.l\" The logical notation then is just first-order predicate calculus, where the universe of discourse is a rich set of individuals, which are real, possible auad even impossible objects, events, conditions, eventualities, and so on. Existence and truth in the actual universe are treated as pred- ications about individuals in the Platonic universe. For this pur- pose, we use a predicate Ezist. The formula Ezist(JOllN) says that the individual in the Platonic universe denoted by JOHN exists in the actual universe, s The formula (2) Ezist{g) ̂run'(E, JOHN) says that the condition E of John's r~mning exists in the ac- tual universe, or more simply that \"John rains\" is true, or still more simply, that John runs. A shorter way to write it is run( JO lf N). Although for a simple sentence like \"John rmls ~, a logical form like (2) seems a bit overblown, when we rome to real sentences in English discourse with their variety of tenses, modalities and adverbial modifiers, the more elaborated logical form is neces- sary. Adopting the notation of (2) has Hw eth,ct of splitting a sentence into its propositional content - run'(L', JOHN) and its assertional claim - gzist(E). This frequently turns out to be useful, as the latter is often in doubt until substantial work has been done by discourse interpretation processes. An entire sentence may be embedded within aa indirect proof or other extended counts{factual.
