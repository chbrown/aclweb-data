The most noticeable fact is the ease with ~4nich the required modifications fit in the previous parser structure. In particular, the rules written for analyzing simple sentences (without conjunctions) needed only small changes. On the contrary, more substantial changes were made to the e~oeption-handling rules (called \"natural changes\") that are used to restructure the tree in case of failure of a syntactic hypothesis. T0~ parser described in the present work constitutes the syntactic component of the FIDO system (a Flexible Interface for Database Operations), an interface allowing an end-user to access a relational data-base in natural language (Italian). INTRODUCTION","It is not our intention to present here a comprehensive overview of the previous work on coordination, but just to describe a couple of recent studies On this topic and to specify the main differences between them and our approach.","It must be noticed, however, that both systems that will be discussed use a logic grammar as their basic framework, so that we will try to make the comparison picking out the basic principles for the manipulation of conjunctions, and disregarding the more fundamental differences concerning the global system design. It is also worth pointing out that, although the present section is ac~nittedly incomplete, most of the systems for the automatic analysis of I~ural language do not describe the met~hods adopted for the interpretation of sentences containing conjunctions in great detail. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in many of these systems the conjunctions are handled only by means of specific heuristic mechanisms. A noticeable e~ception is the ~ facility of the U/R~%R system (Woods, 1973): in this case, The research project described in this paper has partially been m/pported by the Ministero della Babblica Istruzione of Italy, MPI 40% Intelligenza Artificiale. the conjunctions are handled by m~ans of a para-syntactic mechanis~ that enables the parser to analyze the second conjunct assuming that it has a structure dependent on the hypothesized first conjunct. The main drawback of this approach is that the top-down bias of the ATNs does not allow the system to take advantage of the actual structure of the second conjunct to hypothesize its role. In other words, the analysis of the second conjunct acts as a confirnution mechanism for the hypothesis made on the sole basis of the position where the conjunction has been found. Consequently, all the v~rious possibilities (of increasing levels of complexity) must be analyzed until a match is found, which involves an apparent ~aste of computational resources.","The solution proposed in the first of the systems we will be discussing here is quite similar. It is based on Modifier Structure Grammars (MSG), a logic formalism introduced in (Dahl & McCord, 1983), which constit%Ites an extension of the Extraposition Grammar by F. Pereira (1981). TNe conjunctions are analyzed by means of a special operator, a \"demon\", that deals with the two problems that occur in coordination: ~he first conjunct can be \"interrupted\" in an incomplete status by the occurrence of the conjunction (this is not foreseeable at the beginning of the analysis) and the second conjunct must be analyzed taking into account the previous interruption point (and in this case, mainly because the second conjunct may ass~m~ a greater number of forms, some degree of top-down hypothesization is required).","~e first problem is solved by the \"backup\" procedure, which forces the satisfaction (or \"closure\" in our terms) of one or more of the (incomplete) nodes appearing, in the so-called \"parent\" stack. T~e choice of the node to which the second conjunct must be attached makes the system hypothesize (as in SYSCONJ) the syntactic category of the second conjunct and the analysis can proceed (a previous, incomplete constituent would be saved in a parallel structure, called '~erge stack\" that would be used subsequently to complete the interpretation of the first conjunct).","Apar~ from the ccr~iderable pc~er offered by ~LgGs for semantic interpretation, it is not quite clear why this approach represents an advance with respect to ~ ' a~roach. Even though the analysis times re[x)zted in the appendix of (Oahl & McCord, 1983) are ~ry low, the top-down bias of"]},{"title":"180","paragraphs":["F~Gs produces the ~ problems as ATNs do. The '~:sckup\" procedure, in fact, chooses blindly among the alternatives present in the parent stack (this problem is mentioned by the authors). A final ccmment concerns the analysis of the second conjtmct: since the basic grammar aims at describing \"normal\" English clauses, it seems that the system has so~ trouble with sentences involving \"gapping\" (see the third section). In fact, while an elliptical subject can be handled by the hypothesizetion, as second conjunct, of a verb phrase (this is the equivalent of treating the sit~/ation as a single sentence involving a single subject and tw3 actions, and not as tw~ coordinated sentences, the second of which has an elliptical subject; it a perfectly acceptable choice), the same mechanism cannot be used t~ handle sentences with an elliptical verb in the second conjunct.","The last system we discuss in this section has been described in (Huang, 1984). ThOugh it is based, as the previous one is, on a logic grammar, it starts from a qt/ite different asst~tion: the grammar deals explicitly with conjunctions in its rules. It does not need any extra-gramnatical mechanisms hut the positions where a particular constituent can be erased by the ellipsis ~ve to be indicated in the rules. Even though the effort of reconstructing the complete structure (i.e. of recovering the elliptical fragment) is mainly left to the unification mechanism of P~K)LOG, the design of the grammar is rendered s(~newhat more complex.","%~e fragment of grammar reported in (Huang, 1984) gives the i~pression of a set of rules \"flatter\" than the ones that normally appear in standard grammars (this is not a negative aspect; it is a feature of the ATNs too). The \"sentence\" structure co,rises a NP (the subject, which m~y be elliptical) , an adverbial phrase, a verb (which also may be elliptical), a restverb (for handling possible previous auxiliares) and a rest-sentence cc~nent. We can justify our previous comment on the increased effort in grammar development by noting that two different predicates had to be defined to account for the normal ccmlplements and the structure that Huang calls \"reduced conjunction\", see example (13) in the third section. Moreover, it se~ms that a recovery procedure deeply embedded within the language interpreter reduces the flexibility of the design. It is difficult to realize how far this problem could affect the analysis of n~re complex sentences (space contraints limited the size of the gra~m~ar reported in the paper quoted), but, for instance, the explicit assu~tion that the absence of the subject makes the system retrieve it from a previous conjumct, seems too strong. Disregarding languages where the subject is not always required (as it is the case for Italian), in English a sentence of the fore \"Go home and stay there till I call you\" could give the parser store trouble.","In the following we will describe an approach that overcomes som~ of the problems mentioned above. The parser that will be induced constitutes the syntactic com[xm~t of the FIDO system (a Flexible Interface for Database Operations), which is a prototype allowing an end-user to interact in natural language (Italian) with a relational data base. The query facility has been fully implemented in E~ANZ LISP on a VAX-780 computer. The update operations are currently under study. Tne various com[x~ents of the system have been described in a series of papers which will be referenced within the following sections. The system includes also an optimization ccmlmonent that c~nverts the query expressed at a conceptual level into an efficient logical-level query (Lesmo, Siklossy & Torasso, 1985). ORGANIZATION OF THE PARSER","In this section we overview the principles that lie at the root of the syntactic analysis in FIDO. We try to focus the discussion on the issues that guided the design of the parser, rather than giving all the details about its current implen~ntation. We hope that this approach will enable the reader to realize why the system is so easily extendible. For a more detailed presentation, see (Lesmo & Torasso, 1983 and Lesmo & Torasso, 1984).","The first issue concerns the interactions between the concept of \"structured representation of a sentence\" and \"status of the analysis\". These t%~ concepts have usually been considered as distinct: in ATNs, to consider a well-known exa~le, the parse tree is held in a register, but the global status of the parsing process also includes t/he contents of the other registers, a set of states identifying the current position in the various transition networks, and a stack containing the data on the previous choice points. In logic grammars (Definite Clause Granmars (Pereira & Warren, 1980), Extraposition Grammars (Pereira, 1981), M~difier Structure Grammars (Dahl & ~L-~Drd, 1983)) this book-keeping need not be completely explicit, but the interpreter of the language (usually a dialect of PROLOG) has to keep track of the binding of the variables, of the clauses that have not been used (but could be used in case of failure of the current path), and so on. On the contrary, ~e tried to organize the parser in such a way that the two concepts mentioned above coincide: the portion of the tree that has been built so far \"is\" the sta~/s of the analysis. Tne implicit assunlDtion is that the parser, in order to go on wi~/~ the analysis does not need to know how the tree was built (what rules have been applied, what alternatives there were), but just what the result of the previous processing steps is 4. Of course, this assumption implies that all information present in the input sentence must also be AWe must confess that this assumption has not been pushed to its extreme consequences. In some cases (see (Lesm~ & Torasso, 1983) for a more detailed discussion) the backtracking mechanism is still needed, but, although we are not unable to provide experimental evidence, we believe that it cou/d be substituted by diagnostic procedures of the type discussed, with different purposes and within a different fomTalism, in (Weischedel & Black, 1980)."]},{"title":"181","paragraphs":["present in its struct-ttred representation; actually, what happens is that new pieces of information, which were implicit in the \"linear\" input form, are made explicit in the result of the analysis.

This moans that there is no one-to-one association between syntactic and semantic rules, a further advantage if we succeed in making the structured representation of the sentence reasonably uniform. This result has been achieved by distinguishing between \"syntactic categories\", which are used in the syntactic rules to build the tree, and \"node types\", whose instantiations are the ele_,~nts the tree is built of. z Since the number of syntactic categories (and of syntactic rules) is considerably larger than the ntm~ber of node types (6 node types, 22 syntactic categories, 61 rules), then so,~ general constraints and interpretation tales may be expressed in a more compact form. WiL-hout entering into a discussion on semantic interpretation, we can give an exile using the rules that validate the tree from a syntactic point of view (SY~IC RULES 2 in fig.l). One of these rules specifies that the subject and the verb of the sentence must agree in nun~r. On the other hand, the subject can be a noun, a pronoun, an interrogative pro~)un, a relative pro~m~n: each of them is associated with a different syntactic category, but all of them will finally be stored in a node of type REF (standing for REFerent) ; independently of the category, a single rule is used to specify the agreement constraint mentioned above.","let us now have a look at the box in fig.l labelled \"~IC RULES i: EXTENDING THE [~a~\". ~Six node types have been introduced (each node is actually a o~91ex data structure): REL (~a-tions, mainly verbs), REF (R]~Ferents, no~s, pronouns, etc. ), CO~ (CONNectors, e.g. prepositions), OET (DETerminers), ADJ (ADJectives), and MOD (MCOifiers, ~ainly adverbs).

The right-hand side of a rule (ACTION) consists in a sequence of operations; there are two operators: CRLINK (X,Y) which creates a new instance of the type X and links it to the nearest node of type Y existing in the rightn~Dst path of the tree (and moving only upwards) FILL (X,V) which fills the nearest node (see above) of type X with the value V (which in most cases coincides with the lexical date about the current input word).","'][he rules are grouped in packets, each of which is associated with a lexical category.

On the other hand, the non-determinism has been reduced by making the preconditions of the rules belonging to the same packet mutually e~uzlusive; consequently, the status is saved on the stack only (but not always) if the input word is syntactically ambiguous. Note that nothing prevents there being exceptions to this rule.

Same experiments :,a~e been made to include a weighting mechanism, which should depend both on the syntactic context and on the semantic knowledge (Lesmo & Torasso, 1985).","A second \"syntactic\" box appears in fig.l. It refers to rules that are, in a sense, weaker than the rules of the set discussed above. The rules of the first set are aimed at defining acceptable syntactic structures, where \"acceptable\" is used to maan that the resulting structure is semantically interpretable (for instance, a determiner cannot be used to modify an adjective). On the contrary, the rules of t~he second set specify which of the meaningful sentences are well formed; in particular, they are used to check gender and number agreement and the ordering of constituents (e.g. the fact that in ~glish an adjective should occur before the noun it refers to, whereas this is not always the case in Italian). The separation between the rules of the two sets is the feature that makes the system robust from a syntactic point of view (see (Lesmo & Torasso, 1984) for further details).","It may be noticed that, in fig. i, both the second set of syntactic rules we have just discussed and a part of the semantic knowledge have the purpose of '~alidating the tree\", independently of t.he fact that the second-level syntactic constraints can be broken (they are \"weak\" constraints), whilst the semantic constraints can not (they are \"strong\" constraints), sane action must be performed when the structure hypothesized by the first-level rules does not match those constraints. The task of the rules called \"natural changes\" (see fig.l) is to restructure the tree in order to provide the parser with a new, \"correct\" structure. We will not go into further details here, since the natural changes (in particular t_he one concerning the treatn~nt of conjunctions) will be discussed in a following section; however, in order to give a complete picture of the behavior of the parser, we must point out ~.hat the natural changes can fail (no correct structure can be built) . In this case, the parser returns to the original structure and issues a warning m~ssage, if the trigger of the natural changes ~as a weak constraint; otherwise (semantic failure) it backtracks to a previous choice point. A~LYSIS OF CDNJUNL~IONS","Before starting the description of the n~chanisms adop~=d to analyze conjunctions, it is worth noting that the analysis of conjunctions was already mentioned in a previous paper (Lesmo & Torasso, 1984). The present paper represents an advance with respect to the referenced one in that","new solutions have been adopted, which greatly enhance the homogeneity of the parsing process (not to mention the fact that the behavior of ~ parser was treated very sketchily in the previous paper). The presentation of the solution we adopted is based on the classification of sentences containing conjunctions reported in (Huang, 1984) : we will start from the simpler cases and introduce the more ccmplex examples later. A last remark concerns the language: as stated above, the FIDO system works on Italian; in order to enhance the readability of the paper, we present ~glish examples. Actually, we are doing some experiments using a restricted ~glish grammar, but it must be clear that the facilities that will be described are fully i~@lemented only for the Italian grammar (the cases where Italian behaves differently from I~glish will be pointed out during the presentation).","As for all other syntactic categories, the category \"conjunction\" also has an associated set of rules: the set contains a single, very simple rule: it saves the conjunction in a global register, which is available during the subsequent stages of processing. %~e simplest case of conjunction is the one referred to in (Fmang, 1984) as \"unit interpretation\" : (i) Bob met Sue and Mary in London Normally, the rules associated with hOLmS hypothesize the attachrrent of a newly created REF node to a connector that (if it does not already exist) is, in turn, created and attached to the nearest node of type REL above the current node (or to the current node itself if it is of type REL). After the analysis of \"Bob mat\", the situation of the parse tree would be as in fig.2.a (and p~l is the current node). Tne analysis of \"Sue\" would produce the tree of fig.2.b. The noun rules have bee_n changed to allow for the attachment of more than one noun to the same connector (should a conjunction be present in the register). In fig.2.c, the tree built after the analysis of sentence (1) is reported. It must be noted that the most common exar~le of natural change (the one called MOVEUP) is also useful when a conjunction is present. Cons ider, for instance, the sentence :","(2) John saw the boy you told the story and the girl you met yesterday After the analysis of the fragment ending wir/n \"story\", we get the tree of fig.3.a (and REF4 is the current node). According to the previous disc-assion, the noun \"girl\" would be stored in a ~EF node attached to CONN4. On the other hand, the semantics would reject this hypothesis, since the case frame (TO '~r: SUHJ/PERSON; DIROBJ/PERSON; INDOBJ~) is not acceptable. The portion of the tree representing \"and the girl\" would be '~ved up\" and attached to CONN2, thus yielding the tree of fig.3.b (that would be expanded subsequently, by attaching the relative clause \"you nnet yesterday\" to Faro'5).","Unlike what happens in the previous cases, a new rule had to be added to account for the other types of conjt~ctions. This rule is a new natural change, that the system executes when the conjunction implies the existence of a new clause in the sentence. ~he need for such a rUle is clear if we"]},{"title":"183 REL~ ~¢ I soe I H I (a)","paragraphs":["ggL~~ (b) Fig.2 -"]},{"title":"I',-o NEET I,IHI,ITt","paragraphs":["¢oww:P ~ CONN~ (c) Different phases of the interpretation of the sentence \"Bob met Sue and Mary in London\".

In a sense, the parser knows that it has to parse a sentence because, before starting the analysis, the tree is initialized by the creation of an empty REL node. Analogously, when a relative pronoun is found, the relative clause is \"initialized\" via the creation of a new empty REL node and its attachment to the REF node whictl the relative clause is supposed to refer to. The only exception to this rule is represented by gerunds and participles, which are handled by means of explicit preconditions in the VERB rule set. Of course, this can give rise to ambiguities when the past indicative and the past participle have the same form, as in the well known garden path: (3) The horse raced past the barn fell In the case of sentence (3), the choice of the indicative tense would be made, and the past participle rule would be saved ~o allow for a possible backtrackLng in a s~nt phase, as would actually occur in example (3) (we must note here that such an ambiguity does not occur in Italian).

H~wever, it seems that, also in this case, the increased power of the procedures handling elliptical fragments could provide some reasonable solutions without requiring substantial changes to the presented approach to parsing. CONCLUSIONS AS stated in the introduction, a proper treat- • ent of coordination involves the ability to interrupt the analysis of the first conjunct when the conjunction is found and the ability to analyze the second conjunct taking into account what happened before.","~he system described in the paper deals with the two probl~s by adopting a robust and modular bottom-up approach. The first conjunct is extended as far as possible using the incoming words and the structure building syntactic rules. Its complete-ness and/or acceptability is verified by n~_ans of another set of rules that fit easily in the proposed framework and do not affect the validity of the other rules.","~he second conjunct is analyzed using the s~me standard set of structure building rules, plus an excep~ion-~%ndling rule that accounts for the presence of a whole clause as second conjunct. The need ~o take into account what happened before is satisfied by the availability of the portion of the tree that has already been built and that can be inspected by all the rules existing in the system.","qhe paper shows that the approach that has been adopted enables the system to analyze correctly most sentences involving conjunctions. Although sane cases are pointed out, where the present i~plementation fails tm analyze a correct sentence, we believe that the solutions presented in the paper enlight some of the advantages that a rule-based approach to parsing has with respect to the classical grammar-based ones.
