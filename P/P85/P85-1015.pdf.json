Abstract","paragraphs":["By generalizing the notion of location of a constituent to allow discontinuous Ioctaions, one can describe the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages. These discontinuous constituents can be described by a variant of definite clause grammars, and these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof procedure to create a parser for non-configurational languages. 1. Introduction","In this paper [ discuss the problem of describing and computationally processing the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages. In these languages the grammatical func-tion that an argument plays in the clause or the sentence is not determined by its position or confguration in the sentence, as it is in configurational languages like English, but rather by some kind of morphological marking on tile argument or on the verb. Word order in non-configurational languages is often extremely free: it has been claimed that if some string of words S is grammatical in one of these languages, then the string S' formed by any arbitrary permutation of the words in S is also grammatical. Most attempts to describe this word order freedom take mechanisms designed to handle fairly rigid word order systems and modify them in order to account for the greater word order freedom of non-configurational languages. .Mthough it is doubtful whether any natural language ever exhibits such total scrambling, it is interesting to investigate the computational and linguistic implications of systems that allow a ifigh degree of word order freedom. So the approach here is the opposite to the usual one: I start with a system which, unconstrained, allows for unrestricted permutation of the words of a sentence, and capture any word order regularities the language may have by adding restrictions to the system. The extremely free word order of non-configurational languages is described by allowing constituents to have discontinuous [ocatio,ls. To demonstrate that it is possible to parse with such discontinuous constituents. I show how they can be incorporated into a variant of definite clause grammars, and that these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof procedure. such as Ear[ey deduction, to coestruct a parser, a.s shown in Pereira and Warren (1983).","This paper is organized as follows: section 2 contains an informal introduction to Definite Clause Grammars and ,lisctmses how they can be used in parsing, section :l giws a brief description of some of the grammatical features of o**o non-,'onligurational language. Guugu Yimhlhirr, section I presents ;t deiinite clause fragment for this language, aml shows how this can be u~ed for parsing. Section 5 notes that the use of di~conti*uiot*s con.~l.ituent.~ is *lot limited to definite clause granunars. [)lit they could lie incorporated into such disparate formalisnts as GP~(;, I,FG or (';[L Section 6 discusses whether a unified account of par.qng both conligurational and non-configurational languages can be given, and section 7 compares the notion of discontinuous constituents with other approaches to free word order. 2. Definite Clam Grammars and Parsing","[n this section [ show how to represent both an utterance and a context free granmmz (CI\"G) so that tile locations of eoustituents are explicitly represented in the grammar formalism. Given this, it will be easy to generalize the notion of location so that it can describe the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages. The formalism [ use here is the Definite Clause Grammar formalism described in Clocksin and Mellish (1084). To fatalliarize the reader with the DCG notation, I discuss a fragment for English in this section. In fact, the DCG representation is even more general than is brought out here: as Pereira and Warren (1083) demonstrated, one can view parsin K algorithms highly specialized proof procedures, and the process of parsing as logical inferencing on the representation of the utterance, with the grammar functioning as the axioms of the logical system.","Given a context free grammar, as in (l), the parsing problem is to determine whether a particular utterance, such as the one in (2}, is an S with respect to it. {1) S -- NP VP","VP ~VNP","NP -- Det N","Det -- NP"]},{"title":"[÷Ce~l","paragraphs":["('2} 0 the t boy's 2 father 3 hit 4 the s dog s","The subscripts in (2} serve to locate the lexical items: they indicate that, for instance, the utterance of the word d0~ began at time t s and ended at time t s. That is, the location of the utterance \"dog\" in example (2) was the interval (t~,tsl. [ interpret the subscripts aa the points in time that segment the utterance into individual words or morphemes. Note that they perform the same func-tion as the vertices of a standard chart parsing system.","Parsing {2} is the same as searching for an S node that dominates the entire string, ie. whose location is [0,6!. By looking at the rules in {I), we see that an S node is composed of an NP and a VP node. The interpretation conventions associated with phrase structure rules like those in (I) tell us this, and also tell us that the location of the S is the concatenation of the location of tile NP and the VP. That is, tile existence of an S node located at i0.t~! would be implied by the existetlce of an NP node located at interval r O.z i ( z a variable) and a V'P node located at [: ,8 t.","The relationship between the mother constituent's location anti those of its daughters is made explicit in the definite clause grauunar, .~hown in (3}, that corresponds to the CFG (l}. The utterante (1) (after lexical analysis} would be represented as in (4).

The major difference for us between (1) and (3) is that in (3) the locations of the constituents fie. the endpoints) are explicit in the formalism: they are arguments of the constituents, the first argument being the beginning time of the constituent's location, the second argument its ending time. ALso note the way that syntactic features arc treated in this system: the difference between genitive and non-genitive case marked nouns is indicated by a third argument in both the N and NP constituents. Genitive nouns and noun phrases have the value Gen for their third argument, while non-genitive NP have the value ~, and the rule that expands NP explicitly passes the case of the mother to the head daughter t.","We can use (3) and (4) to make inferences about the existence of constituents in utterance (2). For example, using the rule that expands ~ in (3) together with the first two facts of (4), we can infer the existence of constituent NP(0,2,Gen).","The simplest appruach to parsing is probably to use (t) in a top*down fashion, and start by searching for an S with location [0,6]; that is, search for goal S(0,6). This method, top down recursive descent, is the method the programming language Prolog uses to perform deduction on definite clauses systems, so Prulo g can easily be used to make very efficient top*down parsers.","Unfortunately, despite their intuitive simplicity, top down recursive descent parsers have certain properties that make them less than optimal for handling natural language phenomena. Unless the grammar the parser is using is very specially crafted, these parsers tend to go into infinite loops. For example, the rule that expands NP into Det and N in (3) above would be used by a top-down parser to create a Det subgoal from an NP goal. But Det Ltself can be expanded as a genitive NP, so the parser would create another NP subgual from the Det subgoal, and so on infinitely.","The problem is that the parser is searching for the same [NP many times over: what is needed is a strategy that reduces multiple searches for the same item to a single search, and arranges to share its results. Eariey deduction, based on the Eariey parsing algorithm. is capable of doing this. For reasons of time, I won't go into details of Eariey Deduction (see Pereira and Warren (1983) for details}; [ will simply note here that using Eariey Deduction on the definite clause grammar in {3) results in behaviour that corresponds exactly to the way an Earley chart parser wouhl parse ( I ). 3.

Similiarly, the CFG part of LFG, the C-structure, could be enriched to allow discontinuous constituents if one wished.

[n his conception, heads contain as lexical information a list of the items they subcategorize for. This strongly suggests that one should parse accord-ing to a \"head first\" strategy: when one parses a sentence, one looks for its verb first, and then, based on the lexical form of the verb, one looks for the other arguments in the clause. Not only would such an approach be easy to implement in a DCG framework, but given the empirical fact that the nature of argument NPs in a clause is strongly determined by that clause's verb, it seems a very reasonable thing to do. 8. Implementha g the Parser","In their 1983 paper, Pereira and Warren point out several problems involved in implementing the Earley proof procedure, and proposed ways of circumventing or minimizing these problems. In :.his section [ only consider the specialized case of Earley Deduction working with clauses that correspond to grammars of either the continuous or discontinuous constituent type, rather than the general ca~e of performing deduction on an arbitrary set of clauses.","Considering first the case of Earley Deduction applying to a set of clauses like (3) that correspond to a CFG, a sensible thing to do would be to index the derived clauses fie. the intermediate results) on the left edge of their location. Because Earley Deduction on such a set of clauses always proceeds in exactly the same manner as Eariey chart parsing, namely strictly left to right within a constituent, the position of the left edge of any constituent being searched for is always determined by the ending location of the constituent immediately preceeding it in the derivation. That is, the proof 15rocedure is always searching for constituents with hard, ie. nonvariable, left edges. I have no empirical data on this point, but the reduction in the number of clauses that need to be checked because of this indexing could be quite important. Note that the vertices in a chart act essentially as indices to edges in the manner described.","Unfortunately, indexing on the left edge in system working with discontinuous constituents in the manner suggested above would not be very useful, since the inferencing does not proceed in a left to right fashion. Rather, if the suggestions at the end of the last section are heeded, the parser proceeds in a \"head first\" fashion, looking first for the head of a constituent and then for its complements, the nature and number of which are partially determined by information available from the head. ht such a strategy, it would seem reasonable to index clauses not on their location, but on morphological or categorial features, such as category, case, etc., since these are the features they will be identified"]},{"title":"by","paragraphs":["when they are searched for.","It seems then that the optimal data structure for one type of constituent is not optimal for the other. The question then arises whether there is a unified parsing strategy for both configurational and non-configurational languages. Languages with contiguous constituents could be parsed with a head first strategy, but I suspect that this would prove less efficient than a strategy that indexed on left edge position. Locations have the useful property that their number grows as the size of the sentence (and hence the number of constituents) increases, thus giving more indexing resolution where it is needed, namely in longer sentences.

Rather, the possessor of the possessor is indicated by a dative construction and so *,he LFG analysis is supported here.

For instance, the a~Tinc parsa6dity property (F'ereira and Warren 1983) that is required to assure decidablity in LFG (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982) essentially prohibits scrambling of single lexical elements from doubly embedded clauses, because such scrambling would entail one S node exhaustively dominating another.
