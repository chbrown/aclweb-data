RAPAPOIIT'S THEORY.","On my own reconstruction of Meinong's theory (Rapaport 1976, 1978--which bears a coincidental r~mblance to McCarthy 1979). there are two types of objecLs: M-objecta (i.e~ the objects of thought, which are intensional) and actual objects (which are extensional). There are two modes of predication of properties to these: M-objects are constituted by properties, and both M- and actual objects can exemplify properties. For instance, the pen with which l wrote the manumnpt of this paper is an actual object that exemplifies the property of being while. Right now. when I think about that pen. the object of my thought is an M-oblect that is constitLaed (in part) by that property. The M-object Jan's pen can be represented as: <belonging to Jan. being a pen> (or. for short, as: *J. P>). Ileing a pen is also a constituent of this M-object: P c <J. P >; and 'Jan% pen is a pen' is true in virtue of this objective. [n addition. <J. P > exemplifies (ex) the property of being constituzed by two properties. There might be an actual (abject, .say. ~. corresrxmding to <J. P >, that exemplifies the property of being a pen (iv ex /\" ) as well as (say) the property of being 6 inches &rag.
