Putting disambiguation ahead of semantic evaluation is reasonable in these applications because they are primarily run on content like newspaper text or dictated speech, where no machine-readable contextual information is readily available to provide semantic guidance for disambiguation.","This single-tree semantic architecture is a poor fitfor applications such as natural language interfaces however, in which a large amount of contextual information is available in the form of the objects and events in the application’s run-time environment. This is because the environment information cannot be used to inform parsing and disambiguation decisions unless the input sentence is semantically analyzed, but this does not occur until after parsing in the single-tree architecture. Assuming that no current statistical disambiguation technique is so accurate that it could not benefitfrom this kind of environment-based information (if available), then it is important that the semantic analysis in an interface architecture be efficientlyperformed during parsing.","This paper describes the computational properties of one such architecture, embedded within a system for giving various kinds of conditional instructions and behavioral constraints to virtual human agents in a 3-D simulated environment (Bindiganavale et al., 2000). In one application of this system, users direct simulated maintenance personnel to repair a jet engine, in order to ensure that the maintenance procedures do not risk the safety of the people performing them. Since it is expected to process a broad range of maintenance instructions, the parser is run on a large subset of the Xtag English grammar (XTAG Research Group, 1998), which has been annotated with lexical semantic classes (Kipper et al., 2000) associated with the objects, states, and processes in the maintenance simulation. Since the grammar has several thousand lexical entries, the parser is ex-posed to considerable lexical and structural ambiguity as a matter of course.","The environment-based disambiguation architecture described in this paper has much in common with very early environment-based approaches, such as those described by Winograd (Winograd, 1972), in that it uses the actual entities in an environment database to resolve ambiguity in the input. This research explores two extensions to the basic approach however: 1. It incorporates ideas from type theory to rep-","resent a broad range of linguistic phenomena","in a manner for which their extensions or po-","tential referents in the environment are well-","defined in every case. This is elaborated in","Section 2.","2. It adapts the concept of structure sharing,","taken from the study of parsing, not only to","translate the many possible interpretations of","ambiguous sentences into shared logical ex-","pressions, but also to evaluate these sets of","potential referents, over all possible interpre-","tations, in polynomial time. This is elabo-","rated in Section 3. Taken together, these extensions allow interfaced systems to evaluate a broad range of natural language inputs – including those containing NP/VP attachment ambiguity and verb sense ambiguity – in a principled way, simply based on the objects and events in the systems’ environments. For example, such a system would be able to correctly answer ‘Did someone stop the test at 3:00?’ and resolve the ambiguity in the attachment of ‘at 3:00’ just from the fact that there aren’t any 3:00 tests in the environment, only an event where one stops at 3:00.1","Because it evaluates instructions before attempting to choose a single interpretation, the interpreter can avoid getting ‘stranded’ by disambiguation errors in earlier phases of analysis.","The main challenge of this approach is that it requires the efficient calculation of the set of objects, states, or processes in the environment that each possible sub-derivation of an input sentence could refer to. A semantic interpreter could always be run on an (exponential) enumerated set of possible parse trees as a post-process, to filter out those interpretations which have no environment referents, but recomputing the potential environment referents for every tree would require an enormous amount of time (particularly for broad coverage grammars such as the one employed here). The primary result of this paper is therefore a method of containing the time complexity of these calculations to lie within the complexity of parsing (i.e. within  for a context-free grammar, where ","is the number of words","1","It is important to make a distinction between this environment information, which just describes the set of objects and events that exist in the interfaced application, and what is often called domain information, which describes (usually via hand-written rules) the kinds of objects and events can exist in the interfaced application. The former comes for free with the application, while the latter can be very expensive to create and port between domains. in the input sentence), without sacrificing logical correctness, in order to make environment-based interpretation tractable for interactive applications."]},{"title":"2 Representation of referents","paragraphs":["Existing environment-based methods (such as those proposed by Winograd) only calculate the referents of noun phrases, so they only consult the objects in an environment database when interpreting input sentences. But the evaluation of ambiguous sentences will be incomplete if the referents for verb phrases and other predicates are not calculated. In order to evaluate the possible interpretations of a sentence, as described in the previous section, an interface needs to define referent sets for every possible constituent.2","The proposed solution draws on a theory of constituent types from formal linguistic semantics, in which constituents such as nouns and verb phrases are represented as composeable functions that take entitiess or situations as inputs and ultimately return a truth value for the sentence. Following a straightforward adaptation of standard type theory, common nouns (functions from entities to truth values) definepotential referent sets of simple environment entities:","","",", and sentences (functions from situations or world states to truth values) definepotential referent sets of situations in which those sentences hold true: ","","",". Depending on the needs of the application, these situations can be represented as intervals along a time line (Allen and Ferguson, 1994), or as regions in a three-dimensional space (Xu and Badler, 2000), or as some combination of the two, so that they can be constrained by modifiers that specify the situations’ times and locations. Referents for other types of phrases may be expressed as tuples of entities and situations: one for each argument of the corresponding logical function’s input (with the presence or absence of the tuple representing the boolean output). For example, adjectives, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses, which are typically represented as situationally-dependent properties (functions from situations and entities","2","This is not strictly true, as referent sets for constituents like determiners are difficult to define, and others (particularly those of quantifiers)will be extremely large until composed with modifiers and arguments. Fortunately, as long as there is a bound on the height in the tree to which the evaluation of referent sets can be deferred (e.g. after the first composition), the claimed polynomial complexity of referent annotation will not be lost. to truth values) definepotential referent sets of tuples that consist of one entity and one situation:             ","","","",". This represen-","tation can be extended to treat common nouns","as situationally-dependent properties as well, in","order to handle sets like ‘bachelors’ that change","their membership over time."]},{"title":"3 Sharing referents across interpretations","paragraphs":["Any method for using the environment to guide the interpretation of natural language sentences requires a tractable representation of the many possible interpretations of each input. The representation described here is based on the polynomial-sized chart produced by any dynamic programming recognition algorithm.","A record of the derivation paths in any dynamic programming recognition algorithm (such as CKY (Cocke and Schwartz, 1970; Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967) or Earley (Earley, 1970)) can be interpreted as a polynomial sized and-or graph with space complexity equal to the time complexity of recognition, whose disjunctive nodes represent possible constituents in the analysis, and whose conjunctive nodes represent binary applications of rules in the grammar. This is called a shared forest of parse trees, because it can represent an exponential number of possible parses using a polynomial number of nodes which are shared between alternative analyses (Tomita, 1985; Billot and Lang, 1989), and can be constructed and traversed in time of the same complexity (e.g."," ","for context free grammars). For example, the two parse trees for the noun phrase ‘button on handle beside adapter’ shown in Figure 1 can be merged into the single shared forest in Figure 2 without any loss of information.","These shared syntactic structures can further be associated with compositional semantic functions that correspond to the syntactic elements in the forest, to create a shared forest of trees each representing a complete expression in some logical form. This extended sharing is similar to the ‘packing’ approach employed in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992), except that the CLE relies on a quasi-logical form to underspecify semantic information such as quantifier scope (the calculation of which is deferred until syntactic ambiguities have been at least partially resolved by other means); whereas the approach described here extends structure sharing to incorporate a certain amount of quantifier scope ambiguity in order to allow a complete evaluation of all subderivations in a shared forest before making any disambiguation decisions in syntax.3","Various synchronous formalisms have been introduced for associating syntactic representations with logical functions in isomorphic or locally non-isomorphic derivations, including Categorial Grammars (CGs) (Wood, 1993), Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Joshi, 1985; Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber, 1994), and Synchronous Description Tree Grammars (DTGs) (Rambow et al., 1995; Rambow and Satta, 1996). Most of these formalisms can be extended to definesemantic associations over entire shared forests, rather than merely over individual parse trees, in a straightforward manner, preserv-ing the ambiguity of the syntactic forest without exceeding its polynomial size, or the polynomial time complexity of creating or traversing it.","Since one of the goals of this architecture is to use the system’s representation of its environment to resolve ambiguity in its instructions, a space-efficient shared forest of logical functions will not be enough. The system must also be able to efficiently calculate the sets of potential referents in the environment for every subexpression in this forest. Fortunately, since the logical function forest shares structure between alternative analyses, many of the sets of potential referents can be shared between analyses during evaluation as well. This has the effect of building a third shared forest of potential referent sets (another and-or graph, isomorphic to the logical function forest and with the same polynomial complexity), where every conjunctive node represents the results of applying a logical function to the elements in that node’s child sets, and every disjunctive node represents the union of all the potential referents in that node’s child sets. The presence or absence of these environment referents at various nodes in the shared forest can be used to choose a vi-able parse tree from the forest, or to evaluate the truth or falsity of the input sentence without disambiguating it (by checking the presence or lack of referents at the root of the forest).","For example, the noun phrase ‘button on handle beside adapter’ has at least two possible interpretations, represented by the two trees in Figure 1: one in which a button is on a handle and","3","A similar basis on (at least partially) disambiguated syntactic representations makes similar underspecifiedsemantic representations such as hole semantics (Bos, 1995) ill-suited for environment-based syntactic disambiguation.

The semantic functions are annotated just below the syntactic categories, and the potential environment referents are annotated just below the semantic functions in the figure. Because there are no handles next to adapters in the environment (only buttons next to adapters), the first interpretation has no environment referents at its root, so this analysis is dispreferred if it occurs within the analysis of a larger sentence. The second interpretation does have potential environment referents all the way up to the root (there is a button on a handle which is also beside an adapter), so this analysis is preferred if it occurs within the analysis of a larger sentence.","The shared forest representation effectively merges the enumerated set of parse trees into a single data structure, and unions the referent sets of the nodes in these trees that have the same label and cover the same span in the string yield (such as the root node, leaves, and the PP cover-ing ‘beside adapter’ in the examples above). The referent-annotated forest for this sentence therefore looks like the forest in Figure 2, in which the sets of buttons, handles, and adapters, as well as the set of things beside adapters, are shared between the two alternative interpretations. If there is a button next to an adapter, but no handle next to an adapter, the tree representing ‘handle beside adapter’ as a constituent may be dispreferred in disambiguation, but the NP constituent at the root is still preferred because it has potential referents in the environment due to the other interpretation.","The logical function at each node is defined over the referent sets of that node’s immediate children.

Thus, the total space and time complexity of the above algorithm (on a context-free forest) is","","","  ",". If other operations are added, the complexity of referent set composition will be limited by the least efficientoperation. 3.1 Temporal referents Since the referent sets for situations are also well definedunder type theory, this environment-based approach can also resolve attachment ambiguities involving verbs and verb phrases in addition to those involving only nominal referents. For example, if the interpreter is given the sentence “Coolant drained after test at 3:00,” which could mean the draining was at 3:00 or the test was at 3:00, the referents for the draining process and the testing process can be treated as time intervals in the environment history.5","First, a forest is constructed which shares the subtrees for “the test” and “after 3:00,” and the corresponding sets of referents. Each node in this forest (shown in Figure 3) is then annotated with the set of objects and intervals that it could refer to in the environment. Since there were no testing intervals at 3:00 in the environment, the referent set for the NP ‘test after 3:00’ is evaluated to the null set. But since there is an interval corresponding to a draining process (",") at the root, the whole VP will still be preferred as constituent due to the other interpretation. 3.2 Quantifierscoping The evaluation of referents for quantifiers also presents a tractability problem, because the functions they correspond to in the Montague analysis map two sets of entities to a truth value. This means that a straightforward representation of the potential referents of a quantifiersuch as ‘at least one’ would contain every pair of non-empty subsets of the set","of all entities, with a cardinality on the order of   ",". If the evaluation of referents is deferred until quantifiers are composed with the common nouns they quantify over, the","5","The composition of time intervals, as well as spatial regions and other types of situational referents, is more complex than that outlined for objects, but space does not permit a complete explanation. input sets would still be as large as the power sets of the nouns’ potential referents. Only if the evaluation of referents is deferred until complete NPs are composed as arguments (as subjects or objects of verbs, for example) can the output sets be restricted to a tractable size.","This provision only covers in situ quantifier scopings, however. In order to model raised scopings, arbitrarily long chains of raised quantifiers (if there are more than one) would have to be evaluated before they are attached to the verb, as they are in a CCG-style function composition analysis of raising (Park, 1996).6","Fortunately, universal quantifierslike ‘each’ and ‘every’ only choose the one maximal set of referents out of all the possible subsets in the power set, so any number of raised universal quantifier functions can be composed into a single function whose referent set would be no larger than the set of all possible entities.","It may not be possible to evaluate the potential referents of non-universal raised quantifiers in polynomial time, because the number of potential subsets they take as input is on the order of the power set of the noun’s potential referents. This apparent failure may hold some explanatory power, however, since raised quantifiers other than ‘each’ and ‘every’ seem to be exceedingly rare in the data. This scarcity may be a result of the significant computational complexity of evaluating them in isolation (before they are composed with a verb)."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation","paragraphs":["An implemented system incorporating this environment-based approach to disambiguation has been tested on a set of manufacturersupplied aircraft maintenance instructions, using a computer-aided design (CAD) model of a portion of the aircraft as the environment.
