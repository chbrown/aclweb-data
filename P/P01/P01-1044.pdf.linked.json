Our initial experiments yielded the surprising result that for many configurations empirical parsing speed was super-cubic in the sentence length. This led us to look more closely at the structure of the treebank grammar. The resulting analysis builds on the presentation of Charniak (1996), but extends it by elucidating the structure of non-terminal interrelationships in the Penn Treebank grammar. On the basis of these studies, we build simple theoretical models which closely predict observed parser performance, and, in particular, explain the originally observed super-cubic behavior.","We used treebank grammars induced directly from the local trees of the entire WSJ section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) (release 3). For each length and parameter setting, 25 sentences evenly distributed through the treebank were parsed. Since we were parsing sentences from among those from which our grammar was derived, coverage was never an issue. Every sentence parsed had at least one parse – the parse with which it was originally observed.1","The sentences were parsed using an implementa-tion of the probabilistic chart-parsing algorithm presented in (Klein and Manning, 2001). In that paper, we present a theoretical analysis showing an worst-case time bound for exhaustively parsing arbitrary context-free grammars. In what follows, we do not make use of the probabilistic aspects of the grammar or parser."]},{"title":"2 Parameters","paragraphs":["The parameters we varied were:  Tree Transforms: NOTRANSFORM, NOEMPTIES, NOUNARIESHIGH, and NOUNARIESLOW.

When we name a setting, any omitted parameters are assumed to be the defaults. 2.1 Tree Transforms In all cases, the grammar was directly induced from (transformed) Penn treebank trees. The transforms used are shown in figure 1. For all settings, functional tags and crossreferencing annotations were stripped. For NOTRANSFORM, no other modification was made. In particular, empty nodes (represented as -NONE- in the treebank) were turned into rules that generated the empty string (","), and there was no collapsing of categories (such as PRT and ADVP) as is often done in parsing work (Collins, 1997, etc.).

For NOUNARIESHIGH, and NOUNARIESLOW, unary nodes were removed as well, by keeping only the tops and the bottoms of unary chains, respectively.2 2.2 Grammar Rule Encodings The parser operates on Finite State Automata (FSA) grammar representations. We compiled grammar rules into FSAs in three ways: LISTs, TRIEs, and MINimized FSAs. An example of each representation is given in figure 2. For LIST encodings, each local tree type was encoded in its own, linearly structured FSA, corresponding to Earley (1970)-style dotted rules. For TRIE, there was one FSA per category, encoding together all rule types producing that category. For MIN, state-minimized FSAs were constructed from the trie FSAs.

There are two primary causes for the super-cubic time values. The first is theoretically uninteresting. The parser is implemented in Java, which uses garbage collection for memory management. Even when there is plenty of memory for a parse’s primary data structures, “garbage collection thrashing” can occur when logical possibility would be trie encodings which compact the grammar states by common suffix rather than common prefix, as in (Leermakers, 1992). The savings are less than for prefix compaction.","4","Note that the number of words (or size) of a span is equal to the difference between the endpoints.","5","The hardware was a 700 MHz Intel Pentium III, and we used up to 2GB of RAM for very long sentences or very poor parameters.

Figures 4 (a) and (b) show the traversal curves corresponding to the times in figure 3.","The interesting cause of the varying exponents comes from the “constant” terms in the theoretical bound. The second half of this paper shows how modeling growth in these terms can accurately predict parsing performance (see figures 9 to 13). 3.2 Memory The memory bound for the parser is",". Since the parser is running in a garbage-collected environment, it is hard to distinguish required memory from utilized memory. However, unlike time and traversals which in practice can diverge, memory requirements match the number of edges in the chart almost exactly, since the large data structures are all proportional in size to the number of edges",".6","Almost all edges stored are active edges (","for sentences longer than 30 words), of which there can be ",": one for every grammar state and span.

Thus, required memory will be implicitly modeled when we model active edges in section 4.3. 3.3 Tree Transforms Figure 4 (a) shows the effect of the tree transforms on traversal counts.

For the remainder of the paper, we will focus on the settings NOTRANSFORM and NOEMPTIES. 3.4 Grammar Encodings Figure 4 (b) shows the effect of each tree transform on traversal counts. The more compacted the grammar representation, the more time-efficient the parser is. 3.5 Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Figure 4 (c) shows the effect on total edges and traversals of using top-down and bottom-up strategies. There are some extremely minimal savings in traversals due to top-down filtering effects, but there is a corresponding penalty in edges as rules whose left-corner cannot be built are introduced. Given the highly unrestrictive nature of the treebank grammar, it is not very surprising that top-down filtering provides such little benefit. However, this is a useful observation about real world parsing performance. The advantages of top-down chart parsing in providing grammar-driven prediction are often advanced (e.g., Allen 1995:66), but in practice we find almost no value in this for broad coverage CFGs. While some part of this is perhaps due to errors in the treebank, a large part just reflects the true nature of broad coverage grammars: e.g., once you allow adverbial phrases almost anywhere and allow PPs, (participial) VPs, and (temporal) NPs to be adverbial phrases, along with phrases headed by adverbs, then there is very little useful top-down control left. With such a permissive grammar, the only real constraints are in the POS tags which anchor the local trees (see section 4.3). Therefore, for the remainder of the paper, we consider only bottom-up settings."]},{"title":"4 Models","paragraphs":["In the remainder of the paper we provide simple mod-","els that nevertheless accurately capture the varying","magnitudes and exponents seen for different grammar","encodings and tree transformations. Since the","","term","of","","","comes directly from the number of start, split, and end points for traversals, it is certainly not responsible for the varying growth rates.

Thus, to be able to evaluate and model the total edge counts, we look to the number of edges over a given span.

An interesting fact is that the saturation of a span is, for the treebank grammar and sentences, essentially independent of what size sentence the span is from and where in the sentence the span begins. Thus, for a given span size, we report the average over all spans of that size occurring anywhere in any sentence parsed. 4.1 Treebank Grammar Structure The reason that effective growth is not found in the ","component is that passive saturation stays almost constant as span size increases. However, the more interesting result is not that saturation is relatively constant (for spans beyond a small, grammar-dependent size), but that the saturation values are extremely large compared to","(see section 4.2).

For these settings, the passive saturation can be summarized by three saturation numbers: zero-spans (empties)",", one-spans (words)",", and all larger spans (categories) ",". Taking averages directly from the data, we have our first model, shown on the right in figure 9.","For the NOUNARIES settings, there will be no same-span reachability and hence no SCCs. To reach a new category always requires the use of at least one overt word. However, for spans of size 6 or so, enough words exist that the same high saturation effect will still be observed. This can be modeled quite simply by assuming each terminal unlocks a fixed fraction of the nonterminals, as seen in the right graph of figure 9, but we omit the details here.","Using these passive saturation models, we can directly estimate the total passive edge counts by summation:","","  ","","10","The maximum possible passive saturation for any span greater than one is equal to the number of phrasal categories in the treebank grammar: 27. However, empty and size-one spans can additionally be covered by POS tag edges. The predictions are shown in figure 8.

With unaries, the linear terms in the reduced equation are significant over these sentence lengths and drag down the exponent. The linear terms are larger for NOTRANSFORM and therefore drag the exponent down more.11","Without unaries, the more gradual saturation growth increases the total exponent, more so for NOUNARIESLOW than NOUNARIESHIGH. However, note that for spans around 8 and onward, the saturation curves are essentially constant for all settings. 4.3 Active Edges Active edges are the vast majority of edges and essentially determine (non-transient) memory requirements. While passive counts depend only on the grammar transform, active counts depend primarily on the encoding for general magnitude but also on the transform for the details (and exponent effects). Figure 10 shows the total active edges by sentence size for three settings chosen to illustrate the main effects.

The active saturation for any span is bounded above by  , the number of active grammar states (states in the grammar FSAs which correspond to active edges). For list grammars, this number is the sum of the lengths of all rules in the grammar. For trie grammars, it is the number of unique rule prefixes (including the LHS) in the grammar. For minimized grammars, it is the number of states with outgoing transitions (non-black states in figure 2). The value of","is shown for each setting in figure 12. Note that the maximum number of active states is dramatically larger for lists since common rule prefixes are duplicated many times. For minimized FSAs, the state reduction is even greater. Since states which are earlier in a rule are much more likely to match a span, the fact that tries (and min FSAs) compress early states is particularly advantageous.","Unlike passive saturation, which was relatively close to its bound",", active saturation is much farther below",". Furthermore, while passive saturation was relatively constant in span size, at least after a point, active saturation quite clearly grows with span size, even for spans well beyond those shown in figure 11. We now model these active saturation curves.","What does it take for a given active state to match a given span? For TRIE and LIST, an active state corresponds to a prefix of a rule and is a mix of POS tags and phrasal categories, each of which must be matched, in order, over that span for that state to be reached. Given the large SCCs seen in section 4.1, phrasal categories, to a first approximation, might as well be wildcards, able to match any span, especially if empties are present. However, the tags are, in comparison, very restricted. Tags must actually match a word in the span.","More precisely, consider an active state","in the grammar and a span",". In the TRIE and LIST encodings, there is some, possibly empty, list","of labels that must be matched over","before an active edge with this state can be constructed over that span.12","Assume that the phrasal categories in","can match any span (or any non-zero span in NOEMPTIES).13","Therefore, phrasal categories in","do not constrain whether","can match",". The real issue is whether the tags in","will match words in",". Assume that a random tag matches a random word with a fixed probability",", independently of where the tag is in the rule and where the word is in the sentence.14","Assume further that, although tags occur more often than categories in rules (63.9% of rule items are tags in the NOTRANSFORM case15","), given a 12 The essence of the MIN model, which is omitted here,","is that states are represented by the “easiest” label sequence","which leads to that state. 13 The model for the NOUNARIES cases is slightly more","complex, but similar. 14 This is of course false; in particular, tags at the end of","rules disproportionately tend to be punctuation tags. 15 Although the present model does not directly apply to","the NOUNARIES cases, NOUNARIESLOW is significantly fixed number of tags and categories, all permutations are equally likely to appear as rules.16","Under these assumptions, the probability that an active state","is in the treebank grammar will depend only on the number","of tags and","of categories in  .

However, with our assumptions, the probability that a randomly chosen set of","tags matches a randomly chosen set of  words is simply",".","We then have an expression for the chance of matching a specific alignment of an active state to a specific span. Clearly, there can be many alignments which differ only in the spans of the categories, but line up the same tags with the same words. However, there will be a certain number of unique ways in which the words and tags can be lined up between","and",". If we know this number, we can calculate the total probability that there is some alignment which matches. For example, consider the state NP","NP CC NP .

The NPs can match any span, so there are","alignments which are distinct from the standpoint of the CC tag – it can be in any position. The chance that some alignment will match is therefore","",", which, for small","is roughly linear in",". It should be clear that for an active state like this, the longer the span, the more likely it is that this state will be found over that span.","It is unfortunately not the case that all states with the same signature will match a span length with the same probability. For example, the state NP","NP NP CC . NP has the same signature, but must align the CC with the final element of the span. A state like this will not become more likely (in our model) as span size increases. However, with some straightforward but space-consuming recurrences, we can calculate the expected chance that a random rule of a given signature will match a given span length. Since we know how many states have a given signature, we can calculate the total active saturation","as","  "," more efficient than NOUNARIESHIGH despite having more active states, largely because using the bottoms of chains increases the frequency of tags relative to categories.","16","This is also false; tags occur slightly more often at the beginnings of rules and less often at the ends.","This model has two parameters. First, there is","which","we estimated directly by looking at the expected match","between the distribution of tags in rules and the distri-","bution of tags in the Treebank text (which is around","1/17.7). No factor for POS tag ambiguity was used,","another simplification.17","Second, there is the map","","from signatures to a number of active states,","which was read directly from the compiled grammars. This model predicts the active saturation curves","shown to the right in figure 11. Note that the model,","though not perfect, exhibits the qualitative differences","between the settings, both in magnitudes and expo-","nents.18","In particular:"," The transform primarily changes the saturation over short spans, while the encoding determines the overall magnitudes. For example, in TRIE-NOEMPTIES the low-span saturation is lower than in TRIE-NOTRANSFORM since short spans in the former case can match only signatures which have both and","small, while in the latter only","needs to be small. Therefore, the several hundred states which are reachable only via categories all match every span starting from size 0 for NOTRANSFORM, but are accessed only gradually for NOEMPTIES. However, for larger spans, the behavior converges to counts characteristic for TRIE encodings."," For LIST encodings, the early saturations are huge, due to the fact that most of the states which are available early for trie grammars are precisely the ones duplicated up to thousands of times in the list grammars. However, the additive gain over the initial states is roughly the same for both, as after a few items are specified, the tries become sparse."," The actual magnitudes and exponents19","of the saturations are surprisingly well predicted, suggesting that this model captures the essential behavior.","These active saturation curves produce the active total curves in figure 10, which are also qualitatively correct in both magnitudes and exponents. 4.4 Traversals Now that we have models for active and passive edges, we can combine them to model traversal counts as well. We assume that the chance for a passive edge and an active edge to combine into a traversal is a single probability representing how likely an arbitrary active state is to have a continuation with a label matching an arbitrary passive state. List rule states have only one continuation, while trie rule states in the branch-17 In general, the","we used was lower for not having mod-","eled tagging ambiguity, but higher for not having modeled","the fact that the SCCs are not of size 27. 18 And does so without any “tweakable” parameters. 19 Note that the list curves do not compellingly suggest a","power law model. 0.0M 5.0M 10.0M 15.0M 20.0M","0 10 20 30 40 50 SentenceLength Avg.Traversals List-NoTransform exp2.60r0.999 Trie-NoTransform exp2.86r1.000 Trie-NoEmpties exp3.28r1.000 0.0M 5.0M 10.0M 15.0M 20.0M","0 10 20 30 40 50 SentenceLength Avg.Traversals List-NoTransform exp2.60r0.999 Trie-NoTransform exp2.92r1.000 Trie-NoEmpties exp3.47r1.000 Figure 13: The average number of traversals for sentences of a given length as observed in practice (left), and as predicted by the models presented in the latter part of the paper (right).","ing portion of the trie average about 3.7 (min FSAs","4.2).20","Making another uniformity assumption, we as-","sume that this combination probability is the contin-","uation degree divided by the total number of passive","labels, categorical or tag (73). In figure 13, we give graphs and exponents of the","traversal counts, both observed and predicted, for var-","ious settings. Our model correctly predicts the approx-","imate values and qualitative facts, including:"," For LIST, the observed exponent is lower than for TRIEs, though the total number of traversals is dramatically higher. This is because the active saturation is growing much faster for TRIEs; note that in cases like this the lower-exponent curve will never actually outgrow the higher-exponent curve."," Of the settings shown, only TRIE-NOEMPTIES exhibits super-cubic traversal totals. Despite their similar active and passive exponents, TRIE-NOEMPTIES and TRIE-NOTRANSFORM vary in traversal growth due to the “early burst” of active edges which gives TRIE-NOTRANSFORM significantly more edges over short spans than its power law would predict. This excess leads to a sizeable quadratic addend in the number of transitions, caus-ing the average best-fit exponent to drop without greatly affecting the overall magnitudes.","Overall, growth of saturation values in span size increases best-fit traversal exponents, while early spikes in saturation reduce them. The traversal exponents therefore range from LIST-NOTRANSFORM at 2.6 to TRIE-NOUNARIESLOW at over 3.8. However, the final performance is more dependent on the magnitudes, which range from LIST-NOTRANSFORM as the worst, despite its exponent, to MIN-NOUNARIESHIGH as the best. The single biggest factor in the time and traversal performance turned out to be the encoding, which is fortunate because the choice of grammar transform will depend greatly on the application. 20","This is a simplification as well, since the shorter prefixes that tend to have higher continuation degrees are on average also a larger fraction of the active edges."]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We built simple but accurate models on the basis of two observations. First, passive saturation is relatively constant in span size, but large due to high reachability among phrasal categories in the grammar. Second, active saturation grows with span size because, as spans increase, the tags in a given active edge are more likely to find a matching arrangement over a span. Combin-ing these models, we demonstrated that a wide range of empirical qualitative and quantitative behaviors of an exhaustive parser could be derived, including the potential super-cubic traversal growth over sentence lengths of interest."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["James Allen. 1995.
