The Multi-Class Composite N-gram maintains an accurate word prediction capability and reliability for sparse data with a compact model size based on multiple word clusters, called Multi-Classes. In the Multi-Class, the statistical connectivity at each position of the N-grams is regarded as word attributes, and one word cluster each is created to represent the positional attributes. Furthermore, by introducing higher order word N-grams through the grouping of frequent word successions, Multi-Class N-grams are extended to Multi-Class Composite N-grams. In experiments, the Multi-Class Composite N-grams result in 9.5% lower perplexity and a 16% lower word error rate in speech recognition with a 40% smaller parameter size than conventional word 3-grams."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word N-grams have been widely used as a statistical language model for language processing. Word N-grams are models that give the transition probability of the next word from the previous ","","","word sequence based on a statistical analysis of the huge text corpus. Though word N-grams are more effective and flexible than rule-based grammatical constraints in many cases, their performance strongly depends on the size of training data, since they are statistical models.","In word N-grams, the accuracy of the word prediction capability will increase according to the number of the order N, but also the number of word transition combinations will exponentially increase. Moreover, the size of training data for reliable transition probability values will also dramatically increase. This is a critical problem for spoken language in that it is difficult to collect training data sufficient enough for a reliable model. As a solution to this problem, class N-grams are proposed.","In class N-grams, multiple words are mapped to one word class, and the transition probabilities from word to word are approximated to the probabilities from word class to word class. The performance and model size of class N-grams strongly depend on the definition of word classes. In fact, the performance of class N-grams based on the part-of-speech (POS) word class is usually quite a bit lower than that of word N-grams. Based on this fact, effective word class definitions are required for high performance in class N-grams.","In this paper, the Multi-Class assignment is proposed for effective word class definitions. The word class is used to represent word connectivity, i.e. which words will appear in a neighboring position with what probability. In Multi-Class assignment, the word connectivity in each position of the N-grams is regarded as a different attribute, and multiple classes corresponding to each attribute are assigned to each word. For the word clustering of each Multi-Class for each word, a method is used in which word classes are formed automatically and statistically from a corpus, not using a priori knowledge as POS information. Furthermore, by introducing higher order word N-grams through the grouping of frequent word successions, Multi-Class N-grams are extended to Multi-Class Composite N-grams."]},{"title":"2 N-gram Language Models Based on Multiple Word Classes 2.1 Class N-grams","paragraphs":["Word N-grams are models that statistically give the transition probability of the next word from the previous","","","word sequence.

However, accuracy of the word prediction capability will be lower than that of word N-grams with a sufficient size of training data, since the representation capability of the word dependent, unique connectivity attribute will be lost for the approximation base word class.","2.2 Problems in the Definition of Word Classes In class N-grams, word classes are used to represent the connectivity between words. In the conventional word class definition, word connectivity for which words follow and that for which word precedes are treated as the same neighboring characteristics without distinction. Therefore, only the words that have the same word connectivity for the following words and the preceding word belong to the same word class, and this word class definition cannot represent the word connectivity attribute efficiently. Take ”a” and ”an” as an example. Both are classified by POS as an Indefinite Article, and are assigned to the same word class. In this case, information about the difference with the following word connectivity will be lost. On the other hand, a different class assignment for both words will cause the information about the community in the preceding word connectivity to be lost. This directional distinction is quite crucial for languages with reflection such as French and Japanese. 2.3 Multi-Class and Multi-Class N-grams As in the previous example of ”a” and ”an”, following and preceding word connectivity are not always the same. Let’s consider the case of different connectivity for the words that precede and follow. Multiple word classes are assigned to each word to represent the following and preceding word connectivity. As the connectivity of the word preceding ”a” and ”an” is the same, it is efficient to assign them to the same word class to represent the preceding word connectivity, if as-signing different word classes to represent the following word connectivity at the same time. To apply these word class definitions to formula (2), the next formula is given.","","     ","  ","","  ","","","      ","","","","","","   ","","","","","","","(3)","In the above formula,   represents the word class","in the target position to which the word","","be-","longs, and ","","represents the word class in the N-th position in a conditional word sequence.","We call this multiple word class definition, a Multi-Class. Similarly, we call class N-grams based on the Multi-Class, Multi-Class N-grams (Yamamoto and Sagisaka, 1999)."]},{"title":"3 Automatic Extraction of Word Clusters 3.1 Word Clustering for Multi-Class 2-grams","paragraphs":["For word clustering in class N-grams, POS information is sometimes used. Though POS information can be used for words that do not appear in the corpus, this is not always an optimal word classification for N-grams. The POS information does not accurately represent the statistical word connectivity characteristics. Better word-clustering is to be considered based on word connectivity by the reflection neighboring characteristics in the corpus. In this paper, vectors are used to represent word neighboring characteristics. The elements of the vectors are forward or backward word 2-gram probabilities to the clustering target word after being smoothed. And we consider that word pairs that have a small distance between vectors also have similar word neighboring characteristics (Brown et al., 1992) (Bai et al., 1998). In this method, the same vector is assigned to words that do not appear in the corpus, and the same word cluster will be assigned to these words. To avoid excessively rough clustering over different POS, we cluster the words under the condition that only words with the same POS can belong to the same cluster. Parts-of-speech that have the same connectivity in each Multi-Class are merged. For example, if different parts-of-speeche are assigned to ”a” and ”an”, these parts-of-speeche are regarded as the same for the preceding word cluster. Word clustering is thus performed in the following manner. 1. Assign one unique class per word.s.","2. Assign a vector to each class or to each word ",". This represents the word connectivity attribute.","","","   ","","","","","","","  ","","","","","       ","","","","   "," (4)","","","   ","","","","","","","  ","","","","","","     ","","","","   ","","(5)","Where,","","",""," represents the preceding word","connectivity,  ","","","represents the following","word connectivity, and","","is the value of the probability of the succeeding class-word 2-gram or word 2-gram, while","","is the same for the preceding one.","3.

Repeat step 2 until the number of classes is reduced to the desired number.","3.2 Word Clustering for Multi-Class 3-grams To apply the multiple clustering for 2-grams to 3-grams, the clustering target in the conditional part is extended to a word pair from the single word in 2-grams. Number of clustering targets in the preceding class increases to","","from","in 2-grams, and the length of the vector in the succeeding class also increase to","",". Therefore, efficient word clustering is needed to keep the reliability of 3-grams after the clustering and a reasonable calculation cost.","To avoid losing the reliability caused by the data sparseness of the word pair in the history of 3-grams, approximation is employed using distance-2 2-grams. The authority of this approximation is based on a report that the association of word 2-grams and distance-2 2-grams based on the maximum entropy method gives a good approximation of word 3-grams (Zhang et al., 1999).

In the Multi-Class method, multiple classes are assigned to each word by clustering the following and preceding word characteristics separately. This word clustering is performed based on the word connectivity in the corpus. Therefore, the Multi-Class N-grams based on Multi-Class can improve reliability with a compact model size without losing accuracy.","Furthermore, Multi-Class N-grams are extended to Multi-Class Composite N-grams. In the Multi-Class Composite N-grams, higher order word N-grams are introduced through the grouping of frequent word successions. Therefore, these have accuracy in higher order word N-grams added to reliability in the Multi-Class N-grams. And the number of increased parameters with the introduction of word successions is at most the number of word successions times 2. Therefore, Multi-Class Composite 3-grams can maintain a compact model size in the Multi-Class N-grams. Nevertheless, Multi-Class Composite 3-grams are represented by the usual formation of 3-grams. This formation is easily handled by a language processor, especially that requires huge calculation cost as speech recognitions.","In experiments, the Multi-Class Composite 3-gram resulted in 9.5% lower perplexity and 16% lower word error rate in continuous speech recognition with a 40% smaller model size than the conventional word 3-gram. And it is confirmed that high performance with a small model size can be created for Multi-Class Composite 3-grams."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We would like to thank Michael Paul and Rainer Gruhn for their assistance in writing some of the explanations in this paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Shuanghu Bai, Haizhou Li, and Baosheng Yuan. 1998.
