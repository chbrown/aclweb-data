The answer is constrained to be found either in a short (50 bytes) or a long (250 bytes) text span. Frequently, keywords extracted from the natural language question are either within the text span or in its immediate vicinity, forming a text paragraph. Since such paragraphs must be identified throughout voluminous collections, automatic and autonomous Q&A systems incorporate an index of the collection as well as a paragraph retrieval mechanism.","Recent results from the TREC evaluations ((Kwok et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Allen","1","The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) is a series of workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), designed to advance the state-of-the-art in information retrieval (IR) et al., 2000)) show that Information Retrieval (IR) techniques alone are not sufficient for finding answers with high precision. In fact, more and more systems adopt architectures in which the semantics of the questions are captured prior to paragraph retrieval (e.g. (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 2000) (Harabagiu et al., 2000)) and used later in extracting the answer (cf. (Abney et al., 2000)). When processing a natural language question two goals must be achieved. First we need to know what is the expected answer type; in other words, we need to know what we are looking for. Second, we need to know where to look for the answer, e.g. we must identify the question keywords to be used in the paragraph retrieval.","The expected answer type is determined based on the question stem, e.g. who, where or how much and eventually one of the question concepts, when the stem is ambiguous (for example what), as described in (Harabagiu et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Srihari and Li, 2000). However finding question keywords that retrieve all candidate answers cannot be achieved only by deriving some of the words used in the question. Frequently, question reformulations use different words, but imply the same answer. Moreover, many equivalent answers are phrased differently. In this paper we argue that the answer to complex natural language questions cannot be extracted with significant precision from large collections of texts unless several lexico-semantic feedback loops are allowed.","In Section 2 we survey the related work whereas in Section 3 we describe the feedback loops that refine the search for correct answers. Section 4 presents the approach of devising keyword alternations whereas Section 5 details the recognition of question reformulations. Section 6 evaluates the results of the Q&A system and Section 7 summarizes the conclusions."]},{"title":"2 Related work","paragraphs":["Mechanisms for open-domain textual Q&A were not discovered in the vacuum. The 90s witnessed a constant improvement of IR systems, determined by the availability of large collections of texts and the TREC evaluations. In parallel, Information Extraction (IE) techniques were developed under the TIPSTER Message Understanding Conference (MUC) competitions. Typically, IE systems identify information of interest in a text and map it to a predefined, target representation, known as template. Although simple combinations of IR and IE techniques are not practical solutions for open-domain textual Q&A because IE systems are based on domain-specific knowledge, their contribution to current open-domain Q&A methods is significant. For example, state-of-the-art Named Entity (NE) recognizers developed for IE systems were readily available to be incorporated in Q&A systems and helped recognize names of people, organizations, locations or dates.","Assuming that it is very likely that the answer is a named entity, (Srihari and Li, 2000) describes a NE-supported Q&A system that functions quite well when the expected answer type is one of the categories covered by the NE recognizer. Unfortunately this system is not fully autonomous, as it depends on IR results provided by external search engines. Answer extractions based on NE recognizers were also developed in the Q&A presented in (Abney et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 2000). As noted in (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), Q&A systems that did not include NE recognizers performed poorly in the TREC evaluations, especially in the short answer category. Some Q&A systems, like (Moldovan et al., 2000) relied both on NE recognizers and some empirical indicators.","However, the answer does not always belong to a category covered by the NE recognizer. For such cases several approaches have been developed. The first one, presented in (Harabagiu et al., 2000), the answer type is derived from a large answer taxonomy. A different approach, based on statistical techniques was proposed in (Radev et al., 2000). (Cardie et al., 2000) presents a method of extracting answers as noun phrases in a novel way. Answer extraction based on grammatical information is also promoted by the system described in (Clarke et al., 2000).","One of the few Q&A systems that takes into account morphological, lexical and semantic alternations of terms is described in (Ferret et al., 2000). To our knowledge, none of the current open-domain Q&A systems use any feedback loops to generate lexico-semantic alternations. This paper shows that such feedback loops enhance significantly the performance of open-domain textual Q&A systems."]},{"title":"3 Textual Q&A Feedback Loops","paragraphs":["Before initiating the search for the answer to a natural language question we take into account the fact that it is very likely that the same question or a very similar one has been posed to the system before, and thus those results can be used again. To find such cached questions, we measure the similarity to the previously processed questions and when a reformulation is identified, the system returns the corresponding cached correct answer, as illustrated in Figure 1.","When no reformulations are detected, the search for answers is based on the conjecture that the eventual answer is likely to be found in a text paragraph that (a) contains the most representative question concepts and (b) includes a textual concept of the same category as the expected answer. Since the current retrieval technology does not model semantic knowledge, we break down this search into a boolean retrieval, based on some question keywords and a filtering mechanism, that retains only those passages containing the expected answer type. Both the question keywords and the expected answer type are identified by using the dependencies derived from the question parse.","By implementing our own version of the publicly available Collins parser (Collins, 1996), we also learned a dependency model that enables the mapping of parse trees into sets of binary relations between the head-word of each constituent and its sibling-words. For example, the parse tree of TREC-9 question Q210: “How many dogs pull a sled in the Iditarod ?” is: JJ S Iditarod VP NP PP NP NNPDTINNN NP DTVBPNNS NP manyHow WRB dogs pull a sled in the","For each possible constituent in a parse tree, rules first described in (Magerman, 1995) and (Jelinek et al., 1994) identify the head-child and propagate the head-word to its parent. For the parse of question Q210 the propagation is: NP (sled) DT NN DTIN manyHow WRB dogs NNSJJ NP (dogs) VBP pull a sled in the Iditarod NNP (Iditarod) NP (Iditarod) PP (Iditarod) NP (sled) VP (pull) S (pull)","When the propagation is over, head-modifier relations are extracted, generating the following dependency structure, called question semantic form in (Harabagiu et al., 2000). dogs IditarodCOUNT pull sled","In the structure above, COUNT represents the expected answer type, replacing the question stem “how many”. Few question stems are unambiguous (e.g. who, when). If the question stem is ambiguous, the expected answer type is determined by the concept from the question semantic form that modifies the stem. This concept is searched in an ANSWER TAXONOMY comprising several tops linked to a significant number of WordNet noun and verb hierarchies. Each top represents one of the possible expected answer types implemented in our system (e.g. PERSON, PRODUCT, NUMERICAL VALUE, COUNT, LOCATION). We encoded a total of 38 possible answer types.","In addition, the question keywords used for paragraph retrieval are also derived from the question semantic form. The question keywords are organized in an ordered list which first enumerates the named entities and the question quota-tions, then the concepts that triggered the recognition of the expected answer type followed by all adjuncts, in a left-to-right order, and finally the question head. The conjunction of the keywords represents the boolean query applied to the document index. (Moldovan et al., 2000) details the empirical methods used in our system for transforming a natural language question into an IR query.

However, for question answering, this is an advantage, exploited by the first feedback loop represented in Figure 1. Feedback loop 1 is triggered when the number of retrieved paragraphs is either smaller than a minimal value or larger than a maximal value determined beforehand for each answer type. Alternatively, when the number of paragraphs is within limits, those paragraphs that do not contain at least one concept of the same semantic category as the expected answer type are filtered out. The remaining paragraphs are parsed and their dependency structures, called answer semantic forms, are derived. Feedback loop 2 illustrated in Figure 1 is activated when the question semantic form and the answer semantic form cannot by unified. The unification involves three steps: ","Step 1: The recognition of the expected answer type. The first step marks all possible concepts that are answer candidates. For example, in the case of TREC -9 question Q243: “Where did the ukulele originate ?”, the expected answer type is LOCATION. In the paragraph “the ukulele introduced from Portugal into the Hawaiian islands” contains two named entities of the category LO-CATION and both are marked accordingly. ","Step 2: The identification of the question concepts. The second step identifies the question words, their synonyms, morphological deriva-tions or WordNet hypernyms in the answer semantic form. ","Step 3: The assessment of the similarities of dependencies. In the third step, two classes of similar dependencies are considered, generating unifications of the question and answer semantic forms:","Class L2-1: there is a one-to-one mapping between the binary dependencies of the question and binary dependencies from the answer semantic form. Moreover, these dependencies largely cover the question semantic form2",". An example is: Answer Question Q261: What company sells most greetings cards ? largest sellsORGANIZATION greeting cards most \"Hallmark remains the largest maker of greeting cards\" ORGANIZATION(Hallmark) maker greeting cards","We find an entailment between producing, or making and selling goods, derived from WordNet, since synset","make, produce, create","has the genus manufacture, defined in the gloss of its homomorphic nominalization as “for sale”. Therefore the semantic form of question Q261 and its illustrated answer are similar.","Class L2-2: Either the question semantic form or the answer semantic form contain new con-","2","Some modifiers might be missing from the answer. cepts, that impose a bridging inference. The knowledge used for inference is of lexical nature and is later employed for abductions that justify the correctness of the answer. For example: Answer Question Q231: Who was the president of Vichy France ? Vichy PERSON president France Vichy","\"Marshall Philippe Petain, head of Vichy France government\" head PERSON(Marshall Philippe Petain) government France Nouns head and government are constituents of a possible paraphrase of president, i.e. “head of government”. However, only world knowledge can justify the answer, since there are countries where the prime minister is the head of government. Presupposing this inference, the semantic form of the question and answer are similar. Feedback loop 3 from Figure 1 brings forward additional semantic information. Two classes of similar dependencies are considered for the abduction of answers, performed in a manner similar to the justifications described in (Harabagiu et al., 2000).","Class L3-1: is characterized by the need for contextual information, brought forward by reference resolution. In the following example, a chain of coreference links Bill Gates and Microsoft founder in the candidate answer: Answer Question Q318: Where did Bill Gates go to college? Bill Gates ORGANIZATION collegego Bill Gates \"Harvard dropout and Microsoft founder\"ORGANIZATION=college(Harvard) dropout founder Microsoft ","Class L3-2: Paraphrases and additional information produce significant differences between the question semantic form and the answer semantic form. However, semantic information contributes to the normalization of the answer dependencies until they can be unified with the question dependencies. For example, if (a) a volcano IS-A mountain; (b) lava IS-PART of volcano, and moreover it is a part coming from the inside; and (c) fragments of lava have all the properties of lava, the following question semantic form and answer semantic form can be unified: Answer Question Q361: How hot does the inside of an active volcano get ? belched out TEMPERATURE get inside volcano active 300 degrees Fahrenheit\" TEMPERATURE(300 degrees) fragments lava mountain \"lava fragments belched out of the mountain were as hot The resulting normalized dependencies are: TEMPERATURE(300 degrees) belched out [lava belched out]","lava/ [inside volcano] active/mountain/volcano","The semantic information and the world knowledge needed for the above unifications are available from WordNet (Miller, 1995). More-over, this knowledge can be translated in axiomatic form and used for abductive proofs. Each of the feedback loops provide the retrieval engine with new alternations of the question keywords. Feedback loop 2 considers morphological and lexical alternations whereas Feedback loop 3 uses semantic alternations. The method of generating the alternations is detailed in Section 4."]},{"title":"4 Keyword Alternations","paragraphs":["To enhance the chance of finding the answer to a question, each feedback loop provides with a different set of keyword alternations. Such alternations can be classified according to the linguistic knowledge they are based upon: 1.Morphological Alternations. When lexical alternations are necessary because no answer was found yet, the first keyword that is altered is determined by the question word that either prompted the expected answer type or is in the same semantic class with the expected answer type. For example, in the case of question Q209: “Who invented the paper clip ?”, the expected answer type is PERSON and so is the subject of the verb invented , lexicalized as the nominalization inventor. Moreover, since our retrieval mechanism does not stem keywords, all the inflections of the verb are also considered. Therefore, the initial query is expanded into: QUERY(Q209):","paper AND clip AND (invented OR inventor OR invent OR invents) 2. Lexical Alternations. WordNet encodes a wealth of semantic information that is easily mined. Seven types of semantic relations span concepts, enabling the retrieval of synonyms and other semantically related terms. Such alternations improve the recall of the answer paragraphs. For example, in the case of question Q221: “Who killed Martin Luther King ?”, by considering the synonym of killer, the noun assassin, the Q&A system retrieved paragraphs with the correct answer. Similarly, for the question Q206: “How far is the moon ?”, since the adverb far is encoded in WordNet as being an attribute of distance, by adding this noun to the retrieval keywords, a correct answer is found. 3. Semantic Alternations and Paraphrases. We define as semantic alternations of a keyword those words or collocations from WordNet that (a) are not members of any WordNet synsets containing the original keyword; and (b) have a chain of WordNet relations or bigram relations that connect it to the original keyword. These relations can be translated in axiomatic form and thus participate to the abductive backchaining from the answer to the question - to justify the answer. For example semantic alternations involving only WordNet relations were used in the case of question Q258: “Where do lobsters like to live ?”. Since in WordNet the verb prefer has verb like as a hypernym, and moreover, its glossed definition is liking better, the query becomes: QUERY(Q258):","lobsters AND (like OR prefer) AND live","Sometimes multiple keywords are replaced by a semantic alternation. Sometimes these alternations are similar to the relations between multiterm paraphrases and single terms, other time they simply are semantically related terms. In the case of question Q210: “How many dogs pull a sled in the Iditarod ?”, since the definition of WordNet sense 2 of noun harness contains the bigram “pull cart” and both sled and cart are forms of vehicles, the alternation of the pair of keywords pull, slide","is rendered by harness. Only when this feedback is received, the paragraph containing the correct answer is retrieved.","To decide which keywords should be expanded and what form of alternations should be used we rely on a set of heuristics which complement the heuristics that select the question keywords and generate the queries (as described in (Moldovan et al., 2000)): Heuristic 1: Whenever the first feedback loop requires the addition of the main verb of the question as a query keyword, generate all verb conjugations as well as its nominalizations. Heuristic 2: Whenever the second feedback loop requires lexical alternations, collect from WordNet all the synset elements of the direct hypernyms and direct hyponyms of verbs and nominalizations that are used in the query. If multiple verbs are used, expand them in a left-to-right or-der. Heuristic 3: Whenever the third feedback loop imposes semantic alternations expressed as paraphrases, if a verb and its direct object from the question are selected as query keywords, search for other verb-object pairs semantically related to the query pair. When new pairs are located in the glosses of a synset",", expand the query verb-object pair with all the elements from",".","Another set of possible alternations, defined by the existence of lexical relations between pairs of words from different question are used to detect question reformulations. The advantage of these different forms of alternations is that they enable the resolution of similar questions through answer caching instead of normal Q&A processing."]},{"title":"5 Question Reformulations","paragraphs":["In TREC-9 243 questions were reformulations of 54 inquiries, thus asking for the same answer.
