Identifying and isolating topics by dividing documents, which is called text segmentation, is important for many natural language processing tasks, in-cluding information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Salton et al., 1996) and summarization (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000). In information retrieval, users are often interested in particular topics (parts) of retrieved documents, in-stead of the documents themselves. To meet such needs, documents should be segmented into coherent topics. Summarization is often used for a long document that includes multiple topics. A summary of such a document can be composed of summaries of the component topics. Identification of topics is the task of text segmentation.","A lot of research has been done on text segmentation (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Salton et al., 1996; Yaari, 1997; Kan et al., 1998; Choi, 2000; Nakao, 2000). A major characteristic of the methods used in this research is that they do not require training data to segment given texts. Hearst (1994), for example, used only the similarity of word distributions in a given text to segment the text. Consequently, these methods can be applied to any text in any domain, even if training data do not exist. This property is important when text segmentation is applied to information retrieval or summarization, because both tasks deal with domain-independent documents.","Another application of text segmentation is the segmentation of a continuous broadcast news story into individual stories (Allan et al., 1998). In this application, systems relying on supervised learning (Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999) achieve good performance because there are plenty of training data in the domain. These systems, however, can not be applied to domains for which no training data exist.","The text segmentation algorithm described in this paper is intended to be applied to the summarization of documents or speeches. Therefore, it should be able to handle domain-independent texts. The algorithm thus does not use any training data. It requires only the given documents for segmentation. It can, however, incorporate training data when they are available, as discussed in Section 5.","The algorithm selects the optimum segmentation in terms of the probability defined by a statistical model. This is a new approach for domain-independent text segmentation. Previous approaches usually used lexical cohesion to segment texts into topics. Kozima (1993), for example, used cohesion based on the spreading activa-tion on a semantic network. Hearst (1994) used the similarity of word distributions as measured by the cosine to gauge cohesion. Reynar (1994) used word repetition as a measure of cohesion. Choi (2000) used the rank of the cosine, rather than the cosine itself, to measure the similarity of sentences.","The statistical model for the algorithm is described in Section 2, and the algorithm for obtaining the maximum-probability segmentation is described in Section 3. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Further discussion and our conclusions are given in Sections 5 and 6, respectively."]},{"title":"2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation","paragraphs":["We first define the probability of a segmentation of a given text in this section.

Calculate the cost    of edge    for   ","  by using Equation (16).","Step 2. Find the minimum-cost path from","","to","  . Algorithms for finding the minimum-cost path in a graph are well known. An algorithm that can provide a solution for Step 2 will be a simpler version of the algorithm used to find the maximum-probability solution in Japanese morphological analysis (Nagata, 1994). Therefore, a solution can be obtained by applying a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm.4","DP algorithms have also been used for text segmentation by other researchers (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998).","The path thus obtained represents the minimum-cost segmentation in","when edges correspond with segments. In Figure 1, for example, if    is the minimum-cost path, then      is the minimum-cost segmentation.","The algorithm automatically determines the number of segments. But the number of segments can also be specified explicitly by specifying the number of edges in the minimum-cost path.","The algorithm allows the text to be segmented anywhere between words; i.e., all the positions","4","A program that implements the algorithm described in this section is available at http: //www.crl.go.jp/jt/a132/members/mutiyama /softwares.html. between words are candidates for segment boundaries. It is easy, however, to modify the algorithm so that the text can only be segmented at particular positions, such as the ends of sentences or paragraphs. This is done by using a subset of  in Equation (15). We use only the edges whose initial and terminal vertices are candidate boundaries that meet particular conditions, such as being the ends of sentences or paragraphs. We then obtain the minimum-cost path by doing Steps 1 and 2. The minimum-cost segmentation thus obtained meets the boundary conditions. In this paper, we assume that the segment boundaries are at the ends of sentences. 3.2 Properties of the segmentation Generally speaking, the number of segments obtained by our algorithm is not sensitive to the length of a given text, which is counted in words. In other words, the number of segments is relatively stable with respect to variation in the text length. For example, the algorithm divides a newspaper editorial consisting of about 27 sentences into 4 to 6 segments, while on the other hand, it divides a long text consisting of over 1000 sentences into 10 to 20 segments. Thus, the number of segments is not proportional to text length. This is due to the term","  ","in Equation (11). The value of this term increases as the number of words increases. The term thus suppresses the division of a text when the length of the text is long.","This stability is desirable for summarization, because summarizing a given text requires selecting a relatively small number of topics from it. If a text segmentation system divides a given text into a relatively small number of segments, then a summary of the original text can be composed by combining summaries of the component segments (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000). A finer segmentation can be obtained by applying our algorithm recursively to each segment, if necessary.5","5","We segmented various texts without rigorous evaluation and found that our method is good at segmenting a text into a relatively small number of segments. On the other hand, the method is not good at segmenting a text into a large number of segments. For example, the method is good at segmenting a 1000-sentence text into 10 segments. In such a case, the segment boundaries seem to correspond well with topic boundaries. But, if the method is forced to segment the same text into 50 segments by specifying the number of g0 g2 g3 g4 g5g1w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 e01 e14 e35 e13 e45 Figure 1: Example of a graph."]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Material","paragraphs":["We used publicly available data to evaluate our system.

For English, Klavans, et al. describe a segmentation corpus in which the texts were segmented by humans (Klavans et al., 1998). But, there are no such corpora for other languages. We are planning to build a segmentation corpus for Japanese, based on a corpus of speech transcriptions (Maekawa and Koiso, 2000). 5.2 Related work Our proposed algorithm finds the maximum-probability segmentation of a given text. This is a new approach for domain-independent text segmentation. A probabilistic approach, however, has already been proposed by Yamron, et al. for domain-dependent text segmentation (broadcast news story segmentation) (Yamron et al., 1998). They trained a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose states correspond to topics. Given a word sequence, their system assigns each word a topic so that the maximum-probability topic sequence is obtained. Their model is basically the same as that used for HMM part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Manning and Schütze, 1999), if we regard topics as POS tags.11","Finding topic boundaries is equivalent to finding topic transitions; i.e., a continuous topic or segment is a sequence of words with the same topic.","Their approach is indirect compared with our approach, which directly finds the maximum-probability segmentation. As a result, their model can not straightforwardly incorporate features pertaining to a segment itself, such as the average length of segments. Our model, on the other hand, can incorporate this information quite naturally. Suppose that the length of a segment","follows a normal distribution    , with a mean of"," and standard deviation of ","(Ponte and Croft, 1997).

Equation (17) favors segments whose lengths are similar to the average length (in words).","Another major difference from their algorithm is that our algorithm does not require training data to estimate probabilities, while their algorithm does. Therefore, our algorithm can be applied to domain-independent texts, while their algorithm is restricted to domains for which training data are available. It would be interesting, however, to compare our algorithm with their algorithm for the case when training data are available. In such a case, our model should be extended to incorporate various features such as the average segment length, clue words, named entities, and so on (Reynar, 1999; Beeferman et al., 1999).","Our proposed algorithm naturally estimates the probabilities of words in segments. These probabilities, which are called word densities, have been used to detect important descriptions of words in texts (Kurohashi et al., 1997). This method is based on the assumption that the density of a word is high in a segment in which the word is discussed (defined and/or explained) in some depth. It would be interesting to apply our method to this application."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have proposed a statistical model for domain-independent text segmentation.
