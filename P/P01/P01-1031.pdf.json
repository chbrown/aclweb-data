Two common readings/understandings of CE are exemplified in (1b,c): the clausal reading is commonly used simply to confirm the content of a particular subutter-ance. The main function of the constituent reading is to elicit an alternative description or ostension to the content (referent or predicate etc) in-tended by the original speaker of the reprised sub-utterance.","(1) a. A: Did Bo finagle a raise? B: (i) Bo?/ (ii) finagle? b. Clausal reading: Are you asking if BO (of all people) finagled a raise/Bo FI-NAGLED a raise (of all actions) c. Constituent reading: Who is Bo?/What does it mean to finagle?","The issue of whether CE involves an ambiguity or is simply vague is an important one.1","2 Clearly, pragmatic reasoning plays an important role in understanding CEs. Some considerations do, nonetheless, favour the existence of an ambiguity. First, the BNC provides numerous examples of misunderstandings concerning CE interpretation,3","where a speaker intends one reading, is misunderstood, and clarifies his original interpretation:","(2) a. A: ... you always had er er say every foot he had with a piece of spunyarn in the wire/B: Spunyarn?/A: Spunyarn, yes/B: What’s spunyarn?","b. A: Have a laugh and joke with Dick./","B: Dick?/A: Have a laugh and joke with","Dick./B: Who’s Dick?","1","An anonymous ACL reviewer proposed to us that all CE could be analyzed in terms of a single reading along the lines of “I thought I heard you say Bo, and I don’t know why you would do so?”.","2","Closely related to this issue is the issue of what other readings/understandings CE exhibits. We defer discussion of the latter issue to (Purver et al., 2001), which provides a detailed analysis of the frequency of CEs and their understandings among clarification utterances in the British Na-tional Corpus (BNC).","3","This confirms our (non-instrumentally tested) impression that these understandings are not on the whole disambiguated intonationally. All our CE data from the BNC was found using SCoRE, Matt Purver’s dialogue oriented BNC search engine (Purver, 2001).","More crucially, the clausal and constituent readings involve distinct syntactic and phonological parallelism conditions. The constituent reading seems to actually require phonological identity. With the resolution associated with clausal readings, there is no such requirement. However, partial syntactic parallelism does obtain: an XP used to clarify an antecedent sub-utterance must match","categorially, though there is no requirement of phonological identity:","(3) a. A: I phoned him. B: him? / #he? b. A: Did he adore the book. B: adore? / #adored? c. A: We’re leaving? B: You?","We are used to systems that will confirm the user’s utterances by repeating part of them. These presuppose no sophisticated linguistic analysis. However, it is not usual for a system to be able to process CEs produced by the user. It would be a great advantage in negotiative dialogues, where, for example, the system and the user might be discussing several options and the system may make alternative suggestions, for a system to be able to recognize and interpret a CE. Consider the following (constructed) dialogue in the route-planning domain:","(4) Sys: Would you like to make that trip via Malvern? User: Malvern?","At this point the system has to consider a number of possible intepretations for the user’s utterance all of which involve recognizing that this is a clarification request concerning the system’s last utterance.","Appropriate responses might be (5a-c); the system should definitely not say (5d), as it might if it does not recognize that the user is trying to clarify its previous utterance.","(5) a. Yes, Malvern b. Malvern – M-A-L-V-E-R-N c. Going via Malvern is the quickest route d. So, you would like to make that trip via Malvern instead of Malvern?","In this paper we examine the interpretation of CEs. CE is a singularly complex ellipsis/anaphoric phenomenon which cannot be handled by standard techniques such as first order unification (as anaphora often is) or by higher order unification (HOU) on logical forms (see e.g. (Pulman, 1997)). For a start, in order to capture the syntactic and phonological parallelism exemplified in (3), logical forms are simply in-sufficient. Moreover, although an HOU account could, given a theory of dialogue that structures context appropriately, generate the clausal reading, the constituent reading cannot be so generated. Clark (e.g. (Clark, 1996)) initiated work on the grounding of an utterance (for computational and formal work see e.g. (Traum, 1994; Poesio and Traum, 1997)). However, existing work, while spelling out in great detail what updates arise in an IS as a result of grounding, do not offer a characterization of the clarification possibilities spawned by a given utterance. A sketch of such a characterization is provided in this paper. On the basis of this we offer an analysis of CE, integrated into a large existing grammar framework, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (specifically the version developed in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)). We start by informally describing the grounding/clarification processes and the representations on which they operate. We then provide the requisite background on HPSG and on the KOS framework (Ginzburg, 1996; Bohlin et al., 1999), in which our analysis of ISs is couched. We sketch an algorithm for the process of utterance integration which leads to grounding or clarification. Finally, we formalize the operations which underpin clarification and sketch a grammatical analysis of CE."]},{"title":"2 Utterance Representation: grounding and clarification","paragraphs":["We start by offering an informal description of how an utterance","such as (6) can get grounded or spawn a clarification by an addressee B: (6) A: Did Bo leave?","A is attempting to convey to B her question whether the property she has referred to with her utterance of leave holds of the person she has referred to with the name Bo. B is required to try and find values for these references. Finding values is, with an important caveat, a necessary condition for B to ground A’s utterance, thereby signalling that its content has been integrated in B’s IS.4","Modelling this condition for successful grounding provides one obvious constraint on the representation of utterance types: such a representation must involve a function from or ","- abstract over a set of certain parameters (the contextual parameters) to contents. This much is familiar already from early work on context dependence by (Montague, 1974) et seq. What happens when B cannot or is at least uncertain as to how he should instantiate in his IS a contextual parameter","? In such a case B needs to do at least the following: (1) perform a partial update of the existing context with the successfully processed components of the utterance (2) pose a clarification question that involves reference to the sub-utterance u","from which","emanates. Since the original speaker, A, can coherently integrate a clarification question once she hears it, it follows that, for a given utterance, there is a predictable range of","partial updates + consequent clarification questions",". These we take to be specified by a set of coercion operations on utterance representations.5","Indeed we assume that a component of dialogue competence is knowledge of these coercion operations.","CE gives us some indication concerning both the input and required output of these operations. One such operation, which we will refer to as parameter identification, essentially involves as output a question paraphrasable as what is the in-tended reference of sub-utterance u","?. The par-tially updated context in which such a clarification takes place is such that simply repeating the segmental phonology of u","using rising intonation enables that question to be expressed. An-other existent coercion operation is one which we will refer to as parameter focussing. This involves a (partially updated) context in which the issue under discussion is a question that arises by instantiating all contextual parameters except for  and abstracting over",". In such a context, one","4","The caveat is, of course, that the necessity is goal driven. Relative to certain goals, one might decide simply to existen-tially quantify the problematic referent. For this operation on meanings see (Cooper, 1998). We cannot enter here into a discussion of how to integrate the view developed here in a plan based view of understanding, but see (Ginzburg, (forthcoming)) for this.","5","The term coercion operation is inspired by work on utterance representation within a type theoretic framework reported in (Cooper, 1998). can confirm that","gets the value B suspects it has by uttering with rising intonation any apparently co-referential phrase whose syntactic category is identical to","’s.","From this discussion, it becomes clear that coercion operations (and by extension the grounding process) cannot be defined simply on meanings. Rather, given the syntactic and phonological parallelism encoded in clarification contexts, these operations need to be defined on representations that encode in parallel for each sub-utterance down to the word level phonological, syntactic, semantic, and contextual information. With some minor modifications, signs as conceived in HPSG are exactly such a representa-tional format and, hence, we will use them to define coercion operations.6","More precisely, given that an addressee might not be able to come up with a unique or a complete parse, due to lexi-cal ignorance or a noisy environment, we need to utilize some ‘underspecified’ entity (see e.g. (Milward, 2000)). For simplicity we will use descrip-tions of signs. An example of the format for signs we employ is given in (7):7","6","We make two minor modifications to the version of HPSG described in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)). First, we revamp the existing treatment of the feature C-INDICES. This will now encode the entire inventory of contextual parameters of an utterance (proper names, deictic pronouns, indexicals) not merely information about speaker/hearer/utterance-time, as standardly. Indeed, in principle, relation names should also be included, since they vary with context and are subject to clarification as well. Such a step involves a significant change to how argument roles are handled in existing HPSG. Hence, we do not make such a move here. This modification of C-INDICES will allow signs to play a role akin to the role associated with ‘meanings’, i.e. to function as abstracts with roles that need to be instantiated. The second modification we make concerns the encoding of phrasal constituency. Standardly, the feature DTRS is used to encode immediate phrasal constituency. To facilitate statement of coercion operations, we need access to all phrasal constituents— given that a contextual parameter emanating from deeply embedding constituents are as clarifiable as immediate constituents. We posit a set valued feature CONSTIT(UENT)S whose value is the set of all constituents immediate or otherwise of a given sign (Cf. the mother-daughter predicates used in (Gregory and Lappin, 1999).) In fact, having posited CONSTITS one could eliminate DTRS: this by making the value of CONSTITS be a set of sets whose first level elements are the immediate constituents. For current purposes, we stick with tradition and tolerate the redundancy of both DTRS and CONSTITS.","7","Within the phrasal type system of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) root-cl constitutes the ‘start’ symbol of the grammar. In particular, phrases of this type have as their content an illocutionary operator embedding the appropriate semantic","(7)                                 root-cl PHON did bo leave CAT V[+fin]","C-INDICES  ,",",",", i,j CONT              ASK-REL ASKER i ASKED j MSG-ARG        question","PARAMS ","PROP SOA   leave-rel AGT TIME                    ","CTXT BCKGRD","utt-time( ),","precede( ,","), named(bo)(",")","CONSTITS  ","PHON Did , ","PHON Bo ,  ","PHON leave ,  PHON Did Bo leave                                 ","Before we can explain how these representations can feature in dialogue reasoning and the resolution of CE, we need to sketch briefly the approach to dialogue ellipsis that we assume."]},{"title":"3 Contextual evolution and ellipsis","paragraphs":["We adopt the situation semantics based theory of dialogue context developed in the KOS framework (Ginzburg, 1996; Ginzburg, (forthcoming); Bohlin et al., 1999). The common ground component of ISs is assumed to be structured as follows:8 (8) FACTS set of facts LATEST-MOVE (illocutionary) fact QUD p.o. set of questions  ","In (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) this framework is integrated into HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994); (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) define two new at-tributes within the CONTEXT (CTXT) feature structure: Maximal Question Under Discussion (MAX-QUD), whose value is of sort question;9 object (an assertion embedding a proposition, a query embedding a question etc.). Here and throughout we omit various features (e.g. STORE, SLASH etc that have no bearing on current issues wherever possible.","8","Here FACTS corresponds to the set of commonly accepted assumptions; QUD(‘questions under discussion’) is a set consisting of the currently discussable questions, par-tially ordered by","(‘takes conversational precedence’); LATEST-MOVE represents information about the content and structure of the most recent accepted illocutionary move.","9","Questions are represented as semantic objects compris-ing a set of parameters—empty for a polar question—and a and Salient Utterance (SAL-UTT), whose value is a set (singleton or empty) of elements of type sign. In information structure terms, SAL-UTT can be thought of as a means of underspecifying the subsequent focal (sub)utterance or as a potential parallel element. MAX-QUD corresponds to the ground of the dialogue at a given point. Since SAL-UTT is a sign, it enables one to encode syntactic categorial parallelism and, as we will see below, also phonological parallelism. SAL-UTT is computed as the (sub)utterance associated with the role bearing widest scope within MAX-QUD.10 Below, we will show how to extend this account of parallelism to clarification queries.","To account for elliptical constructions such as short answers and sluicing, Ginzburg and Sag posit a phrasal type headed-fragment-phrase (hdfrag-ph)—a subtype of hd-only-ph—governed by the constraint in (9).

Clauses are divided into inter alia declarative clauses (decl-cl), which denote propositions, and interrogative clauses (inter-cl) denoting questions. Each maximal phrasal type inherits from both these dimensions. This classification allows specification of systematic correlations between clausal construction types and types of semantic content.","(10)                       STORE CONT     proposition SIT SOA","QUANTS order( )","","NUCL","    MAX-QUD          question PARAMS neset PROP     proposition SIT SOA QUANTS NUCL","           ","HD-DTR","STORE ","","set(param)                        The content of this phrasal type is a proposition: whereas in most headed clauses the content is entirely (or primarily) derived from the head daughter, here it is constructed for the most part from the contextually salient question.
