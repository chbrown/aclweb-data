The decoder’s job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combin-ing them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risk-ing to miss good solutions. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A statistical MT system that translates (say) French sentences into English, is divided into three parts: (1) a language model (LM) that assigns a probability P(e) to any English string, (2) a translation model (TM) that assigns a probability P(f","e) to any pair of English and French strings, and (3) a decoder. The decoder takes a previously unseen sentence","and tries to find the that maximizes P(e","f), or equivalently maximizes P(e)","P(f","e).","Brown et al. (1993) introduced a series of TMs based on word-for-word substitution and re-ordering, but did not include a decoding algorithm. If the source and target languages are constrained to have the same word order (by choice or through suitable pre-processing), then the linear Viterbi algorithm can be applied (Tillmann et al., 1997). If re-ordering is limited to rotations around nodes in a binary tree, then optimal decoding can be carried out by a high-polynomial algorithm (Wu, 1996). For arbitrary word-reordering, the decoding problem is NP-complete (Knight, 1999).","A sensible strategy (Brown et al., 1995; Wang and Waibel, 1997) is to examine a large subset of likely decodings and choose just from that. Of course, it is possible to miss a good translation this way. If the decoder returns e","but there exists some e for which P(e","f)","P(e","","f), this is called a search error. As Wang and Waibel (1997) remark, it is hard to know whether a search error has occurred—the only way to show that a decoding is sub-optimal is to actually produce a higherscoring one.","Thus, while decoding is a clear-cut optimiza-tion task in which every problem instance has a right answer, it is hard to come up with good answers quickly. This paper reports on measurements of speed, search errors, and translation quality in the context of a traditional stack decoder (Jelinek, 1969; Brown et al., 1995) and two new decoders. The first is a fast greedy decoder, and the second is a slow optimal decoder based on generic mathematical programming techniques."]},{"title":"2 IBM Model 4","paragraphs":["In this paper, we work with IBM Model 4, which revolves around the notion of a word alignment over a pair of sentences (see Figure 1).

English word is said to have a fertility of two. Likewise, if an English word remains unaligned-to, then it has fertility zero. The word alignment in Figure 1 is shorthand for a hypothetical stochastic process by which an English string gets converted into a French string. There are several sets of decisions to be made.","First, every English word is assigned a fertility. These assignments are made stochastically according to a table n(","e","). We delete from the string any word with fertility zero, we duplicate any word with fertility two, etc. If a word has fertility greater than zero, we call it fertile. If its fertility is greater than one, we call it very fertile.","After each English word in the new string, we may increment the fertility of an invisible English NULL element with probability p","(typically about 0.02). The NULL element ultimately produces “spurious” French words.","Next, we perform a word-for-word replacement of English words (including NULL) by French words, according to the table t(f","e",").","Finally, we permute the French words. In permuting, Model 4 distinguishes between French words that are heads (the leftmost French word generated from a particular English word), non-heads (non-leftmost, generated only by very fertile English words), and NULL-generated.","Heads.

By building solutions incrementally and storing partial solutions, or hypotheses, in a “stack” (in modern terminology, a priority queue), the decoder conducts an ordered search of the solution space. In the ideal case (unlimited stack size and exhaustive search time), a stack decoder is guaranteed to find an optimal solution; our hope is to do almost as well under real-world constraints of limited space and time. The generic stack decoding algorithm follows:","","Initialize the stack with an empty hy-","pothesis.","","Pop h, the best hypothesis, off the stack.","","If h is a complete sentence, output h and","terminate.","","For each possible next word w, extend h","by adding w and push the resulting hy-","pothesis onto the stack.","","Return to the second step (pop).","One crucial difference between the decoding process in speech recognition (SR) and machine translation (MT) is that speech is always produced in the same order as its transcription. Consequently, in SR decoding there is always a simple left-to-right correspondence between input and output sequences. By contrast, in MT the left-to-right relation rarely holds even for language pairs as similar as French and English. We address this problem by building the solution from left to right, but allowing the decoder to consume its input in any order. This change makes decoding significantly more complex in MT; instead of knowing the order of the input in advance, we must consider all","","permutations of an","-word input sentence.","Another important difference between SR and MT decoding is the lack of reliable heuristics in MT. A heuristic is used in A* search to estimate the cost of completing a partial hypothesis. A good heuristic makes it possible to accurately compare the value of different partial hypotheses, and thus to focus the search in the most promising direction. The left-to-right restriction in SR makes it possible to use a simple yet reliable class of heuristics which estimate cost based on the amount of input left to decode. Partly because of the absence of left-to-right correspondence, MT heuristics are significantly more difficult to develop (Wang and Waibel, 1997). With-out a heuristic, a classic stack decoder is ineffective because shorter hypotheses will almost always look more attractive than longer ones, since as we add words to a hypothesis, we end up multiplying more and more terms to find the probability. Because of this, longer hypotheses will be pushed off the end of the stack by shorter ones even if they are in reality better decodings. For-tunately, by using more than one stack, we can eliminate this effect.","In a multistack decoder, we employ more than one stack to force hypotheses to compete fairly. More specifically, we have one stack for each subset of input words. This way, a hypothesis can only be pruned if there are other, better, hypotheses that represent the same portion of the input. With more than one stack, however, how does a multistack decoder choose which hypothesis to extend during each iteration? We address this is-sue by simply taking one hypothesis from each stack, but a better solution would be to somehow compare hypotheses from different stacks and extend only the best ones.","The multistack decoder we describe is closely patterned on the Model 3 decoder described in the (Brown et al., 1995) patent. We build solutions incrementally by applying operations to hypotheses. There are four operations:","","Add adds a new English word and","aligns a single French word to it.","","AddZfert adds two new English words.","The first has fertility zero, while the","second is aligned to a single French","word.","","Extend aligns an additional French","word to the most recent English word,","increasing its fertility.","","AddNull aligns a French word to the","English NULL element.","AddZfert is by far the most expensive operation, as we must consider inserting a zero-fertility English word before each translation of each unaligned French word. With an English vocabulary size of 40,000, AddZfert is 400,000 times more expensive than AddNull!","We can reduce the cost of AddZfert in two ways. First, we can consider only certain English words as candidates for zero-fertility, namely words which both occur frequently and have a high probability of being assigned frequency zero. Second, we can only insert a zero-fertility word if it will increase the probability of a hypothesis. According to the definition of the decoding problem, a zero-fertility English word can only make a decoding more likely by increasing P(e) more than it decreases P(a,f","e).2","By only considering helpful zero-fertility insertions, we save ourselves significant overhead in the AddZfert operation, in many cases eliminating all possibilities and reducing its cost to less than that of AddNull."]},{"title":"5 Greedy Decoding","paragraphs":["Over the last decade, many instances of NP-complete problems have been shown to be solv-able in reasonable/polynomial time using greedy methods (Selman et al., 1992; Monasson et al., 1999). Instead of deeply probing the search space, such greedy methods typically start out with a random, approximate solution and then try to improve it incrementally until a satisfactory solution is reached. In many cases, greedy methods quickly yield surprisingly good solutions.","We conjectured that such greedy methods may prove to be helpful in the context of MT decoding.

Because any TSP problem instance can be transformed into a decoding problem instance, Model 4 decoding is provably NP-complete in the length of f. It is interesting to consider the reverse direction—is it possible to transform a decoding problem instance into a TSP instance? If so, we may take great advantage of previous research into efficient TSP algorithms. We may also take advantage of existing software packages, obtaining a sophisticated decoder with little programming effort.","It is difficult to convert decoding into straight TSP, but a wide range of combinatorial optimiza-tion problems (including TSP) can be expressed in the more general framework of linear integer programming. A sample integer program (IP) looks like this:","minimize objective function: 3.2 * x1 + 4.7 * x2 - 2.1 * x3","subject to constraints: x1 - 2.6 * x3 > 5 7.3 * x2 > 7","A solution to an IP is an assignment of integer values to variables.

To do this, we set up a city for each word in the observed sentence f. City boundaries are shown with bold lines. We populate each city with ten hotels corresponding to ten likely English word translations. Hotels are shown as small rectangles. The owner of a hotel is the English word inside the rectangle. If two cities have hotels with the same owner x, then we build a third xowned hotel on the border of the two cities. More generally, if","cities all have hotels owned by x, we build","new hotels (one for each non-empty, non-singleton subset of the cities) on various city borders and intersections. Finally, we add an extra city representing the sentence boundary.","We define a tour of cities as a sequence and hotels (starting at the sentence boundary hotel) that visits each city exactly once before returning to the start.
