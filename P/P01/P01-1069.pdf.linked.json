Among them, the Winnow algorithm has been argued to be particularly suitable for NLP problems, due to its robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for non-separable data. To remedy this problem, a modification called regularized Winnow has been proposed. In this paper, we apply this new method to text chunking. We show that this method achieves state of the art performance with significantly less computation than previous approaches."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recently there has been considerable interest in applying machine learning techniques to problems in natural language processing. One method that has been quite successful in many applications is the SNoW architecture (Dagan et al., 1997; Khardon et al., 1999). This architecture is based on the Winnow algorithm (Littlestone, 1988; Grove and Roth, 2001), which in theory is suitable for problems with many irrelevant attributes. In natural language processing, one often encounters a very high dimensional feature space, although most of the features are irrelevant. Therefore the robustness of Winnow to high dimensional feature space is considered an important reason why it is suitable for NLP tasks.","However, the convergence of the Winnow algorithm is only guaranteed for linearly separable data. In practical NLP applications, data are often linearly non-separable. Consequently, a direct application of Winnow may lead to numerical instability. A remedy for this, called regularized Winnow, has been recently proposed in (Zhang, 2001). This method modifies the original Winnow algorithm so that it solves a regularized optimization problem. It converges both in the linearly separable case and in the linearly non-separable case. Its numerical stability implies that the new method can be more suitable for practical NLP problems that may not be linearly separable.","In this paper, we compare regularized Winnow and Winnow algorithms on text chunking (Abney, 1991). In order for us to rigorously compare our system with others, we use the CoNLL-2000 shared task dataset (Sang and Buchholz, 2000), which is publicly available from http://lcgwww.uia.ac.be/conll2000/chunking. An advantage of using this dataset is that a large number of state of the art statistical natural language processing methods have already been applied to the data. Therefore we can readily compare our results with other reported results.","We show that state of the art performance can be achieved by using the newly proposed regularized Winnow method. Furthermore, we can achieve this result with significantly less computation than earlier systems of comparable performance.","The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the Winnow algorithm and the regularized Winnow method. Section 3 describes the CoNLL-2000 shared task. In Section 4, we give a detailed description of our system that employs the regularized Winnow algorithm for text chunking. Section 5 contains experimental results for our system on the CoNLL-2000 shared task. Some final remarks will be given in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Winnow and regularized Winnow for binary classification","paragraphs":["We review the Winnow algorithm and the regularized Winnow method. Consider the binary classification problem: to determine a label ","associated with an input vector",". A use-ful method for solving this problem is through linear discriminant functions, which consist of linear combinations of the components of the input variable. Specifically, we seek a weight vector and a threshold","such that","if its label  ","and if its label ",". For simplicity, we shall assume","in this","paper. The restriction does not cause problems in","practice since one can always append a constant","feature to the input data",", which offsets the effect","of . Given a training set of labeled data       ","",", a number of approaches to finding linear discriminant functions have been advanced over the years. We are especially interested in the Winnow multiplicative update algorithm (Littlestone, 1988). This algorithm updates the weight vector","by going through the training data repeatedly. It is mistake driven in the sense that the weight vector is updated only when the algorithm is not able to correctly classify an example.","The Winnow algorithm (with positive weight) employs multiplicative update: if the linear discriminant function misclassifies an input training vector","with true label",", then we update each component","of the weight vector","as:  ","    ","  (1) where ","","is a parameter called the learning","rate. The initial weight vector can be taken as"," ","",", where","is a prior which is typ-","ically chosen to be uniform.","There can be several variants of the Winnow al-","gorithm. One is called balanced Winnow, which","is equivalent to an embedding of the input space","into a higher dimensional space as:",""," ","",". This modification allows the positive weight Winnow algorithm for the augmented input","","to have the effect of both positive and negative weights for the original input",".","One problem of the Winnow online update algorithm is that it may not converge when the data are not linearly separable. One may partially remedy this problem by decreasing the learning rate parameter ","during the updates. However, this is rather ad hoc since it is unclear what is the best way to do so. Therefore in practice, it can be quite difficult to implement this idea properly.","In order to obtain a systematic solution to this problem, we shall first examine a derivation of the Winnow algorithm in (Gentile and Warmuth, 1998), which motivates a more general solution to be presented later.","Following (Gentile and Warmuth, 1998), we consider the loss function   ","",",","which is often called “hinge loss”.

This theoretical insight implies that the algorithm is suitable for NLP tasks with large feature spaces."]},{"title":"3 CoNLL-2000 chunking task","paragraphs":["The text chunking task is to divide text into syntactically related non-overlapping groups of words (chunks). It is considered an important problem in natural language processing. As an example of text chunking, the sentence “Balcor, which has interests in real estate, said the position is newly created.” can be divided as follows:","[NP Balcor], [NP which] [VP has] [NP interests] [PP in] [NP real estate], [VP said] [NP the position] [VP is newly created].","In this example, NP denotes non phrase, VP denotes verb phrase, and PP denotes prepositional phrase.","The CoNLL-2000 shared task (Sang and Buchholz, 2000), introduced last year, is an attempt to set up a standard dataset so that researchers can compare different statistical chunking methods. The data are extracted from sections of the Penn Treebank. The training set consists of WSJ sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank, and the test set consists of WSJ sections 20. Additionally, a part-of-speech (POS) tag was assigned to each token by a standard POS tagger (Brill, 1994) that was trained on the Penn Treebank. These POS tags can be used as features in a machine learning based chunking algorithm. See Section 4 for detail.","The data contains eleven different chunk types. However, except for the most frequent three types: NP (noun phrase), VP (verb phrase), and PP (prepositional phrase), each of the remaining chunks has less than","occurrences. The chunks are represented by the following three types of tags: B-X first word of a chunk of type X I-X non-initial word in an X chunk O word outside of any chunk","A standard software program has been provided (which is available from http://lcgwww.uia.ac.be/conll2000/chunking) to compute the performance of each algorithm. For each chunk, three figures of merit are computed: precision (the percentage of detected phrases that are correct), recall (the percentage of phrases in the data that are found), and the ","metric which is the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall. The overall precision, recall and  metric on all chunks are also computed. The overall ","metric gives a single number that can be used to compare different algorithms."]},{"title":"4 System description 4.1 Encoding of basic features","paragraphs":["An advantage of regularized Winnow is its robustness to irrelevant features. We can thus include as many features as possible, and let the algorithm itself find the relevant ones. This strategy ensures that we do not miss any features that are important. However, using more features requires more memory and slows down the algorithm. Therefore in practice it is still necessary to limit the number of features used.","Let           be a string of tokenized text (each token is a word or punctuation). We want to predict the chunk type of the current token",". For each word   , we let ","denote the associated POS tag, which is assumed to be given in the CoNLL-2000 shared task. The following is a list of the features we use as input to the regularized Winnow (where we choose","):"," first order features:  and  (     )"," second order features: "," (       ,","), and"," "," ","(     ;    )","In addition, since in a sequential process, the predicted chunk tags  for ","are available for","",", we include the following extra chunk type","features:"," first order chunk-type features:  (    )"," second order chunk-type features:   (     ",", ), and POS-chunk interactions  ","  (         ). For each data point (corresponding to the cur-","rent token","","), the associated features are en-","coded as a binary vector",", which is the input to","Winnow. Each component of","corresponds to a","possible feature value","of a feature","in one of","the above feature lists. The value of the compo-","nent corresponds to a test which has value one if","the corresponding feature","achieves value",", or","value zero if the corresponding feature","achieves","another feature value. For example, since","is in our feature list, each of the possible POS value","of","corresponds to a component of",": the component has value one if","(the feature value represented by the component is active), and value zero otherwise. Similarly for a second order feature in our feature list such as    , each possible value    in the set      ","is","represented by a component of",": the component","has value one if","","","","and   ","(the feature value represented by the component is active), and value zero otherwise. The same encod-ing is applied to all other first order and second order features, with each possible test of “feature = feature value” corresponds to a unique component in",".","Clearly, in this representation, the high order features are conjunction features that become active when all of their components are active. In principle, one may also consider disjunction features that become active when some of their components are active. However, such features are not considered in this work. Note that the above representation leads to a sparse, but very large dimensional vector. This explains why we do not include all possible second order features since this will quickly consume more memory than we can handle.","Also the above list of features are not necessarily the best available. We only included the most straight-forward features and pair-wise feature interactions. One might try even higher order features to obtain better results.","Since Winnow is relatively robust to irrelevant features, it is usually helpful to provide the algorithm with as many features as possible, and let the algorithm pick up relevant ones. The main problem that prohibits us from using more features in the Winnow algorithm is memory consumption (mainly in training). The time complexity of the Winnow algorithm does not depend on the number of features, but rather on the average number of non-zero features per data, which is usually quite small.","Due to the memory problem, in our implementation we have to limit the number of token features (words or punctuation) to",": we sort the tokens by their frequencies in the training set from high frequency to low frequency; we then treat tokens of rank","or higher as the same token. Since the number","is still reasonably large, this restriction is relatively minor.","There are possible remedies to the memory consumption problem, although we have not implemented them in our current system. One solution comes from noticing that although the feature vector is of very high dimension, most dimensions are empty. Therefore one may create a hash table for the features, which can significantly reduce the memory consumption. 4.2 Using enhanced linguistic features We were interested in determining if additional features with more linguistic content would lead to even better performance. The ESG (English Slot Grammar) system in (McCord, 1989) is not directly comparable to the phrase structure grammar implicit in the WSJ treebank. ESG is a dependency grammar in which each phrase has a head and dependent elements, each marked with a syntactic role. ESG normally produces multiple parses for a sentence, but has the capability, which we used, to output only the highest ranked parse, where rank is determined by a system-defined measure.","There are a number of incompatibilities between the treebank and ESG in tokenization, which had to be compensated for in order to transfer the syntactic role features to the tokens in the standard training and test sets. We also transferred the ESG part-of-speech codes (different from those in the WSJ corpus) and made an attempt to attach B-PP, B-NP and I-NP tags as in-ferred from the ESG dependency structure. In the end, the latter two tags did not prove useful. ESG is also very fast, parsing several thousand sentences on an IBM RS/6000 in a few minutes of clock time.","It might seem odd to use a parser output as input to a machine learning system to find syntactic chunks. As noted above, ESG or any other parser normally produces many analyses, whereas in the kind of applications for which chunking is used, e.g., information extraction, only one solution is normally desired. In addition, due to many incompatibilities between ESG and WSJ treebank, less than","of ESG generated syntactic role tags are in agreement with WSJ chunks. However, the ESG syntactic role tags can be regarded as features in a statistical chunker. Another view is that the statistical chunker can be regarded as a machine learned transformation that maps ESG syntactic role tags into WSJ chunks.","We denote by  the syntactic role tag associated with token ",". Each tag takes one of 138 possible values. The following features are added to our system."," first order features:  (     )"," second order features: self interactions   ","(       ,","), and iterations with POS-tags "," (       ). 4.3 Dynamic programming In text chunking, we predict hidden states (chunk types) based on a sequence of observed states (text). This resembles hidden Markov models where dynamic programming has been widely employed. Our approach is related to ideas described in (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001). Similar methods have also appeared in other natural language processing systems (for example, in (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000)).","Given input vectors","consisting of features constructed as above, we apply the regularized Winnow algorithm to train linear weight vectors. Since the Winnow algorithm only produces positive weights, we employ the balanced version of Winnow with","being transformed into","       . As explained earlier, the constant","term is used to offset the effect of threshold",".","Once a weight vector","","       "," is obtained, we let  "," and  ","",".","The prediction with an incoming feature vector","is then           ","",".","Since Winnow only solves binary classification problems, we train one linear classifier for each chunk type. In this way, we obtain twenty-three linear classifiers, one for each chunk type",". Denote by","the weight associated with type",", then a straight-forward method to classify an incoming datum is to assign the chunk tag as the one with the highest score ","  ","",". However, there are constraints in any valid sequence of chunk types: if the current chunk is of type I-X, then the previous chunk type can only be either B-X or I-X. This constraint can be explored to improve chunking performance. We denote by the set of all valid chunk sequences (that is, the sequence satisfies the above chunk type constraint). Let  ","","be the sequence of tok-","enized text for which we would like to find the","associated chunk types. Let    ","be the as-","sociated feature vectors for this text sequence. Let","    ","be a sequence of potential chunk types","that is valid:        ",". In our system, we find the sequence of chunk types that has the highest value of overall truncated score as:        ","","   ","     ","        where   ","           ","        The truncation onto the interval ","","is to make","sure that no single point contributes too much in","the summation.

We let the learning rate     ",", and ran the regularized Winnow update formula (4) repeatedly thirty times over the training data. The algorithm is not very sensitive to these parameter choices. Some other aspects of the system design (such as dynamic programming, features used, etc) have more impact on the performance. However, due to the limitation of space, we will not discuss their impact in detail.","Table 1 gives results obtained with the basic features.

Each kernel support vector machine is computationally significantly more expensive than a corresponding Winnow classifier, and they use an order of magnitude more classifiers. This implies that their system should be orders of magnitudes more expensive than ours. This point can be verified from their training time of about one day on a 500Mhz Linux machine.
