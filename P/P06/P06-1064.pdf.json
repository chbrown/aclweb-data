However, many corpora (B öhomváetal., 2003; Skut et al., 1997; Brants et al., 2002) use dependency graphs or other representations, and the extraction algorithms that have been developed for Penn Treebank style corpora may not be immediately applicable to this representation. As a consequence, research on statistical parsing with “deep” grammars has largely been confinedtoEnglish. Free-word order languages typically pose greater challenges for syntactic theories (Rambow, 1994), and the richer inflectional morphology of these languages creates additional problems both for the coverage of lexicalized formalisms such as CCG or TAG, and for the usefulness of dependency counts extracted from the training data. On the other hand, formalisms such as CCG and TAG are particularly suited to capture the crossing dependencies that arise in languages such as Dutch or German, and by choosing an appropriate linguistic representation, some of these problems may be mitigated.","Here, we present an algorithm which translates the German Tiger corpus (Brants et al., 2002) into CCG derivations. Similar algorithms have been developed by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002a) to create CCGbank, a corpus of CCG derivations (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2005) from the Penn Treebank, by Ca̧kıcı (2005) to extract a CCG lexicon from a Turkish dependency corpus, and by Moortgat and Moot (2002) to induce a type-logical grammar for Dutch.","The annotation scheme used in Tiger is an extension of that used in the earlier, and smaller, German Negra corpus (Skut et al., 1997). Tiger is better suited for the extraction of subcategorization information (and thus the translation into “deep” grammars of any kind), since it distinguishes between PP complements and modifiers, and includes “secondary” edges to indicate shared arguments in coordinate constructions. Tiger also includes morphology and lemma information.","Negra is also provided with a “Penn Treebank”- style representation, which uses flat phrase structure trees instead of the crossing dependency structures in the original corpus. This version has been used by Cahill et al. (2005) to extract a German LFG. However, Dubey and Keller (2003) have demonstrated that lexicalization does not help a Collins-style parser that is trained on this corpus, and Levy and Manning (2004) have shown that its context-free representation is a poor approximation to the underlying dependency structure. The resource presented here will enable future research to address the question whether “deep” grammars such as CCG, which capture the underlying dependencies directly, are better suited to parsing German than linguistically inadequate context-free approximations. 505 1.

German nouns and adjectives are inflected for number, case and gender, and noun compounding is very productive. Word order German has three different word orders that depend on the clause type. Main clauses (1) are verb-second. Imperatives and questions are verb-initial (2). If a modifier or one of the objects is moved to the front, the word order becomes verb-initial (2). Subordinate and relative clauses are verb-final (3):","(1) a. Peter gibt Maria das Buch.","Peter gives Mary the book. b. ein Buch gibt Peter Maria. c. dann gibt Peter Maria das Buch.","(2) a.

The annotation is based on a hybrid framework which contains features of phrase-structure and dependency grammar. Each sentence is represented as a graph whose nodes are labeled with syntactic categories (NP, VP, S, PP, etc.) and POS tags. Edges are directed and labeled with syntactic functions (e.g. head, subject, accusative object, conjunct, appositive). The edge labels are similar to the Penn Treebank function tags, but provide richer and more explicit information.

There is no NP level inside PPs (and no noun level inside NPs). Punctuation marks are often attached at the so-called “virtual” root (VROOT) of the entire graph. The relative pronoun is a dative object (edge label DA) of the embedded infinitive, and is therefore attached at the VP level. The relative clause itself has the category S; the incoming edge is labeled RC (relative clause). 4.2 The translation algorithm Our translation algorithm has the following steps:","translate(TigerGraph g):","TigerTree t = createTree(g);","preprocess(t);","if (t ","null) CCGderiv d = translateToCCG(t); if (d","","null);","if (isCCGderivation(d))","return d;","else fail; else fail;","else fail; 1. Creating a planar tree: After an initial preprocessing step which inserts punctuation that is attached to the “virtual” root (VROOT) of the graph in the appropriate locations, discontinuous graphs are transformed into planar trees. Starting at the lowest nonterminal nodes, this step turns the Tiger graph into a planar tree without crossing edges, where every node spans a contiguous substring. This is required as input to the actual translation step, since CCG derivations are planar binary trees.

Discontinuous dependencies between resumptive pronouns (“place holders”, PH) and their antecedents (“repeated elements”, RE) are also dissolved. 2. Additional preprocessing: In order to obtain the desired CCG analysis, a certain amount of preprocessing is required.

The basic translation step Our basic translation algorithm is very similar to Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005).

Special cases: Wh-extraction and extraposition In Tiger, wh-extraction is not explicitly marked. Relative clauses, wh-questions and free relatives are all annotated as S-nodes,and the wh-word is a normal argument of the verb. After turning the graph into a planar tree, we can identify these constructions by searching for a relative pronoun in the leftmost child of an S node (which may be marked as extraposed in the case of extraction from an embedded verb). As shown in figure 2, we turn this S into an SBAR (a category which does not exist in Tiger) with the first edge as complementizer and move the remaining chil-5 Eventive (“werden”) passive is easily identified by con-","text; however, we found that not all stative (“sein”) passives","seem to be annotated as such. 6 In some contexts, measure nouns (e.g. Mark, Kilometer)","lack case annotation. dren under a new S node which becomes the second daughter of the SBAR. The relative pronoun is the head of this SBAR and takes the S-node as argument. Its category is","","","",", since all clauses with a complementizer are verb-final. In order to capture the long-range dependency, a “trace” is introduced, and percolated down the tree, much like in the algorithm of Hockenmaier and Steedman (2005), and similar to GPSG’s slash-passing (Gazdar et al., 1985). These trace categories are appended to the category of the head node (and other arguments are type-raised as necessary). In our case, the trace is also associated with the verb whose argument it is. If the span of this verb is within the span of a complement, the trace is percolated down this complement. When the VP that is headed by this verb is reached, we assume a canonical order of arguments in order to “discharge” the trace.","If a complement node is marked as extraposed, it is also percolated down the head tree until the constituent whose argument it is is found. When another complement is found whose span includes the span of the constituent whose argument the extraposed edge is, the extraposed category is percolated down this tree (we assume extraction out of adjuncts is impossible).7","In order to capture the topicalization analysis, main clause subjects also introduce a trace. Fronted complements or subjects, and the first adjunct in main clauses are analyzed as described in figure 1. Special case: coordination – secondary edges Tiger uses “secondary edges” to represent the dependencies that arise in coordinate constructions such as gapping, argument cluster coordination and right (or left) node raising (Figure 3). In right (left) node raising, the shared elements are arguments or adjuncts that appear on the right periphery of the last, (or left periphery of the first) conjunct.

The result category of the furthest element in each conjunct is equal to the category of the entire VP (or sentence), and all other elements are type-raised and composed with this to yield a category which takes as argument a verb with the required subcat frame and returns a verb phrase (sentence).

If the graph cannot be turned into a tree, it cannot be translated. This happens in 1.3% (647) of all sentences. In many cases, this is due 510 to coordinated NPs or PPs where one or more conjuncts are extraposed. We believe that these are anaphoric, and further preprocessing could take care of this. In other cases, this is due to verb topicalization (gegeben hat Peter Maria das Buch), which our algorithm cannot currently deal with.9 For 1.9% of the sentences, the algorithm cannot obtain a correct CCG derivation. Mostly this is the case because some traces and extraposed elements cannot be discharged properly. Typically this happens either in local scrambling, where an object of the main verb appears between the auxiliary and the subject (hat das Buch Peter...)10",",or when an argument of a noun that appears in a relative clause is extraposed to the right. There are also a small number of constituents whose head is not annotated. We ignore any gapping construc-tion or argument cluster coordination that we cannot get into the right shape (1.5%), 732 sentences).","There are also a number of other constructions that we do not currently deal with. We do not process sentences if the root of the graph is a “virtual root” that does not expand into a sentence (1.7%, 869). This is mostly the case for strings such as Frankfurt (Reuters)), or if we cannot identify a head child of the root node (1.3%, 648; mostly fragments or elliptical constructions).","Overall, we obtain CCG derivations for 92.4% (46,628) of all 54,0474 sentences, including 88.4% (12,122) of those whose Tiger graphs are marked as discontinuous (13,717), and 95.2% of all 48,957 full sentences (excluding headless roots, and fragments, but counting coordinate structures such as gapping). Lexicon size There are 2,506 lexical category types, but 1,018 of these appear only once. 933 category types appear more than 5 times. Lexical coverage In order to evaluate coverage of the extracted lexicon on unseen data, we split the corpus into segments of 5,000 sentences (ignoring the last 474), and perform 10-fold crossvalidation, using 9 segments to extract a lexicon and the 10th to test its coverage. Average coverage is 86.7% (by token) of all lexical categories. Coverage varies between 84.4% and 87.6%. On average, 92% (90.3%-92.6%) of the lexical tokens 9 The corresponding CCG derivation combines the rem-","nant complements as in argument cluster coordination. 10 This problem arises because Tiger annotates subjects as","arguments of the auxiliary.

In the English data set, the proportion of seen tokens (96.2%) is much higher, most likely because of the relative lack of derivational and inflectional morphology. The better lexical coverage on seen tokens is also to be expected, given that the flexible word order of German requires case markings on all nouns as well as at least two different categories for each tensed verb, and more in order to account for local scrambling."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and future work","paragraphs":["We have presented an algorithm which converts the syntax graphs in the German Tiger corpus (Brants et al., 2002) into Combinatory Categorial Grammar derivation trees. This algorithm is currently able to translate 92.4% of all graphs in Tiger, or 95.2% of all full sentences. Lexicons extracted from this corpus contain the correct entries for 86.7% of all and 94.2% of all seen tokens. Good lexical coverage is essential for the performance of statistical CCG parsers (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a). Since the Tiger corpus contains complete morphological and lemma information for all words, future work will address the question of how to identify and apply a set of (non-recursive) lexical rules (Carpenter, 1992) to the extracted CCG lexicon to create a much larger lexicon. The number of lexical category types is almost twice as large as that of the English CCGbank. This is to be expected, since our grammar includes case features, and German verbs require different categories for main and subordinate clauses. We currently perform only the most essential preprocessing steps, although there are a number of constructions that might benefit from additional changes (e.g. comparatives, parentheticals, or fragments), both to increase coverage and accuracy of the extracted grammar.","Since Tiger corpus is of comparable size to the Penn Treebank, we hope that the work presented here will stimulate research into statistical wide-coverage parsing of free word order languages such as German with deep grammars like CCG. 511"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["I would like to thank Mark Steedman and Aravind Joshi for many helpful discussions.
