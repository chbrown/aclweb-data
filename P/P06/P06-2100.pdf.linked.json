The theme of the research is to vindicate the stand that- if morphology is strong and harnessable, then lack of training corpora is not debilitating. We establish a methodology of POS tagging which the resource disadvantaged (lacking annotated corpora) languages can make use of. The methodology makes use of locally annotated modestly-sized corpora (15,562 words), exhaustive morpohological analysis backed by high-coverage lexicon and a decision tree based learning algorithm (CN2). The evaluation of the system was done with 4-fold cross validation of the corpora in the news domain (www.bbc.co.uk/hindi). The current accuracy of POS tagging is 93.45% and can be further improved."]},{"title":"1 Motivation and Problem Denition","paragraphs":["Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging is a complex task fraught with challenges like ambiguity of parts of speech and handling of le xical absence (proper nouns, foreign words, derivationally morphed words, spelling variations and other unknown words) (Manning and Schutze, 2002). For English there are many POS taggers, employing machine learning techniques like transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), markov model (Cutting et al. 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc. There are also taggers which are hybrid using both stochastic and rule-based approaches, such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997). The accuracy of these taggers ranges from 93-98% approximately. English has annotated corpora in abundance, enabling usage of powerful data driven machine learning methods. But, very few languages in the world have the resource advantage that English enjoys.","In this scenario, POS tagging of highly inectional languages presents an interesting case study. Morphologically rich languages are characterized by a large number of morphemes in a single word, where morpheme boundaries are difcult to detect because they are fused to-gether. They are typically free-word ordered, which causes xed-context systems to be hardly adequate for statistical approaches (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997). Morphology-based POS tagging of some languages like Turkish (Oazer and Kuruoz, 1994), Arabic (Guiassa, 2006), Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), Modern Greek (Orphanos et al., 1999) and Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) has been tried out using a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical learning. These systems use large amount of corpora along with morphological analysis to POS tag the texts. It may be noted that a purely rule-based or a purely stochastic approach will not be effective for such 779 languages, since the former demands subtle linguistic expertise and the latter variously permuted corpora. 1.1 Previous Work on Hindi POS Tagging There is some amount of work done on morphology-based disambiguation in Hindi POS tagging. Bharati et al. (1995) in their work on computational Paninian parser, describe a technique where POS tagging is implicit and is merged with the parsing phase. Ray et al. (2003) proposed an algorithm that identies Hindi word groups on the basis of the lexical tags of the individual words. Their partial POS tagger (as they call it) reduces the number of possible tags for a given sentence by imposing some constraints on the sequence of lexical categories that are possible in a Hindi sentence. UPENN also has an online Hindi morphological tagger1","but there exists no literature discussing the performance of the tagger. 1.2 Our Approach We present in this paper a POS tagger for Hindi- the national language of India, spoken by 500 million people and ranking 4th in the world. We establish a methodology of POS tagging which the resource disadvantaged (lack-ing annotated corpora) languages can make use of. This methodology uses locally annotated modestly sized corpora (15,562 words), exhaustive morphological analysis backed by high-coverage lexicon and a decision tree based learning algorithm- CN2 (Clark and Niblett, 1989). To the best of our knowledge, such an approach has never been tried out for Hindi. The heart of the system is the detailed linguistic analysis of morphosyntactic phenomena, adroit handling of sufxes, accurate verb group identication and learning of disambiguation rules.","The approach can be used for other inectional languages by providing the language specic resources in the form of sufx replacement rules (SRRs), lexicon, group identication and morpheme analysis rules etc. and keeping the 1 http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/plc/tamilweb/hindi.html processes the same as shown in Figure 1. The similar kind of work exploiting morphological information to assign POS tags is under progress for Marathi which is also an Indian language.","In what follows, we discuss in section 2 the challenges in Hindi POS tagging followed by a section on morphological structure of Hindi. Section 4 presents the design of Hindi POS tagger. The experimental setup and results are given in sections 5 and 6. Section 7 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Challenges of POS Tagging in Hindi","paragraphs":["The inter-POS ambiguity surfaces when a word or a morpheme displays an ambiguity across POS categories. Such a word has multiple entries in the lexicon (one for each category). After stemming, the word would be assigned all possible POS tags based on the number of entries it has in the lexicon. The complexity of the task can be understood looking at the following English sentence where the word ‘back’ falls into three different POS categories-I get back to the back seat to give rest to my back.","The complexity further increases when it comes to tagging a free-word order language like Hindi where almost all the permutations of words in a clause are possible (Shrivastava et al., 2005). This phenomenon in the language, makes the task of a stochastic tagger difcult.","Intra-POS ambiguity arises when a word has one POS with different feature values, e.g., the word ‘"," ","’ {laDke} (boys/boy) in Hindi is a noun but can be analyzed in two ways in terms of its feature values:","1. POS: Noun, Number: Sg, Case: Oblique   "," . maine laDke ko ek aam diyaa. I-erg boy to one mango gave. I gave a mango to the boy.","2. POS: Noun, Number: Pl, Case: Direct"," ","","",". laDke aam khaate hain. Boys mangoes eat. Boys eat mangoes. 780 One of the difcult tasks here is to choose the appropriate tag based on the morphology of the word and the context used. Also, new words appear all the time in the texts. Thus, a method for determining the tag of a new word is needed when it is not present in the lexicon. This is done using context information and the information coded in the afxes, as afxes in Hindi (especially in nouns and verbs) are strong indicators of a word’s POS category. For example, it is possible to determine that the word ‘ ","’ {jaaegaa} (will go) is a verb, based on the environment in which it appears and the knowledge that it carries the inectional sufx -  {egaa} that attaches to the base verb ‘  ’ {jaa}. 2.1 Ambiguity Schemes The criterion to decide whether the tag of a word is a Noun or a Verb is entirely different from that of whether a word is an Adjective or an Adverb. For example, the word ‘","’ can occur as conjunction, post-position or a noun (as shown previously), hence it falls in an Ambiguity Scheme ‘Conjunction-Noun-Postposition’. We grouped all the ambiguous words into sets according to the Ambiguity Schemes that are possible in Hindi, e.g., Adjective-Noun, Adjective-Adverb, NounVerb, etc. This idea was rst proposed by Orphanos et al. (1999) for Modern Greek POS tagging."]},{"title":"3 Morphological Structure Of Hindi","paragraphs":["In Hindi, Nouns inect for number and case. To capture their morphological variations, they can be categorized into various paradigms2 (Narayana, 1994) based on their vowel ending, gender, number and case information. We have a list of around 29,000 Hindi nouns that are categorized into such paradigms3",". Looking at the morphological patterns of the words in a paradigm, sufx-replacement rules have been developed. These rules help in separating out a valid sufx 2 A paradigm systematically arranges and identies the","uninected forms of the words that share similar inec-","tional patterns. 3 Anusaaraka system developed at IIT Kanpur (INDIA)","uses similar noun sets in the form of paradigms from an inected word to output the correct stem and consequently, get the correct root.","Hindi Adjectives may be inected or uninected, e.g., ‘  ’ {chamkiilaa} (shiny), ‘  ’ {acchaa} (nice), ‘ ","’ {lambaa} (long)","inect based on the number and case values of","their head nouns while ‘","   ’ {sundar} (beautiful), ‘   ","’ {bhaarii} (heavy) etc. do not inect. Hindi Verbs inect for the following grammat-","ical properties (GNPTAM):","1. Gender: Masculine, Feminine, Non-specic 2. Number: Singular, Plural, Non-specic 3. Person: 1st, 2nd and 3rd 4. Tense: Past, Present, Future","5. Aspect: Perfective, Completive, Frequentative, Habitual, Durative, Inceptive, Stative","6. Modality: Imperative, Probabilitive, Subjunctive, Conditional, Deontic, Abilitive, Permissive","The morphemes attached to a verb along with their corresponding analyses help identify values for GNPTAM features for a given verb form. Division of Information Load in Hindi Verb Groups A Verb Group (VG) primarily comprises main verb and auxiliaries. Constituents like particles, negation markers, conjunction, etc. can also occur within a VG. It is important to know how much of GNPTAM feature information is stored in VG constituents individually and what is the load division in the absence or presence of auxiliaries. In a Hindi VG, when there is no auxiliary present, the complete information load falls on the main verb which carries information for GNPTAM features. In presence of auxiliaries, the load gets shared between the main verb and auxiliaries, and is represented in the form of different morphemes (inected or uninected), e.g., in the sentence - 781     ","   main bol paa rahaa hoon I am able to speak 1. Main verb ‘ ","’ {bol} is uninected and does not carry any information for any of the GNPTAM features. 2. ‘ ","’ {paa} is uninected and gives modality information, i.e., Abilitive. 3. ‘ ","’ {rahaa} gives Number (Sg), Gender (Masculine), Aspect (Durative) 4. ‘   ","’ {hoon} gives Number (Sg), Person (1st), Tense (Present) Gerund Identication In Hindi, the attachment of verbal sufxes like ‘  ’ {naa} and ‘  ","’ {ne} to a verb root results either in a gerund like ‘    ","’ {tairnaa} (swimming) or in an innitival verb form like ‘    ","’ {tairnaa} (to swim). We observed that it is easy to detect a gerund if it is followed by a case-marker or by any other innitival verb form."]},{"title":"4 Design of Hindi POS Tagger 4.1 Morphology Driven Tagger","paragraphs":["Morphology driven tagger makes use of the afx information stored in a word and assigns a POS tag using no contextual information. Though, it does take into account the previous and the next word in a VG to correctly identify the main verb and the auxiliaries, other POS categories are identied through lexicon lookup of the root form. The current lexicon4","has around 42,000 entries belonging to the major categories as mentioned in Figure 3. The format of each entry is ⟨word⟩,⟨paradigm⟩,⟨category⟩.","The process does not involve learning or disambiguation of any sort and is completely driven by hand-crafted morphology rules. The architecture of the tagger is shown in Figure 1. The work progresses at two levels:","4","The lexicon was developed using the wordlist from Hindi Wordnet (http://www.clt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/) and partial noun list from Anusaraka. It is being enhanced by adding new words from the corpus and removing the inconsistencies.","1. At Word Level: A stemmer is used in conjunction with lexicon and Sufx Replacement Rules (SRRs) to output all possible root-sufx pairs along with POS category label for a word. There is a possibility that the input word is not found in the lexicon and does not carry any inectional sufx. In such a case, derivational morphology rules are applied.","2. At Group Level: At this level a Morphological Analyzer (MA) uses the information encoded in the extracted sufx to add morphological information to the word. For nouns, the information provided by the sufxes is restricted only to ‘Number’. ‘Case’ can be inferred later by looking at the neighbouring words. For verbs, GNP values are found at the word level, while TAM values are identied dur-ing the VG Identication phase, described later. The analysis of the sufx is done in a discrete manner, i.e., each component of the sufx is analyzed separately. A morpheme analysis table comprising individual morphemes with their paradigm information and analyses is used for this purpose. MA’s output for the word  {khaaoongii} (will eat) looks like - Stem:  (eat) Sufx:  Category: Verb Morpheme 1:  Analysis: 1 Per, Sg Morpheme 2:  Analysis: Future","Morpheme 3: Analysis: Feminine 4.1.1 Verb Group Identication","The structure of a Hindi VG is relatively rigid and can be captured well using simple syntactic rules. In Hindi, certain auxiliaries like ’  ’ {rah}, ’  ’ {paa}, ’  ’, {sak} or ’ ","’ {paD} can also occur as main verbs in some contexts. VG identication deals with identifying the main verb and the auxiliaries of a VG while discounting for particles, conjunctions and negation markers. The VG identication goes left to right by marking the rst constituent as the main verb or copula verb and making every other verb con-782 Figure 1: Overall Architecture of the Tagger Table 1: Average Accuracy(%) Comparison of Various Approaches LLB LLBD MD BL LB 61.19 86.77 73.62 82.63 93.45 struct an auxiliary till a non-VG constituent is encountered. Main verb and copula verb can take the head position of a VG and can occur with or without auxiliary verbs. Auxiliary verbs, on the other hand, always come along with a main verb or a copula verb. This results in a very high accuracy of 99.5% for verb auxiliaries. Ambiguity between a main verb and a copula verb remains unresolved at this level and asks for disambiguation rules. 4.2 Need for Disambiguation The accuracy obtained by simple lexicon lookup based approach (LLB) comes out to be 61.19%. The morphology-driven tagger, on the other hand, performs better than just lexicon lookup but still results in considerable ambiguity. These results are signicant as they present a strong case in favor of using detailed morphological analysis. Similar observation has been presented by Uchimoto et al. (2001) for Japanese language. According to the tagging performed by SRRs and the lexicon, a word receives n tags if it be-longs to n POSs. If we consider multiple tags for a word as an error of the tagger (even when the options contain the correct tag for a word), then the accuracy of the tagger comes to be 73.62% (as shown in Table 1). The goal is to keep the contextually appropriate tag and eliminate others which can be achieved by devising a disambiguation technique. The disambiguation task can be naively addressed by choosing the most frequent tag for a word. This approach is also known as baseline (BL) tagging. The baseline accuracy turns out to be 82.63% which is still higher than that of the morphology-driven tag-ger5",". The drawback with baseline tagging is that its accuracy cannot be further improved. On the other hand, there is enough room for improving upon the accuracy of morphology-driven (MD) tagger. It is quite evident that though the MD tagger works well for VG and many close categories, around 30% of the words are either ambiguous or unknown. Hence, a disambiguation stage is needed to shoot up the accuracy.","The common choice for disambiguation rule learning in POS tagging task is usually machine learning techniques mainly focussing on decision tree based algorithms (Orphanos and Christodoulalds, 1999), neural networks (Schmid, 1994), etc. Among the various decision tree based algorithms like ID3, AQR, ASSIS-TANT and CN2, CN2 is known to perform better than the rest (Clark and Niblett, 1989). Since no such machine learning technique has been used for Hindi language, we thought of choosing CN2 as it performs well on noisy data6",". 5 These numbers may change if we experiment on a dif-","ferent dataset 6 The training annotated corpora becomes noisy by","virtue of intuitions of different annotators (trained native","Hindi speakers) 783 4.2.1 Training Corpora","We set up a corpus, collecting sentences from BBC news site7","and let the morphology-driven tagger assign morphosyntactic tags to all the words. For an ambiguous word, the contextually appropriate POS tag is manually chosen. Unknown words are assigned a correct tag based on their context and usage. 4.2.2 Learning","Out of the completely manually corrected corpora of 15,562 tokens, we created training instances for each Ambiguity Scheme and for Unknown words. These training instances take into account the POS categories of the neighbouring words and not the feature values8",". The experiments were carried out for different context window sizes ranging from 2 to 20 to nd the best conguration. 4.2.3 Rule Generation","The rules are generated from the training corpora by extracting the ambiguity scheme (AS) of each word. If the word is not present in the lexicon then its AS is set as ‘unknown’. Once the AS is identied, a training instance is formed. This training instance contains the neighbouring correct POS categories as attributes. The number of neighbours included in the training instance is the window size for CN2. After all the ambiguous words are processed and training instances for all seen ASs are created, the CN2 algorithm is applied over the training instances to generate actual rule-sets for each AS. The CN2 algorithm gives one set of If-Then rules (either ordered or unordered) for each AS including ‘unknown’9",". The AS of every ambiguous word is formed while tagging. A corresponding rule-set for that AS is then identied and traversed to get the contextually appropriate rule. The resultant 7 http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/ 8 Considering that a tag encodes 0 to 6 morphosyntactic","features and each feature takes either one or a disjunction","of 2 to 7 values, the total number of different tags can count","up to several hundreds 9 We used the CN2 algorithm implementation (1990)","by Robin Boswell. The software is available at","ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/pclark/cn2.tar.Z category outputted by this rule is then assigned to the ambiguous word. The traversal rule differs for ordered and unordered implementation.

The best results are empirically achieved with ordered rules, star size as 1, signicance threshold as 10 and window size 4, i.e., two neighbours on either side are used to generate the training instances. 5.2 Evaluation The tests are performed on contiguous partitions of the corpora (15,562 words) that are 75% training set and 25% testing set.

The accuracy for known and unknown words is also measured separately."]},{"title":"6 Results and Discussion","paragraphs":["The average accuracy of the learning based (LB) tagger after 4-fold cross validation is 93.45%. To 10","Most of the unknown words are proper nouns, which cannot be stored in the lexicon extensively. So, it also helps in named-entity detection. 784 90 90.5 91 91.5 92 92.5 93 93.5 94 94.5 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Accuracy Number of Words in Training Corpus","Overall Accuracy Known Words Accuracy Unknown Words Accuracy Figure 2: POS Learning Curve the best of our knowledge no comparable results have been reported so far for Hindi.","From Table 1, we can see that the disambiguation module brings up the accuracy of simple lexicon lookup based approach by around 25% (LLBD). The overall average accuracy is also brought up by around 20% by augmenting the morphology-driven (MD) tagger by a disambiguation module; hence justifying our belief that a disambiguation module over a morphology driven approach yields better results.","One interesting observation is the performance of the tagger on individual POS categories. Figure 3 shows clearly that the per POS accuracies of the LB tagger highly exceeds those of the MD and BL tagger for most categories. This means that the disambiguation module correctly disambiguates and correctly identies the unknown words too. The accuracy on unknown words, as earlier shown in Figure 2, is very high at 92.08%. The percentage of unknown words in the test corpora is 0.013. It seems independent of the size of training corpus because the corpora is unbalanced having most of the unknowns as proper nouns. The rules are formed on this bias, and hence the application of these rules assigns PPN tag to an unknown which is mostly the case.","From Figure 3 again we see that the accuracy on some categories remains very low even after disambiguation. This calls for some detailed failure analysis. By looking at the categories having low accuracy, such as pronoun, intensier, demonstratives and verb copula, we nd that all of them are highly ambiguous and, almost invariably, very rare in the corpus. Also, most of them are hard to disambiguate without any semantic information."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions & Future Work","paragraphs":["We have described in this paper a POS tagger for Hindi which can overcome the handicap of annotated corpora scarcity by exploiting the rich morphology of the language and the relatively rigid word-order within a VG. The whole work was driven by hunting down the factors that lower the accuracy of Verbs and weeding them out. A detailed study of accuracy distribution across the POS tags pointed out the cases calling for elaborate disambiguation rules. A major strength of the work is the learning of disambiguation rules, which otherwise would have been hand-coded, thus demanding exhaustive analysis of language phenomena. Attaining an accuracy of close to 94%, from a corpora of just about 15,562 words lends credence to the belief that morphological richness can offset resource scarcity. The work could lead such efforts of POS tag building for all those languages which have rich morphology, but cannot afford to invest a lot in creating large annotated corpora.","Several interesting future directions suggest themselves. It will be worthwhile to investigate a statistical approach like Conditional Random Fields in which the feature functions would be constructed from morphology. The next logical step from the POS tagger is a chunker for Hindi. In fact a start on this has already been made through VG identication."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["A. Ratnaparakhi. 1996.
