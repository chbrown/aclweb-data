By characterizing the discourse as a sequence of speech acts, discourse modeling becomes the identification of the speech act sequence. A statistical approach is adopted to model the relations between words in the user’s utterance using the semantic dependency graphs. Dependency relation between the headword and other words in a sentence is detected using the semantic dependency grammar. In order to evaluate the proposed method, a dialogue system for medical service is developed. Experimental results show that the rates for speech act detection and task-completion are 95.6% and 85.24%, respectively, and the average number of turns of each dialogue is 8.3.

Understanding of spontaneous language is arguably the core technology of the spoken dialogue systems, since the more accurate information obtained by the machine (Higashinaka et al., 2004), the more possibility to finish the dialogue task. Practical use of speech act theories in spoken language processing (Stolcke et al. 2000; Walker and Passonneau 2001; Wu et al., 2004) have given both insight and deeper understanding of verbal communication. Therefore, when considering the whole discourse, the relationship between the speech acts of the dialogue turns becomes extremely important. In the last decade, several practicable dialogue systems (McTEAR, 2002), such as air travel information service system, weather forecast system, automatic banking system, automatic train timetable information system, and the Circuit-Fix-it shop system, have been developed to extract the user’s semantic entities using the semantic frames/slots and conceptual graphs. The dialogue management in these systems is able to handle the dialogue flow efficaciously. However, it is not applicable to the more complex applications such as “Type 5: the natural language conversational applications” defined by IBM (Rajesh and Linda, 2004). In Type 5 dialog systems, it is possible for the users to switch directly from one ongo-ing task to another. In the traditional approaches, the absence of precise speech act identification without discourse analysis will result in the failure in task switching. The capability for identifying the speech act and extracting the semantic objects by reasoning plays a more important role for the dialog systems. This research proposes a semantic dependency-based discourse model to capture and share the semantic objects among tasks that switch during a dialog for semantic resolution. Besides 937 acoustic speech recognition, natural language understanding is one of the most important research issues, since understanding and application restric-tion on the small scope is related to the data structures that are used to capture and store the meaningful items. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2003) applied the object-oriented concept to provide a new semantic representation including semantic class and the learning algorithm for the combination of context free grammar and N-gram.","Among these approaches, there are two essential issues about dialogue management in natural language processing. The first one is how to obtain the semantic object from the user’s utterances. The second is a more effective speech act identification approach for semantic understanding is needed. Since speech act plays an important role in the development of dialogue management for dealing with complex applications, speech act identification with semantic interpretation will be the most important topic with respect to the methods used to control the dialogue with the users. This paper proposes an approach integrating semantic dependency graph and history/discourse information to model the dialogue discourse (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Gao and Suzuki, 2003). Three major components, such as semantic relation, semantic class and semantic role are adopted in the semantic dependency graph (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Hacioglu and Ward, 2003). The semantic relations constrain the word sense and provide the method for disambiguation. Semantic roles are assigned when the relation established among semantic objects. Both semantic relations and roles are defined in many knowledge resources or ontologies, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 2004) and HowNet with 65,000 concepts in Chinese and close to 75,000 English equivalents, is a bilingual knowledge-base describing relations between concepts and relations between the attributes of concepts with ontological view (Dong and Dong 2006). Generally speaking, semantic class is defined as a set with the elements that are usually the words with the same semantic interpretation. Hypernyms that are superordinate concepts of the words are usually used as the semantic classes just like the Hypernyms of synsets in WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) or definitions of words’ primary features in HowNet. Besides, the approach for understanding tries to find the implicit semantic dependency between the concepts and the dependency structure between concepts in the utterance are also taken into consideration. Instead of semantic frame/slot, semantic dependency graph can keep more information for dialogue understanding."]},{"title":"2 Semantic Dependency Graph","paragraphs":["Since speech act theory is developed to extract the functional meaning of an utterance in the dialogue (Searle, 1979), discourse or history can be defined as a sequence of speech acts,","12 1","{, ,.... , }ttt HSASASASA−","= , and accordingly the speech act theory can be adopted for discourse modeling.

In this experiment, we analyze the effect of the number of sentences according to the precision rate of the speech act using the semantic dependency graphs with and without the discourse information. From the results, the precision rates for speech act identification achieved 95.6 and 92.4 percentages for the training corpus containing 10,036 and 7,012 sentences using semantic dependency graphs with and without history, respectively. This means that semantic dependency graph with discourse outperforms that without discourse, but more training data are needed to include the discourse for speech act identification. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the speech act identification rate and the size of the training corpus. From this figure, we can find that more training sentences for the semantic dependency graph with discourse analysis are needed than that without discourse. This implies discourse analysis plays an important role in the identification of the speech act. 3.3 Performance analysis of semantic dependency graph To evaluate the performance, two systems were developed for comparison. One is based on the Bayes’ classifier (Walker et al., 1997), and the other is the use of the partial pattern tree (Wu et al., 2004) to identify the speech act of the user’s utterances. Since the dialogue discourse is defined as a sequence of speech acts. The prediction of speech act of the new input utterance becomes the core issue for discourse modeling.

The reason is that not only the meanings of the words or concepts but also the structural information and the implicit semantic relation defined in the knowledge base are needed to identify the speech act.Besides, taking the discourse into consideration will improve the prediction about the speech act of the new or next utterance. This means the discourse model can improve the accuracy of the speech act identification, that is to say, discourse modeling can help understand the user’s desired intension especially when the answer is very short.","Semantic dependency graph Speech act With discourse analysis Without discourse analysis","PPT Bayes’ Classifier Clinic information (26 sentences) 100 (26) 96.1 (25) 88 (23) 92 (24) Dr.’s information (42 sentences) 97 (41) 92.8 (39) 66.6 (28) 92.8 (39) Confirmation(others) (42 sentences) 95 (40) 95 (40) 95 (40) 95 (40) Others (14 sentences) 57.1 (8) 50 (7) 43 (6) 38 (5) FAQ (13 sentences) 70 (9) 53.8 (7) 61.5 (8) 46 (6) Clinic information (135 sentences) 98.5 (133) 96.2 (130) 91.1 (123) 93.3 (126) Time (38) 94.7 (36) 89.4 (34) 97.3 (37) 92.1 (35) Registration (75) 100 (75) 100 (75) 86.6 (65) 86.6 (65) Cancel registration (10) 90 (9) 80 (8) 60 (6) 80 (8)","Average Precision 95.6 92.4 85 88.1 Table 1 The accuracy for speech act identification 942 For example, the user may only say “yes” or “no” for confirmation. The misclassification in speech act will happen due to the limited information. However, it can obtain better interpretation by introducing the semantic dependency relations as well as the discourse information. To obtain the single measurement, the average accuracy for speech act identification is shown in Table 1. The best approach is the semantic dependency graphs with the discourse. This means the information of the discourse can help speech act identification. And the semantic dependency graph outperforms the traditional approach due to the semantic analysis of words with their corresponding relations.  The success of the dialog lies on the achievement of the common ground between users and machine which is the most important issue in dialogue management. To compare the semantic dependency graph with previous approaches, 150 individuals who were not involved in the development of this project were asked to use the dialogue system to measure the task success rate. To filter out the incomplete tasks, 131 dialogs were employed as the analysis data in this experiment.

Two main reasons are concluded: First, dependency graph can keep the most important information in the user’s utterance, while in semantic slot/frame approach, the semantic objects not matching the semantic slot/frame are generally filtered out. This approach is able to skip the repe  tition or similar utterances to fill the same information in different semantic slots. Second, the dependency graph-based approach can provide the inference to help the interpretation of the user’s intension. For semantic understanding, correct interpretation of the information from the user’s utterances becomes inevitable. Correct speech act identification and correct extraction of the semantic objects are both important issues for semantic understanding in the spoken dialogue systems. Five main categories about medical application, clinic information, Dr.’s information, confirmation for the clinic information, registration time and clinic inference, are analyzed in this experiment.

The mis-identification of speech act results in the un-matched semantic slots/frames. This condition will not happen in semantic dependency graph, since the semantic dependency graph always keeps the most important semantic objects according to the dependency relations in the semantic dependency graph instead of the semantic slots. Rather than filtering out the unmatched semantic objects, the semantic dependency graph is constructed to keep the semantic relations in the utterance. This means that the system can preserve most of the user’s information via the semantic dependency graphs. We can observe the identification rate of the speech act is higher for the semantic dependency graph than that for the partial pattern tree and Bayes’ classifier as shown in Table 3. 943"]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has presented a semantic dependency graph that robustly and effectively deals with a variety of conversational discourse information in the spoken dialogue systems.

By integrating discourse analysis this result also shows the improvement obtained not only in the identification rate of speech act but also in the performance for semantic object extraction."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The authors would like to thank the National Science Council, Republic of China, for its financial support of this work, under Contract No. NSC 94-2213-E-006-018."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.
