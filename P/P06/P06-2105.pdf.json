One of the central challenges for natural language understanding systems is to determine whether different text fragments have the same meaning or, more generally, if the meaning of one text can be derived from the meaning of another. A module that recognizes the semantic entailment between two text snippets can be employed by many NLP applications. For example, Question Answering systems have to identify texts that entail expected answers. In Multi-document Summarization, the redundant information should be recognized and omitted from the summary.","Trying to boost research in textual inferences, the PASCAL Network proposed the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006). For a pair of two text fragments, the task is to determine if the meaning of one text (the entailed hypothesis denoted by ",")","can be inferred from the meaning of the other text","(the entailing text or","). In this paper, we propose a model to represent the knowledge encoded in text and a logical set-ting suitable to a recognizing semantic entailment system. We cast the textual inference problem as a logic implication between meanings. Text","semantically entails  if its meaning logically implies the meaning of ",". Thus, we, first,transform both text fragments into logic form, capture their meaning by detecting the semantic relations that hold between their constituents and load these rich logic representations into a natural language logic prover to decide if the entailment holds or not. Figure 1 illustrates our approach to RTE. The following sections of the paper shall detail the logic proving methodology, our logical representation of text and the various types of axioms that the prover uses.","To our knowledge, there are few logical ap-proaches to RTE.

To every inference, an appropriate weight is assigned depending on the axiom used for its derivation. If a refutation is found, the proof is complete; if a refutation cannot be found, then predicate arguments are relaxed. When argument relaxation fails to produce a refutation, entire predicates are dropped from the negated hypothesis until a refutation is found. 2.1 Proof scoring algorithm Once a proof by contradiction is found, its score is computed by starting with an initial perfect score and deducting points for each axiom utilized in the proof, every relaxed argument, and dropped predicate. The computed score is a measure of the kinds of axioms used in the proof and the significanceof the dropped arguments and predicates. If we as-sume that both text fragments are existential, then   ","if and only if ’s entities are a subset of  ’s entities (Some smart people read","Some peo-","ple read) and penalizing a pair whose ","contains","predicates that cannot be inferred is a correct way","to ensure entailment (Some people read","","Some","smart people read).

More specifically, a predicate is created for each noun, verb, adjective and adverb. The nouns that form a noun compound are gathered under a nn NNC predicate. Each named entity class of a noun has a corresponding predicate which shares its argument with the noun predicate it modifies.

This syntactic layer of the logic representation is, automatically, derived from a full parse tree and acknowledges syntax-based relationships such as: syntactic subjects, syntactic objects, prepositional attachments, complex nominals, and adjectival/adverbial adjuncts.","In order to objectively evaluate our representation, we derived it from two different sources: constituency parse trees (generated with our implementation of (Collins, 1997)) and dependency parse trees (created using Minipar (Lin, 1998))1",". The two logic forms are slightly different. The dependency representation captures more accurately the syntactic dependencies between the concepts, but lacks the semantic information that our semantic parser extracts from the constituency parse trees. For instance, the sentence Gilda Flores was kidnapped on the 13th of January 19902","is “constituenc y” represented as Gilda NN(x1) & Flores NN(x2) & nn NNC(x3,x1,x2) & human NE(x3) & kidnap VB(e1,x9,x3) & on IN(e1,x8) & 13th NN(x4) & of NN(x5) & January (x6) & 1990 NN(x7) & nn NNC(x8,x4,x5,x6,x7) & date NE(x8) and its “dependenc y” logic form is Gilda Flores NN(x2) & human NE(x2) & kidnap VB(e1,x4,x2) & on IN(e1,x3) & 13th NN(x3) & of IN(x3,x1) & January 1990 NN(x1). 3.1.1 Negation","The exceptions to the one-predicate-peropen-class-word rule include the adverbs not and never.

The RTE datasets will be described in Section 7. not RB(x3,e1) and negates the verb’s predicate (-release VB(e1,x1,x2)). Similarly, for nouns whose determiner is no, for example, No case of indigenously acquired rabies infection has been confirmed, the verb’s predicate is negated (case NN(x1) & -confirm VB(e2,x15,x1)). 3.2 Semantic Relations The second layer of our logic representation adds the semantic relations, the underlying relationships between concepts. They provide the semantic background for the text, which allows for a denser connectivity between the concepts expressed in text. Our semantic parser takes free English text or parsed sentences and extracts a rich set of semantic relations3","between words or concepts in each sentence. It focuses not only on the verb and its arguments, but also on semantic relations encoded in syntactic patterns such as complex nominals, genitives, adjectival phrases, and adjectival clauses. Our representation module maps each semantic relation identified by the parser to a predicate whose arguments are the events and entities that participate in the relation and it adds these semantic predicates to the logic form. For example, the previous logic form is augmented with the THEME SR(x3,e1) & TIME SR(x8,e1) relations4","(Gilda Flores is the theme of the kidnap event and 13th of January 1990 shows the time of the kidnapping). 3.3 Temporal Representation In addition to the semantic predicates, we represent every date/time into a normalized form time TMP(BeginFn(event), year, month, date, hour, minute, second) & time TMP(EndFn(event), year, month, date, hour, minute, second). Furthermore, temporal reasoning 3 We consider relations such as AGENT,","THEME, TIME, LOCATION, MANNER, CAUSE,","INSTRUMENT, POSSESSION, PURPOSE,","MEASURE, KINSHIP, ATTRIBUTE, etc. 4 R(x,y) should be read as “x is R of y”. 821","predicates are derived from both the detected","semantic relations as well as from a module","which utilizes a learning algorithm to detect","temporally ordered events ( ","","",""," ",", where"," is the temporal signal linking two events",""," and","",") (Moldovan et al., 2005).

The system generates axioms on demand for a given     ","pair whenever the semantic connectivity between two concepts needs to be established in a proof. The axioms on demand are lexical chains and world knowledge axioms. We are keen on the idea of axioms on demand since it is not possible to derive apriori all axioms needed in an arbitrary proof. This brings a considerable level of robustness to our entailment system. 4.1 eXtended WordNet lexical chains For the semantic entailment task, the ability to recognize two semantically-related words is an important requirement. Therefore, we automatically construct lexical chains of WordNet relations from","’s constituents to ","’s (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002). In order to avoid errors introduced by a Word Sense Disambiguation system, we used the first","senses for each word5","unless the source and the target of the chain are synonyms. If a chain exists6",", the system generates, on demand, an axiom with the predicates of the source (from",") and the target (from ","). 5 Because WordNet senses are ranked based on their fre-","quency, the correct sense is most likely among the first",". In","our experiments,",". 6 Each lexical chain is assigned a weight based on its prop-","erties: shorter chains are better than longer ones, the relations","are not equally important and their order in the chain influ-","ences its strength. If the weight of a chain is above a given","threshold, the lexical chain is discarded. For example, given the ISA relation between murder#1 and kill#1, the system generates, when needed, the axiom murder VB(e1,x1,x2) ","kill VB(e1,x1,x2). The remaining of this section details some of the requirements for creating accurate lexical chains.","Because our extended version of WordNet has attached named entities to each noun synset, the lexical chain axioms append the entity name of the target concept, whenever it exists. For example, the logic prover uses the axiom Nicaraguan JJ(x1,x2)  Nicaragua NN(x1) & country NE(x1) when it tries to infer electoral campaign is held in Nicaragua from Nicaraguan electoral campaign.","We ensured the relevance of the lexical chains by limiting the path length to three relations and the set of WordNet relations used to create the chains by discarding the paths that contain certain relations in a particular order. For example, the automatic axiom generation module does not consider chains with an IS-A relation followed by a HYPONYMY link (        ","","). Similarly, the system rejected chains with more than one HYPONYMY relations. Although these relations link semantically related concepts, the type of semantic similarity they in-troduce is not suited for inferences. Another restriction imposed on the lexical chains generated for entailment is not to start from or include too general concepts7",". Therefore, we assigned to each noun and verb synset from WordNet a generality weight based on its relative position within its hierarchy and on its frequency in a large corpus. If ","is the depth of concept  ,  ","is the max-","imum depth in  ’s hierarchy","","and     ","","","","  ","","","","is the information content of","","mea-","sured on the British National Corpus, then  ","","","","","   ","","","","","","","  ","",""," In our experiments, we discarded the chains with concepts whose generality weight exceeded 0.8 such as object NN#1, act VB#1, be VB#1, etc.","Another important change that we introduced in our extension of WordNet is the refinement of the DERIVATION relation which links verbs with their corresponding nominalized nouns. Because the relation is ambiguous regarding the role of the noun, we split","7","There are no restrictions on the target concept. 822 this relation in three: ACT-DERIVATION, AGENT-DERIVATION and THEME-DERIVATION. The role of the nominalization determines the argument given to the noun predicate. For in-stance, the axioms act VB(e1,x1,x2)  acting NN(e1) (ACT), act VB(e1,x1,x2) ","actor NN(x1) (AGENT) reflect different types of derivation. 4.2 NLP Axioms Our NLP axioms are linguistic rewriting rules that help break down complex logic structures and express syntactic equivalence. After analyzing the logic form and the parse trees of each text fragment, the system, automatically, generates axioms to break down complex nominals and coordinating conjunctions into their constituents so that other axioms can be applied, individually, to the components. These axioms are made available only to the","","  ","pair that generated them. For example, the axiom nn NNC(x3,x1,x2) & francisco NN(x1) & merino NN(x2) ","merino NN(x3) breaks down the noun compound Francisco Merino into Francisco and Merino and helps COGEX infer Merino’s home from Francisco Merino’s home. 4.3 World Knowledge Axioms Because, sometimes, the lexical or the syntactic knowledge cannot solve an entailment pair, we exploit the WordNet glosses, an abundant source of world knowledge. We used the logic forms of the glosses provided by eXtended WordNet8 to, automatically, create our world knowledge axioms. For example, the firstsense of noun Pope and its definition the head of the Roman Catholic Church introduces the axiom Pope NN(x1) ","head NN(x1) & of IN(x1,x2) & Roman Catholic Church NN(x2) which is used by prover to show the entailment between  : A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI. and ",": Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.","We also incorporate in our system a small common-sense knowledge base of 383 hand-coded world knowledge axioms, where 153 have been manually designed based on the entire de-8 http://xwn.hlt.utdallas.edu velopment set data, and 230 originate from previous projects. These axioms express knowledge that could not be derived from WordNet regarding employment9",", family relations, awards, etc."]},{"title":"5 Semantic Calculus","paragraphs":["The Semantic Calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).

Depending on their properties, there are up to 8 combinations between any two semantic relations and their inverses, not counting the combinations between a semantic relation and itself10",". Many combinations are not semantically significant, for example, KINSHIP SR(x1,x2) & TEMPORAL SR(x2,e1) is unlikely to be found in text.

Another frequent axiom is LOCATION SR(x1,x2) & PARTWHOLE SR(x2,x3)  LOCATION SR(x1,x3). Given the text John lives in Dallas, Texas and using the axiom, the system infers that John lives in Texas. The system applies the 82 axioms independent of the concepts involved in the semantic composition. There are rules that can be applied only if the concepts that participate satisfy a certain condition or if the relations are of a certain type. For example, LOCATION SR(x1,x2) & LOCATION SR(x2,x3)  LOCATION SR(x1,x3) only if the LOCATION relation shows inclusion (John is in the car in the garage ","LOCATION SR(John,garage). John is near the car behind the garage  LOCATION SR(John,garage))."]},{"title":"6 Temporal Axioms","paragraphs":["One of the types of temporal axioms that we load in our logic prover links specific dates to more general time intervals.
