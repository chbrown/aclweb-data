Ideally, a model should allow the reordering of any distance, because if we are to translate from Japanese to English, the verb in the Japanese sentence must be moved from the end of the sentence to the beginning just after the subject in the English sentence."," Graduated in March 2006","Standard phrase-based translation systems use a word distance-based reordering model in which non-monotonic phrase alignment is penalized based on the word distance between successively translated source phrases without considering the orientation of the phrase alignment or the identities of the source and target phrases (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) introduced the notion of a block (a pair of source and target phrases that are translations of each other), and proposed the block orientation bigram in which the local reordering of adjacent blocks are expressed as a three-valued orientation, namely Right (monotone), Left (swapped), or Neutral. A block with neutral orientation is supposed to be less strongly linked to its predecessor block: thus in their model, the global reordering is not explicitly modeled.","In this paper, we present a global reordering model that explicitly models long distance reordering1",". It predicts four type of reordering patterns, namely MA (monotone adjacent), MG (monotone gap), RA (reverse adjacent), and RG (reverse gap). There are based on the identities of the source and target phrases currently being translated, and the previously translated source and target phrases. The parameters of the reordering model are estimated from the phrase alignments of training bilingual sentences. To cope with sparseness, we use N-best phrase alignments and bilingual phrase clustering.","In the following sections, we first describe the global phrase reordering model and its param-","1","It might be misleading to call our reordering model “global” since it is at most considers two phrases.

The consistent N-best phrase alignment are searched from all combinations of the above phrase pairs.","The search for consistent Viterbi phrase alignments can be implemented as a phrase-based decoder using a beam search whose outputs are constrained only to the target sentence. The consistent N-best phrase alignment can be obtained by using A* search as described in (Ueffing et al., 2002). We did not use any reordering constraints, such as IBM constraint and ITG constraint in the search for the N-best phrase alignment (Zens et al., 2004).","The thresholds used in the search are the following: the minimum phrase translation probability is 0.0001. The maximum number of translation candidates for each phrase is 20. The beam width is 1e-10, the stack size (for each target candidate word length) is 1000. We found that, compared with the decoding of sentence translation, we have to search significantly larger space for the N-best phrase alignment.","Figure 3 shows an example of phrase pair expansion toward eight neighbors.

We call this conventional phrase extraction method “gr ow-diag-final”, and the proposed phrase extraction method “ppick er” (this is intended to stand for phrase picker). 4.2 Bilingual Phrase Clustering The second approach to cope with the sparseness in Equation (4) is to group the phrases into equivalence classes. We used a bilingual word clustering tool, mkcls (Och et al., 1999) for this purpose. It forms partitions of the vocabulary of the two languages to maximize the joint probability of the training bilingual corpus.","In order to perform bilingual phrase clustering, all words in a phrase are concatenated by an under-score ’ ’ to form a pseudo word.

Since we are not sure whether it is appropriate to introduce asymmetry in head word selection, we also tried a “2po s” method, where the parts of speech of both the first and the last words are used for phrase classification. 4.3 Conditioning Factor of Reordering The third approach to cope with sparseness in Equation (4) is to approximate the equation by reducing the conditioning factors.","Other than the baseline word distance-based reordering model and the Equation (4) itself, we tried eight different approximations of Equation (4) as shown in Table 2, where, the symbol in the left column is the shorthand for the reordering model in the right column.","The approximations are designed based on two intuitions.

We assume this is because the proposed N-best phrase alignment method optimizes the combination of phrase extraction (segmentation) and phrase alignment in a sentence. 5.4 Global and Local Reordering Model In order to show the advantages of explicitly modeling global phrase reordering, we implemented a different reordering model where the reordering pattern is classified into three values: monotone adjacent, reverse adjacent and neutral.
