We present a series of experiments to investigate the effectiveness of QuestionBank as both an exclusive and supplementary training resource for a state-of-the-art parser in parsing both question and non-question test sets. We introduce a new method for recovering empty nodes and their antecedents (capturing long distance dependencies) from parser output in CFG trees using LFG f-structure reentrancies. Our main ndings are (i) using QuestionBank training data improves parser performance to 89.75% labelled bracketing f-score, an increase of almost 11% over the baseline; (ii) back-testing experiments on non-question data (Penn-II WSJ Section 23) shows that the retrained parser does not suffer a performance drop on non-question material; (iii) ablation experiments show that the size of training material provided by QuestionBank is sufcient to achieve optimal results; (iv) our method for recovering empty nodes captures long distance dependencies in questions from the ATIS corpus with high precision (96.82%) and low recall (39.38%). In summary, QuestionBank provides a useful new resource in parser-based QA research."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Parse-annotated corpora (treebanks) are crucial for developing machine learning and statistics-based parsing resources for a given language or task. Large treebanks are available for major languages, however these are often based on a specic text type or genre, e.g. nancial newspaper text (the Penn-II Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)). This can limit the applicability of grammatical resources induced from treebanks in that such resources underperform when used on a different type of text or for a specic task.","In this paper we present work on creating QuestionBank, a treebank of parse-annotated questions, which can be used as a supplementary training resource to allow parsers to accurately parse questions (as well as other text). Alternatively, the resource can be used as a stand-alone training corpus to train a parser specically for questions. Either scenario will be useful in training parsers for use in question answering (QA) tasks, and it also provides a suitable resource to evaluate the accuracy of these parsers on questions.","We use a semi-automatic bootstrapping method to create the question treebank from raw text. We show that a parser trained on the question treebank alone can accurately parse questions. Training on a combined corpus consisting of the question treebank and an established training set (Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank), the parser gives state-of-the-art performance on both questions and a non-question test set (Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank).","Section 2 describes background work and motivation for the research presented in this paper. Section 3 describes the data we used to create the corpus. In Section 4 we describe the semi-automatic method to bootstrap the question corpus, discuss some interesting and problematic phenomena, and show how the manual vs. automatic workload distribution changed as work progressed. Two sets of experiments using our new question corpus are presented in Section 5. In Section 6 we introduce a new method for recovering empty nodes and their antecedents using Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) f-structure reen-497 trancies. Section 7 concludes and outlines future work."]},{"title":"2 Background and Motivation","paragraphs":["High quality probabilistic, treebank-based parsing resources can be rapidly induced from appropriate treebank material. However, treebank- and machine learning-based grammatical resources reect the characteristics of the training data. They generally underperform on test data substantially different from the training data.","Previous work on parser performance and domain variation by Gildea (2001) showed that by training a parser on the Penn-II Treebank and test-ing on the Brown corpus, parser accuracy drops by 5.7% compared to parsing the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) based Penn-II Treebank Section 23. This shows a negative effect on parser performance even when the test data is not radically different from the training data (both the Penn II and Brown corpora consist primarily of written texts of American English, the main difference is the considerably more varied nature of the text in the Brown corpus). Gildea also shows how to resolve this problem by adding appropriate data to the training corpus, but notes that a large amount of additional data has little impact if it is not matched to the test material.","Work on more radical domain variance and on adapting treebank-induced LFG resources to analyse ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990) question material is described in Judge et al. (2005). The research established that even a small amount of additional training data can give a substantial improvement in question analysis in terms of both CFG parse accuracy and LFG grammatical functional analysis, with no signicant negative effects on non-question analysis. Judge et al. (2005) suggest, however, that further improvements are possible given a larger question training corpus.","Clark et al. (2004) worked specically with question parsing to generate dependencies for QA with Penn-II treebank-based Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG’s). They use what questions taken from the TREC QA datasets as the basis for a What-Question corpus with CCG annotation."]},{"title":"3 Data Sources","paragraphs":["The raw question data for QuestionBank comes from two sources, the TREC 8-11 QA track test sets1",", and a question classier training set produced by the Cognitive Computation Group (CCG2",") at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.3","We use equal amounts of data from each source so as not to bias the corpus to either data source. 3.1 TREC Questions The TREC evaluations have become the standard evaluation for QA systems. Their test sets consist primarily of fact seeking questions with some imperative statements which request information, e.g. List the names of cell phone manufacturers. We included 2000 TREC questions in the raw data from which we created the question treebank. These 2000 questions consist of the test questions for the rst three years of the TREC QA track (1893 questions) and 107 questions from the 2003 TREC test set. 3.2 CCG Group Questions The CCG provide a number of resources for developing QA systems. One of these resources is a set of 5500 questions and their answer types for use in training question classiers. The 5500 questions were stripped of answer type annotation, duplicated TREC questions were removed and 2000 questions were used for the question treebank.","The CCG 5500 questions come from a number of sources (Li and Roth, 2002) and some of these questions contain minor grammatical mistakes so that, in essence, this corpus is more representative of genuine questions that would be put to a working QA system. A number of changes in to-kenisation were corrected (eg. separating contrac-tions), but the minor grammatical errors were left unchanged because we believe that it is necessary for a parser for question analysis to be able to cope with this sort of data if it is to be used in a working QA system."]},{"title":"4 Creating the Treebank 4.1 Bootstrapping a Question Treebank","paragraphs":["The algorithm used to generate the question treebank is an iterative process of parsing, manual correction, retraining, and parsing. 1 http://trec.nist.gov/data/qa.html 2 Note that the acronym CCG here refers to Cognitive","Computation Group, rather than Combinatory Categorial","Grammar mentioned in Section 2. 3 http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/ cogcomp/tools.php 498","Algorithm 1 Induce a parse-annotated treebank","from raw data repeat Parse a new section of raw data Manually correct errors in the parser output Add the corrected data to the training set Extract a new grammar for the parser until All the data has been processed","Algorithm 1 summarises the bootstrapping algorithm. A section of raw data is parsed. The parser output is then manually corrected, and added to the parser’s training corpus. A new grammar is then extracted, and the next section of raw data is parsed. This process continues until all the data has been parsed and hand corrected. 4.2 Parser The parser used to process the raw questions prior to manual correction was that of Bikel (2002)4",", a retrainable emulation of Collins (1999) model 2 parser. Bikel’s parser is a history-based parser which uses a lexicalised generative model to parse sentences. We used WSJ Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank to train the parser for the rst it-eration of the algorithm. The training corpus for subsequent iterations consisted of the WSJ material and increasing amounts of processed questions. 4.3 Basic Corpus Development Statistics Our question treebank was created over a period of three months at an average annotation speed of about 60 questions per day. This is quite rapid for treebank development. The speed of the process was helped by two main factors: the questions are generally quite short (typically about 10 words long), and, due to retraining on the continually increasing training set, the quality of the parses output by the parser improved dramatically during the development of the treebank, with the effect that corrections during the later stages were generally quite small and not as time consuming as during the initial phases of the bootstrapping process.","For example, in the rst week of the project the trees from the parser were of relatively poor quality and over 78% of the trees needed to be corrected manually. This slowed the annotation process considerably and parse-annotated questions 4 Downloaded from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/∼dbikel","/software.html#stat-parser were being produced at an average rate of 40 trees per day. During the later stages of the project this had changed dramatically. The quality of trees from the parser was much improved with less than 20% of the trees requiring manual correction. At this stage parse-annotated questions were being produced at an average rate of 90 trees per day. 4.4 Corpus Development Error Analysis Some of the more frequent errors in the parser output pertain to the syntactic analysis of WHphrases (WHNP, WHPP, etc). In Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank, these are used more often in relative clause constructions than in questions. As a result many of the corpus questions were given syntactic analyses corresponding to relative clauses (SBAR with an embedded S) instead of as questions (SBARQ with an embedded SQ). Figure 1 provides an example. SBAR WHNP WP Who S VP VBD created NP DT the NN Muppets (a) SBARQ WHNP WP Who SQ VP VBD created NP DT the NNPS Muppets (b) Figure 1: Example tree before (a) and after correction (b)","Because the questions are typically short, an error like this has quite a large effect on the accuracy for the overall tree; in this case the f-score for the parser output (Figure 1(a)) would be only 60%. Errors of this nature were quite frequent in the rst section of questions analysed by the parser, but with increased training material becom-ing available during successive iterations, this error became less frequent and towards the end of 499 the project it was only seen in rare cases.","WH-XP marking was the source of a number of consistent (though infrequent) errors during annotation. This occurred mostly in PP constructions containing WHNPs. The parser would output a structure like Figure 2(a), where the PP mother of the WHNP is not correctly labelled as a WHPP as in Figure 2(b). PP IN by WHNP WP$ whose NN authority WHPP IN by WHNP WP$ whose NN authority (a) (b) Figure 2: WH-XP assignment","The parser output often had to be rearranged structurally to varying degrees. This was common in the longer questions. A recurring error in the parser output was failing to identify VPs in SQs with a single object NP. In these cases the verb and the object NP were left as daughters of the SQ node. Figure 3(a) illustrates this, and Figure 3(b) shows the corrected tree with the VP node inserted. SBARQ WHNP WP Who SQ VBD killed NP Ghandi SBARQ WHNP WP Who SQ VP VBD killed NP Ghandi (a) (b) Figure 3: VP missing inside SQ with a single NP","On inspection, we found that the problem was caused by copular constructions, which, accord-ing to the Penn-II annotation guidelines, do not feature VP constituents. Since almost half of the question data contain copular constructions, the parser trained on this data would sometimes misanalyse non-copular constructions or, conversely, incorrectly bracket copular constructions using a VP constituent (Figure 4(a)).","The predictable nature of these errors meant that they were simple to correct. This is due to the particular context in which they occur and the nite number of forms of the copular verb.

In cross-validation experiments with 90%/10% splits we use all 4000 trees in the completed QuestionBank as the test set. We performed ablation experiments to investigate the effect of varying the amount of question and non-question training data on the parser’s performance. For these experiments we divided the 4000 questions into two sets. We randomly selected 400 trees to be held out as a gold standard test set against which to evaluate, the remaining 3600 trees were then used as a training corpus. 5.1 Establishing the Baseline The baseline we use for our experiments is provided by Bikel’s parser trained on WSJ Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank. We test on all 4000 questions in our question treebank, and also Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank. QuestionBank Coverage 100 F-Score 78.77 WSJ Section 23 Coverage 100 F-Score 82.97 Table 1: Baseline parsing results","Table 1 shows the results for our baseline evaluations on question and non-question test sets. While the coverage for both tests is high, the parser underperforms signicantly on the question test set with a labelled bracketing f-score of 78.77 compared to 82.97 on Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank. Note that unlike the published results for Bikel’s parser in our evaluations we test on Section 23 and include punctuation. 5.2 Cross-Validation Experiments We carried out two cross-validation experiments. In the rst experiment we perform a 10-fold cross-validation experiment using our 4000 question 500 treebank. In each case a randomly selected set of 10% of the questions in QuestionBank was held out during training and used as a test set. In this way parses from unseen data were generated for all 4000 questions and evaluated against the QuestionBank trees.","The second cross-validation experiment was similar to the rst, but in each of the 10 folds we train on 90% of the 4000 questions in QuestionBank and on all of Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank.","In both experiments we also backtest each of the ten grammars on Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank and report the average scores.

Compared to Table 1, the results show a signicant improvement of over 10% on the baseline f-score for questions. However, the tests on the non-question Section 23 data show not only a signicant drop in accuracy but also a drop in coverage.","Questions Coverage 100 F-Score 89.75 Backtest on Sect 23 Coverage 100 F-Score 82.39 Table 3: Cross-validation experiment using Penn-II Treebank Sections 02-21 and 4000 questions","Table 3 shows the results for the second cross-validation experiment using Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank and the 4000 questions in QuestionBank. The results show an even greater increase on the baseline f-score than the experiments using only the question training set (Table 2). The non-question results are also better and are comparable to the baseline (Table 1). 5.3 Ablation Runs In a further set of experiments we investigated the effect of varying the amount of data in the parser’s training corpus. We experiment with varying both the amount of QuestionBank and Penn-II Treebank data that the parser is trained on. In each experiment we use the 400 question test set and Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank to evaluate against, and the 3600 question training set described above and Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank as the basis for the parser’s training corpus. We report on three experiments:","In the rst experiment we train the parser using only the 3600 question training set. We performed ten training and parsing runs in this experiment, incrementally reducing the size of the QuestionBank training corpus by 10% of the whole on each run.","The second experiment is similar to the rst but in each run we add Sections 02-21 of the Penn-II Treebank to the (shrinking) training set of questions.","The third experiment is the converse of the second, the amount of questions in the training set remains xed (all 3600) and the amount of Penn-II Treebank material is incrementally reduced by 10% on each run. 50 60 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Coverage/F-Score","Percentage of 3600 questions in the training corpus","FScore Questions","FScore Section 23 Coverage Questions","Coverage Section 23 Figure 5: Results for ablation experiment reducing 3600 training questions in steps of 10%","Figure 5 graphs the coverage and f-score for the parser in tests on the 400 question test set, and Section 23 of the Penn-II Treebank in ten parsing runs with the amount of data in the 3600 question training corpus reducing incrementally on each run. The results show that training on only a small amount of questions, the parser can parse questions with high accuracy. For example when trained on only 10% of the 3600 questions used in this experiment, the parser successfully parses all of the 400 question test set and achieves an f-score of 85.59. However the results for the tests on WSJ Section 23 are considerably worse.
