The key component is a new procedure to directly optimize the global scoring function used by a SMT decoder.

A block is a pair of phrases which are translations of each other. For example, Figure 1 shows an Arabic-English translation example that uses four blocks. During decoding, we view translation as a block segmentation process, where the input sentence is segmented from left to right and the target sentence is generated from bottom to top, one block at a time. A monotone block sequence is generated except for the possibility to handle some local phrase re-ordering. In this local re-ordering model (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005; Kumar and Byrne, 2005) a block ","with","orientation","is generated relative to its predeces-","sor block  .

The block orientation se-721 quence","is generated under the restriction that the concatenated source phrases of the blocks  ","yield the input sentence. In modeling a block sequence, we emphasize adjacent block neighbors that have right or left orientation, since in the current experiments only local block swapping is handled (neutral orientation is used for ’detached’ blocks as described in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005)).","This paper focuses on the discriminative training of the weight vector","used in Eq. 1. The decoding process is decomposed into local decision steps based on Eq. 1, but the model is trained in a global setting as shown below. The advantage of this approach is that it can easily handle tens of millions of features, e.g. up to","million features for the experiments in this paper. Moreover, under this view, SMT becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing, and the novel training algorithm presented in this paper is actually most similar to work on training algorithms presented for these task, e.g. the on-line training algorithm presented in (McDonald et al., 2005) and the perceptron training algorithm presented in (Collins, 2002). The current approach does not use specialized probability features as in (Och, 2003) in any stage during decoder parameter training. Such probability features include language model, translation or distortion probabilities, which are commonly used in current SMT approaches 1",". We are able to achieve comparable performance to (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005). The novel algorithm differs computationally from earlier work in discriminative training algorithms for SMT (Och, 2003) as follows:"," No computationally expensive","-best lists are generated during training: for each input sentence a single block sequence is generated on each iteration over the training data."," No additional development data set is necessary as the weight vector","is trained on bilingual training data only.","The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the baseline block sequence model and the feature representation.

Section 4 presents results on a standard Arabic-English translation task. Finally, some discussion and future work is presented in Section 5."]},{"title":"2 Block Sequence Model","paragraphs":["This paper views phrase-based SMT as a block sequence generation process. Blocks are phrase pairs consisting of target and source phrases and local phrase re-ordering is handled by including so-called block orientation. Starting point for the block-based translation model is a block set, e.g. about","million Arabic-English phrase pairs for the experiments in this paper. This block set is used to decode training sentence to obtain block orientation sequences that are used in the discriminative parameter training. Nothing but the block set and the parallel training data is used to carry out the training. We use the block set described in (Al-Onaizan et al., 2004), the use of a different block set may effect translation results. Rather than predicting local block neighbors as in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) , here the model parameters are trained in a global setting. Starting with a simple model, the training data is decoded multiple times: the weight vector","is trained to discriminate block sequences with a high translation score against block sequences with a high BLEU score 2",". The high BLEU scoring block sequences are obtained as follows: the regular phrase-based decoder is modified in a way that it uses the BLEU score as optimization criterion (independent of any translation model). Here, searching for the highest BLEU scoring block sequence is restricted to local re-ordering as is the model-based decoding (as shown in Fig. 1). The BLEU score is computed with respect to the single reference translation provided by the parallel training data. A block sequence with an average BLEU score of about","is obtained for each training sentence 3",". The ’true’ maximum BLEU block sequence as well as the high scoring","2","High scoring block sequences may contain translation errors that are quantified by a lower BLEU score.","3","The training BLEU score is computed for each training sentence pair separately (treating each sentence pair as a single-sentence corpus with a single reference) and then averaged over all training sentences. Although block sequences are found with a high BLEU score on average there is no guarantee to find the maximum BLEU block sequence for a given sentence pair. The target word sequence corresponding to a block sequence does not have to match the reference translation, i.e. maximum BLEU scores are quite low for some training sentences. 722 block ","sequences are represented by high dimensional feature vectors using the binary features defined below and the translation process is handled as a multi-class classification problem in which each block sequence represents a possible class. The effect of this training procedure can be seen in Figure 2: each decoding step on the training data adds a high-scoring block sequence to the discriminative training and decoding performance on the training data is improved after each iteration (along with the test data decoding performance). A theoretical justification for the novel training procedure is given in Section 3.","We now define the feature components for the block bigram feature vector   ","  ","","","in Eq. 1. Although the training algorithm can handle real-valued features as used in (Och, 2003; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) the current paper intentionally excludes them. The current feature functions are similar to those used in common phrase-based translation systems: for them it has been shown that good translation performance can be achieved 4 . A systematic analysis of the novel training algorithm will allow us to include much more sophisticated features in future experiments, i.e. POS-based features, syntactic or hierarchical features (Chiang, 2005). The dimensionality of the feature vector   ","  ","","","depends on the number of binary features.

Additionally, we use distortion features involving relative source word position and","-gram features for adjacent target words.

It is easy to see that if we can find a weight vector that approximates ",", then the decoding-rule in Eq. 2 automatically maximizes the BLEU score. However, it is usually difficult to estimate  reliably based only on a linear combination of the feature vector as in Eq. 1. We note that a good decoder does not necessarily employ a scoring function that approximates the BLEU score. Instead, we only need to make sure that the top-ranked block sequence obtained by the decoder scoring function has a high BLEU score. To formulate this idea, we attempt to find a decoding parameter such that for each sentence","in the training data, sequences in  with the highest BLEU","scores should get    scores higher than those","with low BLEU scores. Denote by ","a set of block sequences in ","with the highest BLEU scores. Our decoded result should lie in this set. We call them the “truth”.

We refer","to this formulation as ’costMargin’ (cost-sensitive","margin) method: for each training sentence","the ’costMargin’","","   ","    between the","’true’ block sequence set ","  and the ’alternative’ block sequence set ","is maximized. Note that due to the truth and alternative set up, we always have ",". This loss function gives an up-per bound of the error we will suffer if the order of  and  is wrongly predicted (that is, if we predict   instead of   ","). It also has the property that if for the BLEU scores  holds, then the loss value is small (proportional to ","). A major contribution of this work is a procedure to solve Eq. 3 approximately. The main difficulty is that the search space ","covered by the decoder can be extremely large. It cannot be enumerated for practical purposes. Our idea is to replace this large space by a small subspace      ","which we call relevant set. The possibility of this reduction is based on the following theoretical result.","Lemma 1 Let        ","be a non-negative con-","tinuous piece-wise differentiable function of",",","and let "," be a local solution of Eq. 3.

Each subspace ","   will be significantly","smaller than  ",". This is because it only includes those alternatives ","with score   ","close to one of the selected truth. These are the most important alternatives that are easily confused with the truth. Essentially the lemma says that if the decoder works well on these difficult alternatives (relevant points), then it works well on the whole space. The idea is closely related to active learning in standard classification problems, where we 724 Table 1: Generic Approximate Relevant Set Method for each data point","initialize truth ","  and alternative   ","for each decoding iteration :      ","for each data point","select relevant points","","   (*) update      ","   ","update by solving Eq. 5 approximately (**) selectively pick the most important samples (often based on estimation uncertainty) for labeling in order to maximize classification performance (Lewis and Catlett, 1994). In the active learning setting, as long as we do well on the actively selected samples, we do well on the whole sample space. In our case, as long as we do well on the relevant set, the decoder will perform well.","Since the relevant set depends on the decoder parameter",", and the decoder parameter is optimized on the relevant set, it is necessary to estimate them jointly using an iterative algorithm. The basic idea is to start with a decoding parameter",", and estimate the corresponding relevant set; we then update","based on the relevant set, and it-erate this process.

Moreover, the rate of convergence depends only on the property of the loss function, and not on the size of ",". This property is critical as it shows that as long as Eq. 6 can be computed efficiently, then the Approximate Relevant Set algorithm is efficient. Moreover, it gives a bound on the size of an approximate relevant set with a certain accuracy.5","5","Due to the space limitation, we will not include a for-The approximate solution of Eq. 5 in (**) can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), where we may simply update","as:  ","           The parameter ","","is a fixed constant often referred to as learning rate.

The training data comes from UN news sources. Some punctuation tokenization and some number classing are carried out on the English and the Arabic training data. We show translation results in terms of the automatic BLEU evaluation metric (Papineni et al., 2002) on the MT03 Arabic-English DARPA evaluation test set consisting of","sentences with","Arabic words with","reference translations. In order to speed up the parameter training the original training data is filtered according to the test set: all the Arabic substrings that occur in the test set are computed and the parallel training data is filtered to include only those training sentence pairs that contain at least one out of these phrases: the resulting pre-filtered training data contains about","thousand sentence pairs (","million Arabic words and","million English words). The block set is generated using a phrase-pair selection algorithm similar to (Koehn et al., 2003; Al-Onaizan et al., 2004), which includes some heuristic filtering to mal statement here. A detailed theoretical investigation of the method will be given in a journal paper. 725 increase ","phrase translation accuracy. Blocks that occur only once in the training data are included as well. 4.1 Practical Implementation Details The training algorithm in Table 2 is adapted from Table 1. The training is carried out by running  ","times over the parallel training data, each time decoding all the ","","training sentences","and generating a single block translation sequence","for each training sentence. The top five block se-","quences  ","with the highest BLEU score are computed up-front for all training sentence pairs  ","and are stored separately as described in Section 2. The score-based decoding of the training sentence pairs is carried out in parallel on ","-Bit Opteron machines. Here, the monotone decoding is much faster than the decoding with block swapping: the monotone decoding takes less than","hours and the decoding with swapping takes about an hour. Since the training starts with only the parallel training data and a block set, some initial block sequences have to be generated in order to initialize the global model training: for each input sentence a simple bag of blocks translation is generated. For each input interval that is matched by some block ",", a single block is added to the bag-of-blocks translation   ",". The order in which the blocks are generated is ignored. For this block set only block and word identity features are generated, i.e. features of type  and  ","in Section 2. This step does not require the use of a decoder. The initial block sequence training data contains only a single alternative. The training procedure proceeds by iteratively decoding the training data. After each decoding step, the resulting translation block sequences are stored on disc in binary format. A block sequence generated at decoding step  is used in all subsequent","training steps , where   ",". The block se-","quence training data after the","-th decoding step","is given as    ","  ","","  , where the","size  ","    of the relevant alternative set is  ","",". Although in order to achieve fast convergence with a theoretical guarantee, we should use Eq. 6 to update the relevant set, in reality, this idea is difficult to implement because it requires a more costly decoding step. Therefore in Table 2, we adopt an approximation, where the relevant set is updated by adding the decoder output at each stage. In this way, we are able to treat the decoding","Table 2: Relevant set method:","= number of decoding","iterations,","= number of training sentences.","for each input sentence  ","     ","initialize truth  ",""," and alternative","    ","  ","for each decoding iteration :      ","train using SGD on training","data  ","","  ","  ",""," ","for each input sentence  ","     ","select top-scoring sequence","",""," and update ","    ","  ","","   scheme as a black box. One way to approximate Eq. 6 is to generate multiple decoding outputs and pick the most relevant points based on Eq. 6. Since the","-best list generation is computationally costly, only a single block sequence is generated for each training sentence pair, reducing the memory requirements for the training algorithm as well. Although we are not able to rigorously prove fast convergence rate for this approximation, it works well in practice, as Figure 2 shows. Theoretically this is because points achieving large values in Eq. 6 tend to have higher chances to become the top-ranked decoder output as well. The SGD-based on-line training algorithm described in Section 3, is carried out after each decoding step to generate the weight vector","for the subsequent decoding step. Since this training step is carried out on a single machine, it dominates the overall computation time. Since each iteration adds a single relevant alternative to the set ","  ",", computation time increases with the number of training iterations: the initial model is trained in a few minutes, while training the model after the","-th iteration takes up to","hours for the most complex models.

While error-driven training techniques are commonly used to improve the performance of phrase-based translation systems (Chiang, 2005; Och, 2003), this paper presents a novel block sequence translation approach to SMT that is similar to sequential natural language annotation problems 727 such as part-of-speech tagging or shallow parsing, both in modeling and parameter training. Unlike earlier approaches to SMT training, which either rely heavily on domain knowledge, or can only handle a small number of features, this approach treats the decoding process as a black box, and can optimize tens millions of parameters automatically, which makes it applicable to other problems as well. The choice of our formulation is convex, which ensures that we are able to find the global optimum even for large scale problems. The loss function in Eq. 4 may not be optimal, and using different choices may lead to future improvements. Another important direction for performance improvement is to design methods that better approximate Eq. 6. Although at this stage the system performance is not yet better than previous approaches, good translation results are achieved on a standard translation task. While being similar to (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005), the current procedure is more automated with comparable performance. The latter approach requires a decomposition of the decoding scheme into local decision steps with the inherent difficulty acknowledged in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005). Since such limitation is not present in the current model, improved results may be obtained in the future. A perceptron-like algorithm that handles global features in the context of re-ranking is also presented in (Shen et al., 2004). The computational requirements for the training algorithm in Table 2 can be significantly reduced. While the global training approach presented in this paper is simple, after","iterations or so, the alternatives that are being added to the relevant set differ very little from each other, slowing down the training considerably such that the set of possible block translations ","might not be fully explored. As mentioned in Section 2, the current approach is still able to handle real-valued features, e.g. the language model probability. This is important since the language model can be trained on a much larger monolingual corpus."]},{"title":"6 Acknowledgment","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by the GALE project under the DARPA contract No. HR0011-06-2-0001.
