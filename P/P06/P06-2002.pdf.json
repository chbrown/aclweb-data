Because of the difficulty of collecting annotated data, several procedures have been described that can be trained on unannotated textual corpora (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland, 1999; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005). An interesting approach is that of rote extractors (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), which look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relationship between two concepts.","In this paper, we describe some contributions to the training of Rote extractors, including a procedure for generalizing the patterns, and a more complex way of calculating their accuracy. We first introduce the general structure of a rote extractor and its limitations. Next, we describe the proposed modifications (Sections 2, 3 and 4) and the evaluation performed (Section 5). 1.1 Rote extractors According to the traditional definition of rote extractors (Mann and Yarowsky, 2005), they estimate the probability of a relationship r(p, q) given the surrounding context A1pA2qA3. This is calculated, with a training corpus T , as the number of times that two related elements r(x, y) from T appear with that same context A1xA2yA3, divided by the total number of times that x appears in that context together with any other word: P (r(p, q)|A1pA2qA3) = P x,yεr c(A1xA2yA3) P x,z c(A1xA2zA3) (1)","x is called the hook, and y the target. In order","to train a Rote extractor from the web, this proce-","dure is usually followed (Ravichandran and Hovy,","2002):","1. Select a pair of related elements to be used as seed. For instance, (Dickens,1812) for the relationship birth year.","2. Submit the query Dickens AND 1812 to a search engine, and download a number of documents to build the training corpus.","3. Keep all the sentences containing both elements.","4. Extract the set of contexts between them and identify repeated patterns. This may just be the m characters to the left or to the right, (Brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).","5. Download a separate corpus, called hook corpus, containing just the hook (in the example, Dickens).","6. Apply the previous patterns to the hook corpus, calculate the precision of each pattern 9","in the following way: the number of times it","identifies a target related to the hook divided","by the total number of times the pattern ap-","pears. 7. Repeat the procedure for other examples of","the same relationship. To illustrate this process, let us suppose that we want to learn patterns to identify birth years. We may start with the pair (Dickens, 1812). From the downloaded corpus, we extract sentences such as","Dickens was born in 1812","Dickens (1812 - 1870) was an English writer","Dickens (1812 - 1870) wrote Oliver Twist The system identifies that the contexts of the last two sentences are very similar and chooses their longest common substring to produce the following patterns:","<hook> was born in <target>","<hook> ( <target> - 1870 ) In order to measure the precision of the extracted patterns, a new corpus is downloaded using the hook Dickens as the only query word, and the system looks for appearances of the patterns in the corpus. For every occurrence in which the hook of the relationship is Dickens, if the target is 1812 it will be deemed correct, and otherwise it will be deemed incorrect (e.g. in Dickens was born in Portsmouth). 1.2 Limitations and new proposal We have identified the following limitations in this algorithm: firstly, to our knowledge, no Rote extractor allows for the insertion of wildcards (e.g. *) in the extracted patterns. Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) have noted that this might be dangerous if the wildcard matches unrestrictedly incorrect sentences. However, we believe that the precision estimation that is performed at the last step of the algorithm, using the hook corpus, may be used to rule out the dangerous wildcards while keeping the useful ones.","Secondly, we believe that the procedure for calculating the precision of the patterns may be some-what unreliable in a few cases. For instance, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) report the following patterns for the relationships Inventor, Discoverer and Location:","Relation Prec. Pattern","Inventor 1.0 <target> ’s <hook> and","Inventor 1.0 that <target> ’s <hook>","Discoverer 0.91 of <target> ’s <hook>","Location 1.0 <target> ’s <hook> In this case, it can be seen that the same pattern (the genitive construction) may be used to indicate several different relationships, apart from the most common use indicating possession. However, they all receive very high precision values. The reason is that the patterns are only evaluated for the same hook for which they were extracted. Let us suppose that we obtain the pattern for Location using the pairs (New York, Chrysler Building). The genitive construction can be extracted from the context New York’s Chrysler Building. Afterward, when evaluating it, only sentences containing <target>’s Chrysler Building are taken into account, which makes it unlikely that the pattern is expressing a relationship other than Location, so the pattern will receive a high precision value.","For our purposes, however, we need to collect patterns for several relations such as writer-book, painter-picture, director-film, actor-film, and we want to make sure that the obtained patterns are only applicable to the desired relationship. Patterns like <target> ’s <hook> are very likely to be applicable to all of these relationships at the same time, so we would like to be able to discard them automatically.","Hence, we propose the following improvements for a Rote extractor:","• A new pattern generalization procedure that","allows the inclusion of wildcards in the pat-","terns.","• The combination with Named Entity recogni-","tion, so people, locations, organizations and","dates are replaced by their entity type in the","patterns, in order to increase their degree of","generality. This is in line with Mann and","Yarowsky (2003)’s modification, consisting","in replacing all numbers in the patterns with","the symbol ####.","• A new precision calculation procedure, in a","way that the patterns obtained for a given re-","lationship are evaluated on the corpus for dif-","ferent relationships, in order to improve the","detection of over-general patterns."]},{"title":"2 Proposed pattern generalization procedure","paragraphs":["To begin with, for every appearance of a pair of concepts, we extract a context around them. Next, those contexts are generalized to obtain the parts that are shared by several of them. The procedure is detailed in the following subsections. 10 Birth year: BOS/BOS <hook> (/( <target> -/- number/entity )/) EOS/EOS BOS/BOS <hook> (/( <target> -/- number/entity )/) British/JJ writer/NN BOS/BOS <hook> was/VBD born/VBN on/IN the/DT first/JJ of/IN time expr/entity ,/, <target> ,/, at/IN location/entity ,/, of/IN BOS/BOS <hook> (/( <target> -/- )/) a/DT web/NN guide/NN Birth place: BOS/BOS <hook> was/VBD born/VBN in/IN <target> ,/, in/IN central/JJ location/entity ,/, BOS/BOS <hook> was/VBD born/VBN in/IN <target> date/entity and/CC moved/VBD to/TO location/entity BOS/BOS Artist/NN :/, <hook> -/- <target> ,/, location/entity (/( number/entity -/- BOS/BOS <hook> ,/, born/VBN in/IN <target> on/IN date/entity ,/, worked/VBN as/IN Author-book: BOS/BOS <hook> author/NN of/IN <target> EOS/EOS BOS/BOS Odysseus/NNP :/, Based/VBN on/IN <target> ,/, <hook> ’s/POS epic/NN from/IN Greek/JJ mythology/NN BOS/BOS Background/NN on/IN <target> by/IN <hook> EOS/EOS did/VBD the/DT circumstances/NNS in/IN which/WDT <hook> wrote/VBD \"/’’ <target> \"/’’ in/IN number/entity ,/, and/CC Capital-country: BOS/BOS <hook> is/VBZ the/DT capital/NN of/IN <target> location/entity ,/, location/entity correct/JJ time/NN BOS/BOS The/DT harbor/NN in/IN <hook> ,/, the/DT capital/NN of/IN <target> ,/, is/VBZ number/entity of/IN location/entity BOS/BOS <hook> ,/, <target> EOS/EOS BOS/BOS <hook> ,/, <target> -/- organization/entity EOS/EOS Figure 1: Example patterns extracted from the training corpus for each several kinds of relationships. 2.1 Context extraction procedure After selecting the sentences for each pair of related words in the training set, these are processed with a part-of-speech tagger and a module for Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) that annotates people, organizations, locations, dates, relative temporal expressions and numbers. Afterward, a context around the two words in the pair is extracted, including (a) at most five words to the left of the first word; (b) all the words in between the pair words; (c) at most five words to the right of the second word. The context never jumps over sentence boundaries, which are marked with the symbols BOS (Beginning of sentence) and EOS (End of sentence). The two related concepts are marked as <hook> and <target>. Figure 1 shows several example contexts extracted for the relationships birth year, birth place, writer-book and capital-country.","Furthermore, for each of the entities in the relationship, the system also stores in a separate file the way in which they are annotated in the training corpus: the sequences of part-of-speech tags of every appearance, and the entity type (if marked as such). So, for instance, typical PoS sequences for names of authors are “NNP”1","(surname) and “NNP NNP” (first name and surname). A typical entity kind for an author is person. 2.2 Generalization pseudocode In order to identify the portions in common between the patterns, and to generalize them, we apply the following pseudocode (Ruiz-Casado et al., in press):","1","All the PoS examples in this paper are done with Penn Treebank labels (Marcus et al., 1993). 1. Store all the patterns in a set P. 2. Initialize a set R as an empty set. 3. While P is not empty,","(a) For each possible pair of patterns, cal-","culate the distance between them (de-","scribed in Section 2.3).","(b) Take the two patterns with the smallest","distance, pi and pj.","(c) Remove them from P, and add them to","R.","(d) Obtain the generalization of both, pg","(Section 2.4).","(e) If pg does not have a wildcard adjacent","to the hook or the target, add it to P. 4. Return R At the end, R contains all the initial patterns","and those obtained while generalizing the previous","ones. The motivation for step (e) is that, if a pat-","tern contains a wildcard adjacent to either the hook","or the target, it will be impossible to know where","it starts or ends. For instance, when applying the","pattern <hook> wrote * <target> to a text, the","wildcard prevents the system from guessing where","the title of the book starts. 2.3 Edit distance calculation So as to calculate the similarity between two patterns, a slightly modified version of the dynamic programming algorithm for edit-distance calculation (Wagner and Fischer, 1974) is used. The distance between two patterns A and B is defined as the minimum number of changes (insertion, addi-tion or replacement) that have to be done to the first one in order to obtain the second one.","The calculation is carried on by filling a matrix M, as shown in Figure 2 (left). At the same 11 A: wrote the well known novel B: wrote the classic novel M 0 1 2 3 4 D 0 1 2 3 4 0 0 1 2 3 4 0 I I I I 1 1 0 1 2 3 1 R E I I I 2 2 1 0 1 2 2 R R E I I 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 R R R U I 4 4 3 2 2 2 4 R R R R U 5 5 4 3 3 2 5 R R R R E Figure 2: Example of the edit distance algorithm. A and B are two word patterns; M is the matrix in which the edit distance is calculated, and D is the matrix indicating the choice that produced the minimal distance for each cell in M. time that we calculate the edit distance matrix, it is possible to fill in another matrix D, in which we record which of the choices was selected at each step: insertion, deletion, replacement or no edition. This will be used later to obtain the generalized pattern. We have used the following four characters:","• I means that it is necessary to insert a token","in the first pattern to obtain the second one.","• R means that it is necessary to remove a to-","ken.","• E means that the corresponding tokens are","equal, so no edition is required.","• U means that the corresponding tokens are","unequal, so a replacement has to be done.","Figure 2 shows an example for two patterns, A and B, containing respectively 5 and 4 tokens. M(5, 4) has the value 2, indicating the distance between the two complete patterns. For in-stance, the two editions would be replacing well by classic and removing known. 2.4 Obtaining the generalized pattern","After calculating the edit distance between two","patterns A and B, we can use matrix D to obtain","a generalized pattern, which should maintain the","common tokens shared by them. The procedure","used is the following: • Every time there is an insertion or a deletion,","the generalized pattern will contain a wild-","card, indicating that there may be anything in","between. • Every time there is replacement, the general-","ized pattern will contain a disjunction of both","tokens. • Finally, in the positions where there is no edit","operation, the token that is shared between","the two patterns is left unchanged. The patterns in the example will produced the","generalized pattern Wrote the well known novel Wrote the classic novel","———————————","Wrote the well|classic * novel","The generalization of these two patterns produces one that can match a wide variety of sentences, so we should always take care in order not to over-generalize.","2.5 Considering part-of-speech tags and Named Entities If we consider the result in the previous example, we can see that the disjunction has been made between an adverb and an adjective, while the other adjective has been deleted. A more natural result, with the same number of editing operations as the previous one, would have been to delete the adverb to obtain the following generalization: Wrote the well known novel Wrote the classic novel","———————————","Wrote the * known|classic novel","This is done taking into account part-of-speech tags in the generalization process. In this way, the edit distance has been modified so that a replacement operation can only be done between words of the same part-of-speech. 2","Furthermore, replacements are given an edit distance of 0. This favors the choice of replacements with respect to deletions and insertions. To illustrate this point, the distance between known|classic/JJ and old/JJ","2","Note that, although our tagger produces the very detailed PennTreebank labels, we consider that all nouns (NN, NNS, NNP and NNPS) belong to the same part-of-speech class, and the same for adjectives, verbs and adverbs. 12 Hook Birth Death Birth place Author of Director of Capital of Charles Dickens 1812 1870 Portsmouth {Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield...} None None Woody Allen 1935 None Brooklin None {Bananas, Annie Hall, Manhattan, ... } None Luanda None None None None None Angola Table 1: Example rows in the input table for the system. will be set to 0, because both tokens are adjectives. In other words, the d function is redefined as: d(A[i], B[j]) = ( 0 if P oS(A[i]) = P oS(B[j]) 1 otherwise (2)","Note that all the entities identified by the NERC module will appear with a PoS tag of entity, so it is possible to have a disjunction such as location|organization/entity in a generalized pattern (See Figure 1)."]},{"title":"3 Proposed pattern scoring procedure","paragraphs":["As indicated above, if we measure the precision of the patterns using a hook corpus-based approach, the score may be inadvertently increased because they are only evaluated using the same terms with which they were extracted. The approach proposed herein is to take advantage of the fact that we are obtaining patterns for several relationships. Thus, the hook corpora for some of the patterns can be used also to identify errors done by other patterns.","The input of the system now is not just a list of related pairs, but a table including several relationships for the same entities. We may consider it as mini-biographies as in Mann and Yarowsky (2005)’s system. Table 1 shows a few rows in the input table for the system. The cells for which no data is provided have a default value of None, which means that anything extracted for that cell will be considered as incorrect.","Although this table can be written by hand, in our experiments we have chosen to build it automatically from the lists of related pairs. The system receives the seed pairs for the relationships, and mixes the information from all of them in a single table. In this way, if Dickens appears in the seed list for the birth year, death year, birth place and writer-book relationships, four of the cells in its row will be filled in with values, and all the rest will be set to None. This is probably a","very strict evaluation, because, for all the cells for","which there was no value in any of the lists, any re-","sult obtained will be judged as incorrect. However,","the advantage is that we can study the behavior of","the system working with incomplete data. The new procedure for calculating the patterns’","precisions is as follows: 1.

For each pair in each seed list, a corpus with 500 documents has been collected using Google, from which the patterns are extracted. Table 2 shows the number of patterns obtained. It is interesting to see that for some relations, such as birth-year or birth-place, more than one thousand patterns have been reduced to a few. Table 3 shows the patterns obtained for the relationship birth-year. It can also be seen that some of the patterns with good precision contain the wildcard *, which helped extract the correct birth year in roughly 50 occasions.

This is because in other test corpora (e.g. in the one containing soccer players and clubs) it is more frequent to find the name of a person followed by a number that is not his/her birth year, while that did not happen so often in the birth year test corpus.","For evaluating the patterns, a new test corpus has been collected for fourteen entities not present in the training corpora, again using Google. The chosen entities are Robert de Niro and Natalie Wood (actors), Isaac Asimov and Alfred Bester (writers), Montevideo and Yaounde (capitals), Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Hosni Mubarak (country presidents), Bernardo Bertolucci and Federico Fellini (directors), Peter Paul Rubens and Paul Gauguin (painters), and Jens Lehmann and Thierry Henry (soccer players). Table 4 shows the results obtained for each relationship.","We have observed that, for those relationships in which the target does not belong to a Named 14 Entity type, it is common for the patterns to extract additional words together with the right target. For example, rather than extracting The Last Emperor, the patterns may extract this title together with its rating or its length, the title between quotes, or phrases such as The classic The Last Emperor. In the second column in the table, we measured the percentage of times that a correct answer appears inside the extracted target, so these examples would be considered correct. We call this metric inclusion precision. 5.1 Comparison to related approaches Although the above results are not comparable to Mann and Yarowsky (2005), as the corpora used are different, in most cases the precision is equal or higher to that reported there. On the other hand, we have rerun Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)’s algorithm on our corpus. In order to assure a fair comparison, their algorithm has been slightly modified so it also takes into account the part-of-speech sequences and entity types while extracting the hooks and the targets during the rule application. So, for instance, the relationship birth date is only extracted between a hook tagged as a person and a target tagged as either a date or a number. The results are shown in Table 5. As can be seen, our procedure seems to perform better for all of the relations except birth place. It is interesting to note that, as could be expected, for those targets for which there is no entity type defined (films, books and pictures), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)’s extracts many errors, because it is not possible to apply the Named Entity Recognizer to clean up the results, and the accuracy remains below 10%. On the other hand, that trend does not seem to affect our system, which had very poor results for painter-picture, but reasonably good for actor-film.","Other interesting case is that of birth places. A manual observation of our generalized patterns shows that they often contain disjunctions of verbs such as that in (1), that detects not just the birth place but also places where the person lived. In this case, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002)’s patterns resulted more precise as they do not contain disjunctions or wildcards.

From the mid-nineties, there are systems that learn extraction patterns from partially annotated and unannotated data (Huffman, 1995; Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Soderland, 1999).","Generalizing textual patterns (both manually and automatically) for the identification of relationships has been proposed since the early nineties (Hearst, 1992), and it has been applied to extending ontologies with hyperonymy and holonymy relationships (Kietz et al., 2000; Cimiano et al., 2004; Berland and Charniak, 1999), with overall precision varying between 0.39 and 0.68.
