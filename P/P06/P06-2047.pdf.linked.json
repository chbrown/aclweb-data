The scored DG has preference scores attached to the arcs and is widely used as a basis of the optimum tree search method. For example, the scored DG is used in Japanese Kakari-uke analysis1 to represent all possible kakari-uke(dependency) trees(Ozeki, 1994),(Hirakawa, 2001). (McDonald et al., 2005) proposed a dependency analysis method using a scored DG and some maximum spanning tree search algorithms.

This paper classifies these methods based on the types of the DGs and the basic well-formed constraints and explains the features of the DF adopted in PDG(Hirakawa, 2006).

As shown below, the combination of the DF and the graph branch algorithm enables the treatment of non-projective dependency analysis and optimum solution search satisfying the single valence occupation constraint, which are out of the scope of most of the DP(dynamic programming)- based parsing methods."]},{"title":"2 Optimum Tree Search in a Scored DG 2.1 Basic Framework","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows the basic framework of the optimum dependency tree search in a scored DG.

The well-formed dependency tree constraint is a set of well-formed constraints which should be satisfied by all dependency trees representing sentence interpretations. A DG and a well-formed dependency tree constraint prescribe a set of well-formed dependency trees. The score of a dependency tree is the sum total of arc scores. The optimum tree is a dependency tree with the highest score in the set of dependency trees. 2.2 Dependency Graph DGs are classified into some classes based on the types of nodes and arcs. This paper assumes three types of nodes, i.e. word-type, WPP-type2","and concept-type3",". The types of DGs are called a word DG, a WPP DG and a concept DG, respectively. DGs are also classified into non-labeled and labeled DGs. There are some types of arc labels such as syntactic label (ex. “subject”,“object”) and semantic label (ex. “agent”,“target”). Various types of DGs are used in existing systems according to these classifications, such as non-label word DG(Lee and Choi, 1997; Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005)4",", syntactic-label word DG (Maruyama, 1990), semantic-label word DG(Hirakawa, 2001), non-label WPP DG(Ozeki, 1994; Katoh and Ehara, 1989), syntactic-label WPP DG(Wang and Harper, 2004), semantic-label concept DG(Harada and Mizuno, 2001).","2.3 Well-formedness Constraints and Graph Search Algorithms There can be a variety of well-formedness constraints from very basic and language-independent constraints to specific and language-dependent constraints. This paper focuses on the following four basic and language-independent constraints which may be embedded in data structure and/or the optimum tree search algorithm.","(C1) Coverage constraint: Every input word has a corresponding node in the tree","(C2) Single role constraint(SRC): No two nodes in a dependency tree occupy the same input position 2 WPP is a pair of a word and a part of speech (POS). The","word “time” has WPPs such as “time/n” and “time/v”. 3 One WPP (ex. “time/n”) can be categorized into one or","more concepts semantically (ex. “time/n/period time” and","“time/n/clock time”). 4 This does not mean that these algorithms can not handle","labeled DGs.","(C3) Projectivity constraint(PJC): No arc crosses another arc5","(C4) Single valence occupation constraint(SVOC): No two arcs in a tree occupy the same valence of a predicate (C1) and (C2), collectively referred to as “covering constraint”, are basic constraints adopted by almost all dependency parsers. (C3) is adopted by the majority of dependency parsers which are called projective dependency parsers. A projective dependency parser fails to analyze non-projective sentences. (C4) is a basic constraint for valency but is not adopted by the majority of dependency parsers.","Graph search algorithms, such as the Chu-Liu-Edmonds maximum spanning tree algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967), algorithms based on the dynamic programming (DP) principle (Ozeki, 1994; Eisner, 1996) and the algorithm based on the B&B method (Hirakawa, 2001), are used for the optimum tree search in scored DGs. The applicability of these algorithms is closely related to the types of DGs and/or well-formedness constraints. The Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm is very fast (","","","","","for sentence length","), but it works correctly only on word DGs. DP-based algorithms can satisfy (C1)-(C3) and run efficiently, but seems not to satisfy (C4) as shown in 2.4.","(C2)-(C4) can be described as a set of co-occurrence constraints between two arcs in a DG. As described in Section 2.6, the DF can represent (C2)-(C4) and more precise constraints because it can handle co-occurrence constraints between two arbitrary arcs in a DG. The graph branch algorithm described in Section 3 can find the optimum tree from the DF. 2.4 SVOC and DP (Ozeki and Zhang, 1999) proposed the minimum cost partitioning method (MCPM) which is a partitioning computation based on the recurrence equa-tion where the cost of joining two partitions is the cost of these partitions plus the cost of combining these partitions. MCPM is a generalization of (Ozeki, 1994) and (Katoh and Ehara, 1989) which compute the optimum dependency tree in a scored DG.

The optimum tree search algorithm searches for the optimum tree satisfying the well-formed constraints (C1)-(C4) in a SDG(Hirakawa, 2001). This method is lack-ing in terms of generality in that it cannot handle backward dependency and multiple WPP because it depends on some linguistic features peculiar to Japanese. Therefore, this method is inherently in-applicable to languages like English that require backward dependency and multiple POS analysis.","The DF described below can be seen as the extension of the SDG. Since the DF has none of the language-dependent premises that the SDG has, it is applicable to English and other languages. 2.6 Dependency Forest (DF) The DF is a packed shared data structure encompassing all possible dependency trees for a sentence adopted in PDG. The DF consists of a dependency graph (DG) and a constraint matrix (CM). Figure 3 shows a DF for the example sentence “Time flies like an arrow.” The DG consists of nodes and directed arcs. A node represents a WPP and an arc shows the dependency relation between nodes. An arc has its ID and preference score. CM is a matrix whose rows and columns are a set of arcs in DG and prescribes the co-occurrence constraint between arcs. Only when CM(i,j) is !{,","","","and","","","are co-occurrable in one dependency tree.","The DF is generated by using a phrase structure parser in PDG. PDG grammar rule is an extended CFG rule, which defines the mapping between a sequence of constituents (the body of a CFG rule) and a set of arcs (a partial dependency tree). 363 The generated CM assures that the parse trees in the parse forest and the dependency trees in the DF have mutual correspondence(Hirakawa, 2006). CM can represent (C2)-(C4) in 2.3 and more precise constraints. For example, PDG can generate a DF encompassing non-projective dependency trees by introducing the grammar rules defining non-projective constructions. This is called the controlled non-projectivity in this paper. Treatment of non-projectivity as described in (Kanahe et al., 1998; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) is an important topic out of the scope of this paper."]},{"title":"3 The Optimum Tree Search in DF","paragraphs":["This section shows the graph branch algorithm based on the B&B principle, which searches for the optimum well-formed tree in a DF by apply-ing problem expansions called graph branching. 3.1 Outline of B&B Method The B&B method(Ibaraki, 1978) is a principle for solving computationally hard problems such as NP-complete problems. The basic strategy is that the original problem is decomposed into easier partial-problems (branching) and the original problem is solved by solving them. Pruning called a bound operation is applied if it turns out that the optimum solution to a partial-problem is inferior to the solution obtained from some other partial-problem (dominance test)7",", or if it turns out that a partial-problem gives no optimum solutions to the original problem (maximum value test). Usually, the B&B algorithm is constructed to minimize the value of the solution. The graph branch algorithm in this paper is constructed to maximize the score of the solution because the best solution is the maximum tree in the DF. 3.2 Graph Branch Algorithm The graph branch algorithm is obtained by defining the components of the original B&B skeleton algorithm, i.e. the partial-problem, the feasible solution, the lower bound value, the upper bound value, the branch operation, and so on(Ibaraki, 1978). Figure 4 shows the graph branch algorithm which has been extended from the original B&B skeleton algorithm to search for all the optimum trees in a DF.

The preference score source, i.e. the WPP frequencies and the dependency relation frequencies are obtained from the closed data. The basic PDG grammar (907 extended CFG rules) is used for generating the DFs for the open data.","The expanded problem number (EPN), a principal computational amount factor of the B&B method, is adopted as the base metric. The following three metrics are used in this experiment.","(a) EPN in total (EPN-T): The number of the expanded problems which are generated in the entire search process.","(b) EPN for the first optimum solution (EPN-F): The number of the expanded problems when the first optimum solution is obtained.","(c) EPN for the last optimum solution (EPN-L): The number of the expanded problems when the last optimum solution is obtained. At this point, all optimum solutions are obtained. Optimum solution number (OSN) for a problem, i.e. the number of optimum dependency trees in a given DF, gives the lower bound value for all these metrics because one problem generates at most one solution. The minimum value of OSN is 1 because every DF has at least one dependency tree. As the search process proceeds, the algorithm finds the first optimum solution, then the last optimum solution, and finally terminates the process by confirming no better solution is left. There-fore, the three metrics and OSN have the relation OSN","EPN-F","EPN-L","EPN-T. Average values for these are described as Ave:OSN, Ave:EPN-F, Ave:EPN-L and Ave:EPN-T. 5.2 Experimental Results An evaluation experiment for the open data is performed using a prototype PDG system implemented in Prolog. The sentences containing more than 22 words are neglected due to the limita-tion of Prolog system resources in the parsing process. 4334 sentences out of the remaining 6882 test sentences are parsable. Unparsable sentences (2584 sentences) are simply neglected in this experiment.

Figure 7 shows averages of EPN-T, EPN-L, EPN-F and OSN with respect to sentence length. Over-all averages of EPN-T, EPN-L, EPN-F and OSN for the test sentences are 3.0, 1.67, 1.43 and 1.15. The result shows that the average number of problems required is relatively small. The gap between Ave:EPN-T and Ave:EPN-L (3.0-1.67=1.33) is much greater than the gap between Ave:EPN-L and Ave:OSN(1.67-1.15=0.52). This means that the major part of the computation is performed only for checking if the obtained feasible solutions are optimum or not.","According to (Hirakawa, 2001), the experiment on the B&B-based algorithm for the SDG shows the overall averages of AVE:EPN-T, AVE:EPN-F are 2.91, 1.33 and the average CPU time is 305.8ms (on EWS). These values are close to those in the experiment based on the graph branch algorithm. Two experiments show a tendency for the optimum solution to be obtained in the early stage of the search process. The graph branch algorithm is expected to obtain the comparable performance with the SDG search algorithm.","(Hirakawa, 2001) introduced the improved upper bound function g’(P) into the B&B-based algorithm for the SDG and found Ave:EPN-T is reduced from 2.91 to 1.82. The same technique is introduced to the graph branch algorithm and has obtained the reduction of the Ave:EPN-T from 3.00 to 2.68.","The tendency for the optimum solution to be obtained in the early stage of the search process suggests that limiting the number of problems to expand is an effective pruning strategy.

This kind of ratio is called an achievement ratio (AR) in this paper. From Figure 8, the ARs for EPN-T, EPN-L, EPN-F (plotted in solid lines) are 97.1%,99.6%,99.8% respectively at the EPN 10. The dotted line shows the AR for EPN-T of the improved algorithm using g’(P). The use of g’(P) increases the AR for EPN-T from 97.1% to 99.1% at the EPN 10. However, the effect of g’(P) is quite small for EPN-F and EPN-L. This result shows that the pruning strategy based on the EPN is effective and g’(P) works for the reduction of the problems generated in the posterior part of the search processes."]},{"title":"6 Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["This paper has described the graph branch algorithm for obtaining the optimum solution for a DF used in PDG. The well-formedness dependency tree constraints are represented by the constraint matrix of the DF, which has flexible and precise description ability so that controlled non-projectivity is available in PDG framework. The graph branch algorithm assures the search for the optimum trees with arbitrary arc co-occurrence constraints, including the SVOC which has not been treated in DP-based algorithms so far. The experimental result shows the averages of EPN-T, EPN-L and EPN-F for English test sentences are 3.0, 1.67 and 1.43, respectively. The practical code implementation of the graph branch algorithm and its performance evaluation are subjects for future work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Y. J. Chu and T. H. Liu. 1965.
