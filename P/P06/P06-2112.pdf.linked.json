Many researchers build alignment links with bilingual corpora (Wu, 1997; Och and Ney, 2003; Cherry and Lin, 2003; Zhang and Gildea, 2005). In order to achieve satisfactory results, all of these methods require a large-scale bilingual corpus for training. When the large-scale bilingual corpus is unavailable, some researchers acquired class-based alignment rules with existing dictionaries to improve word alignment (Ker and Chang, 1997). Wu et al. (2005) used a large-scale bilingual corpus in general domain to improve domain-specific word alignment when only a small-scale domain-specific bilingual corpus is available.","This paper proposes an approach to improve word alignment for languages with scarce resources using bilingual corpora of other language pairs. To perform word alignment between languages L1 and L2, we introduce a third language L3 as the pivot language. Although only small amounts of bilingual data are available for the desired language pair L1-L2, large-scale bilingual corpora in L1-L3 and L2-L3 are available. Using these two additional bilingual corpora, we train two word alignment models for language pairs L1-L3 and L2-L3, respectively. And then, with L3 as a pivot language, we can build a word alignment model for L1 and L2 based on the above two models. Here, we call this model an induced model. With this induced model, we perform word alignment between languages L1 and L2 even if no parallel corpus is available for this language pair. In addition, using the small bilingual corpus in L1 and L2, we train another word alignment model for this language pair. Here, we call this model an original model. An interpolated model can be built by interpolating the induced model and the original model.","As a case study, this paper uses English as the pivot language to improve word alignment between Chinese and Japanese. Experimental results show that the induced model performs better than the original model trained on the small Chinese-Japanese corpus. And the interpolated model further improves the word alignment results, achieving a relative error rate reduction of 874 21.30% as compared with results produced by the original model.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work. Section 3 introduces the statistical word alignment models. Section 4 describes the parameter estimation method using bilingual corpora of other language pairs. Section 5 presents the interpolation model. Section 6 reports the experimental results. Finally, we conclude and present the future work in section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["A shared task on word alignment was organized as part of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (Martin et al., 2005). The focus of the task was on languages with scarce resources. Two different subtasks were defined: Limited resources and Unlimited resources. The former subtask only allows participating systems to use the resources provided. The latter subtask allows participating systems to use any resources in addition to those provided.","For the subtask of unlimited resources, Aswani and Gaizauskas (2005) used a multi-feature approach for many-to-many word alignment on English-Hindi parallel corpora. This approach performed local word grouping on Hindi sentences and used other methods such as dictionary lookup, transliteration similarity, expected English words, and nearest aligned neighbors. Martin et al. (2005) reported that this method resulted in absolute improvements of up to 20% as compared with the case of only using limited resources. Tufis et al. (2005) combined two word aligners: one is based on the limited resources and the other is based on the unlimited resources. The unlimited resource consists of a translation dictionary extracted from the alignment of Romanian and English WordNet. Lopez and Resnik (2005) extended the HMM model by integrating a tree distortion model based on a dependency parser built on the English side of the parallel corpus. The latter two methods produced comparable results with those methods using limited resources. All the above three methods use some language dependent resources such as dictionary, thesaurus, and dependency parser. And some methods, such as transliteration similarity, can only be used for very similar language pairs.","In this paper, besides the limited resources for the given language pair, we make use of large amounts of resources available for other language pairs to address the alignment problem for languages with scarce resources. Our method does not need language-dependent resources or deep linguistic processing. Thus, it is easy to adapt to any language pair where a pivot language and corresponding large-scale bilingual corpora are available."]},{"title":"3 Statistical Word Alignment","paragraphs":["According to the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), the statistical word alignment model can be generally represented as in equation (1)."]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["= a' c|f,a' c|fa, c|fa, ) Pr( ) Pr( ) Pr(  (1) Where, and ","represent the source sentence and the target sentence, respectivelyc f","1",".

The parameters are usually estimated by using bilingual sentence pairs in the desired languages, namely Chinese and Japanese here.

We introduce English as the pivot language, and use the Chinese-English and English-Japanese bilingual corpora to estimate the parameters of the Chinese-Japanese word alignment model. With these two corpora, we first build Chinese-English and English-Japanese word alignment models as described in section 3. Then, based on these two models, we estimate the parameters of Chinese-Japanese word alignment model.

This approach can build a word alignment model for the desired language pair even if no bilingual corpus is available in this language pair. Experimental results indicate a relative error reduction of 10.41% as compared with the method using the small bilingual corpus.","In addition, we interpolated the above model with the model trained on the small L1-L2 bilingual corpus to further improve word alignment between L1 and L2. This interpolated model further improved the word alignment results by achieving a relative error rate reduction of 12.51% as compared with the method using the two corpora in L1-L3 and L3-L2, and a relative error rate reduction of 21.30% as compared with the method using the small bilingual corpus in L1 and L2.","In future work, we will perform more evaluations. First, we will further investigate the effect of the size of corpora on the alignment results. Second, we will investigate different parameter combination of the induced model and the original model. Third, we will also investigate how simpler IBM models 1 and 2 perform, in comparison with IBM models 3 and 4. Last, we will evaluate the word alignment results in a real machine translation system, to examine whether lower word alignment error rate will result in higher translation accuracy."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Yaser Al-Onaizan, Jan Curin, Michael Jahr, Kevin Knight, John Lafferty, Dan Melamed, Franz-Josef Och, David Purdy, Noah A.
