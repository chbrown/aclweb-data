To translate SMS texts, traditional approaches model such irregularities directly in Machine Translation (MT). However, such approaches suffer from customization problem as tremendous effort is required to adapt the language model of the existing translation system to handle SMS text style. We offer an alternative approach to resolve such irregularities by normalizing SMS texts before MT. In this paper, we view the task of SMS normalization as a translation problem from the SMS language to the English language 1","and we propose to adapt a phrase-based statistical MT model for the task. Evaluation by 5-fold cross validation on a parallel SMS normalized corpus of 5000 sentences shows that our method can achieve 0.80702 in BLEU score against the baseline BLEU score 0.6958. Another experiment of translating SMS texts from English to Chinese on a separate SMS text corpus shows that, using SMS normalization as MT preprocessing can largely boost SMS translation performance from 0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score."]},{"title":"1 Motivation","paragraphs":["SMS translation is a mobile Machine Translation (MT) application that translates a message from one language to another. Though there exists many commercial MT systems, direct use of such systems fails to work well due to the special phenomena in SMS texts, e.g. the unique relaxed and creative writing style and the frequent use of unconventional and not yet standardized short-forms. Direct modeling of these special phenomena in MT requires tremendous effort. Alternatively, we can normalize SMS texts into  1 This paper only discusses English SMS text normalization. grammatical texts before MT. In this way, the traditional MT is treated as a “black-box” with little or minimal adaptation. One advantage of this pre-translation normalization is that the diversity in different user groups and domains can be modeled separately without accessing and adapting the language model of the MT system for each SMS application. Another advantage is that the normalization module can be easily util-ized by other applications, such as SMS to voicemail and SMS-based information query.","In this paper, we present a phrase-based statistical model for SMS text normalization. The normalization is visualized as a translation problem where messages in the SMS language are to be translated to normal English using a similar phrase-based statistical MT method (Koehn et al., 2003). We use IBM’s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the performance of SMS text normalization. BLEU score computes the similarity between two sentences using n-gram statistics, which is widely-used in MT evalua-tion. A set of parallel SMS messages, consisting of 5000 raw (un-normalized) SMS messages and their manually normalized references, is constructed for training and testing. Evaluation by 5-fold cross validation on this corpus shows that our method can achieve accuracy of 0.80702 in BLEU score compared to the baseline system of 0.6985. We also study the impact of our SMS text normalization on the task of SMS translation. The experiment of translating SMS texts from English to Chinese on a corpus comprising 402 SMS texts shows that, SMS normalization as a preprocessing step of MT can boost the translation performance from 0.1926 to 0.3770 in BLEU score.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 summarizes the characteristics of English SMS texts. Section 4 discusses our method and Section 5 reports our experiments. Section 6 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["There is little work reported on SMS normalization and translation. Bangalore et al. (2002) used 33 a consensus translation technique to bootstrap parallel data using off-the-shelf translation systems for training a hierarchical statistical translation model for general domain instant messaging used in Internet chat rooms. Their method deals with the special phenomena of the instant messaging language (rather than the SMS language) in each individual MT system. Clark (2003) proposed to unify the process of tokenization, segmentation and spelling correction for normalization of general noisy text (rather than SMS or instant messaging texts) based on a noisy channel model at the character level. However, results of the normalization are not reported. Aw et al. (2005) gave a brief description on their input pre-processing work for an English-to-Chinese SMS translation system using a word-group model. In addition, in most of the commercial SMS translation applications 2",", SMS lingo (i.e., SMS short form) dictionary is provided to replace SMS short-forms with normal English words. Most of the systems do not handle OOV (out-of-vocabulary) items and ambiguous inputs. Following compares SMS text normalization with other similar or related applications.","2.1 SMS Normalization versus General Text Normalization General text normalization deals with Non-Standard Words (NSWs) and has been well-studied in text-to-speech (Sproat et al., 2001) while SMS normalization deals with Non-Words (NSs) or lingoes and has seldom been studied before. NSWs, such as digit sequences, acronyms, mixed case words (WinNT, SunOS), abbreviations and so on, are grammatically correct in linguistics. However lingoes, such as “b4” (before) and “bf” (boyfriend), which are usually selfcreated and only accepted by young SMS users, are not yet formalized in linguistics. Therefore, the special phenomena in SMS texts impose a big challenge to SMS normalization.","2.2 SMS Normalization versus Spelling Correction Problem Intuitively, many would regard SMS normalization as a spelling correction problem where the lingoes are erroneous words or non-words to be replaced by English words. Researches on spelling correction centralize on typographic and cognitive/orthographic errors (Kukich, 1992) and use approaches (M.D. Kernighan, Church and  2 http://www.etranslator.ro and http://www.transl8bit.com Gale, 1991) that mostly model the edit operations using distance measures (Damerau 1964; Levenshtein 1966), specific word set confusions (Golding and Roth, 1999) and pronunciation modeling (Brill and Moore, 2000; Toutanova and Moore, 2002). These models are mostly character-based or string-based without considering the context. In addition, the author might not be aware of the errors in the word introduced during the edit operations, as most errors are due to mistype of characters near to each other on the keyboard or homophones, such as “poor” or “pour”.","In SMS, errors are not isolated within word and are usually not surrounded by clean context. Words are altered deliberately to reflect sender’s distinct creation and idiosyncrasies. A character can be deleted on purpose, such as “wat” (what) and “hv” (have). It also consists of short-forms such as “b4” (before), “bf” (boyfriend). In addi-tion, normalizing SMS text might require the context to be spanned over more than one lexical unit such as “lemme” (let me), “ur” (you are) etc. Therefore, the models used in spelling correction are inadequate for providing a complete solution for SMS normalization.","2.3 SMS Normalization versus Text Para-phrasing Problem Others may regard SMS normalization as a paraphrasing problem. Broadly speaking, paraphrases capture core aspects of variability in language, by representing equivalencies between different expressions that correspond to the same meaning. In most of the recent works (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata, 2002), they are acquired (semi-) automatically from large comparable or parallel corpora using lexical and morpho-syntactic information.","Text paraphrasing works on clean texts in which contextual and lexical-syntactic features can be extracted and used to find “approximate conceptual equivalence”. In SMS normalization, we are dealing with non-words and “ungrammatically” sentences with the purpose to normalize or standardize these words and form better sentences. The SMS normalization problem is thus different from text paraphrasing. On the other hand, it bears some similarities with MT as we are trying to “convert” text from one language to another. However, it is a simpler problem as most of the time; we can find the same word in both the source and target text, making alignment easier."," 34"]},{"title":"3 Characteristics of English SMS","paragraphs":["Our corpus consists of 55,000 messages collected from two sources, a SMS chat room and correspondences between university students. The content is mostly related to football matches, making friends and casual conversations on “how, what and where about”. We summarize the text behaviors into two categories as below. 3.1 Orthographic Variation The most significant orthographic variant in SMS texts is in the use of non-standard, selfcreated short-forms. Usually, sender takes advantage of phonetic spellings, initial letters or number homophones to mimic spoken conversation or shorten words or phrases (hw vs. homework or how, b4 vs. before, cu vs. see you, 2u vs. to you, oic vs. oh I see, etc.) in the attempt to minimize key strokes. In addition, senders create a new form of written representation to express their oral utterances. Emotions, such as “:(“ symbolizing sad, “:)” symbolizing smiling, “:()” symbolizing shocked, are representations of body language. Verbal effects such as “hehe” for laughter and emphatic discourse particles such as “lor”, “lah”, “meh” for colloquial English are prevalent in the text collection.","The loss of “alpha-case” information posts an-other challenge in lexical disambiguation and introduces difficulty in identifying sentence boundaries, proper nouns, and acronyms. With the flexible use of punctuation or not using punctuation at all, translation of SMS messages without prior processing is even more difficult. 3.2 Grammar Variation SMS messages are short, concise and convey much information within the limited space quota (160 letters for English), thus they tend to be implicit and influenced by pragmatic and situation reasons. These inadequacies of language expression such as deletion of articles and subject pronoun, as well as problems in number agreements or tenses make SMS normalization more challenging. Table 1 illustrates some orthographic and grammar variations of SMS texts. 3.3 Corpus Statistics We investigate the corpus to assess the feasibility of replacing the lingoes with normal English words and performing limited adjustment to the text structure. Similarly to Aw et al. (2005), we focus on the three major cases of transformation as shown in the corpus: (1) replacement of OOV words and non-standard SMS lingoes; (2) removal of slang and (3) insertion of auxiliary or copula verb and subject pronoun.

Moreover, we also want the normalization to have better lexical affinity and linguistic equivalent, thus we extend the model to allow many words to many words alignment, allowing a sequence of SMS words to be normalized to a sequence of contiguous English words. We call this updated model a phrase-based normalization model. normalization with a total of 2300 transformations. Substitution accounts for almost 86% of all transformations. Deletion and substitution make up the rest.

For evaluation, we use IBM’s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the performance of the SMS normalization.

Finally we carry out the 3rd","experiment using dictionary look-up plus bi-gram LM. Only a slight improvement of 0.0128 (0.7086-0.6958) is obtained. This is largely because the English words in the lingo dictionary are mostly highfrequency and commonly-used. Thus bi-gram does not show much more discriminative ability than unigram without the help of the phrase-based lexical mapping model.","Experimental result analysis reveals that the strength of our model is in its ability to disambiguate mapping as in “2” to “two” or “to” and “w” to “with” or “who”. Error analysis shows that the challenge of the model lies in the proper insertion of subject pronoun and auxiliary or copula verb, which serves to give further semantic information about the main verb, however this requires significant context understanding. For example, a message such as “u smart” gives little clues on whether it should be normalized to “Are you smart?” or “You are smart.” unless the full conversation is studied.  Takako w r u?
