Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004).","Supervised methods for relation extraction perform well on the ACE Data, but they require a large amount of manually labeled relation instances. Unsupervised methods do not need the definition of relation types and manually labeled data, but they cannot detect relations between entity pairs and its result cannot be directly used in many NLP tasks since there is no relation type label attached to each instance in clustering result. Considering both the availability of a large amount of untagged corpora and direct usage of extracted relations, semi-supervised learning methods has received great at-tention.","DIPRE (Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Expansion) (Brin, 1998) is a bootstrapping-based system that used a pattern matching system as classifier to exploit the duality between sets of patterns and relations. Snowball (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) is another system that used bootstrapping techniques for extracting relations from unstructured text. Snowball shares much in common with DIPRE, including the employment of the bootstrapping framework as well as the use of pattern matching to extract new candidate relations. The third system approaches relation classification problem with bootstrapping on top of SVM, proposed by Zhang (2004). This system focuses on the ACE sub-problem, RDC, and extracts various lexical and syntactic features for the classification task. However, Zhang (2004)’s method doesn’t actually “detect” relaitons but only performs relation classification between two entities given that they are known to be related.","Bootstrapping works by iteratively classifying unlabeled examples and adding confidently classified examples into labeled data using a model learned from augmented labeled data in previous iteration. It 129 can be found that the affinity information among unlabeled examples is not fully explored in this bootstrapping process.","Recently a promising family of semi-supervised learning algorithm is introduced, which can effectively combine unlabeled data with labeled data in learning process by exploiting manifold structure (cluster structure) in data (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Blum et al., 2004; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003). These graph-based semi-supervised methods usually define a graph where the nodes represent labeled and unlabeled examples in a dataset, and edges (may be weighted) reflect the similarity of examples. Then one wants a labeling function to satisfy two constraints at the same time: 1) it should be close to the given labels on the labeled nodes, and 2) it should be smooth on the whole graph. This can be expressed in a regularization framework where the first term is a loss function, and the second term is a regularizer. These methods differ from traditional semi-supervised learning methods in that they use graph structure to smooth the labeling function.","To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done on using graph based semi-supervised learning algorithms for relation extraction. Here we investigate a label propagation algorithm (LP) (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) for relation extraction task. This algorithm works by representing labeled and unlabeled examples as vertices in a connected graph, then propagating the label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges iteratively, finally inferring the labels of unlabeled examples after the propagation process converges. In this paper we focus on the ACE RDC task1",".","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 formulates relation extraction problem in the context of semi-supervised learning and describes our proposed approach. Then we provide experimental results of our proposed method and compare with a popular supervised learning algorithm (SVM) and bootstrapping algorithm in Section 4. Finally we conclude our work in section 5.","1","http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/ACE/, Three tasks of ACE program: Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT), Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC), and Event Detection and Characterization (EDC)"]},{"title":"2 The Proposed Method 2.1 Problem Definition","paragraphs":["The problem of relation extraction is to assign an appropriate relation type to an occurrence of two entity pairs in a given context. It can be represented as follows: R → (Cpre, e1, Cmid, e2, Cpost) (1) where e1 and e2 denote the entity mentions, and Cpre,Cmid,and Cpost are the contexts before, between and after the entity mention pairs. In this paper, we set the mid-context window as the words between the two entity mentions and the pre- and post-context as up to two words before and after the corresponding entity mention.","Let X = {xi}n","i=1 be a set of contexts of occurrences of all the entity mention pairs, where xi represents the contexts of the i-th occurrence, and n is the total number of occurrences. The first l examples (or contexts) are labeled as yg ( yg ∈ {rj}R","j=1, rj denotes relation type and R is the total number of relation types). The remaining u(u = n − l) examples are unlabeled.","Intuitively, if two occurrences of entity mention pairs have the similarity context, they tend to hold the same relation type. Based on the assumption, we define a graph where the vertices represent the contexts of labeled and unlabeled occurrences of entity mention pairs, and the edge between any two vertices xi and xj is weighted so that the closer the vertices in some distance measure, the larger the weight associated with this edge. Hence, the weights are defined as follows: Wij = exp(− s2 ij α2 ) (2) where sij is the similarity between xi and xj calculated by some similarity measures, e.g., cosine similarity, and α is used to scale the weights. In this paper, we set α as the average similarity between labeled examples from different classes. 2.2 A Label Propagation Algorithm In the LP algorithm, the label information of any vertex in a graph is propagated to nearby vertices through weighted edges until a global stable stage is achieved. Larger edge weights allow labels to travel 130 through easier. Thus the closer the examples are, the more likely they have similar labels.","We define soft label as a vector that is a probabilistic distribution over all the classes. In the label propagation process, the soft label of each initial labeled example is clamped in each iteration to replenish label sources from these labeled data. Thus the labeled data act like sources to push out labels through unlabeled data. With this push from labeled examples, the class boundaries will be pushed through edges with large weights and settle in gaps along edges with small weights. Hopefully, the values of Wij across different classes would be as small as possible and the values of Wij within the same class would be as large as possible. This will make label propagation to stay within the same class. This label propagation process will make the labeling function smooth on the graph.","Define an n × n probabilistic transition matrix T Tij = P (j → i) = wij","∑n k=1 wkj (3) where Tij is the probability to jump from vertex xj to vertex xi. We define a n × R label matrix Y , where Yij representing the probabilities of vertex yi to have the label rj.","Then the label propagation algorithm consists the following main steps: Step1 : Initialization","• Set the iteration index t = 0;","• Let Y 0","be the initial soft labels attached to each vertex, where Y 0","ij = 1 if yi is label rj","and 0 otherwise.","• Let Y 0 L be the top l rows of Y 0","and Y 0","U be the remaining u rows. Y 0","L is consistent with the labeling in labeled data and the initialization of Y 0","U can be arbitrary.","Step 2 : Propagate the labels of any vertex to nearby vertices by Y t+1","= T Y t",", where T is the row-normalized matrix of T , i.e. Tij = Tij/ ∑","k Tik, which can maintain the","class probability interpretation.","Step 3 : Clamp the labeled data, that is, replace the","top l row of Y t+1","with Y 0","L . Step 4 : Repeat from step 2 until Y converges.","Step 5 : Assign xh(l + 1 ≤ h ≤ n) with a label: yh = argmaxjYhj.","The above algorithm can ensure that the labeled data YL never changes since it is clamped in Step 3. Actually we are interested in only YU . This algorithm has been shown to converge to a unique solution ŶU = limt→∞ Y t","U = (I − T̄uu)−1 T̄ulY 0","L (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002). Here, T̄uu and T̄ul are acquired by splitting matrix T̄ after the l-th row and the l-th column into 4 sub-matrices. And I is u × u identity matrix. We can see that the initialization of Y 0 U in this solution is not important, since Y 0","U does not affect the estimation of ŶU ."]},{"title":"3 Experiments and Results 3.1 Feature Set","paragraphs":["Following (Zhang, 2004), we used lexical and syntactic features in the contexts of entity pairs, which are extracted and computed from the parse trees derived from Charniak Parser (Charniak, 1999) and the Chunklink script 2","written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University.","Words: Surface tokens of the two entities and words in the three contexts.","Entity Type: the entity type of both entity mentions, which can be PERSON, ORGANIZA-TION, FACILITY, LOCATION and GPE.","POS features: Part-Of-Speech tags corresponding to all tokens in the two entities and words in the three contexts.","Chunking features: This category of features are extracted from the chunklink representation, which includes:","• Chunk tag information of the two entities and words in the three contexts. The “0” tag means that the word is not in any chunk. The “I-XP” tag means that this word is inside an XP chunk. The “B-XP” by default means that the word is at the beginning of an XP chunk.","• Grammatical function of the two entities and words in the three contexts. The","2","Software available at http://ilk.uvt.nl/∼sabine/chunklink/ 131 last word in each chunk is its head, and the function of the head is the function of the whole chunk. “NP-SBJ” means a NP chunk as the subject of the sentence. The other words in a chunk that are not the head have “NOFUNC” as their function.","• IOB-chains of the heads of the two entities. So-called IOB-chain, noting the syntactic categories of all the constituents on the path from the root node to this leaf node of tree.","The position information is also specified in the description of each feature above. For example, word features with position information include:","1) WE1 (WE2): all words in e1 (e2)","2) WHE1 (WHE2): head word of e1 (e2)","3) WMNULL: no words in Cmid","4) WMFL: the only word in Cmid","5) WMF, WML, WM2, WM3, ...: first word, last word, second word, third word, ...in Cmid when at least two words in Cmid","6) WEL1, WEL2, ...: first word, second word, ... before e1","7) WER1, WER2, ...: first word, second word, ... after e2 We combine the above lexical and syntactic features with their position information in the contexts to form context vectors. Before that, we filter out low frequency features which appeared only once in the dataset. 3.2 Similarity Measures The similarity sij between two occurrences of entity pairs is important to the performance of the LP algorithm. In this paper, we investigated two similarity measures, cosine similarity measure and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991). Cosine similarity is commonly used semantic distance, which measures the angle between two feature vectors. JS divergence has ever been used as distance measure for document clustering, which outperforms cosine similarity based document clustering (Slonim et al., 2002). JS divergence measures the distance between two probability distributions if feature vector is considered as probability distribution over features. JS divergence is defined as follows:","Table 1: Frequency of Relation SubTypes in the ACE training","and devtest corpus.","Type SubType Training Devtest","ROLE General-Staff 550 149 Management 677 122 Citizen-Of 127 24 Founder 11 5 Owner 146 15 Affiliate-Partner 111 15 Member 460 145 Client 67 13 Other 15 7","PART Part-Of 490 103 Subsidiary 85 19 Other 2 1","AT Located 975 192 Based-In 187 64 Residence 154 54","SOC Other-Professional 195 25 Other-Personal 60 10 Parent 68 24 Spouse 21 4 Associate 49 7 Other-Relative 23 10 Sibling 7 4 GrandParent 6 1","NEAR Relative-Location 88 32 JS(q, r) = 1 2 [DKL(q∥p̄) + DKL(r∥p̄)] (4) DKL(q∥p̄) = ∑ y q(y)(log q(y) p̄(y) ) (5) DKL(r∥p̄) = ∑ y r(y)(log r(y) p̄(y) ) (6)","where p̄ = 1","2 (q + r) and J S(q, r) represents JS divergence between probability distribution q(y) and r(y) (y is a random variable), which is defined in terms of KL-divergence. 3.3 Experimental Evaluation 3.3.1 Experiment Setup","We evaluated this label propagation based relation extraction method for relation subtype detection and characterization task on the official ACE 2003 corpus.

Therefore they can not perform well, since the classification hyperplane was learned only from few labeled data and the coherent structure in unlabeled data was not explored when inferring class boundary.
