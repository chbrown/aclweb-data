In statistical machine translation, word alignment plays a crucial role as word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related knowledge.","Various methods have been proposed for finding word alignments between parallel texts. There are generally two categories of alignment approaches: statistical approaches and heuristic approaches. Statistical approaches, which depend on a set of unknown parameters that are learned from training data, try to describe the relationship between a bilingual sentence pair (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel and Ney, 1996). Heuristic approaches obtain word alignments by using various similarity functions between the types of the two languages (Smadja et al., 1996; Ker and Chang, 1997; Melamed, 2000). The central distinction between statistical and heuristic approaches is that statistical approaches are based on well-founded probabilistic models while heuristic ones are not. Studies reveal that statistical alignment models outperform the simple Dice coefficient (Och and Ney, 2003).","Finding word alignments between parallel texts, however, is still far from a trivial work due to the diversity of natural languages. For example, the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing content or function words is problematic. When two languages widely differ in word order, finding word alignments is especially hard. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate all useful linguistic information to alleviate these problems.","Tiedemann (2003) introduced a word alignment approach based on combination of association clues. Clues combination is done by disjunction of single clues, which are defined as probabilities of associations. The crucial assumption of clue combination that clues are independent of each other, however, is not always true. Och and Ney (2003) proposed Model 6, a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM model. Although Model 6 yields better results than naive IBM models, it fails to include dependencies other than IBM models and HMM model. Cherry and Lin (2003) developed a 459 statistical model to find word alignments, which allow easy integration of context-specific features.","Log-linear models, which are very suitable to incorporate additional dependencies, have been successfully applied to statistical machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002). In this paper, we present a framework for word alignment based on log-linear models, allowing statistical models to be easily extended by incorporating additional syntactic dependencies. We use IBM Model 3 alignment probabilities, POS correspondence, and bilingual dictionary coverage as features. Our experiments show that log-linear models significantly outperform IBM translation models.","We begin by describing log-linear models for word alignment. The design of feature functions is discussed then. Next, we present the training method and the search algorithm for log-linear models. We will follow with our experimental results and conclusion and close with a discussion of possible future directions."]},{"title":"2 Log-linear Models","paragraphs":["Formally, we use following definition for alignment. Given a source (’English’) sentence e = eI","1 = e1, . . . , ei, . . . , eI and a target language (’French’) sentence f = f J","1 = f1, . . . , fj, . . . , fJ . We define a link l = (i, j) to exist if ei and fj are translation (or part of a translation) of one another. We define the null link l = (i, 0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation for any French word in f . The null link l = (0, j) is defined similarly. An alignment a is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of the word positions: a ⊆ {(i, j) : i = 0, . . . , I; j = 0, . . . , J } (1) We define the alignment problem as finding the alignment a that maximizes P r(a |e, f ) given e and f .","We directly model the probability P r(a |e, f ). An especially well-founded framework is maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996). In this framework, we have a set of M feature functions hm(a, e, f ), m = 1, . . . , M . For each feature function, there exists a model parameter λm, m = 1, . . . , M . The direct alignment probability is given by: P r(a|e, f ) =","exp[∑M m=1 λmhm(a, e, f )]","∑","a′ exp[∑M","m=1 λmhm(a′",", e, f )]","(2)","This approach has been suggested by (Papineni et","al., 1997) for a natural language understanding task","and successfully applied to statistical machine trans-","lation by (Och and Ney, 2002).","We obtain the following decision rule:","â = argmax a { M∑ m=1 λmhm(a, e, f )} (3)","Typically, the source language sentence e and the target sentence f are the fundamental knowledge sources for the task of finding word alignments. Linguistic data, which can be used to identify associations between lexical items are often ignored by traditional word alignment approaches. Linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, namedentity recognizers have become more and more robust and available for many languages by now. It is important to make use of linguistic information to improve alignment strategies. Treated as feature functions, syntactic dependencies can be easily in-corporated into log-linear models.","In order to incorporate a new dependency which contains extra information other than the bilingual sentence pair, we modify Eq.2 by adding a new variable v: P r(a|e, f , v) =","exp[∑M m=1 λmhm(a, e, f , v)]","∑","a′ exp[∑M m=1 λmhm(a′",", e, f , v)]","(4) Accordingly, we get a new decision rule:","â = argmax a { M∑ m=1 λmhm(a, e, f , v)} (5)","Note that our log-linear models are different from Model 6 proposed by Och and Ney (2003), which defines the alignment problem as finding the alignment a that maximizes P r(f , a |e) given e."]},{"title":"3 Feature Functions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we use IBM translation Model 3 as the base feature of our log-linear models. In addition, we also make use of syntactic information such as part-of-speech tags and bilingual dictionaries. 460 3.1 IBM Translation Models Brown et al. (1993) proposed a series of statistical models of the translation process. IBM translation models try to model the translation probability P r(f J","1 |eI","1), which describes the relationship between a source language sentence eI","1 and a target","language sentence f J 1 . In statistical alignment models P r(f J","1 , aJ","1 |eI","1), a ’hidden’ alignment a = aJ","1 is introduced, which describes a mapping from a target position j to a source position i = aj. The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by:","P r(f J 1 |eI","1) = ∑ aJ 1","P r(f J","1 , aJ","1 |eI","1) (6)","Although IBM models are considered more coherent than heuristic models, they have two drawbacks. First, IBM models are restricted in a way such that each target word fj is assigned to exactly one source word eaj . A more general way is to model alignment as an arbitrary relation between source and target language positions. Second, IBM models are typically language-independent and may fail to tackle problems occurred due to specific languages.","In this paper, we use Model 3 as our base feature function, which is given by 1",":","h(a, e, f ) = P r(f J","1 , aJ","1 |eI","1) = ( m − φ0","φ0 )","p0m−2φ0 p 1 φ0 l∏ i=1 φi!n(φi|ei) × m∏ j=1 t(fj|eaj )d(j|aj, l, m) (7)","We distinguish between two translation directions to use Model 3 as feature functions: treating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa. 3.2 POS Tags Transition Model The first linguistic information we adopt other than the source language sentence e and the target language sentence f is part-of-speech tags. The use of POS information for improving statistical alignment quality of the HMM-based model is described","1","If there is a target word which is assigned to more than one source words, h(a, e, f ) = 0. in (Toutanova et al., 2002). They introduce additional lexicon probability for POS tags in both languages.","In IBM models as well as HMM models, when one needs the model to take new information into account, one must create an extended model which can base its parameters on the previous model. In log-linear models, however, new information can be easily incorporated.","We use a POS Tags Transition Model as a feature function. This feature learns POS Tags transition probabilities from held-out data (via simple counting) and then applies the learned distributions to the ranking of various word alignments. We define eT = eT I","1 = eT1, . . . , eTi, . . . , eTI and fT = f T J","1 = f T1, . . . , f Tj, . . . , f TJ as POS tag sequences of the sentence pair e and f . POS Tags Transition Model is formally described as: P r(fT|a, eT) = ∏ a t(f Ta(j)|eTa(i)) (8) where a is an element of a, a(i) is the corresponding source position of a and a(j) is the target position.","Hence, the feature function is: h(a, e, f , eT, fT) = ∏ a t(f Ta(j)|eTa(i)) (9)","We still distinguish between two translation directions to use POS tags Transition Model as feature functions: treating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa. 3.3 Bilingual Dictionary A conventional bilingual dictionary can be considered an additional knowledge source. We could use a feature that counts how many entries of a conventional lexicon co-occur in a given alignment between the source sentence and the target sentence. Therefore, the weight for the provided conventional dictionary can be learned. The intuition is that the conventional dictionary is expected to be more reliable than the automatically trained lexicon and therefore should get a larger weight.","We define a bilingual dictionary as a set of entries: D = {(e, f, conf )}. e is a source language word, f is a target langauge word, and conf is a positive real-valued number (usually, conf = 1.0) assigned 461 by lexicographers to evaluate the validity of the entry. Therefore, the feature function using a bilingual dictionary is: h(a, e, f , D) = ∑ a occur(ea(i), fa(j), D) (10) where occur(e, f, D) = { conf if (e, f ) occurs in D 0 else (11)"]},{"title":"4 Training","paragraphs":["We use the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) to train the model parameters λM","1 of the log-linear models according to Eq. 4. By applying suitable transformations, the GIS algorithm is able to handle any type of real-valued features. In practice, We use YASMET 2 written by Franz J. Och for performing training.","The renormalization needed in Eq. 4 requires a sum over a large number of possible alignments. If e has length l and f has length m, there are possible 2lm","alignments between e and f (Brown et al., 1993). It is unrealistic to enumerate all possible alignments when lm is very large. Hence, we approximate this sum by sampling the space of all possible alignments by a large set of highly proba-ble alignments. The set of considered alignments are also called n-best list of alignments.","We train model parameters on a development corpus, which consists of hundreds of manually-aligned bilingual sentence pairs. Using an n-best approximation may result in the problem that the parameters trained with the GIS algorithm yield worse alignments even on the development corpus. This can happen because with the modified model scaling factors the n-best list can change significantly and can include alignments that have not been taken into account in training. To avoid this problem, we iteratively combine n-best lists to train model parameters until the resulting n-best list does not change, as suggested by Och (2002). However, as this training procedure is based on maximum likelihood criterion, there is only a loose relation to the final alignment quality on unseen bilingual texts. In practice, 2 Available at http://www.fjoch.com/YASMET.html having a series of model parameters when the itera-tion ends, we select the model parameters that yield best alignments on the development corpus.","After the bilingual sentences in the development corpus are tokenized (or segmented) and POS tagged, they can be used to train POS tags transition probabilities by counting relative frequencies: p(f T |eT ) =","NA(f T, eT ) N (eT ) Here, NA(f T, eT ) is the frequency that the POS tag f T is aligned to POS tag eT and N (eT ) is the frequency of eT in the development corpus."]},{"title":"5 Search","paragraphs":["We use a greedy search algorithm to search the alignment with highest probability in the space of all possible alignments. A state in this space is a partial alignment. A transition is defined as the addition of a single link to the current state. Our start state is the empty alignment, where all words in e and f are assigned to null. A terminal state is a state in which no more links can be added to increase the probability of the current alignment. Our task is to find the terminal state with the highest probability.","We can compute gain, which is a heuristic function, instead of probability for efficiency. A gain is defined as follows: gain(a, l) =","exp[∑M m=1 λmhm(a ∪ l, e, f )]","exp[∑M m=1 λmhm(a, e, f )] (12) where l = (i, j) is a link added to a.","The greedy search algorithm for general log-linear models is formally described as follows: Input: e, f , eT, fT, and D Output: a 1.
