In those parsers, the strong conditional independence as-sumption made in vanilla treebank PCFGs is weakened by annotating non-terminal symbols with many ‘features’ (Goodman, 1997; Johnson, 1998). Examples of such features are head words of constituents, labels of ancestor and sibling nodes, and subcategorization frames of lexical heads. Effective features and their good combinations are normally explored using trial-and-error.","This paper defines a generative model of parse trees that we call PCFG with latent annotations (PCFG-LA). This model is an extension of PCFG models in which non-terminal symbols are annotated with latent variables. The latent variables work just like the features attached to non-terminal symbols. A fine-grained PCFG is automatically induced from parsed corpora by training a PCFG-LA model using an EM-algorithm, which replaces the manual feature selection used in previous research.","The main focus of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the automatically trained models in parsing. Because exact inference with a PCFG-LA, i.e., selection of the most probable parse, is NP-hard, we are forced to use some approximation of it. We empirically compared three different approximation methods. One of the three methods gives a performance of 86.6% (F",", sentences","40 words) on the standard test set of the Penn WSJ corpus.","Utsuro et al. (1996) proposed a method that automatically selects a proper level of generalization of non-terminal symbols of a PCFG, but they did not report the results of parsing with the obtained PCFG. Henderson’s parsing model (Henderson, 2003) has a similar motivation as ours in that a derivation history of a parse tree is compactly represented by induced hidden variables (hidden layer activation of a neural network), although the details of his approach is quite different from ours."]},{"title":"2 Probabilistic model","paragraphs":["PCFG-LA is a generative probabilistic model of parse trees.

The rest of this section describes three different approximations, which are empirically compared in the next section. The first method simply limits the number of candidate parse trees compared in Eq. 4; we first create N-best parses using a PCFG and then, within the N-best parses, select the one with the highest probability in terms of the PCFG-LA.
