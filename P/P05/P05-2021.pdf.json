In this paper, we tackle the problem of vocabulary selection, language modeling and pruning for inective languages. We show that by explicit reduction of out of vocabulary rate we can achieve signicant improvements in recognition accuracy while almost preserving the model size. Reported results are on Czech speech corpora."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition of inective languages is a challenging task for mainly two reasons. Rich morphology generates huge number of forms which are not captured by limited-size dictionaries, and therefore leads to worse recognition results. Relatively free word order admits enormous number of word sequences and thus impoverishes","-gram language models. In this paper we are concerned with the former issue.","Previous work which deals with excessive vocabulary growth goes mainly in two lines. Authors have either decided to break words into sub-word units or to adapt dictionaries in a multi-pass scenario. On Czech data, (Byrne et al., 2001) suggest to use linguistically motivated recognition units. Words are broken down to stems and endings and used as the recognition units in the rst recognition phase. In the second phase, stems and endings are concatenated. On Serbo-Croatian, (Geutner et al., 1998) also tested morphemes as the recognition units. Both groups of authors agreed that this approach is not benecial for speech recognition of inective languages. Vocabulary adaptation, however, brought considerable improvement. Both (Icring and Psutka, 2001) on Czech and (Geutner et al., 1998) on Serbo-Croatian reported substantial reduction of word error rate. Both authors followed the same procedure. In the rst pass, they used a dictionary composed of the most frequent words. Generated lattices were then processed to get a list of all words which appeared in them. This list served as a basis for a new adapted dictionary into which morphological variants were added.","It can be concluded that large corpora contain a host of words which are ignored during estimation of language models used in rst pass, despite the fact that these rare words can bring substantial improvement. Therefore, it is desirable to explore how to in-corporate rare or even unseen words into a language model which can be used in a rst pass."]},{"title":"2 Language Model","paragraphs":["Language models used in a rst pass of current speech recognition systems are usually built in the following way. First, a text corpus is acquired. In case of broadcast news, a newspaper collection or news transcriptions are a good source. Second, most frequent words are picked out to form a dictionary. Dictionary size is typically in tens of thousand words. For English, for example, dictionaries of size 121 of 60k words sufciently cover common domains. (Of course, for recognition of entries listed in the Yellow pages, such limited dictionaries are clearly inappropriate.) Third, an","-gram language model is estimated. In case of Katz back-off model, the conditional bigram word probability is estimated as"," ","   ",""," if","","  ",""," "," ","  ","otherwise (1) where  represents a smoothed probability distribution,  stands for the back-off weight, and  denotes the count of its argument. Back-off model can be also nicely viewed as a nite state automaton as depicted in Figure 1.","    "," ","","  ","   Figure 1: A fragment of a bigram back-off model represented as a nite-state automaton.","To alleviate the problem of a high OOV, we suggest to gather supplementary words and add them into the model in the following way."," ","","","   ","","","","","  (2)  refers to the regular back-off model, ","denotes the regular dictionary from which the back-off model was estimated, ","is the supplementary dictionary which does not overlap with ",".","Several sources can be exploited to obtain supplementary dictionaries. Morphology tools can derive words which are close to those observed in corpus. In such a case, ","can be set as a constant function and estimated on held-out data to maximize recognition accuracy.","  ",""," for  ","generated by morphology","(3) Having prior domain knowledge, new words which are expected to appear in audio recordings might be collected and added into  . Consider an example of transcribing an ice-hockey tournament. Names of new players are desirably in the vocabulary. An-other source of ","are the words which fell below the selection threshold of ",". In large corpora, there are hundreds of thousands words which are omitted from the estimated language model. We suggest to put them into ",". As it turned out, unigram probability of these words is very low, so it is suitable to increase their score to make them competitive with other words in  during recognition.","   is then computed as  shift  (4) where  refers to the relative frequency of ","in a given corpus, shift denotes a shifting factor which should be tuned on some held-out data.","    ","   ","  ","","","","","","","","",""," Figure 2: A fragment of a bigram back-off model injected by a supplementary dictionary","Note that the probability of a word given its history is no longer proper probability. It does not adds up to one. We decided not to normalize the model for two reasons. First, we used a decoder which searches for the best path using Viterbi criterion, so there’s no need for normalization. Second, normalization would have involved recomputing all back-off model weights and could also enforce re-tuning of the language model scaling factor. To rule out any variation which the re-tuning of the scaling factor could bring, we decided not to normalize the new model.","In nite-state representation, injection of a new dictionary was implemented as depicted in Figure 2. Supplementary words form a loop in the back-off state. 122"]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["We have evaluated our approach on two corpora, Czech Broadcast News and the Czech portion of MALACH data. 3.1 Czech Broadcast News Data The Czech Broadcast News (Radov·a et al., 2004) is a collection of both radio and TV news in Czech. Weather forecast, trafc announcements and sport news were excluded from this corpus. Our training portion comprises 22 hours of speech. To tune the language model scaling factor and additional LM parameters, we set aside 100 sentences. The test set consists of 2500 sentences.","We used the HTK toolkit (Young et al., 1999) to extract acoustic features from sampled signal and to estimate acoustic models. As acoustic features we used 12 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefcients plus energy and delta and delta-delta features. We trained a triphone acoustic model with tied mixtures of continuous density Gaussians.","As a LM training corpus we exploited a collection of newspaper articles from the Lidov·e Noviny (LN) newspaper. This collection was published as a part of the Prague Dependency Treebank by LDC (Hajic et al., 2001). This corpus contains 33 million tokens. Its vocabulary contains more than 650k word forms. OOV rates are displayed in Table 1. Dict. size OOV 60k 8.27% 80k 6.92% 124k 5.20% 371k 2.23% 658k 1.63% Table 1: OOV rate of transcriptions of the test data. Dictionaries contain the most frequent words.","As can be readily observed, moderate-size vocabularies don’t sufciently cover the test data transcriptions. Therefore they are one of the major sources of poor recognition performance.","The baseline language model was estimated from 60k most frequent words. It was a bigram Katz back-off model with Knesser-Ney smoothing pruned by the entropy-based method (Stolcke, 1998).","As the supplementary dictionary we took the rest of words from the LN corpus. To learn the impact of injection of infrequent words, we carried out two experiments.","First, we built a uniform loop which was injected into the back-off model. The uniform distribution was tuned on the held-out data. Tuning of this constant is displayed in Table 2. Uniform scale WER 12 18.89% 11 18.68% 10 18.40% 9 21.00% Table 2: Tuning of uniform distribution on the held-out set. WER denotes the word error rate.","Second, we took relative frequencies multiplied by a shift coefcient as the injected model scores. This shift coefcient was again tuned on held-out data as shown in Table 3. Unigram shift WER no shift 19.52% ","18.54% ","17.91% ","18.75% Table 3: Tuning of the shift coefcient of unigram model on the held-out set.","Then, we took the best parameters and used them for recognition of the test data. Recognition results are depicted in Figure 4. The injection of supplementary words helped decrease both recognition word error rate and oracle word error rate. By oracle WER is meant WER of the path, stored in the generated lattice, which best matches the utterance regardless the scores. In other words, oracle WER gives us a bound on how well can we get by tuning scores in a given lattice. Injection of shifted unigram model brought relative improvement of 13.6% in terms of WER over the 60k baseline model. Uniform injection brought also signicant improvement despite its simplicity. Indeed, we observed more than 10% relative improvement in terms of WER. In terms of oracle WER, unigram injection brought more than 30% relative improvement. 123 Model WER OWER Baseline 60k 29.17% 15.90% Baseline 80k 27.44% 14.31% 60k + Uniform injection 26.12% 11.10% 60k + Unigram injection 25.21% 11.03% Table 4: Evaluation on 2500 test sentences. OWER stands for the oracle error rate.","It’s worthwhile to mention the model size, since it could be argued that the improvement was achieved by an enormous increase of the model. We decided to measure the model size using two factors. The disk space occupied by the language model and the disk space taken up by the so-called CLG. By CLG we mean a transducer which maps triphones to words augmented with the model scores. This transducer represents the search space investigated during recognition. More details on transducers in speech recognition can be found in (Mohri et al., 2002). Table 5 summarizes the sizes of the evaluated models. Model CLG size G size Baseline 60k 399MB 106MB 60k + Uniform 405MB 115MB 60k + Unigram 405MB 115MB Baseline 80k 441MB 116MB Table 5: Model size comparison measured in disk space. G denotes a language model compiled as a nite-state automaton. CLG denotes transducer mapping triphones to words augmented with model scores.","Injection of supplementary words increased the model size only slightly. To see the difference in the size of injected models and traditionally built ones, we constructed a model of 80k most frequent words and pruned with the same threshold as the 60k LM. Not only did this 80k model give worse recognition results, but it also proved to be bigger. 3.2 MALACH Data The next data we tested our approach on was the Czech portion of the MALACH corpus (http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/research/malach). MALACH is a multilingual audio-visual corpus. It contains recordings of survivors of World War II talking about war events. 600 people spoke in Czech, but only 350 recordings had been digitized till end of 2003. The interviewer and the interviewee had separate microphones, and were recorded on separate stereo channels. Recordings were stored in the MPEG-1 format. Average length of a testimony is 1.9 hours.","30 minutes from each testimony were transcribed and used as training data. 10 testimonies were transcribed completely and used for testing. The acoustic model used 15-dimensional PLP cepstral features, sampled at 10 msec. Modeling was done using the HTK Toolkit.","The baseline language model was estimated from transcriptions of the survivors’ testimonies. We worked with the standardized version of the transcriptions. More details regarding the Czech portion of the MALACH data can be found in (Psutka et al., 2004). Transcriptions are 610k words long and the entire vocabulary comprises 41k words. We refer to this corpus as TR 41k.","To obtain a supplementary vocabulary, we used Czech morphology tools (Hajic and Vidov·a-Hladk·a, 1998). Out of 41k words we generated 416k words which were the inected forms of the observed words in the corpus. Note that we posed restrictions on the generation procedure to avoid obsolete, archaic and uncommon expressions. To do so, we ran a Czech tagger on the transcriptions and thus obtained a list of all morphological tags of observed forms. The morphological generation was then conned to this set of tags.","Since there is no corpus to train unigram scores of generated words on, we set the LM score of the generated forms to a constant.","The transcriptions are not the only source of text data in the MALACH project. (Psutka et al., 2004) searched the Czech National Corpus (CNC) for sentences which are similar to the transcriptions. This additional corpus contains almost 16 million words, 330k types. CNC vocabulary overlaps to a large extent with TR vocabulary. This fact is not surprising since the selection criterion was based on a lemma unigram probability. Table 6 summarizes OOV rates of several dictionaries.","We estimated several language models. The baseline models are pruned bigram back-off models with Knesser-Ney smoothing. The baseline word error 124 Dictionary OOV Name Size TR41k 41k 5.07 % TR41k + Morph416k 416k 2.74 % TR41k + CNC60k 79k 3.04 % TR41k + CNC100k 114k 2.62 % TR41k + CNC160k 171k 2.25% TR41k + CNC329k 337k 1.76 % All together 630k 1.46 % Table 6: OOV for several dictionaries.

Numbers in the dictionary names represent the dictionary size. rate of the model built solely from transcriptions was 37.35%. We injected constant loop of morphological variants into this model. In terms of text coverage, this action reduced OOV from 5.07% to 2.74%. In terms of recognition word error rate, we observed a relative improvement of 3.5%.","In the next experiment we took as the baseline LM a linear interpolation of the LM built from transcriptions and a model estimated from the CNC corpus. Into this model, we injected a unigram loop of all the available words. That is the rest of words from the CNC corpus with unigram scores and words provided by morphology which were not already in the model. Table 7 summarizes the achieved WER and oracle WER. Given the fact that the injection only slightly reduced the OOV rate, a small relative reduction of 2.3% matched our expectations.

Uniform Morph refers to the constant uniform loop of the morphology-generated words. Inj denotes the loop of the rest of words of the CNC corpus and the morphology-generated words.","To learn how the injection affected model size, we measured size of the language model automaton and the optimized triphone-to-word transducer. As in the case of the LN corpus, injection increased the model size only moderately. Sizes of the models are shown in Table 8. model CLG G TR41k 38MB 5.6MB TR41k + Morph 54MB 11MB TR41k + CNC 100k 283MB 53MB TR41k + CNC 100k + Inj 307MB 61MB TR41k + CNC 160k 312MB 59MB Table 8: Disk usage of tested models.

CNC and Morph refer to a LM estimated from transcriptions and the Czech National Corpus, respectively. Morph represents the loop of words generated by morphology. Inj is the loop of all words from CNC which were not included in CNC language model, more-over, Inj also contains words generated by the morphology."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have suggested to inject a loop of supplementary words into the back-off state of a rst-pass language model. As it turned out, addition of rare or morphology-generated words into a language model can considerably decrease both recognition word error rate and oracle WER in single recognition pass. In the recognition of Czech Broadcast News, we achieved 13.6% relative improvement in terms of word error rate. In terms of oracle error rate, we observed more than 30% relative improvement. On the MALACH data, we attained only marginal word error rate reduction. Since the text corpora already covered the transcribed speech relatively well, a smaller OOV reduction translated into a smaller word error rate reduction. In the near future, we would like to test our approach on agglutinative languages, where the problems with high OOV are even more challenging. We would also like to experiment with more complex language models. 125"]},{"title":"5 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We would like to thank our colleagues from the University of Western Bohemia for providing us with acoustic models.
