Many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem, including supervised learning algorithms (Leacock et al., 1998), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Yarowsky, 1995), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Schütze, 1998).","Supervised sense disambiguation has been very successful, but it requires a lot of manually sense-tagged data and can not utilize raw unannotated data that can be cheaply acquired. Fully unsupervised methods do not need the definition of senses and manually sense-tagged data, but their sense clustering results can not be directly used in many NLP tasks since there is no sense tag for each instance in clusters. Considering both the availability of a large amount of unlabelled data and direct use of word senses, semi-supervised learning methods have received great attention recently.","Semi-supervised methods for WSD are characterized in terms of exploiting unlabeled data in learning procedure with the requirement of predefined sense inventory for target words. They roughly fall into three categories according to what is used for supervision in learning process: (1) using external resources, e.g., thesaurus or lexicons, to disambiguate word senses or automatically generate sense-tagged corpus, (Lesk, 1986; Lin, 1997; McCarthy et al., 2004; Seo et al., 2004; Yarowsky, 1992), (2) exploiting the differences between mapping of words to senses in different languages by the use of bilingual corpora (e.g. parallel corpora or untagged monolingual corpora in two languages) (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Li and Li, 2004; Ng et al., 2003), (3) bootstrapping sense-tagged seed examples to overcome the bottleneck of acquisition of large sense-tagged data (Hearst, 1991; Karov and Edelman, 1998; Mihalcea, 2004; Park et al., 2000; Yarowsky, 1995).","As a commonly used semi-supervised learning method for WSD, bootstrapping algorithm works by iteratively classifying unlabeled examples and adding confidently classified examples into labeled dataset using a model learned from augmented labeled dataset in previous iteration. It can be found that the affinity information among unlabeled examples is not fully explored in this bootstrapping process. Bootstrapping is based on a local consistency assumption: examples close to labeled examples within same class will have same labels, which is also the assumption underlying many supervised learning algorithms, such as kNN.","Recently a promising family of semi-supervised learning algorithms are introduced, which can effectively combine unlabeled data with labeled data 395 in learning process by exploiting cluster structure in data (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002; Blum et al., 2004; Chapelle et al., 1991; Szummer and Jaakkola, 2001; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003). Here we investigate a label propagation based semi-supervised learning algorithm (LP algorithm) (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) for WSD, which works by representing labeled and unlabeled examples as vertices in a connected graph, then iteratively propagating label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges, finally inferring the labels of unlabeled examples after this propagation process converges.","Compared with bootstrapping, LP algorithm is based on a global consistency assumption. Intuitively, if there is at least one labeled example in each cluster that consists of similar examples, then unlabeled examples will have the same labels as labeled examples in the same cluster by propagating the label information of any example to nearby examples according to their proximity.","This paper is organized as follows. First, we will formulate WSD problem in the context of semi-supervised learning in section 2. Then in section 3 we will describe LP algorithm and discuss the difference between a supervised learning algorithm (SVM), bootstrapping algorithm and LP algorithm. Section 4 will provide experimental results of LP algorithm on widely used benchmark corpora. Finally we will conclude our work and suggest possible improvement in section 5."]},{"title":"2 Problem Setup","paragraphs":["Let X = {xi}n","i=1 be a set of contexts of occurrences of an ambiguous word w, where xi represents the context of the i-th occurrence, and n is the total number of this word’s occurrences.

The goal is to predict the sense of w in context xh by the use of label information of xg and similarity information among examples in X.","The cluster structure in X can be represented as a connected graph, where each vertex corresponds to an example, and the edge between any two examples xi and xj is weighted so that the closer the vertices in some distance measure, the larger the weight as-sociated with this edge. The weights are defined as follows: Wij = exp(−","d2","ij","σ2 ) if i ̸= j and Wii = 0","(1 ≤ i, j ≤ n), where dij is the distance (ex. Euclid-","ean distance) between xi and xj, and σ is used to","control the weight Wij."]},{"title":"3 Semi-supervised Learning Method 3.1 Label Propagation Algorithm","paragraphs":["In LP algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002), label information of any vertex in a graph is propagated to nearby vertices through weighted edges until a global stable stage is achieved. Larger edge weights allow labels to travel through easier. Thus the closer the examples, more likely they have similar labels (the global consistency assumption).","In label propagation process, the soft label of each initial labeled example is clamped in each iteration to replenish label sources from these labeled data. Thus the labeled data act like sources to push out labels through unlabeled data. With this push from labeled examples, the class boundaries will be pushed through edges with large weights and settle in gaps along edges with small weights. If the data structure fits the classification goal, then LP algorithm can use these unlabeled data to help learning classification plane.","Let Y 0","∈ N n×c","represent initial soft labels at-tached to vertices, where Y 0","ij = 1 if yi is sj and 0","otherwise.

For comparing LP with SVM and bootstrapping, let us consider a dataset with two-moon pattern shown in Figure 1(a). The upper moon consists of 9 points, while the lower moon consists of 13 points. There is only one labeled point in each moon, and other 20 points are un- −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 3−2 −1 0 1 2 (a) Minimum Spanning Tree (b) t=1 (c) t=7 (d) t=10 (e) t=12 (f) t=100 B A C Figure 2: Classification result of LP on two-moon pattern dataset. (a) Minimum spanning tree of this dataset. The convergence process of LP algorithm with t varying from 1 to 100 is shown from (b) to (f). labeled. The distance metric is Euclidian distance. We can see that the points in one moon should be more similar to each other than the points across the moons.","Figure 1(b) shows the classification result of SVM. Vertical line denotes classification hyperplane, which has the maximum separating margin with respect to the labeled points in two classes. We can see that SVM does not work well when labeled data can not reveal the structure (two moon pattern) in each class. The reason is that the classification hyperplane was learned only from labeled data. In other words, the coherent structure (two-moon pattern) in unlabeled data was not explored when inferring class boundary.","Figure 1(c) shows bootstrapping procedure using kNN (k=1) as base classifier with user-specified parameter b = 1 (the number of added examples from unlabeled data into classified data for each class in each iteration). Termination condition is that the distance between labeled and unlabeled points is more than inter-class distance (the distance between A0 and B0). Each arrow in Figure 1(c) represents one classification operation in each iteration for each class. After eight iterations, A1 ∼ A8 were tagged 397 as +1, and B1 ∼ B8 were tagged as −1, while A9 ∼ A10 and B9 ∼ B10 were still untagged. Then at the ninth iteration, A9 was tagged as +1 since the label of A9 was determined only by labeled points in kNN model: A9 is closer to any point in {A0 ∼ A8} than to any point in {B0 ∼ B8}, regardless of the intrinsic structure in data: A9 ∼ A10 and B9 ∼ B10 are closer to points in lower moon than to points in upper moon. In other words, bootstrapping method uses the unlabeled data under a local consistency based strategy. This is the reason that two points A9 and A10 are misclassified (shown in Figure 1(c)).","From above analysis we see that both SVM and bootstrapping are based on a local consistency assumption.","Finally we ran LP on a connected graph-minimum spanning tree generated for this dataset, shown in Figure 2(a). A, B, C represent three points, and the edge A − B connects the two moons. Figure 2(b)- 2(f) shows the convergence process of LP with t increasing from 1 to 100. When t = 1, label information of labeled data was pushed to only nearby points. After seven iteration steps (t = 7), point B in upper moon was misclassified as −1 since it first received label information from point A through the edge connecting two moons. After another three iteration steps (t=10), this misclassified point was re-tagged as +1. The reason of this self-correcting be-havior is that with the push of label information from nearby points, the value of YB,+1 became higher than YB,−1. In other words, the weight of edge B − C is larger than that of edge B − A, which makes it easier for +1 label of point C to travel to point B. Finally, when t ≥ 12 LP converged to a fixed point, which achieved the ideal classification result."]},{"title":"4 Experiments and Results 4.1 Experiment Design","paragraphs":["For empirical comparison with SVM and bootstrapping, we evaluated LP on widely used benchmark corpora - “interest”, “line” 1","and the data in English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-3 (including all 57 English words ) 2",". 1 Available at http://www.d.umn.edu/∼tpederse/data.html 2 Available at http://www.senseval.org/senseval3","Table 1: The upper two tables summarize accuracies (aver-","aged over 20 trials) and paired t-test results of SVM and LP on","SENSEVAL-3 corpus with percentage of training set increasing","from 1% to 100%.

For SVM, we did not perform feature selection on SENSEVAL-3 data since feature selection deteriorates its performance (Lee and Ng, 2002).

For the word “interest”, they used its four major senses. For comparison with their results, we took reduced “interest” corpus (constructed by retaining four major senses) and complete “line” corpus as evaluation data. In their algorithm, c is the number of senses of ambiguous word, and b (b = 15) is the number of examples added into classified data for each class in each iteration of bootstrapping. c × b can be considered as the size of initial labeled data in their bootstrapping algorithm. We ran LP with 20 trials on reduced “interest” corpus and complete “line” corpus. In each trial, we randomly sampled b labeled examples for each sense of “interest” or “line” as labeled data. The rest served as both unlabeled data and test data.","Table 2 summarizes the average accuracies of LP on the two corpora. It also lists the accuracies of monolingual bootstrapping algorithm (MB), bilingual bootstrapping algorithm (BB) on “interest” and “line” corpora.

The parameter b is set as 1. Only b unlabeled examples nearest to labeled examples and with the distance less than dinter−class (the minimum distance between labeled examples with different sense tags) will be added into classified data in each iteration till no such unlabeled examples can be found. Firstly we ran this monolingual bootstrapping on this dataset to augment initial labeled data. The resulting classified data is shown in Figure 3 (d). Then a 1NN model was learned on this classified data and we used this model to perform classification on the remaining unlabeled data. Figure 3 (e) reports the final classification result by this 1NN model. We can see that bootstrapping does not perform well since it is susceptible to small noise in dataset. For example, in Figure 3 (d), the unlabeled example B 6","happened to be closest to labeled example A, then 1NN model tagged example B with label ⋄. But the correct label of B should be + as shown in Figure 3 (b). This error caused misclassification of other unlabeled examples that should have label +.","In LP, the label information of example C can travel to B through unlabeled data. Then example A will compete with C and other unlabeled examples around B when determining the label of B.

Using this classification strategy achieves better performance than the local consistency based strategy adopted by SVM and bootstrapping. 4.5 Experiment 3: LPcosine vs. LPJS Table 3 summarizes the performance comparison between LPcosine and LPJS on three datasets.

This observation motivates us to automatically select a distance measure that will boost the performance of LP on a given dataset.","Cross-validation on labeled data is not feasible due to the setting of semi-supervised learning (l ≪ u). In (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003), they suggested a label entropy criterion H(YU ) for model selection, where Y is the label matrix learned by their semi-supervised algorithms. The intuition behind their method is that good parameters should result in confident labeling. Entropy on matrix W (H(W )) is a commonly used measure for unsupervised feature selection (Dash and Liu, 2000), which can be considered here. Another possible criterion for model selection is to measure the entropy of c × c inter-class distance matrix D calculated on labeled data (denoted as H(D)), where Di,j represents the average distance between the i-th class and the j-th class. We will investigate three criteria, H(D), H(W ) and H(YU ), for model selection. The distance measure can be automatically selected by minimizing the average value of function H(D), H(W ) or H(YU ) over 20 trials.","Let Q be the M × N matrix.

But H(D) and H(YU ) fail to find the optimal distance measure when only very few labeled examples are available (percentage of labeled data ≤ 10%).","H(W ) measures the separability of matrix W . Higher value of H(W ) means that distance measure decreases the separability of examples in full dataset. Then the boundary between clusters is obscured, which makes it difficult for LP to locate this boundary. Therefore higher value of H(W ) results in worse performance of LP.","When labeled dataset is small, the distances between classes can not be reliably estimated, which results in unreliable indication of the separability of examples in full dataset. This is the reason that H(D) performs poorly on SENSEVAL-3 corpus when the percentage of labeled data is less than 25%.","For H(YU ), small labeled dataset can not reveal intrinsic structure in data, which may bias the estimation of YU . Then labeling confidence (H(YU )) can not properly indicate the performance of LP. This may interpret the poor performance of H(YU ) on SENSEVAL-3 data when percentage ≤ 25%. 401"]},{"title":"5 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have investigated a label propagation based semi-supervised learning algorithm for WSD, which fully realizes a global consistency assumption: similar examples should have similar labels. In learning process, the labels of unlabeled examples are determined not only by nearby labeled examples, but also by nearby unlabeled examples. Compared with semi-supervised WSD methods in the first and second categories, our corpus based method does not need external resources, including WordNet, bilingual lexicon, aligned parallel corpora. Our analysis and experimental results demonstrate the potential of this cluster assumption based algorithm. It achieves better performance than SVM when only very few labeled examples are available, and its performance is also better than monolingual bootstrapping and comparable to bilingual bootstrapping. Finally we suggest an entropy based method to automatically identify a distance measure that can boost the performance of LP algorithm on a given dataset.","It has been shown that one sense per discourse property can improve the performance of bootstrapping algorithm (Li and Li, 2004; Yarowsky, 1995). This heuristics can be integrated into LP algorithm by setting weight Wi,j = 1 if the i-th and j-th instances are in the same discourse.","In the future we may extend the evaluation of LP algorithm and related cluster assumption based algorithms using more benchmark data for WSD. Another direction is to use feature clustering technique to deal with data sparseness and noisy feature problem.","Acknowledgements We would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
