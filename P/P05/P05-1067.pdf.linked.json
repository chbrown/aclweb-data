Such approaches, which are essentially stochastic string-to-string transducers, do not explicitly model natural language syntax or semantics. In reality, pure statistical systems some-times suffer from ungrammatical outputs, which are understandable at the phrasal level but some-times hard to comprehend as a coherent sentence.","In recent years, syntax-based statistical machine translation, which aims at applying statistical models to structural data, has begun to emerge. With the research advances in natural language parsing, especially the broad-coverage parsers trained from treebanks, for example (Collins, 1999), the utiliza-tion of structural analysis of different languages has been made possible. Ideally, by combining the natural language syntax and machine learning methods, a broad-coverage and linguistically wellmotivated statistical MT system can be constructed.","However, structural divergences between languages (Dorr, 1994),which are due to either systematic differences between languages or loose translations in real corpora,pose a major challenge to syntax-based statistical MT. As a result, the syntax based MT systems have to transduce between non-isomorphic tree structures.","(Wu, 1997) introduced a polynomial-time solution for the alignment problem based on synchronous binary trees. (Alshawi et al., 2000) represents each production in parallel dependency trees as a finite-state transducer. Both approaches learn the tree representations directly from parallel sentences, and do not make allowances for non-isomorphic structures. (Yamada and Knight, 2001, 2002) modeled translation as a sequence of tree operations transforming a syntactic tree into a string of the target language.","When researchers try to use syntax trees in both languages, the problem of non-isomorphism must be addressed. In theory, stochastic tree transducers and some versions of synchronous grammars provide solutions for the non-isomorphic tree based transduction problem and hence possible solutions for MT. Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars, proposed by (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), were introduced primarily for semantics but were later also proposed for translation. Eisner (2003) proposed viewing the MT problem as a probabilistic synchronous tree substitution grammar parsing 541 problem. Melamed (2003, 2004) formalized the MT problem as synchronous parsing based on multitext grammars. Graehl and Knight (2004) defined training and decoding algorithms for both generalized tree-to-tree and tree-to-string transducers. All these approaches, though different in formalism, model the two languages using tree-based transduction rules or a synchronous grammar, possibly probabilistic, and using multi-lemma elementary structures as atomic units. The machine translation is done either as a stochastic tree-to-tree transduction or a synchronous parsing process.","However, few of the above mentioned formal-isms have large scale implementations. And to the best of our knowledge, the advantages of syntax based statistical MT systems over pure statistical MT systems have yet to be empirically verified.","We believe difficulties in inducing a synchronous grammar or a set of tree transduction rules from large scale parallel corpora are caused by: 1. The abilities of synchronous grammars and","tree transducers to handle non-isomorphism","are limited. At some level, a synchronous","derivation process must exist between the","source and target language sentences. 2. The training and/or induction of a synchro-","nous grammar or a set of transduction rules","are usually computationally expensive if all","the possible operations and elementary struc-","tures are allowed. The exhaustive search for","all the possible sub-sentential structures in a","syntax tree of a sentence is NP-complete. 3. The problem is aggravated by the non-perfect","training corpora. Loose translations are less of","a problem for string based approaches than for","approaches that require syntactic analysis.","Hajic et al. (2002) limited non-isomorphism by n-to-m matching of nodes in the two trees. However, even after extending this model by allowing cloning operations on subtrees, Gildea (2003) found that parallel trees over-constrained the alignment problem, and achieved better results with a tree-to-string model than with a tree-to-tree model using two trees. In a different approach, Hwa et al. (2002) aligned the parallel sentences using phrase based statistical MT models and then projected the alignments back to the parse trees.","This motivated us to look for a more efficient and effective way to induce a synchronous grammar from parallel corpora and to build an MT system that performs competitively with the pure statistical MT systems. We chose to build the synchronous grammar on the parallel dependency structures of the sentences. The synchronous grammar is induced by hierarchical tree partitioning operations. The rest of this paper describes the system details as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe the motivation behind the usage of dependency structures and how a version of synchronous dependency grammar is learned. This grammar is used as the primary translation knowledge source for our system. Section 4 defines the tree-to-tree transducer and the graphical model for the stochastic tree-to-tree transduction process and introduces a polynomial time decoding algorithm for the transducer. We evaluate our system in section 5 with the NIST/Bleu automatic MT evaluation software and the results are discussed in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 The Synchronous Grammar 2.1 Why Dependency Structures?","paragraphs":["According to Fox (2002), dependency representations have the best inter-lingual phrasal cohesion properties. The percentage for head crossings is 12.62% and that of modifier crossings is 9.22%. Furthermore, a grammar based on dependency structures has the advantage of being simple in formalism yet having CFG equivalent formal generative capacity (Ding and Palmer, 2004b).","Dependency structures are inherently lexical-ized as each node is one word. In comparison, phrasal structures (treebank style trees) have two node types: terminals store the lexical items and non-terminals store word order and phrasal scopes. 2.2 Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars Ding and Palmer (2004b) described one version of synchronous grammar: Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars. A Dependency Insertion Grammars (DIG) is a generative grammar formalism that captures word order phenomena within the dependency representation. In the scenario of two languages, the two sentences in the source and target languages can be modeled as being generated from a synchronous derivation process.","A synchronous derivation process for the two syntactic structures of both languages suggests the level of cross-lingual isomorphism between the two trees (e.g. Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990)). 542","Apart from other details, a DIG can be viewed as a tree substitution grammar defined on dependency trees (as opposed to phrasal structure trees). The basic units of the grammar are elementary trees (ET), which are sub-sentential dependency structures containing one or more lexical items. The synchronous version, SDIG, assumes that the isomorphism of the two syntactic structures is at the ET level, rather than at the word level, hence allowing non-isomorphic tree to tree mapping.","We illustrate how the SDIG works using the following pseudo-translation example: y [Source] The girl kissed her kitty cat. y [Target] The girl gave a kiss to her cat.  Figure 1. An example  Figure 2. Tree-to-tree transduction","Almost any tree-transduction operations defined on a single node will fail to generate the target sentence from the source sentence without using insertion/deletion operations. However, if we view each dependency tree as an assembly of indivisible sub-sentential elementary trees (ETs), we can find a proper way to transduce the input tree to the output tree. An ET is a single “symbol” in a transducer’s language. As shown in Figure 2, each circle stands for an ET and thick arrows denote the transduction of each ET as a single symbol."]},{"title":"3 Inducing a Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammar","paragraphs":["As the start to our syntax-based SMT system, the SDIG must be learned from the parallel corpora. 3.1 Cross-lingual Dependency Inconsistencies One straightforward way to induce a generative grammar is using EM style estimation on the generative process. Different versions of such training algorithms can be found in (Hajic et al., 2002; Eisner 2003; Gildea 2003; Graehl and Knight 2004).","However, a synchronous derivation process cannot handle two types of cross-language mappings: crossing-dependencies (parent-descendent switch) and broken dependencies (descendent appears elsewhere), which are illustrated below:  Figure 3. Cross-lingual dependency consistencies","In the above graph, the two sides are English and the foreign dependency trees. Each node in a tree stands for a lemma in a dependency tree. The arrows denote aligned nodes and those resulting inconsistent dependencies are marked with a “*”.","Fox (2002) collected the statistics mainly on French and English data: in dependency representations, the percentage of head crossings per chance (case [b] in the graph) is 12.62%.","Using the statistics on cross-lingual dependency consistencies from a small word to word aligned Chinese-English parallel corpus1",", we found that the percentage of crossing-dependencies (case [b]) between Chinese and English is 4.7% while that of broken dependencies (case [c]) is 59.3%.","The large number of broken dependencies presents a major challenge for grammar induction based on a top-down style EM learning process.","Such broken and crossing dependencies can be modeled by SDIG if they appear inside a pair of elementary trees. However, if they appear between the elementary trees, they are not compatible with the isomorphism assumption on which SDIG is based. Nevertheless, the hope is that the fact that the training corpus contains a significant percentage of dependency inconsistencies does not mean that during decoding the target language sentence cannot be written in a dependency consistent way.","3.2 Grammar Induction by Synchronous Hierarchical Tree Partitioning (Ding and Palmer, 2004a) gave a polynomial time solution for learning parallel sub-sentential de-  1 Total 826 sentence pairs, 9957 Chinese words, 12660 English words. Data made available by the courtesy of Microsoft Research, Asia and IBM T.J. Watson Research. 543 pendency structures from non-isomorphic dependency trees. Our approach, while similar to (Ding and Palmer, 2004a) in that we also iteratively partition the parallel dependency trees based on a heuristic function, departs (Ding and Palmer, 2004a) in three ways: (1) we base the hierarchical tree partitioning operations on the categories of the dependency trees; (2) the statistics of the resultant tree pairs from the partitioning operation are collected at each iteration rather than at the end of the algorithm; (3) we do not re-train the word to word probabilities at each iteration. Our grammar induction algorithm is sketched below:","Step 0. View each tree as a “bag of words” and train a statistical translation model on all the tree pairs to acquire word-to-word translation probabilities. In our implementation, the IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) is used.","Step 1. Let i denote the current iteration and let","[]C CategorySequence i= be the current syntactic category set.","For each tree pair in the corpus, do { a) For the tentative synchronous partitioning operation, use a heuristic function to select the BEST word pair **(, )ijef , where both **,ijef are NOT “chosen”, *()iCategory e C∈ and *()jCategory f C∈ . b) If **(, )ijef is found in (a), mark **,ijef as “chosen” and go back to (a), else go to (c). c) Execute the synchronous tree partitioning operation on all the “chosen” word pairs on the tree pair. Hence, several new tree pairs are created. Replace the old tree pair with the new tree pairs together with the rest of the old tree pair. d) Collect the statistics for all the new tree pairs as elementary tree pairs. } Step 2. 1ii=+. Go to Step 1 for the next iteration. At each iteration, one specific set of categories of nodes is handled. The category sequence we used in the grammar induction is: 1. Top-NP: the noun phrases that do not have","another noun phrase as parent or ancestor. 2. NP: all the noun phrases 3. VP, IP, S, SBAR: verb phrases equivalents. 4. PP, ADJP, ADVP, JJ, RB: all the modifiers 5. CD: all the numbers. We first process top NP chunks because they are the most stable between languages. Interestingly, NPs are also used as anchor points to learn monolingual paraphrases (Ibrahim et al., 2003). The phrasal structure categories can be extracted from automatic parsers using methods in (Xia, 2001).","An illustration is given below (Chinese in pinyin form).

Note that this is a nondeterministic process. The input sentence is first parsed using an automatic parser and a dependency tree is derived. The rest of the pipeline can be viewed as a stochastic tree transducer. The MT decoding starts first by decomposing the input dependency tree in to elementary trees. Several different results of the decomposition are possible. Each decomposition is indeed a derivation process on the foreign side of SDIG. Then the elementary trees go through a transfer phase and target ETs are combined together into the output.  Figure 5.
