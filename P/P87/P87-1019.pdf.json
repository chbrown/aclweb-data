A single semantic definition is used for both nominalizations and the verbs to which they are related, with the same semantic roles, decompositions, and selectional restrictions on the semantic roles. However, because syntactically nominalizations are noun phrases, the processing which produces the semantic representation is different in several respects from that used for clauses. (1) The rules relating the syntactic positions of the constituents to the roles that they can fill are different. (2) The fact that nominailzations are untensed while clauses normally are tensed means that an alternative treatment of time is required for nomlnalizations. (3) Because none of the arguments of a nominallzation is syntactically obllgatory, some differences in the control of the filling of roles are required, in particular, roles can be filled as part of reference resolution for the nominalization. The differences in processing are captured by allowing the semantic interpreter to operate in two different modes, one for clauses, and one for nominalizations. Because many nomlnalizations are noun-noun compounds, this approach also addresses this problem, by suggest-ing a way of dealing with one relatively tractable subset of noun-noun compounds. 1Formerly SDC-A Burroughs Company. 1.

Clause analysis","The semantic processing to be described in this paper is part of the PUNDIT s system for processing natural language messages.

The semantic domain from which these examples are taken is that of reports of failures of the starting air compressors, or sac's, used in starting gas turbines on Navy ships. The goal of semantic analysis is to produce a representation of the information conveyed by the sentence, both implicit and explicit. This involves 1) mapping the syntactic realization onto an underlying predicate argument representation, e.g., assigning referents of particular syntactic consltuents to predicate arguments, and 2) mak- ]Jig implicit argument fillers expllclt. We are using an algorithm for semantic interpretation based on predicate decomposition that integrates the performance of these tasks. The integration is driven by the goal of filling in the predicate arguments of the decomposition.~almer1986].","In order to produce a semantic representation of a clause, its verb is first decomposed into a semantic predicate representation appropriate for the domain. The arguments of the predicates constitute the SEMANTIC ROLES of the verb, which are slml]ar to cases 4 For example,"]},{"title":"fall","paragraphs":["decomposes into become inoperatlve, with patient as its only semantic role.

There are domain specific criteria for selecting a range of semantic roles. The criteria which we have used are described resolution from default or contextual information.","We have categorized the semantic roles into three classes, based on how they are filled Semantic roles such as theme, actor and patient are syntactically OBLIGATORY, and must be filled by surface constituents. Semantic roles are categorized as semantically ESSENTIAL when they must be filled even if there is no syntactic constituent avaUahle, s In this case they can be filled pragmatically, making use of reference resolution, as explained below. The default categorization is NON-ESSENTIAL, which does not require that the role be filled. The algorithm in Figure 1 produces a semantic representation using this information. Each step in the algorithm will be illustrated at least once in the next section using the following (typical) CASREPS text."]},{"title":"~a© failed. Pump sheared. Ineestifatiort reeealed metal eontamlnation in filter. 2.1. A Simple Example","paragraphs":["DECOMPOSE VERB - The first example uses the fall decomposition for Sac"]},{"title":"failed:","paragraphs":["fall <- beeomeP (inoperatlveP","(patlent(P))). It indicates that the entity filling the OBLIGATORY patient role has or will become inoperative. FOR patient ROLE - PROPOSE SYNTACTIC CONSTITUENT FILLER - A mapping rule indicates that the syntactic subject is a likely filler for any patient role. The mapping rules make use of intuitions about syntactic cues for indicating semantic roles first embodied in the notion of case ~lllmore1968,Palmer1981]. The mapping rules can take advantage of general syntactic cues like \"SUBJECT goes to PATIENT\" while still indicating particular context sensitivities. (See ~almer1985] for details.) in{Paseonneau198611","s We are in the process of defining criteria for categoriz-ing a role as ~SSeNTIAL. It is clearly very domain dependent. 132 CALL REFERENCE RESOLUTION - See is the subject of ma© failed, and is suggested by the mapping rule as a 1Lkely filler of the patient role. At this point the semantic interpreter asks noun phrase analysis to provide a unique referent for the noun phrase subject. Since no sac, have been mentioned previously, a new name is created: sael. TEST SELECTION RESTRICTIONS - In addition to the mapping rules that are used to associate syntactic constituents with semantic roles, there are selection restrictions associated with each semantic role. The selection restrictions for fail test whether or not the filler of the patient role is a mechanical device. A sac is a mechanical device so the subject of the sentence mac failed maps straightforwardly onto the patient role, e.g., beeomeP (inoper at|veP (pat|ent (sac1))).","Since there are no other roles to be filled the algorithm term~-ates successfully at this point and the remaining steps are not applied. The next example illustrates further steps in the algorithm. 2.2. Unfilled Obligatory Roles","The second utterance in the example, Psmp mheared, illustrates the effect of an unfilled obligatory role. DECOMPOSE VERB -","shear,","<- eauseP (!nstigator (I),","beeomeP(shearedP","(patlent(P)))) Sheer is an example of a verb that can be used either transitively or intransitively. In both cases the patient role is filled by a mechanical device that becomes sheared. If the verb is used transitively, the instigator of the shearin¢, also a mechanical device, is mentioned explicitly, as in, The rotating driee shaft sheared the psmp. If the verb is used intransitively, as in the current example, the instigator is not made explicit; however, the algorithm begins by attempting to fill it in. FOR Instigator ROLE - Working from left to right in the verb decomposition, the first role to and relies heavily on what can be assumed from the context. be filled is the instigator role. A mapping rule indicates that the subject of the sentence, psmp, is a likely filler for this role. Reference resolution returns pump1 as the referent of the noun phrase. Since pump is a mechanical device, the selection restriction test passes. FOR patient ROLE - There are no syntactic constituents left, so a syntactic constituent cannot be proposed and tested. UNFILLED OBLIGATORY ROLES - The patlent role, a member of the set of obligatory roles, is still unfilled. This causes failure, and the binding of p,*rnpl to the instigator role is undone. The algorithm starts over again, trying to fill the instigator role. FOR instigator ROLE- There are no other mapping rules for instigator, and it is nonessential, so Case 4 applies and it is left unfilled, e The algorithm tries again to fill in the patient role. FOR patlent ROLE - Two mapping rules can apply to the patient role, one of which suggests the subject, in this case, the pump, as a filler. Reference resolution returns pump1 again, which passes the selection restriction of being a mechanical device. The final representation is: eauseP (instl gator (I), beeomeP (shearedP (patlent (pumpl)))).","The last sentence in the text, \"Inveatlga-tion re~ealed metal eontaminatlon ~n filter,\" is interesting mainly because of the occurrence of two nomlnallzations which are discussed in detail in a separate section. 2.3. Temporal Analysis of Tensed Clauses","The temporal component determines what kind of situation a predication denotes and what time it is asserted to hold for ~assonneau1988]. Its input is the semantic decomposition of the verb and its arguments, tense, an indica-tion of whether the verb was in the perfect or progressive, and a list of unanalyzed constituents which may include temporal adverbials. It generates three kinds of output: an assignment of","IIn other domains, the instigator might be an ~SSZN.

For the simple sentence, sac /'ailed, the input would consist of the semantic decomposition and a past tense marker: Deeomposltlons become (|no per ative (p atlent"]},{"title":"(is sell ) ))","paragraphs":["3Terb forms Past The output would be a representation of a transitional event, corresponding to the"]},{"title":"moment","paragraphs":["of"]},{"title":"becoming","paragraphs":["inoperative, and a resulting state in which the sac is inoperative for some"]},{"title":"period","paragraphs":["initiating at the"]},{"title":"moment","paragraphs":["of transition."]},{"title":"8.","paragraphs":["Nomlnallsatlons","Nominallzations are processed very slml]arly to clauses, but with a few crucial d~erences, both in linguistic information accessed and in the control of the algorithm.

The first pass is for filling roles which are explicitly given syntactically; essential roles are left unfilled.

We are indebted to James Allen for this observation. fillers, as a by-product of reference resolution. After the first pass, the interpreter looks for a referent, which, if found, will unify with the nomlnalisatlon representation, sharing variable bindings. This is a method of filling unfilled roles pragmatically that is not currently available to clause analysis s. However, the first pass was important for filling roles with any explicit syntactic arguments of the nom;nalizatlon before attempting to resolve its reference, since there may be more than one event in the context whkh nominallzation could be specifying. For example,"]},{"title":"failure of","paragraphs":["pump and"]},{"title":"failure of sac","paragraphs":["can only be distinguished by the filler of the patient role.

Temporal Analysis of Nomlnallzatlons","As with clauses, the temporal analysis of norninallsatlons takes place after the semantic analysis. Also as with clauses, one of the inputs to the temporal analysis of nomlna]isatlons is the semantic decomposition. The critical d~erence between the two cases is that a nom;nalisation does not occur with tense. PUNDIT compensates by looking for relevant temporal information in the superordinate constituents in which the nominalizatlon is embedded. Currently, PUNDIT processes nomlnalizatlons in three types of con° texts. The first context for which a nomlnalisation is temporally processed is when it occurs as the prepositional object of a temporal connective (e.g.,"]},{"title":"before, during, after)","paragraphs":["and the matrix clause denotes an actual situation.

Such verbs are classified as aspectual.

Previous Computatlonal Treatments","Previous computational treatments of nominalizations differ in two ways from the current approach. In the first place, nominallzations have often been treated simply as one type of noun-noun compound. This viewpoint is adopted by ~inin1980,Leonard1984,Brachman(nuli)]. Certainly many nomlnalizations contain nominal premodifiers and hence, syntactically, are noun-noun compounds; however, this approach obscures the generalization that prepositional phrase modifiers in non-compound noun phrases often have the same semantic roles with respect to the head noun as noun modifiers. PUNDIT's analysis is aimed at a uniform treatment of the semantic s~ml]arlty among expressions like"]},{"title":"repair of","paragraphs":["enflne, enf~ne repair, and"]},{"title":"Csomeone)","paragraphs":["repaired englne rather than the syntactic similarity of"]},{"title":"engine repair, sir preuure,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"metal partl-","paragraphs":["eles. Of the analyses mentioned above, Brachman's analysis seems to be most similar to ours in that it provides an explicit link from the nominalization to the related verb to relate the roles of the noun to those of the verb. The second way in which our approach differs from previous approaches is that PUNDIT's analysis is driven by taking the semantic roles of the predicate and trying to fill them in any way it can. This means that PUNDIT knows when a role is not explicitly present, and consequently can call on the other mechanisms which we have described above to fill it in. Other approaches have tended to start by fitting the explicitly mentioned arguments into the role slots, thus they lack this"]},{"title":"flexibility. 6.","paragraphs":["L|mltat|ons","The current system has two main limita-tions.

Conclus|ons In this paper we have described a treatment of nom~nalisatlons ill which the goal ls to maxim- [se the s~m~]arities between the processing of nominallsatlons and that of the clauses to whkh they are related. The semantic s~m~]arltles between nom~nallzatlons and clauses are captured by making the semantic roles, semantk decompositions, and selectional restrictions on the roles the same for nomlna]isations and their related verbs. As a result, the same semantk representation k constructed for both structures. This s~m;|arity in representation in turn anows reference resolution to find referents for nom;nallsations whkh refer to events previously described in clauses. In addl-tion, it allows the time component to integrate temporal relationships among events and situations described in clauses with those referred to by non~uaUsations.","On the other hand, where d~erences between nom~uaUsations and clauses have a clear ]ingulstic motivation, our treatment provides for differences in processing. PUNDIT recognizes that the semantic roles of non~na]ised verbs are expressed syntactically as modifiers of nouns rather than arguments of clauses by having a d~erent set of syntactic mapping rules. It ls also true in nominallsatlons that there are no syntacticaUy obligatory arguments, so the analysis of a nom;nallsation does not fall when there is an unfilled obligatory role, as is the case with clauses. Finally, the temporal analysis component is able to take into account the fact that nomlnallzatlons are untensed.","~rh;le there are many cases not yet covered by our system, in general, we believe this to be an approach to processing nomlnallsatlons which is 137 APPENDIX DECOMPOSE VERB; FOR EACH SEMANTIC ROLE","CASE I: IF THERE ARE SYNTACTIC CONSTITUENTS - PROPOSE SYNTACTIC CONSTITUENT FILLER","CALL REFERENCE RESOLUTION & TEST SELECTIONAL RESTRICTIONS","CASE 2: IF ROLE IS OBLIGATORY AND SYNTACTICALLY UNFILLED - FAIL","CASE 3: IF ROLE IS ESSENTIAL AND UNFILLED - CALL REFERENCE RESOLUTION TO HYPOTHESIZE A FILLER & TEST SELECTIONAL RESTRICTIONS","CASE 4: IF ROLE IS NON-ESSENTIAL AND UNFILLED - LEAVE UNFILLED CALL TEMPORAL ANALYSIS ON DECOMPOSITION FIKure 1.
