A consequence of these augmentations is an explosion of semantically equivalent derivations admitted by the grammar. The present work proposes a method for circumventing this spurious ambiguity problem. It involves deriving new, specialized combinators and replacing the orginal basic combinators with these derived ones. In this paper, examples of these predictive combin~tor8 are offered and their effects illustrated. An algorithm for deriving them, as well as s discussion of their semantics, will be presented in forthcoming work. Introduction","In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Categorial Grammar (Adjukeiwicz 1935; Bar-Hillel 1953). The work of Steedman (1985, 1987) and Dowry (1987) is representative of one recent direction in which Categorial Grammar (CG) has been taken, in which the operations of functional composition and type raising have figured in analyses of \"noncanonical\" structures such as wh- dependencies and nonconstituent conjunction. Based on the fact that such operations have their roots in the ¢ombinator~/ c~lc~lua (Curry and Feys 1958), this line of Categorial Grammar has come to be known as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). While such an approach to syntax has been demonstrated to be suitable for computer implementation with unification-based grammar formalisms (Wittenburg 1986a), doubts have arisen over the efficiency with which such grammars can be processed. Karttunen (1986), for instance, argues for an alternative to rules of functional composition and type raising in CGs on such grounds. 1 Other researchers working with Categorial Unification Grammars consider the question of what method to use for long-distance dependencies an open one (Uszkoreit 1986; Zeevat, Klein, and Calder 1986).","The property of Combinatory Categorial Grammars that has occasioned concerns about processing is spurious ambiguity: CCGs that directly use functional composition and type raising admit alternative derivations that nevertheless result in fully equivalent parses from a semantic point of view. In fact, the numbers of such semantically equivalent derivations can multiply at an alarming rate. It was shown in Wittenburg (1986a) that even constrained versions of functional composition and type raising can independently cause the number of semantically equivalent derivations to grow at rates exponential in the length of the input string. 2 While this spurious ambiguity property may not seem to be a partitular problem if a depth-first (or best-first) parsing algorithm is used-after all, if one can get by with producing just one derivation, one has no reason to go on generating the remaining equivalent ones-the fact is that both in cases where the parser ultimately fails to generate a derivation and where one needs to be prepared to generate all and only genuinely (semantically) ambiguous parses, spurious ambiguity may be a roadblock to efficient parsing of natural language from a practical perspective.","The proposal in the present work is aimed toward eliminating spurious ambiguity from the form of Combinatory Categorial Grammars that are actually used during parsing. It involves deriving a new set of combinators, termed predictive combinators, that replace the basic forms of functional composition and type raising in the original grammar. After first reviewing the theory of Combinatory Categorial Grammar and the attendant spurious ambiguity problem, we proceed to the subject of these derived combinators. At the conclusion, we compare this approach to other proposals.","iKarttunen suggests that these operations, at least in their most general form, are computationally intractable. However, it should be noted that neither Steedman nor Dowty has suggested that a fully general form of type raising, in particular, should be included as a productive rule of the syntax. And, as Friedman, Dai, and Wang (1986) have shown, certain constrained forms of these grammars that nevertheless include functional composition are weakly context-free. Aravind Joshi (personal communication} strongly suspects that the generative capacity of the grammars that Steedman assumes, say, for Dutch, is in the same class with Tree Adjoining Grammars (Joshi 1985) and Head Grammars (Pollard 1984). Thus, computational tractability is, I believe, not at issue for the particular CCGs assumed here.","2The result in the case of functional composition was tied to the Catalan series (Knuth 1975), which Martin, Church and Patil (1981) refer to as =almost exponential'. For a particular implementation .of type raising, it was 2 n'1. The fact that derivations grow at such a rate, incidentally, does not mean that these grammars, if they are weakly context-free, are not parsable in n 3 time. But it is such ambiguities that can occasion the worst case for such algorithms. See Martin, Church, and Patti (1981) for discussion."]},{"title":"73","paragraphs":["Overview of CCG","The theory of CombinatoriaJ Categorial Grammar has two main components: a categorial lexicon that assigns grammatical categories to string elements and a set of combinatory rules that operate over these categories. 3 Categorlal lexicon","The grammatical categories assigned to string elements in a Categorial Grammar can be basic, as in the category CN, which might he assigned to the common noun man, or they may he of a more complex sort, namely, one of the so-called functor categories. Functor categories are of the form XIY , which is viewed as a function from categories of type Y to categories of type X. Thus, for instance, a determiner such as the might be ~igned the category NPICN , an indication that it is a function from common nouns to noun phrases. An example of a slightly more complex functor category would be tensed transitive verbs, which might carry the category (SINP)INP. This can be viewed as a second order function from (object) noun phrases to another function, namely SINP , which is itself a function from (subject) noun phrases to sentences. 4 (Following Steedman, we will sometimes abbreviate this finite verb phrase category as the symbol FVP.) Directionality is indicated in the categories with the following convention: a righ~slanting slash indicates that the argument Y must appear to the right of the functor, as in X/Y; a left-slanting slash indicates that the argument Y must appear to the left, as in X\\Y. 5 A vertical slash in this paper is to be interpreted as specifying a directionality of eith~\" left or right. Combinatorial rules","Imposing directionality on categories entails including two versions of the basic functional application rule in the grammar.

However, the theory of Combinatory Categorial Grammar departs from other forms of Categorial Grammar and related theories such as HPSG (Pollard 1085; Sag 1987) in the use of functional composition and type raising in the syntax, which occasions partial constituents within derivations. Functional composition is a combinatory operation whose input is two functors and whose output is also a funetor composed out of the two inputs.

The two essential in-gredients, namely, type-raising and functional composition, are operations of wide generality that are sufficient for handling node-raising (Steedman 1985; 1987) and other forms of nonconstituent conjunction (Dowry 1987). Using these methods to capture unbounded dependencies also preserves a key property of grammm-s, namely, what Steedman (1985) refers to as the ad.~acency property, maintained when string rewriting operations are confined to concatenation. Grammars which preserve the adjacency property, even though they may or may not be weakly context-free, nevertheless can make use of many of the parsing techniques that have been developed for context-free grammars since the applicability conditions for string-rewriting rules are exactly the same. The spurious amblgulty problem","A negative consequence of parsing directly with the rules above is an explosion in possible derivations.

The category strings shown at the bottom of (8a) and (gb) are either lexical category assignments OR (as indicated by the carets) categories derivable in the grammar with rules of functional application or unary rules such as topicalization. Recall that CCGs with such rules alone have no spurious ambiguity problem. The category strings underneath the wider dashed lines are then reducible via (type raising and) functional composition into functional arguments of the appropriate sort that are only then reduced via functional application to the X terms. 10 It is this part of the derivation, i.e., the part represented by the pair of wider dashed lines, in which spurious ambiguity shows up. Note that (5) is intended to be an example of the sort of derivation being schematized in (8a): the topicalization rule applies underneath the leftmost category to produce the X/(Y/Z) type; all other categories in the bottommost string in (8a) correspond to lexical category assignments in ($).","There are two conditions necessary for eliminating spurious ambiguity in the circumstances we have just laid out. First, we must make sure that function composition (and unary rules like subject type-raising) only apply when a higher type functor appears in a substring, as in (8). When no such higher type functors appears, the rules must then be absent from the picture-they are unnecessary. Second, we must be sure that when function composition and unary rules like subject type-raising do become involved, they produce unique derivations under conditions like (8), avoiding the spurious ambiguity that characterizes function composition and type raising as they have been stated earlier.","10While we have implied (as evidenced by the right-leaning slashes on intermediate categories) that forward functional composition is the relevant composition rule, backwards functional composition could also be involved in the reduction of substrings, as could type raising.","The natural solution for enforcing the first condition is to involve categories of type X[(YIZ ) in the derivations from the start. In other words, restricting the application of functional composition and the relevant type-raising rules is possible if we can incorporate some sort of top-down, or predictive, information from the presence of categories of type X[(YIZ). Standard dotted rule techniques found in Eariey deduction (Earley 1970) and active chart parsing (Kay 1980) offer one avenue with which to explore the possibility of adding such control information to a parser. However, since the information carried by dotted rules in algorithms designed for context-free grammars has a direct correlate in the slashes already found in the categories of a Categorial Grammar, we can incorporate such predictive information into our grammar in categorial terms. Specifically, we can derive new combinatorial rules that directly incorporate the • top-down\" information. I call these derived combinatorial rules predictive combinators. 11","It so happens that these same predictive combinators will also enforce the second condition mentioned above, by virtue of the fact that they are designed to branch uniformly from the site of the higher type functor to the site of the \"gap'. For cases of leftward extraction (aa), derivations will be uniformly left-branching. For cases of rightward extraction (8b), derivations will be uniformly right-branching. It is our conjecture that CCGs can be compiled so as to force uniform branching in just this way without al'fecting the language generated by the grammar and without altering the semantic interpretations of the results. We will now turn to some examples of the derived combinatory rules in order to see how they might produce such derivations.","The first predictive combinator we will consider is derived from categories of type X/(Y/Z) and forward functional composition of the a~'gument term of this category.

Hughes proposed, in the context of cornpilation techniques for applicative programming languages, methods for deriving new combinators from actual programs. He used the term supercomblnators to distinguish this derived set from the fixed set of combinators proposed by Turner (1979). By analogy, predictive combinators in CCGs are derived from actual categories and rules defined in specific Combinatory Categorial Grammars.

In the class of function composition rules, we have considered only forward functional composition in this paper, but many published CCG analyses assume rules of backward functional composition as well. As we mentioned, compiling out type-raising rules may involve adding as many new combinators as there axe general combinatory rules in the grammar previously. Other unary rules that produce spurious ambiguity may require even more predictive eombinators. The rule of subject-introduction proposed in Wittenburg (1986a) may be one such example.","There are of course costs involved in increasing the size of a rule base by enlarging the grammar through the addition of predictive combinators. However, the size of a rule base is well known to be a constant factor in asymptotic analyses of parsing complexity (and the rule base for Categorial Grammars is very small to begin with anyway). On the other hand, the cost of producing spuriously ambiguous derivations with grammars that include functional composition is at least polynomial for the best known parsing algorithms. The reasoning is as follows. Based on the (optimistic) assumption that relevant CCGs are weakly context-free, they are amen-able to parsing in n 3 time by, say, the Esrley algorithm (Earley 1970). 12 As alluded to earlier in footnote 2, \"all-ways ambiguous\" grammars, a characterization that holds for CCGs that use function composition directly, occasion the worst case for the Earley algorithm, namely n 3. This is be-cause all possible well-formed bracketings of a string are in fact admitted by the grammar in these worst cases (as exemplified by (6)) and the best the Earley algorithm can do when filling out, a chart (or its equivalent) in such circumstances is O(n3). The methods presented here for norrealizing CCGs through predictive combinators eliminate this particular source of worst case ambiguity. Asymptotic parsing complexity will then be no better or worse than the grammar and parser yield independently from the spurious ambiguity problem.

Pollard (1984) has a result of n 7 for Head Grammars. piling a predictive form of CCGs, given a base form along the lines of Steedman (1985), has been implemented for CCGs expressed in a PATR-like unification grammar for-malism (Shieber 1984). We believe from experience that our algorithm is correct and complete, although we do not have a formal proof at this point. A full formal characterization of the problem, along with algorithms and accompanying correctness proofs, is forthcoming. Comparison with previous work","Previous suggestions in the literature for coping with spurious ambiguity in CCGs are characterized not by eliminating such ambiguity from the grammar but rather by","13 attempting to minimize its effects during parsing. Karttunen (1986) has suggested using equivalence tests during processing; in his modified Earley chart parsing algorithm, a subeonstituent is not added to the chart without first testing to see if an equivalent constituent has already been built. 14 In its effects on complexity, this check is really no different than a step already present in the Earley algorithm: an Earley state (edge) is not added to a state set (vertex) without first checking to see if it is a duplicate of one already there. 15 The recognition algorithm does nothing with duplicates; for the Earley parsing algorithm, duplicates engender an additional small step involving the placement of a pointer so that the analysis trees can be recovered later. Duplicates generated from functional composition (or from other spurious ambiguity sources) require a treatment no different than Earley's duplicates except that no pointers need to be added in parsing-their derivations are simply redundant from a semantic point of view and thus they can be ignored for later processing. Karttunen's proposal does not change the worst-case complexity results for Earley's algorithm used with CCGs as discussed above and thus does not offer much relief from the spurious ambiguity problem. However, parsing algorithms such as Karttunen's that check for duplicates are of course superior from the point of view of asymptotic complexity to parsing algorithms which fail to make cheeks. The latter sort will on the face of it be exponential when faced with ambiguity as in (6) since each of the independent derivations corresponding to the Catalan series will have to be enumerated independently.","In earlier work (Wittenburg 1986a, 1986b), I have suggested that heuristics used with a best-first parsing algorithm can help cope with spurious ambiguity. It is clear to me now that, while more intelligent methods for directing the search van significantly improve performance in the average case, they should not be viewed as a solution to spurious ambiguity in general. Genuine ambiguity and unparsable input in natural language can force the parser to search exhaustively with respect to the grammar. While heuristics used even with a large search space can provide the means for tuning performance for the \"best\" analyses, the search space itself will determine the results in the \"worst\" cases. Compiling the grammar into a normal form based on the notion of predictive eombinators makes exhaustive search more palatable, whatever the enumeration order, since the search","13This characterization also apparently holds for the proposals from Pareschi and Steedman (1987) being presented at this conferenee.","14While Karttunen's categorial fragment for Finnish does not make direct use of functional composition and type raising, it nevertheless suffers from spurious ambiguity of a similar sort stemming from the nature of the categories and functional application rules he defines. 15The n 3 result crucially depends on this check, in fact."]},{"title":"78","paragraphs":["space itself is vastly reduced.
