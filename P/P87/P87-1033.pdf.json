Disjunction is an essential component of grammatical descriptions in Kay's Functional Unification Grammar [6], and it has been proposed by Karttunen as a Linguistically motivated extension to PATR-II [2].","In previous work two methods have been used to handle disjunctive descriptions in parsing and other computational applications.","The first method requires expanding descriptions to dis- ]unctl've normal form (DNF) so that the entire description can be interpreted as a set of structures, each of which contains no disjunction. This method is exemplified by Definite Clause Grammar [8], which eliminates disjunctive terms by expanding each rule containing disjunction into alternative rules. It is also the method used by Kay [7] in parsing FUG. This method works reasonably well for small grammars, but it is clearly unsatisfactory for descriptions containing more than a small number of disjunctions, because the DNF expansion requires an amount of space which is exponential in the number of disjunctions.","The second method, developed by Karttunen [2], uses constraints on dlsjuncts which must be checked whenever a diejunct is modified. Karttunen's method is only applicable to value disjunctions (i.e. those disjunctions used to specify the value of a single feature), and it becomes complicated and inefficient when disjuncts contain non-local dependencies (i.e. values specified by path expressions denoting another feature).","In previous research [4,5] we have shown how descriptions of feature structures can be represented by a certain type of logical formula, and that the consistency problem for disjunctive descriptions is NP-complete. This result indicates, according to the widely accepted mathematical assumption that P ~ NP, that any complete unification algorithm for disjunctive descriptions wiU require exponential time in the worst case. However, this result does not preclude algorithms with better average performance, such as the method described in the remainder of this paper. This method overcomes the shortcomings of previously existing methods, and has the following desirable properties:","1. It appUes to descriptions containing general disjunction and non-local path expressions; 2. It delays expansion to DNF;","3. It can take advantage of fast unification algorithms for non-disjunctive directed graph structures."]},{"title":"2 Data Structures","paragraphs":["The most common unification methods for non-disjunctive feature structures use a directed graph (DG) representation, in which arcs are labeled by names of features, and nodes correspond to values of features.

As we have shown (see [9]) that there is a unique minimal satisfying DG structure for any nondisjunctive FDL formula, we can represent the parts of a formula which do not contain any disjunction by DGs. DGs are a more compact way of representing the same information that is contained in a FDL formula, provided the formula contains no disjunction.","Let us define an unconditional conjunct to be a conjunct of a formula which contains no occurrences of disjunction.

Thus the disjunctions of a formula can be put into the form (~conj~ d̂isA ~ .̂..d̂isA,) v... v (uconj,, d̂isj,, ~ .̂..̂dlsj,, ). The embedding of conjuncts within disjuncts is preserved, but the order of conjuncts may be changed.","The unconditional conjuncts of a formula contain information that is more definite than the information contained in disjunctions. Thus a formula can be regarded as having a definite part, containing only unconditional conjuncts, and an indefinite part, containing a set of disjunctions.

The algorithm was integrated with the structure building module of the PATR-II system [10], written in the Zetalisp programming language.","While the feature-description corresponding to a grammar may have hundreds of disjunctions, the descriptions that result from parsing a sentence usually have only a small number of disjunctions, if any at all. Most disjunctions in a systemic grammar represent possible alternative values that some particular feature may have (along with the grammatical consequences entailed by choosing particular values for the feature). In the analysis of a particular sentence most features have a unique value, and some features are not present at all. When disjunction remains in the description of a sentence after parsing, it usually represents ambiguity or an under-specified part of the grammar.","With this implementation of the algorithm, sentences of up to I0 words have been parsed correctly, using a grammar which contains over 300 disjunctions. The time required for most sentences is in the range of 10 to 300 seconds, running on lisp machine hardware.","The fact that sentences can be parsed at all with a grammar containing this many disjunctions indicates that the algorithm is performing much better than its theoretical worst case time of O(2d). 2 The timings, shown in Table 1, obtained from the experimental parser for systemic grammar also in-dicate that a dramatic increase in the number of disjunctions in the grammar does not result in an exponential increase in parse time.

This method has been used successfully in an experimental parser for a grammar containing several hundred disjunctions in its description.

Therefore, we suggest two types of refinement to this algorithm as topics for future research: using heuristics to determine an opportune ordering of the dlsjuncts within a description, and using parallel hardware to implement the compatibility tests for different disjunctions.
