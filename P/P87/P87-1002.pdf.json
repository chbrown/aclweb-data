Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiers over times which bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component and the semantic interpretation component of JANUS."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["JANUS is a natural language understanding and generation system which allows the user to interface with several knowledge bases maintained by the US NAVY.

The second reading in (12), where P has scope over the entire formula assigns the somewhat absurd truth conditions that at some time in the past every admiral as simultaneously a cadet.

In the models given to tense logics such as the ones first"]},{"title":"9","paragraphs":["developed by Prior, one standardly evaluates propositions with respect to a single time which one may call the event time, the time at which an event happens or at which a state of affairs obtains. The point of speech is taken to be a special case of this parameter.","An alternative to models with only one temporal parameter has been given by Reichenbach (1947). Reichenbach argues for distinguishing between three parameters which he calls speech time, event time and reference time. The meaning of the first two parameters should be self-explanatory. It is the third parameter, reference time, that requires explanation. Reichenbach conceives of reference time as the temporal perspective from which an event is viewed, as opposed to event time as the time at which the event occurs. Reference time can be either implicit in the discourse context or explicitly specified by temporal adverbials such as yesterday. For each individual tense reference time is temporally ordered with respect to the other two parameters. Reference time plays a crucial role in Reichenbach's account of the distinction betwen the simple past and the present perfect in English. In both cases event time preceeds speech time. But while for the simple past, the event time is viewed from a perspective in the past, the event is viewed from the perspective of the present in the case of the present perfect.","Given the distinction between reference time and event time, one can then formalize Reichenbach's analysis of the past tense as in (14). The operator P shifts evaluation of the event time t to some time t' in the past such that t' falls within some reference time r.","(14) [P P]r,t = Tiff [P]r,r for some time t' such that t' < t and t' ~; r. The Y operator on the other hand, does not shift the event time t, rather it operates on the reference time r in the obvious way. 3 (15) ~/P]r,t == Tiff [P][DAY(t=)-I],t = T. With the redefined operators P and Y, one can now give adequate truth conditions for sentences involving tense and time adverbials. In the formula in (16) Y specifies the reference time r to be the day prior to the speech time, and then the P operator locates the event time as being within that reference time.","(16) [Y [ P [ leave' (Vincent') ] ]r,t = T iff [ P [leave' (Vincent') ]][DAY(t=)-I].t == T iff [ leave' (Vincent') ]][OAY(t ).l],t' == T for some t'< t and t'~; [DAY(ts)-I ]. Likewise for tense and negation, the past operator locates the event time t prior to speech time and within some reference time r which in the case of (17) has to be taken to be contextually specified. \"=Operators similar to the redefined P and Y operators have first been suggested in the literature by Acquist (1976).","(17) Vincent did not leave.","(18) [7 [P [leave'(Vincent')]]]r,t = T iff [ P[leave'(Vincent')]]r, t =, F iff [leave'(Vincent') ]r,r = F for all times t' such that t' < t and t' <;; r. (17) is true according to (18) if there is no time within the reference time r at which the untensed proposition /eave'(Vincent') is true.","It turns out that a multi-indexed tense logic also gives an adequate account of tense in discourse. A detailed account of this can be found in Hinrichs (1981, 1986); here I will only sketch the basic idea: By ordering event times with respect to reference times, as sketched in (20), and by updating such reference times after each event description, one can order multiple events as described in (19) in the appropriate way. The relations < and ~; in (20) are meant to stand for temporal precedence and temporal inclusion, respectively.","(19) Vincent [was hit by a harpoon]%, [was abandoned by its crew]e =, and [sank]%.

In (22) past tense is translated into a propositional operator whose semantics is implicit in the truth conditions imposed with respect to the model-theory. In the formula in (23) the past tense leads to existerltial quantification over times. The existential quantifier binds variables which appear as extra argument positions on predicates. So, ship\" which is ordinarily taken to be a one-place predicates turns into a two-place predicate that takes individuals and times as its arguments. The variable t r occurs as a free variable in (23) and stands for the Reichenbachean reference time.","Although the two formulas in (22) and (23) are logically equivalent in the sense that both are true under the same set of models, I will adopt the style of logical representation in (23) for remainder of this paper This is because in the context of the JANUS system, it is important to explicitly quantify over times since in the database times are explicitly entered as dates, time stamps, etc. In order to be able to access them, it is important to incorporate time information explicitly at the level of logical form. A second reason for preferring the style of 10 representation in (23) over the one in (22) concerns the interaction between tenses and quantified NP's. Since formulas such as (23) explicitly quantify over times, scope relations with respect to quantification over individuals become completely transparent."]},{"title":"5 Tense and Quantified Noun Phrases","paragraphs":["Using the style of representation exemplified by formula (23), let me then return to the issue of tense and quantification, which is still unresolved. Consider once again the types of examples that, as Enc points out, cannot be handled in standard tense logic. (24) Every admiral was (once) a cadet. (25) V x [ admirar(x) ---> P [ cadet'(x) ]] (26) P [ ~\" x [ admiral'(x) --e cadet'(x) ]] If tense operators like P have scope over propositions, P can either scope over an entire formula as in (25) or over the consequent of the material implication as in (26). Now, as we saw earlier, neither formula captures the reading that all present or past admirals were cadets prior to their being admirals.","Enc (1981) provides an interesting solution to the problem posed by examples such as (24). Her solution is based on two assumptions: 1. Semantically, tenses should have scope only over verb meanings, but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexical in the sense their interpretations depend on the context of the utterance in the same way that demonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoric pronouns such as she and they do.","As the formula in (27) shows, which represents the translation for (24) in my analysis, I adopt Enc's first assumption and assign tense scope only over the main verb of the sentence.","(27) V x [ 3 t [ admiral'(x)(t) & R (x)(t) ] --~ [ :1 t' [ t' < t s & t' ~ t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') ]] The predicate R in (27), whose role I will comment on in more detail shortly, is meant to range over properties which are salient in a given context. The past tense of sentence (24) contributes the existential quantification over times t' that precede the speech point t s and are contained in some contextually specified reference time t r. Following Enc, tense is thus given scope only over the predicate that corresponds to the main verb. However, the formula in (27) also shows that I do not follow Enc in her second assumption, namely her treatment of nouns as indexicals. In contrast to true indexicals, whose denotation depends solely on the context of utterance, I treat the denotation of predicates corresponding to nouns as being time-dependent in an absolute sense, since predicates such as admira/do carry a time-denoting argument position as part of their function-argument structure. Without such an argument, it seems impossible to give a satisfactory account of temporal adjectives such as former and previous or/ast, whose function it is to shift the temporal evaluation of the predicate that they combine with. However, I do recognize an element of context dependency inherent in the interpretation of noun phrases such as every admiral since I interpret such noun phrases with respect to some contextually salient property R. This predicate makes it possible to account for the well-known phenomenon of restricted quantification, namely that in sentences such as (28) the interpretation of everyone does not involve the set of all students in the world, but rather the set of all individuals in a given context; for example everyone at a certain party. 4 (28) Everyone is having a good time. Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicate is, thus, kept separate from the temporal evaluation of predicates corresponding to other constituents in the sentence. As first pointed out by Enc, this strategy makes it possible to account for sentences such as (29) and (30) whose translations require that the predicates secretary and fugitive be evaluated relative to a time which is distinct from the evaluation time of the predicate corresponding to the verb. s (2g) Oliver North's secretary testified before the","committee. (30) Every fugitive is now in jail. In contrast to an analysis which interprets the past tense in terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrow scope analysis of tense also avoids the dilemma of inducing a simultaneity reading for sentence (31), if the tense operator P has scope over the entire formula as in the translation (32) of (31). (31) Every admiral graduated from West Point. (32) P [ 'd x [admiral'(x) ~ graduate-from'(West-","Point')(x)]] The reading in (32) is factually implausible for two reasons: 1. It imposes simultaneity as part of the truth conditions and requires that all admirals graduated at the same time, 2. since the P operator forces temporal evaluation of all predicates in its scope at the same index, in the case of (31) it requires that every admiral graduated from West Point as an admiral, and not, as is actually the case, subsequent to graduation from the Naval academy.","Notice that the formula in (33) , which represents the translation of (31) in my analysis, avoids both problems associated with (32).","(33) ~' x [ 3 t [ admiral'(x)(t) & R (x)(t) ] --~ [ 3 t' [ t' < t s & t' s t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') ]] 4The example is due to Stalnaker (1973). SRecail that Fawn Hall, North's secretary, testified before the committee when she was no longer North's secretary. The example is due to an editorial in the Boston Globe 11 Since temporal evaluation of the predicates admiral' and graduate-from\" are kept separate, the first problem does not arise. Since the predicates are existentially quantified over independently, (33), in contrast to (32), also avoids having to assign a simultaneity reading to (31).","A crucial element of my analysis is the inclusion of the predicate R, which is meant to restrict the denotation of quantified NP's such as every ship by properties that are salient in the context of utterance. Apart from keeping the temporal evaluation of verbal predicates and nominal predicates independent of one another, it is this context dependent feature of my analysis that makes it more flexible than a wide scope analysis of tense. Let me illustrate how the context-dependent evaluation of quantified NP's by once again focusing on example (34). (34) Every admiral graduated from West Point. Imagine that (34) is uttered in a context in which all current admirals assigned to the Pacific Fleet are under discussion. In that context, R could be instantiated as in (35), i.e. as the intension of the set of individuals x which are assigned to the Pacific Fleet at a time which equals the speech time t s. (35) ;Lt ~.y [assigned-to'(Pac.Fleet')(y)(t) & t = ts] Substituting R by (35) in (36), one then arrives at the formula in (37).","(36) V x [ :1 t [ admirar(x)(t) & R(x)(t) ] --+ [ 3 t' [ t' < t s & t' e t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') ]]","(37) V x [ 3 t [ admiral'(x)(t) & assigned-to'(Pac-Fleet')(x)(t) & t = t s ] ~ [ =1 t' [ t' < t s & t' ¢ t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') ]] In a context in which all present or past admirals in the Pacific Fleet are under discussion, a reading which, as I pointed out in section 3.3, one cannot capture using Priorean tense operators one can capture by instantiating R as in (38), where < stands for the relation temporally preceding or equaJ to. (38) ~.t ~.y [assigned-to'(Pac-Fleet')(y)(t) & t < ts] The idea behind using the variable R in my analysis is, thus, to have it instantiated appropriately by the discourse context. One of the counterarguments that one may raise against this context-dependent aspect of my analysis of temporal semantics concerns the fact that tracking the salience of objects and their properties in natural language discourse is a notoriously difficult problem. However, I will argue in the next section that whatever mechanisms are needed to track saliency, such mechanisms are motivated independently by semantic and pragmatic phenomena that go beyond phenomenon of temporal interpretation."]},{"title":"6 Evaluating Time-dependent Predicates in Context","paragraphs":["Objects and certain of their properties can receive or maintain salience in a discourse in any number of ways. The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of common ground (Stalnaker 1978) and of mutual knowledge (Clark and Marshall 1981) are certainly cases in point. In this section I will concentrate on one such mechanism which plays a role in the context-dependent interpretation of time dependent predicates. I will argue that the mechanism is needed for purposes other than temporal interpretation and, therefore, does not add complexity to my analysis of temporal semantics.","Consider a typical sequence of queries that a user may present to JANUS.","(39) a.

The person asking (39b) is not interested in being informed about all ships that at some time in the future will go to Hawaii. Instead, the user is interested in a much more restricted set of ships that will go there, namely the ones that were deployed by some admiral the day before. In order to arrive at such an interpretation, the free variable R in the translation formula in (40) has to be bound appropriately by the context.","(40) QUERY [ Z z [ z ~ POW[Z y 3 t' [ ship'(y)(t') & R(y)(t')]] & =1 t [ t > t s & t ~ t r & go-to'(Hawaii')(z)(t)"]},{"title":"]4 ]","paragraphs":["QUERY is a speech act operator which takes the propositional content of the question as an argument and causes to evaluate it at some temporal index, in this case the point of speech t s.

POW stands for the power set operation which I use for the interpetation of plural nouns. Now if the reader prefers some other approach to the semantics of plurals, say the lattice-theoretic approach of link (1983), over the approach based on power sets I am not going to argue with them. The point that I want to concentrate on with respect to the formula in (40) concerns the instantiation of the context-dependent predicate R.

The temporal logic is based on Reichenbach's models for the semantics of English tense and uses multiple indices for semantic interpretation. This multi-indexed logic overcomes the kinds of problems that arise when systems of tense logics are used that rely on just one index of evaluation.","I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope to tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate scope relations with respect to NP quantifiers and to interpret such NP's relative to a given discourse context. I have argued that the context-dependent feature of the analysis does not add extra complexity to my treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposes of discourse understanding in general. Finally, I have demonstrated how the narrow scope of tense results in a fully compositional syntax and semantics of tensed sentences in English."]},{"title":"9 Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["I am grateful to Remko Scha and Barry Schein for comments on earlier drafts of this paper.
