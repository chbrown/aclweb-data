Walker","Artificial In~elligence Center","SRI International","Menlo Park, California 94025, USA","Our society was founded on 13 June 1962 as the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics. Consequently, this 1982 Annual Meeting represents our 20th anniversary. We did, Of course, change our name to the Association for Computational Linguistics in 1968, but that did not affect the continuity of the organization. The date of this panel, 17 June, misses the real anniversary by four days, but no matter; the occasion still allows us to reflect on where we have been and where we are going. I seem to be sensitive to opportunities for celebrations. In looking through my AMTCL/ACL correspondence over the years, I came across a copy of a memo sent to Bob Simmons and Hood Roberts during our lOth anniversary year, recommending that something in commemoration might be appropriate. I cannot identify anything in the program of that meeting or in my notes about it that suggests they took me seriously then, but that reflects the critical difference between volunteering a recommendation and Just plain volunteerlngl","My invitation to participate in this panel was sent out to the presidents of the Association, who were, in order, Vic Yngve, Dave Hays, Win Lehmann, Paul Garvin, Susumo Kuno, (I fit here in the sequence), Martin Kay, Warren Plath, Joyce Friedman, Bob Simmons, Bob Barnes, Bill Woods, Aravind Joshi, Stan Petrick, Paul Chapin, Jon Allen, RonKaplan, Bonnie Webber, Norm Sondheimer, and Jane Robinson, and to my predecessor as Secretary-Treasurer, Hood Roberts. Harry Josselson, our first Secretary-Treasurer, is no longer among us, but he would have enjoyed such a gathering, being one for ceremony and celebration.","Vic, Dave, Martin, Warren, Joyce, Bob Simmons, Bill, Aravind, Stan, Paul, Jon, Ron, Bonnie, and Norm agreed to Join me on the panel. Jane refused on the grounds that she was not yet part of history and that her Presidential Address provided ample platform to convey her reflections. Win, Paul, Susumo, and Bob Barnes were not able to come, and Hood was still waffling when this piece was being written. Vic, Dave, Win, Bob Simmons, Aravind, Paul, Jon, Norm, and I have written down some of our reflections; they appear on the following pages.","My charge to the panelists, with respect to both oral and written tradition, was quite broad: \"You are asked to reflect on significant experiences during your tenure of that office, in particular as they reflect on the state of computational linguistics then and now, and perhaps with some suggestions for what the future will bring.\" The written responses are varied, as you can see; I am sure that the oral responses will prove to be equally so.","To provide some perspective--and record some history, I am attaching a synopsis of \"officers, editors, committees, meetings, and program chairing\" (please let me know about errors!). It is interesting to note the names of people--many of whom are still prominent in the field, the practices associated with our annual meetings, and our publication history. I will comment on the latter two.","Our first meeting was held in conjunction with the 1963 ACM National Conference, but it is clear that our primary allegiance has been with the Linguistic Society of America, since we met seven times in conjunction with its summer meetings. For a period, we alternated between the LSA and the Spring Joint Computer Conference--and actually included that schedule in our membership flyer. We Joined with the American Society for Information Science twice, and the Cognitive Science Society once. The convocation of the first International Conference on Computational Linguistics, now known popularly as COLING, replaced our annual meeting in 1965, and we are scheduled to host COLING-84 in two years. Recently, we have been meeting independently, reflecting an increased confidence in our ability to \"make it on our own!\"","The publication history of the Association has been equally varied. The Finite String, our newsletter, was published as a separate under the editorship of Hood Roberts from 1964 through 1973, and has continued in various forms ever since. In 1965, the Association adopted MT: Mechanical Translation, a Journal founded by Vic Yngve in 1954, changing its name to Mechanical Translation and Computational Linguistics in the process. However, that Journal was not able to sustain a sufficient flow of manuscripts, and the last issue, dated 1968, was published in 1970. After a lengthy exploration of an alternative primary Journal, Dave Hays brought the American Journal of Computational Linguistics into"]},{"title":"being","paragraphs":["in 1974. Hi-as intention had been to create a printed Journal that contained extended abstracts, supplemented by microfiches that provided details, programs, and computer listings. This proposal was submitted to the National Science Foundation for support. A grant was approved, but it stipulated that we publish a microfiche-only Journal, and we did that until 1978, The Finite String being issued as a separate microfiche during this period. It became increasingly clear during the five microfiche years that the micropublishing industry was not going to develop as predicted in the early 1970s. 89 Microfiche readers that were both inexpensive and convenient had not materialized, and our members were reluctant to commit their manuscripts to a medium that restricted readership to a dedicated few. Consequently, George Heldorn set about converting the AJCL to a printed Journal, the first issue of which appeared in 1980. Respectful of its microformal origins, it is distributed with a microfiche that duplicates the printed version but sometimes contains additional material. The Finite Strin~ Newsletter continues to provide general information of interest to the membership as a special section.","To complete our publlcatlon history, I can announce a new venture that the Association is Just beginning, Studies in Natural Language Processln~, a monograph series under the Editorship of Aravlnd Joshl. It was prompted by Norm Sondheimer and brought into being through the organizatlonal efforts of Paul Chapln. We are Just completing negotiations with Cambridge University Press, which will publish it for us.","So much for general history, I will reserve my proper place down the llne for other kinds of commentary.","ASSOCIATION FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION AND COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS","(founded 6-13-1962)","ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS","(renamed 7-24-1968)","Officers, Editors, Committees,
