Shvartz Cognitive Systems Inc. 234 Church Street New Haven, Ca. 06510","Zn the past decade, a number of natural language database access systems have been constructed (e.g. Hendrix 1976; Waltz et el. 1976; Sacerdoti 1978; Harris 1979; Lehner~ and Shwartz 1982; Shvartz 1982). The level of performance achieved by natural language database access systems varies considerably, with the sore robust systems operating vithtn a narrow domain (i.e., content area) and relying heavily on domain-specific knowledge to guide the language understanding process. Transporting a system constructed for one domain into a new domain is extremely resource-in-tensive because a new set of domain-specific knowledge must be encoded.","In order to reduce the cost of transportation, a great deal of current research has focussed on building natural language access systems that are domain-independent. More specifically, these systems attempt to use syntactic knowledge in con- ~unction with knowledge about the structure of the database as a substitute for conceptual knowledge regarding the database content area. In this paper I examine the issue of whether or not it is possible to build a natural language database access systee that achieves an acceptable level of performance without including domain-specific conceptual knowledge. 6 gerforn=nca ~i~g~ion for oa~u£al language atoms= =X=~em=,","The principle motivation for building natural language systems for database access is ~o free the user from the need for data processing instruction. A natural language front end is a step above the \"English-like = query systems that presently dominate the commercial database retrieval field. English-like query systems allow the user to phrase requests as English sentences, but permit only a restricted subset of English and impose a rigid syntax on user requests. These English-like query systems are easy to learn, but a training period is still required for the user to learn to phrase requests that conform to ~hc~ restrictions. However, the training period is often very brief, and natura~ language systems can be considered superior only if no computer-related training or knowledge is required of the user.","This criterion can only be met if no restrictions are placed on user queries. A user who has previously relied on a programmer-technician to code formal queries for information retrieval should be permitted to phrase inform%ion retrieval requests t~ the program in exactly the same way as to the technician. That is, whatever the technician would understand, the program should understand. For example, a natural language front end to a stock market database should understand that (1) Did IBM go up yesterday? refers to PRZCE and not VOLUME. However, the system need not understand requests that a programmer-technician would be unable to process, e.g. (2) Is GENCO a likely takeover target? That is, the programmer-technlcisn uorking for an investment firm would not be expected to know how t<) process requests that require \"expert\" knowledge and neither should | natural language front end, If, however, = natural language system cannot achieve the level of performance of a programear-technician it will seem stupid because it does not meet = user's expectations for an English understanding system,","The mprograemer-technician criterion m cannot possibly be met by = domain-independent natural language access system because language understanding requires domain-specific world knowledge. On a theoretical level, the need for a knowledge base in a natural language processing system has been well-documented (e.g. Schank A Abelson 1977; Lehnert 1978; Dyer 1982). It will be argued below that in an applied context, a system that does not have a conceptual knowledge base can produce at best only a shallow level of understanding and one that does not meet the criterion specifled above. Further, the domain-independent approach creates a host of problems that are simply non-existent in knowledge-based s~stems.

Consider the following requests from PEARL (Lehnert and Shvartz 1982; Shwartz 1982) when it operates in the domain of geological map generation: 60 (3) Show ss ell oil veils from 1970 to 1980. (4) Show Is all oil veils fro! 8000 ~ 7000. (5) Show se all oil wells 1 t~a 2000. (6) Show ee all oil wells 40 to 41, 80 to 81. A programmer-technician In the petrochemical in-dustry would infer that (3) refers to drilling dates, (4) refers ~o veil depth, (5) refers ~o the sap scale, end (6) refers to latitude/longitude specifications. Correct processing of these requsst~ requires inferential processing that is based on knowledge of the petrochemical industry. That is, these conventions =re not in everyone's general working knowledge of the English language. Yet they are standard usage for people who communicate with each other about drilling data, and any systss that claims t~o provide a natural language interface t~ l data base of drilling data must have the knowledge to correctly process requests such as these. Without such inferential processing, the user is required to spell out everything in detail, something that is sispty not necessary in normal English discourse.","Another probles for any natural language understanding systes is the processing of ambiguous words. In some cases disambiguation can be performed syntactically. In other cases, the structure of the database can provide the information necessary for word sense disambiguation (more on this below). However, in many cases disasbiguation can only be performed if domain-specific, world knowledge is available. For example, consider the processing of the word \"sales = in (7), (8) and (9). (7) What is the average mark up for sales of stereo equipment? (8) What is the average mark down for sales of stereo equipment? (9) What is the average mark up during sales of stereo equipment? (10) What is the average mark down durlng sales of stereo equipment? These four requests, which are so nelrly identical both lexically and syntactically, have very distinct meanings that derive from the fact that the correct sense of 'sliest in (7) ls quits different from the sense of \"sales = intended in (8), (9), end (10). Nest people have little difficulty determining which sense of =sales = is intended in these sentences, and neither would a knowledge-based understander. The key to the disambiguation process involves world knowledge regarding retail sales.","Problems of anaphora pose similar problems. For example, suppose the following requests were submitted to a personnel data base: (11) List all salesmen with retirement plans along with their salaries. (12) List all offices with women managers along with their salaries. While these requests are syntactically identical, the referents for \"their\" in (11) end (12) occupy different syntactic positions. As human information processors, ve have no trouble understanding 61 that salarie~ are associated with people, so retirement pllns and offices are never considered as possible referents. Again, domain-specific world knouledge is helpful in understanding these requests. ~Ug~u~al knQwlldgm i= m =uh=~i~u~m fo~ GQO¢ID~ual knowlsdgg,","One of inner|aliens to eaerge from the construction of domain-independent systems is t clever mechanism that extracts dosain-speclflc knowledge free the structure of the data base. For example, the resolution of the pronoun 'their = in both (11) and (12) above could be accomplished by using only structural (rather than conceptual) knowledge of the domain. For example, suppose the payroll database for (11) were structured such that SALARY and RETIRENENT-PLANS were fields within a SALESMAN file. It would then be possible to infer that ltheir= refers to =salesmen = in (11) by noting that SALARY is a field in the SALESMEN file, but that SALARY is not an entry in I RETIREMENT-PLANS file.","Unfortunately, this approach has lilited utility because it relies on a fortuitous de,abase structure. Consider what would happen if the data base had a top-level ERPLOYEES file (rather than individual files for each type of employee) with fields for JOB-TYPE, SALARY, COMMISSIONS, and RE-TZRENENT-PLANS, With this database organization, it would not he possible to detersine that (13) List all salesmen who have secrebaries along with their comsissions. ltheir= refers ~o meal=amen\" and not \"secretaries = in (13) on the basis of the structure of the data-bass. To the naive user, however, the seining of this sentence is perfectly clear. A person who couldn't determine the referent of \"their = in (13) would not be perceived as having an adequate cossand of the English language and the same would be true for a computer system that did not understand the request. ~i~fall= a==g~il~Id wi~b ~bm dQ®zin:indag~ndln~ i~-","In a knowledge-based systes such as PEARL, = natural language request is parsed into a conceptual representation of the meaning of the request. The retrieval routine is then generated free this concepbual representation. As a result, the parser is independent of the logical structure of the database. That is, the same parser can be used for databases with different logical structures, but the same information content. Further, the same parser can be used whether the required information is located in = single file or in lultiple files.","In a domaln-independent systes, the parser is entirely dependent on the structure of the database for domain-specific knowledge. As a result, one must restructure the parser for databases with identical content but different logical structure. Sisilarly, the output of the parser lust be very dlfferent vhen the required information Is contained in mulSiple files rather than a single file.","Because of their lack of conceptual knowledge regarding the database, domain-independent systems rely heavily on key words or phrases to indicate which database field iS being referred to. For example, (14) Vhat is Bill Smith's ~ob &male? High& be easily processed by simply retrieving the con&ants of a JOB-TITLE field. Different vlys of referring ~o job title can also be handled as synonyms. However, dosiin°independent systems get into deep trouble vhen the database field that needs to be accessed is not directly indicated by key words or phrases in the input request. For example, (15) Is John Jones the child of an alumnus? is easily processed if there exists a CHILD-OF-AN-ALUMNUS field, but the query (16) Is one of John Jones' paren&s an alumnus? contains no key word or phrase to indicate that the CHILD-OF-AN-ALURNUS field should be accessed, In a knowledge-based system, the retrieval routine is generated from a conceptual representation of the meaning of the user query and therefore key words or phrases arm not required. A related problem occurs with queries involving a~reption or quantity. For example, (17) How many employees are in the sales department? light require retrieving the value of a particular field (e.g. NUHBER-OF-EHPLOYEES), or it sight require totalling the number of records in the EH-PLOYEE file that have the correct DEPARTNENT field value, or, if the departments are broken down into offices, it light require totalling the NUN-BER-OF-ENPLOYEES field for each office. In m domain-independent system, the correct parse depends upon the structure of the database and is therefore difficult to handle in a general way. In a knowledge-based system such as PEARL, the different database structures would simply require altering the mapping between the conceptual representaSion of the parse and the retrieval query.","Finally, this reliance on database structure can lead to wrong answers. A classic example is Harris' (1979) 'snowmobile problem =. Yhen Harris' ROBOT system interfaces with a file containing information about homeowner's insurance, the word 'snowmobile\" is defined as any number • 0 in the 'snowmobile field\" of an insurance policy record. This means that as far as ROBOT is concerned, the question 'How many snowmobiles are there? = is no different from \"How many policies have snowmobile coverage?\" However, the correct answers to the two questions will often be very different. If the first question is asked and the second question is answered, the result is an incorrect answer. If the first question cannot be answered due to the structure of the database, the system should inform the user the5 this is the case. ~oogluaioo=.","I have argued above that conceptually-based domain-specific knowledge is absolutely essential for n|turll language database access systems. Systems that rely on dltabase structure for this domain-specific knowledge viii not achieve an acceptable level of performance -- i.e. operate at the level of understanding of a programmer-technician.","Because of the requirement for delian-specific knowledge, conceptually-based systems are restricted t~o limited domains and are not readily portable ~o new content areas. However, eliminating the domain-speciflc conceptual knowledge is throwing &he baby out with the ba&h water. The conceptual-ly-based domain-specific knowledge is the key to robust understanding.","The approach of the PEARL project with regard t~ the &ransportability problem is t~ try and I-dentify areas of discourse that are common t~ most domains and to build robust modules for natural language analysis within these domains. Examples of such domains are temporal reference, loci&ion reference, and report generation. These modules are knowledge-based and can be used by a wide variety of domains to help extract ~hm conceptual content of a requss5. REFERENCES","Dyer, N.
