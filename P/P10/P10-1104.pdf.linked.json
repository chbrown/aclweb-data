Research in this field considers populations of linguistic agents, and asks how the population dynamics are related to the behavior of individual agents. However, most such work makes little contact with empirical data (de Boer and Zuidema, 2009).1","As pointed out by Choudhury (2007), most computational work on language change deals with data from cases of change either not at all, or at a relatively high level.2","Recent computational work has addressed “real world” data from change in several languages (Mitchener, 2005; Choudhury et al., 2006; Choudhury et al., 2007; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007; Daland et al., 2007; Landsbergen, 2009). In the same","1","However, among language evolution researchers there has been significant recent interest in behavioral experiments, using the “iterated learning” paradigm (Griffiths and Kalish, 2007; Kalish et al., 2007; Kirby et al., 2008).","2","We do not review the literature on computational studies of change due to space constraints; see (Baker, 2008; Wang et al., 2005; Niyogi, 2006) for reviews. spirit, we use data from an ongoing stress shift in English noun/verb (N/V) pairs. Because stress has been listed in dictionaries for several centuries, we are able to trace stress longitudinally and at the level of individual words, and observe dynamics significantly more complicated than in changes previously considered in the computational literature. In §2, we summarize aspects of the dynamics to be accounted for by any computational model of the stress shift. We also discuss proposed sources of these dynamics from the literature, based on experimental work by psychologists and linguists.","In §3–4, we develop models in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems (DS), which over the past 15 years has been used to model the interaction between language learning and language change in a variety of settings (Niyogi and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996; Niyogi, 2006; Komarova et al., 2001; Yang, 2001; Yang, 2002; Mitchener, 2005; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007).","We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dynamics in DS terms; this gives a set of 6 desired properties to which any DS model’s dynamics can be compared. We consider 5 models of language learning by individuals, based on the experimental findings relevant to the N/V stress shift, and evaluate the population-level dynamics of the dynamical system model resulting from each against the set of desired properties. We are thus able to reason about which theories of the source of language change — considered as hypotheses about how individuals learn — lead to the population-level patterns observed in change."]},{"title":"2 Data: English N/V pairs","paragraphs":["The data considered here are the stress patterns of English homographic, disyllabic noun/verb pairs (Table 1); we refer to these throughout as “N/V pairs”. Each of the N and V forms of a pair can have initial (σ́σ: cónvict, n.) or final (σσ́: convı́ct, 1019","N V {1, 1} σ́σ σ́σ (exile, anchor, fracture) {1, 2} σ́σ σσ́ (consort, protest, refuse) {2, 2} σσ́ σσ́ (cement, police, review) Table 1: Attested N/V pair stress patterns. v.) stress. We use the notation {Nstress,Vstress} to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=σ́σ, 2=σσ́. Of the four logically possible stress patterns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3 patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.3 No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, {2,1}.","N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and change between these 3 patterns since Middle English (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to {1,2}. The vast majority of stress shifts occurred after 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictionary listing English word stresses was published (Levens, 1570). Many dictionaries from the 17th century on list word stresses, making it possible to trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs in considerable detail. 2.1 Dynamics Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data collected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570– 1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunciations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 British dictionaries, published 1570–2007. Variation and change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by plotting stress trajectories: the moving average of N and V stress vs. time for a given pair. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. The corpus is described in detail in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to be accounted for in a computational model.4 Change Four types of clear-cut change between the three stress patterns are observed:","{2,2}→{1,2} (Fig.1(a)) {1,2}→{1,1}","{1,1}→{1,2} (Fig. 1(b)) {1,2}→{2,2}","However, change to {1,2} is much more common than change from {1,2}; in particular, {2,2}→{1,2} is the most common change. When","3","However, as variation and change in N/V pair stress is ongoing, a few pairs (e.g. perfume) currently have variable stress. By “stress”, we always mean “primary stress”. All present-day pronunciations are for British English, from CELEX (Baayen et al., 1996).","4","The corpus is available on the first author’s home page (currently, people.cs.uchicago.edu/m̃organ). change occurs, it is often fairly sudden, as in Figs. 1(a), 1(b). Finally, change never occurs directly between {1,1} and {2,2}. Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs (Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasized change, in particular {2,2}→{1,2} (the most common change). However, an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability: most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.","The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus and in previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975) as those most likely to have undergone change, and thus are not suitable for studying how stable the three attested stress patterns are. In a random sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) in use over a fixed time period (1700–2007), we find that only 12% have shown variation or change in stress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010). Most pairs maintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress pattern for hundreds of years. A model of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it can be the case both that some pairs show variation and change, and that many do not. Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both synchronic and diachronic variation.","Synchronically, there is variation at the population level in the stress of some N/V pairs at any given time; this is reflected by the inclusion of more than one pronunciation for some N/V pairs in many dictionaries. An important question for modeling is whether there is variation within individual speakers. We show in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010) that there is, for present-day American English speakers, using a corpus of radio speech. For several N/V pairs which have currently variable pronunciation, 1/3 of speakers show variation in the stress of the N form. Metrical evidence from poetry suggests that individual variation also existed in the past; the best evidence is for Shakespeare, who shows variation in the stress of over 20 N/V pairs (Kökeritz, 1953).","Diachronically, a relevant question for modeling is whether all variation is short-lived, or whether stable variation is possible. A particular type of stable variation is in fact observed relatively often in the corpus: either the N or V form stably vary (Fig. 1(c)), but not both at once. Stable variation where both N and V forms vary almost never occurs (Fig. 1(d)).

Sonderegger (2010) shows that this is the case for the most common change, {2,2}→{1,2}: among N/V pairs which were {2,2} in 1700 and are either {2,2} or {1,2} today, those which have undergone change have significantly lower frequencies, on average, than those which have not. In (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010), we give preliminary evidence from real-time frequency trajectories (for <10 N/V pairs) that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers change to {1,2}, but falling frequency. For example, change in combat from {1,1}→{1,2} around 1800 (Fig. 1(b)) coincides with falling word frequency from 1775–present. 2.2 Sources of change The most salient facts about English N/V pair stress are that (a) change is most often to {1,2} (b) the {2,1} pattern never occurs. We summarize two types of explanation for these facts from the experimental literature, each of which exemplifies a commonly-proposed type of explanation for phonological change. In both cases, there is experimental evidence for biases in present-day English speakers reflecting (a–b). We assume that these biases have been active over the course of the N/V stress shift, and can thus be seen as possible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs.5","5","This type of assumption is necessary for any hypothesis about the sources of a completed or ongoing change, based on present-day experimental evidence, and is thus common in the literature. In the case of N/V pairs, it is implicitly made in Kelly’s (1988 et seq) account, discussed below. Both biases discussed here stem from facts about English (Ross’ Generalization; rhythmic context) that we believe have not changed over the time period considered here (≈1600–present), based on general accounts of English historical phonology during this period (Lass, 1992; MacMahon, 1998). We leave more careful verification of this claim to future work. Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics, analogical changes are those which make “...related forms more similar to each other in their phonetic (and morphological) structure” (Hock, 1991).6 Proposed causes for analogical change thus often involve a speaker’s production and perception of a form being influenced by similar forms in their lexicon.","The English lexicon shows a broad tendency, which we call Ross’ generalization, which could be argued to be driving analogical change to {1,2}, and acting against the unobserved stress pattern {2,1}: “primary stress in English nouns is farther to the left than primary stress in English verbs” (Ross, 1973). Change to {1,2} could be seen as motivated by Ross’ generalization, and {2,1} made impossible by it.","The argument is lent plausibility by experimental evidence that Ross’ Generalization is reflected in production and perception. English listeners strongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=σ́σ or V=σσ́) in novel English disyllables (Guion et al., 2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=σσ́ or V=σ́σ) more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli and Cupples, 2003). Mistransmission An influential line of research holds that many phonological changes are based in asymmetric transmission errors: because of articulatory or perceptual factors, listeners systematically mishear some sound α as β, but rarely mishear β as α.7","We call such effects mistransmission. Asymmetric mistransmission (by individu-","6","“Forms” here means any linguistic unit; e.g. sounds, words, or paradigms, such as an N/V pair’s stress pattern.","7","A standard example is final obstruent devoicing, a common change cross-linguistically. There are several articulatory and perceptual reasons why final voiced obstruents could be heard as unvoiced, but no motivation for the reverse process (final unvoiced obstruents heard as voiced) (Blevins, 2006). 1021 als) is argued to be a necessary condition for the change α→β at the population level, and an explanation for why the change α→β is common, while the change β→α is rarely (or never) observed. Mistransmission-based explanations were pioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq.), and are the subject of much recent work (reviewed by Hansson, 2008)","For English N/V pairs, M. Kelly and collaborators have shown mistransmission effects which they propose are responsible for the directionality of the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts ({1,1}, {2,2}→{1,2}), based on “rhythmic context” (Kelly, 1988; Kelly and Bock, 1988; Kelly, 1989). Word stress is misperceived more often as initial in “trochaic-biasing” contexts, where the preceding syllable is weak or the following syllable is heavy; and more often as final in analogously “iambic-biasing” contexts. Nouns occur more frequently in trochaic contexts, and verbs more frequently in iambic contexts; there is thus pressure for the V forms of {1,1} pairs to be misperceived as σσ́, and for the N forms of {2,2} pairs to be misperceived as σ́σ."]},{"title":"3 Modeling preliminaries","paragraphs":["We first describe assumptions and notation for models developed below (§4).","Because of the evidence for within-speaker variation in N/V pair stress (§2.1), in all models described below, we assume that what is learned for a given N/V pair are the probabilities of using the σσ́ form for the N and V forms.","We also make several simplifying assumptions. There are discrete generations Gt, and learners in Gt learn from Gt−1. Each example a learner in Gt hears is equally likely to come from any member of Gt−1. Each learner receives an identical number of examples, and each generation has infinitely many members.","These are idealizations, adopted here to keep models simple enough to analyze; the effects of relaxing some of these assumptions have been explored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009). The infinite-population assumption in particular makes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rules out the possibility of change due to drift (or sample variation), where a form disappears from the population because no examples of it are encountered by learners in Gt in the input from Gt−1. Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in Gt hears N1 examples of the N form, of which kt","1 are σσ́ and (N1-kt","1) are σ́σ; N2 and kt","2 are similarly defined for V examples. Each example is sampled i.i.d. from a random member of Gt−1. The Ni are fixed (each learner hears the same number of examples), while the kt","i are random variables (over learners in Gt). Each learner applies an algorithm A to the N1+N2 examples to learn α̂t, β̂t ∈ [0, 1], the probabilities of producing N and V examples as σσ́. αt, βt are the expectation of α̂t and β̂t over members of Gt: αt = E( α̂t), βt = E( β̂t). α̂t and β̂t are thus random variables (over learners in Gt), while αt, βt ∈ [0, 1] are numbers.","Because learners in Gt draw examples at random from members of Gt−1, the distributions of α̂t and β̂t are determined by (αt−1, βt−1). (αt, βt), the expectations of α̂t and β̂t, are thus determined by (αt−1, βt−1) via an iterated map f :","f : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1]2",", f (αt, βt) = (αt+1, βt+1). 3.1 Dynamical systems We develop and analyze models of populations of language learners in the mathematical framework of (discrete) dynamical systems (DS) (Niyogi and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi, 2006). This setting allows us to determine the diachronic, population-level consequences of assumptions about the learning algorithm used by individuals, as well as assumptions about population structure or the input they receive.","Because it is in general impossible to solve a given iterated map as a function of t, the dynamical systems viewpoint is to understand its longterm behavior by finding its fixed points and bifurcations: changes in the number and stability of fixed points as system parameters vary.","Briefly, α∗ is a fixed point(FP) of f if f (α∗) = α∗; it is stable if lim","t→∞ αt = α∗ for α0 sufficiently near α∗, and unstable otherwise; these are also called stable states and unstable states. Intuitively, α∗ is stable iff the system is stable under small per-turbations from α∗.8","In the context of a linguistic population, change from state α (100% of the population uses {1,1}) to state β (100% of the population uses {1,2}) corresponds to a bifurcation, where some system parameter (N ) passes a critical value (N0). For","8","See (Strogatz, 1994; Hirsch et al., 2004) for introduc-tions to dynamical systems in general, and (Niyogi, 2006) for the type of models considered here. 1022 N <N0, α is stable. For N >N0, α is unstable, and β is stable; this triggers change from α to β. 3.2 DS interpretation of observed dynamics Below, we describe 5 DS models of linguistic populations. To interpret whether each model has properties consistent with the N/V dataset, we translate the observations about the dynamics of N/V stress made above (§2.1) into DS terms. This gives a list of desired properties against which to evaluate the properties of each model.","1. ∗ {2,1}: {2,1} is not a stable state.","2. Stability of {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}: These stress patterns correspond to stable states (for some system parameter values).","3. Observed stable variation: Stable states are possible (for some system parameter values) corresponding to variation in the N or V form, but not both.","4. Sudden change: Change from one stress pattern to another corresponds to a bifurcation, where the fixed point corresponding to the old stress pattern becomes unstable.","5. Observed changes: There are bifurcations corresponding to each of the four observed changes ({1,1} ⇀↽ {1,2}, {2,2} ⇀↽ {1,2}).","6. Observed frequency dependence: Change to {1,2} corresponds to a bifurcation in frequency (N ), where {2,2} or {1,1} loses stability as N is decreased."]},{"title":"4 Models","paragraphs":["We now describe 5 DS models, each corresponding to a learning algorithm A used by individual language learners. Each A leads to an iterated map, f (αt, βt) = (αt+1, βt+1), which describes the state of the population of learners over successive generations. We give these evolution equations for each model, then discuss their dynamics, i.e. bifurcation structure. Each model’s dynamics are evaluated with respect to the set of desired properties corresponding to patterns observed in the N/V data. Derivations have been mostly omitted for reasons of space, but are given in (Sonderegger, 2009).","The models differ along two dimensions, corresponding to assumptions about the learning algorithm (A): whether or not it is assumed that the stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted (Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabilities acquired by a given learner are coupled. In Model 1 there is no coupling ( α̂t and β̂t learned independently), in Models 2–3 coupling takes the form of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross’ generalization, and in Models 4–5 different stress patterns have different prior probabilities.9 4.1 Model 1: Mistransmission Motivated by the evidence for asymmetric misperception of N/V pair stress (§2.2), suppose the stress of N=σσ́ and V=σ́σ examples may be misperceived (as N=σ́σ and V=σσ́), with mistransmission probabilities p and q.","Learners are assumed to simply probability match: α̂t = kt","1/N1, β̂t = kt","2/N2, where kt","1 is the number of N and V examples heard as σσ́ (etc.) The probabilities pN,t & pV,t of hearing an N or V example as final stressed at t are then pN,t = αt−1(1 − p), pV,t = βt−1 + (1 − βt−1)q (1) kt 1 and kt","2 are binomially-distributed:","PB(kt 1, kt","2) ≡","( N1 kt 1",")","pN,tkt 1 (1 − pN,t)N1−kt","1","×( N2 kt 2",")","pV,tkt 2 (1 − pV,t)N2−kt","2","(2) αt and βt, the probability that a random member of Gt produces N and V examples as σσ́, are the ensemble averages of α̂t and β̂t over all members of Gt. Because we have assumed infinitely many learners per generation, αt=E( α̂t) and βt=E( β̂t). Using (1), and the formula for the expectation of a binomially-distributed random variable: αt = αt−1(1 − p) (3) βt = βt−1 + (1 − βt−1)q (4) these are the evolution equations for Model 1. Due to space constraints we do not give the (more lengthy) derivations of the evolution equations in Models 2–5. Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed point of evolution equations (3–4): (α∗, β∗) = (0, 1), corresponding to the stress pattern {1,2}. This model thus shows none of the desired properties discussed in §3.2, except that {1,2} corresponds to a stable state.","9","The sixth possible model (no coupling, no mistransmission) is a special case of Model 1, resulting in the identity map: αt+1 = αt, βt+1 = βt. 1023 4.2 Model 2: Coupling by constraint Motivated by the evidence for English speakers’ productive knowledge of Ross’ Generalization (§2.2), we consider a second learning model in which the learner attempts to probability match as above, but the ( α̂t, β̂t) learned must satisfy the constraint that σσ́ stress be more probable in the V form than in the N form.","Formally, the learner chooses ( α̂t, β̂t) satisfying a quadratic optimization problem: minimize [(α − kt 1 N1",")2","+ (β − kt","2","N2",")2 ] s.t. α ≤ β This corresponds to the following algorithm, A2: 1.

It does not have bifurcations, or the observed patterns of change and frequency dependence.","4.3 Model 3: Coupling by constraint, with mistransmission We now assume that each example is subject to mistransmission, as in Model 1; the learner then applies A2 to the heard examples. The evolution equations are thus the same as in (5), but with αt−1 and βt−1 changed to pN,t, pV,t (Eqn. 1). Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed point, corresponding to stable variation in both N and V. This model thus shows none of the desired properties, except that {2,1} is not a stable FP (by construction). 4.4 Model 4: Coupling by priors The type of coupling assume in Models 2–3 — a constraint on the relative probability of σσ́ stress for N and V forms — has the drawback that there is no way for the rest of the lexicon to affect a pair’s N and V stress probabilities: there can be no influence of the stress of other N/V pairs, or in the lexicon as a whole, on the N/V pair being learned. Models 4–5 allow such influence by formalizing a simple intuitive explanation for the lack of {2, 1} N/V pairs: learners cannot hypothesize a {2, 1} pair because there is no support for this pattern in their lexicons.","We now assume that learners compute the probabilities of each possible N/V pair stress pattern, rather than separate probabilities for the N and V forms. We assume that learners keep two sets of probabilities (for {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}):","1. Learned probabilities: ⃗P =(P11, P12, P22, P21), where P11 =","N1−kt 1 N1 N2−kt","2 N2 , P12 =","N1−kt 1 N1 kt 2 N2 P22 = kt 1 N1 kt 2 N2 , P21 = kt 1 N1","N2−kt 2 N2","2. Prior probabilities: ⃗λ = (λ11, λ12, λ21, λ22), based on the support for each stress pattern in the lexicon. The learner then produces N forms as follows: 1. Pick a pattern {n1, v1} according to ⃗P . 2. Pick a pattern {n2, v2} according to ⃗λ 3. Repeat 1–2 until n1=n2, then produce N=n1. V forms are produced similarly, but checking whether v1 = v2 at step 3. Learners’ production of an N/V pair is thus influenced by both their learning experience (for the particular N/V pair) and by how much support exists in their lexicon for the different stress patterns.","We leave the exact interpretation of the λij ambiguous; they could be the percentage of N/V pairs already learned which follow each stress pattern, for example. Motivated by the absence of {2,1} N/V pairs in English, we assume that λ21 = 0. 1024","By following the production algorithm above, the learner’s probabilities of producing N and V forms as σσ́ are:","α̂t = α̃(kt 1, kt","2) =","λ22P22 λ11P11 + λ12P12 + λ22P22 (6)","β̂t = β̃(kt 1, kt","2) =","λ12P12 + λ22P22 λ11P11 + λ12P12 + λ22P22 (7) Eqns. 6–7 are undefined when (kt","1, kt","2)=(N1, 0); in this case we set α̃(N1, 0) = λ22 and β̃(N1, 0) = λ12 + λ22.

However, change from {1,2} entails crossing the hyperplane R=1, which does change as N1 and N2 vary (Eqn. 10), so change from {1,2} is frequency-dependent. Thus, although there is frequency dependence in this model, it is not as observed in the diachronic data, where change to {1,2} is frequency-dependent.","Finally, no stable variation is possible: in every stable state, all members of the population categorically use a single stress pattern. {2,1} is never a stable FP, by construction.","4.5 Model 5: Coupling by priors, with mistransmission We now suppose that each example from a learner’s data is possibly mistransmitted, as in Model 1; the learner then applies the algorithm from Model 4 to the heard examples (instead of using kt","1, kt","2) .

As in Model 4, the bifurcation structure","implies all 6 possible changes between the three","FPs. However, change to {1,2} entails crossing","the hyperplanes λ′ 11=λ′","12 and λ′","2=λ′","12, and is thus now frequency dependent.","In particular, consider a system at a stable FP (γ, 1), for some N/V pair.

Assuming that the λij are fixed, this occurs only if N1 falls below a critical value, N ∗","1 = (1 − λ22","λ12 (1 − p))−1","; the system would then transition to (0, 1), the only stable state. By a similar argument, falling frequency can lead to change from (0, κ) to (0, 1). Falling frequency can thus cause change to {1,2} in this model, as seen in the N/V data; Fig. 4 shows an example.","Unlike in Model 4, stable variation of the type seen in the N/V stress trajectories — one of N or V stably varying, but not both — is possible for some parameter values. (0, 0) and (1, 1) (corresponding to {1,1} and {2,2}) are technically never possible, but effectively occur for FPs of the form (κ, 0) and (γ, 1) when κ or γ are small. {2,1} is never a stable FP, by construction.","This model thus arguably shows all of the desired properties seen in the N/V data.

Table 2: Summary of model properties 4.6 Models summary, observations Table 2 lists which of Models 1–5 show each of the desired properties (from §3.2), corresponding to aspects of the observed diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress.","Based on this set of models, we are able to make some observations about the effect of different assumptions about learning by individuals on population-level dynamics. Models including asymmetric mistransmission (1, 3, 5) generally do not lead to stable states in which the entire population uses {1,1} or {2,2}. (In Model 5, stable variation very near {1,1} or {2,2} is possible.) However, {1,1} and {2,2} are diachronically very stable stress patterns, suggesting that at least for this model set, assuming mistransmission in the learner is problematic. Models 2–3, where analogy is implemented as a hard constraint based on Ross’ generalization, do not give most desired properties. Models 4–5, where analogy is implemented as prior probabilities over N/V stress patterns, show crucial aspects of the observed dynamics: bifurcations corresponding to the changes observed in the stress data. Model 5 shows change to {1,2} triggered by falling frequency, a pattern observed in the stress data, and an emergent property of the model dynamics: this frequency effect is not present in Models 1 or 4, but is present in Model 5, where the learner combines mistransmission (Model 1) with coupling by priors (Model 4)."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["We have developed 5 dynamical systems models for a relatively complex diachronic change, found one successful model, and were able to reason about the source of model behavior. Each model describes the diachronic, population-level consequences of assuming a particular learning algorithm for individuals. The algorithms considered 1026 were motivated by different possible sources of change, from linguistics and psychology (§2.2). We discuss novel contributions of this work, and future directions.","The dataset used here shows more complex dynamics, to our knowledge, than in changes previously considered in the computational literature. By using a detailed, longitudinal dataset, we were able to strongly constrain the desired behavior of a computational model, so that the task of model building is not “doomed to success”. While all models show some patterns observed in the data, only one shows all such properties. We believe detailed datasets are potentially very useful for evaluating and differentiating between proposed computational models of change.","This paper is a first attempt to integrate detailed data with a range of DS models. We have only considered some schematic properties of the dynamics observed in our dataset, and used these to qualitatively compare each model’s predictions to the dynamics. Future work should consider the dynamics in more detail, develop more complex models (for example, by relaxing the infinite-population assumption, allowing for stochastic dynamics), and quantitatively compare model predictions and observed dynamics.","We were able to reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population dynamics by analyzing a range of simple, related models. This approach is pursued in more depth in the larger set of models considered in (Sonderegger, 2009). Our use of model comparison contrasts with most recent computational work on change, where a small number (1–2) of very complex models are analyzed, allowing for much more detailed models of language learning and usage than those considered here (e.g. Choudhury et al., 2006; Minett & Wang, 2008; Baxter et al., 2009; Landsbergen, 2009). An advantage of our approach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of proposed causes for a particular case of language change.","By using simple models, we were able to consider a range of learning algorithms corresponding to different explanations for the observed diachronic dynamics. What makes this a useful exercise is the fundamentally non-trivial map, illustrated by Models 1–5, between individual learning and population-level dynamics. Although the type of individual learning assumed in each model was chosen with the same patterns of change in mind, and despite the simplicity of the models used, the resulting population-level dynamics differ greatly. This is an important point given that proposed explanations for change (e.g., mistransmission and analogy) operate at the level of individuals, while the phenomena being explained (patterns of change, or particular changes) are aspects of the population-level dynamics."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Max Bane, James Kirby, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["J.
