In this paper we investigate a novel problem of discovering patterns based on emotion and the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in blogosphere, a representative for social media. We propose the use of normative emotional scores for English words in combination with a psychological model of emotion measurement and a nonparametric clustering process for inferring meaningful emotion patterns automatically from data. Our results on a dataset consisting of more than 17 million mood-groundtruthed blogposts have shown interesting evidence of the emotion patterns automatically discovered that match well with the core-affect emotion model theorized by psychologists. We then present a method based on information theory to discover the association of moods and affective lexicon usage in the new media."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Social media provides communication and interaction channels where users can freely participate in, express their opinions, make their own content, and interact with other users. Users in this new media are more comfortable in expressing their feelings, opinions, and ideas. Thus, the resulting user-generated content tends to be more subjective than other written genres, and thus, is more appealing to be investigated in terms of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. Research in sentiment analysis has recently attracted much atten-tion (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotion patterns and studying the affective lexicon used in social media have received little attention.","Work in sentiment analysis in social media is often limited to finding the sentiment sign in the dipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text. Extensions to this task include the three-class classification (adding neutral to the polarity) and locating the value of emotion the text carries across a spectrum of valence scores. On the other hand, it is well appreciated by psychologists that sentiment has much richer structures than the aforementioned simplified polarity. For example, emotion – a form of expressive sentiment – was suggested by psychologists to be measured in terms of valence and arousal (Russell, 2009). Thus, we are motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogosphere in a more fine-grained fashion. In this paper we study the grouping behaviors of the emotion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blogposts. We are inspired to get insights into the ques-tion of whether these structures can be discovered directly from data without the cost of involving human participants as in traditional psychological studies. Next, we aim to study the relationship between the data-driven emotion structures discovered and those proposed by psychologists.","Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment on lexical access is great in a psychology perspective. However, to our knowledge, limited work exists to examine the same tasks in social media context.","The contribution in this paper is twofold. To our understanding, we study a novel problem of emotion-based pattern discovery in blogosphere. We provide an initial solution for the matter using a combination of psychological models, affective norm scores for English words, a novel feature representation scheme, and a nonparametric clustering to automatically group moods into meaningful emotion patterns. We believe that we are the first to consider the matter of data-driven emotion pattern discovery at the scale presented in this 43 paper. Secondly, we explore a novel problem of detecting the mood – affective lexicon usage correlation in the new media, and propose a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover this sentiment – linguistic association."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Much work in sentiment analysis measures the value of emotion the text convey in a continuum range of valence (Pang and Lee, 2008). Emo-tion patterns have often been used in sentiment analysis limited to this one-dimensional formulation. On the other hand, in psychology, emotions have often been represented in dimensional and discrete perspectives. In the former, emotion states are conceptualized as combinations of some factors like valence and arousal. In contrast, the latter style argues that each emotion has a unique coincidence of experience, psychology and behavior (Mauss and Robinson, 2009). Our work utilizes the dimensional representation, and in particular, the core-affect model (Russell, 2009), which encodes emotion states along the valence and arousal dimensions. The sentiment scoring for emotion bearing words is available in a lexicon known as Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) (Bradley and Lang, 1999). Related work making use of ANEW includes (Dodds and Danforth, 2009) for estimating happiness levels in three types of data: song lyrics, blogs, and the State of the Union addresses.","From a psychological perspective, for estimating mood effects in lexicon decisions, (Chastain et al., 1995) investigates the influence of moods on the access of affective words. For learning affect in blogosphere, (Leshed and Kaye, 2006) utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict moods for coming blog posts and detect mood synonymy."]},{"title":"3 Moods and Affective Lexicon Access 3.1 Mood Pattern Detection","paragraphs":["Livejournal provides a comprehensive set of 132 moods for users to tag their moods when blogging. The provided moods range diversely in the emotion spectrum but typically are observed to fall into soft clusters such as happiness (cheerful or grateful) or sadness (discontent or uncomfortable). We call each cluster of these moods an emotion pattern and aim to detect them in this paper.","We observe that the blogposts tagged with moods in the same emotion pattern have similar","7.27","7.36","7.47","7.51 7.59 7.63","7.72","7.97","8.1","8.170 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 ANEW and their arousal values Usage proportion of ANEW   ANGRY P*SSED OFF HAPPY CHEERFUL","surprised","terrorist sexy","assault","anger win","enraged","orgasm","rage","romantic Figure 1: ANEW usage proportion in the posts tagged with happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off proportions in the usage of ANEW. For example, in Figure 1 – a plot of the usage of ANEW having arousal in the range of 7.2 – 8.2 in the blogposts – we could see that the ANEW usage patterns of happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off are well separated. Anger, enraged, and rage will be most likely found in the angry/p*ssed off tagged posts and least likely found in the happy/cheerful ones. In contrast, the ANEW as romantic or surprised are not commonly used in the posts tagged with angry/p*ssed off but most popularly used in the happy/cheerful ones; suggesting that, the similarity between ANEW usage patterns can be used as a basis to study the structure of mood space.","Let us denote by B the corpus of all blogposts and by M= {sad, happy, ...} the predefined set of moods (|M| = 132). Each blogpost b ∈ B in the corpus is labeled with a mood lb ∈ M. Denote by n the number of ANEW (n = 1034). Let xm","= [xm","1 , ..., xm","i , ..., xm","n ] be the vector representing the usage of ANEW by the mood m. Thus, xm i =","∑","b∈B,lb=m cib, where cib is the counting of the ANEW i-th occurrence in the blogpost b tagged with the mood m. The usage vector is normalized so that","∑n","i=1 xm","i = 1 for all m ∈ M. To discover the grouping of the moods based on the usage vectors we use a nonparametric clustering algorithm known as Affinity Propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007). AP is desirable here because it automatically discovers the number of clusters as well as the cluster exemplars. The algorithm only requires the pairwise similarities between moods, which we compute based on the Euclidean distances for simplicity.","To map the emotion patterns detected to their psychological meaning, we proceed to measure 44 the sentiment scores of those |M| mood words. In particular, we use ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), which is a set of 1034 sentiment conveying English words. The valence and arousal of moods are assigned by those of the same words in the ANEW lexicon. For those moods which are not in ANEW, their values are assigned by those of the nearest father words in the mood hierarchical tree1",", where those moods conveying the same meaning, to some extent, are in the same level of the tree. Thus, each member of the mood clusters can be placed onto the a 2D representation along the valence and arousal dimensions, making it feasible to compare with the core-affect model (Russell, 2009) theorized by psychologists. 3.2 Mood and ANEW Usage Association To study the statistical strength of an ANEW word with respect to a particular mood, the information gain measure (Mitchell, 1997) is adopted. Given a collection of blog posts B consisting of those tagged or not tagged with a target class attribute mood m. The entropy of B relative to this binary classification is H(B) = −p⊕ log2(p⊕) − p⊖ log2 p⊖","where p⊕ and p⊖ are the proportions of the posts tagged and not tagged with m respectively.","The entropy of B relative to the binary classification given a binary attribute A (e.g. if the word A present or not) observed is computed as H(B|A) = |B⊕| |B| H(B⊕) + |B⊖| |B| H(B⊖)","where B⊕ is the subset of B for which attribute A is present in the corpus and B⊖ is the subset of B for which attribute A is absent in the corpus.","The information gain of an attribute ANEW A in classifying the collection with respect to the target class attribute mood m, IG(m, A), is the reduction in entropy caused by partitioning the examples according to the attribute A. Thus, IG(m, A) = H(B) − H(B|A)","With respect to a given mood m, those ANEW having high information gain are considered likely to be associated with the mood. This measure, also often considered a term-goodness criterion, outperforms others in feature selection in text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).","1","http://www.livejournal.com/moodlist.bml"]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results 4.1 Mood Patterns","paragraphs":["We use a large Livejournal blogpost dataset, which contains more than 17 million blogposts tagged with the predefined moods.

We learn that nearly all members in the same patterns express a common affect concept. Those moods in the patterns with cheerful, pensive, and rejuvenated as the exemplars are mostly located in the first quarter of the affect circle (00","– 900","), which should contain moods being high in both pleasure and activation measures. Meanwhile, many members of the angry and aggravated patterns are found in the second quarter (900","– 1800","), which roughly means that those moods express the feeling of sadness in the high of activation. The patterns with the exemplars nauseated and tired contain a majority of moods found in the third quarter (1800","– 2700","), which could be representatives for the mood fashion of sadness and deactivation. In addition, the grateful group could be a representative for moods which are both low in pleasure and in the degree of activation (2700","– 3600","of the affect circle). Thus, the clustering process based on the ANEW usage could separate moods having similar affect scores into corresponding segments in the circle proposed in (Russell, 2009).","To visualize mood patterns that have been detected, we plot these emotion modes on the affect circle plane in Figure 4.

We presented a method for feature representation based on the affective norms of English scores usage. We then presented an unsupervised approach using Affinity Propagation, a nonparametric clustering algorithm that does not require the number of clusters a priori, for detecting emotion patterns in blogosphere. The results are showing that those automatically discovered patterns match well with the core-affect model for emotion, which is independently formulated in the psychology literature. In addition, we proposed a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover mood–lexicon correlation in blogosphere, giving hints on predicting moods based on the affective lexicon usage and vice versa in the social media. Our results could also have potential uses in sentiment-aware social media applications.","Future work will take into account the temporal dimension to trace changes in mood patterns over time in blogosphere. Another direction is to integrate negation information to learn more cohesive association in affect scores between moods and affective words. In addition, a new affective lexicon could be automatically detected based on learning correlation of the blog text and the moods tagged."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["I. Borg and P.J.F.
