On top of the pruning framework, we also propose a discriminative ITG alignment model using hierarchical phrase pairs, which improves both F-score and Bleu score over the baseline alignment system of GIZA++."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Inversion transduction grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) is an adaptation of SCFG to bilingual parsing. It does synchronous parsing of two languages with phrasal and word-level alignment as by-product. For this reason ITG has gained more and more attention recently in the word alignment community (Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009).","A major obstacle in ITG alignment is speed. The original (unsupervised) ITG algorithm has complexity of O(n","6","). When extended to supervised/discriminative framework, ITG runs even more slowly. Therefore all attempts to ITG alignment come with some pruning method. For example, Haghighi et al. (2009) do pruning based on the probabilities of links from a simpler alignment model (viz. HMM); Zhang and Gildea (2005) propose Tic-tac-toe pruning, which is based on the Model 1 probabilities of word pairs inside and outside a pair of spans.","As all the principles behind these techniques have certain contribution in making good pruning decision, it is tempting to incorporate all these features in ITG pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative pruning framework for discriminative ITG. The pruning model uses no more training data than the discriminative ITG parser itself, and it uses a log-linear model to in-tegrate all features that help identify the correct span pair (like Model 1 probability and HMM posterior). On top of the discriminative pruning method, we also propose a discriminative ITG alignment system using hierarchical phrase pairs.","In the following, some basic details on the ITG formalism and ITG parsing are first reviewed (Sections 2 and 3), followed by the definition of pruning in ITG (Section 4). The “Discriminative Pruning for Discriminative ITG” model (DPDI) and our discriminative ITG (DITG) parsers will be elaborated in Sections 5 and 6 respectively. The merits of DPDI and DITG are illustrated with the experiments described in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Basics of ITG","paragraphs":["The simplest formulation of ITG contains three types of rules: terminal unary rules X → e/f , where e and f represent words (possibly a null word, ε) in the English and foreign language respectively, and the binary rules X → X, X and X → X, X , which refer to that the component English and foreign phrases are combined in the same and inverted order respectively.","From the viewpoint of word alignment, the terminal unary rules provide the links of word pairs, whereas the binary rules represent the reordering factor. One of the merits of ITG is that it is less biased towards short-distance reordering.","Such a formulation has two drawbacks. First of all, it imposes a 1-to-1 constraint in word alignment. That is, a word is not allowed to align to more than one word. This is a strong limitation as no idiom or multi-word expression is allowed to align to a single word on the other side. In fact there have been various attempts in relaxing the 1-to-1 constraint. Both ITG alignment 316 approaches with and without this constraint will be elaborated in Section 6.","Secondly, the simple ITG leads to redundancy if word alignment is the sole purpose of applying ITG. For instance, there are two parses for three consecutive word pairs, viz. [a/a’ [b/b’ c/ c’] ] and [[a/a’ b/b’] c/c’] . The problem of redundancy is fixed by adopting ITG normal form. In fact, normal form is the very first key to speed-ing up ITG. The ITG normal form grammar as used in this paper is described in Appendix A."]},{"title":"3 Basics of ITG Parsing","paragraphs":["Based on the rules in normal form, ITG word alignment is done in a similar way to chart parsing (Wu, 1997). The base step applies all relevant terminal unary rules to establish the links of word pairs. The word pairs are then combined into span pairs in all possible ways. Larger and larger span pairs are recursively built until the sentence pair is built.","Figure 1(a) shows one possible derivation for a toy example sentence pair with three words in each sentence. Each node (rectangle) represents a pair, marked with certain phrase category, of foreign span (F-span) and English span (E-span) (the upper half of the rectangle) and the associated alignment hypothesis (the lower half). Each graph like Figure 1(a) shows only one derivation and also only one alignment hypothesis.","The various derivations in ITG parsing can be compactly represented in hypergraph (Klein and Manning, 2001) like Figure 1(b). Each hypernode (rectangle) comprises both a span pair (upper half) and the list of possible alignment hypotheses (lower half) for that span pair. The hyperedges show how larger span pairs are derived from smaller span pairs. Note that a hypernode may have more than one alignment hypothesis, since a hypernode may be derived through more than one hyperedge (e.g. the topmost hypernode in Figure 1(b)). Due to the use of normal form, the hypotheses of a span pair are different from each other."]},{"title":"4 Pruning in ITG Parsing","paragraphs":["The ITG parsing framework has three levels of pruning: 1) To discard some unpromising span pairs; 2) To discard some unpromising F-spans","and/or E-spans; 3) To discard some unpromising alignment","hypotheses for a particular span pair.","The second type of pruning (used in Zhang et. al. (2008)) is very radical as it implies discarding too many span pairs. It is empirically found to be highly harmful to alignment performance and therefore not adopted in this paper.","The third type of pruning is equivalent to minimizing the beam size of alignment hypotheses in each hypernode. It is found to be well handled by the K-Best parsing method in Huang and Chiang (2005). That is, during the bottom-up construction of the span pair repertoire, each span pair keeps only the best alignment hypothesis. Once the complete parse tree is built, the k-best list of the topmost span is obtained by minimally expanding the list of alignment hypotheses of minimal number of span pairs.","The first type of pruning is equivalent to minimizing the number of hypernodes in a hypergraph. The task of ITG pruning is defined in this paper as the first type of pruning; i.e. the search for, given an F-span, the minimal number of E-spans which are the most likely counterpart of that F-span. 1","The pruning method should maintain a balance between efficiency (run as quickly as possible) and performance (keep as many correct span pairs as possible).  1 Alternatively it can be defined as the search of the minimal number of E-spans per F-span. That is simply an arbitrary decision on how the data are organized in the ITG parser.

This score is used to rank all E-spans for a particular F-span, and the score of the correct E-span should be in general higher than most of the in-correct ones."]},{"title":"5 The DPDI Framework","paragraphs":["DPDI, the discriminative pruning model proposed in this paper, assigns score to a span pair f , e as probability from a log-linear model: P e f =","exp( λiΨi f , e i ) exp( λiΨi(f , e ′))ie ′∈E (1) where each Ψi(f , e ) is some feature about the span pair, and each λ is the weight of the corresponding feature. There are three major questions to this model: 1) How to acquire training samples? (Section","5.1) 2) How to train the parameters λ ? (Section 5.2) 3) What are the features? (Section 5.3) 5.1 Training Samples Discriminative approaches to word alignment use manually annotated alignment for sentence pairs. Discriminative pruning, however, handles not only a sentence pair but every possible span pair. The required training samples consist of various F-spans and their corresponding E-spans.","Rather than recruiting annotators for marking span pairs, we modify the parsing algorithm in Section 3 so as to produce span pair annotation out of sentence-level annotation. In the base step, only the word pairs listed in sentence-level annotation are inserted in the hypergraph, and the recursive steps are just the same as usual.","If the sentence-level annotation satisfies the alignment constraints of ITG, then each F-span will have only one E-span in the parse tree. However, in reality there are often the cases where a foreign word aligns to more than one English word. In such cases the F-span covering that foreign word has more than one corresponding E-spans. Consider the example in Figure 2, where the golden links in the alignment annotation are e1/f1, e2/f1, and e3/f2; i.e. the foreign word f1 aligns to both the English words e1 and e2. Therefore the F-span f1, f1 aligns to the E-span e1, e1 in one hypernode and to the E-span e2, e2 in another hypernode. When such situation happens, we calculate the product of the inside and outside probability of each alignment hypothesis of the span pair, based on the probabilities of the links from some simpler alignment model 2 .

If we apply some classifier for parameter training, then negative samples are also needed. Fortunately, our parameter training does not rely on any negative samples. 5.2 MERT for Pruning Parameter training of DPDI is based on Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003), a widely used method in SMT. MERT for SMT estimates model parameters with the objective of minimizing certain measure of translation errors (or maximizing certain performance measure of translation quality) for a development corpus. Given an SMT system which produces, with  2 The formulae of the inside and outside probability of a span pair will be elaborated in Section 5.3.

Instead of a development corpus with reference translations, we have a collection of training samples, each of which is a pair of F-span (fs) and its corresponding E-span (rs). These samples are acquired from some manually aligned dataset by the method elaborated in Section 5.1. The ITG parser outputs for each fs a K-best list of E-spans e fs; λ1M based on the current parameter values λ1M",".","The error function is based on the presence and the rank of the correct E-span in the K-best list: E rs, e fs; λ1M = −rank rs if rs ∈ e fs; λ1M","penalty ot𝑕erwise","(2) where rank rs is the (0-based) rank of the correct E-span rs in the K-best list e fs; λ1M . If rs is not in the K-best list at all, then the error is defined to be penalty, which is set as -100000 in our experiments. The rationale underlying this error function is to keep as many correct E-spans as possible in the K-best lists of E-spans, and push the correct E-spans upward as much as possible in the K-best lists.","This new error measure leads to a change in details of the training algorithm. In MERT for SMT, the interval boundaries at which the performance or error measure changes are defined by the upper envelope (illustrated by the dash line in Figure 4(a)), since the performance/error measure depends on the best candidate translation. In MERT for DPDI, however, the error measure depends on the correct E-span rather than the E-span leading to the highest system score. Thus the interval boundaries are the intersections between the correct E-span and all other candidate E-spans (as shown in Figure 4(b)). The rank of the correct E-span in each interval can then be figured out as shown in Figure 4(c). Finally, the error measure in each interval can be calculated by Equation (2) (as shown in Figure 4(d)). All other steps in MERT for DPDI are the same as that for SMT.

Note that the beam size (max number of E-spans) for each F-span is 10. 5.3 Features","The features used in DPDI are divided into three","categories:","1) Model 1-based probabilities. Zhang and Gildea (2005) show that Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney., 2000) probabilities of the word pairs inside and outside a span pair ( ei1, ei2 /[fj1, fj2]) are useful. Hence these two features: a) Inside probability (i.e. probability of","word pairs within the span pair): pinc ei1,i2 fj1,j2 =","1 j2 − j1 pM1 ei fj j∈ j1,j2 i∈ i1,i2 ","b) Outside probability (i.e. probability of the word pairs outside the span pair): pout ei1,i2 fj1,j2 =","1 J − j2 + j1 pM1 ei fj j ∉ j1,j2 i∉ i1,i2 ","where J is the length of the foreign sen-","tence.","2) Heuristics. There are four features in this cat-","egory. The features are explained with the 319 example of Figure 5, in which the span pair in interest is e2, e3 /[f1, f2]. The four links are produced by some simpler alignment model like HMM. The word pair e2/f1 is the only link in the span pair. The links e4/f2 and e3/f3 are inconsistent with the span pair.3"," f1 f2 f3 f4 e1 e2 e3 e4"," Figure 5: Example for heuristic features a) Link ratio: 2×#links flen +elen  where #links is the number of links in the span pair, and flen and elen are the length of the foreign and English spans respectively.

In the first stage DPDI selects good span pairs. In the second stage good alignment hypotheses are assigned to the span pairs selected by DPDI. Two discriminative ITG (DITG) models are investigated. One is word-to-word DITG (henceforth W-DITG), which observes the 1-to-1 constraint on alignment. Another is DITG with hierarchical phrase pairs (henceforth HP-DITG), which relaxes the 1-to-1 constraint by adopting hierarchical phrase pairs in Chiang (2007).","Each model selects the best alignment hypotheses of each span pair, given a set of features. The contributions of these features are integrated through a log linear model (similar to Liu et al., 2005; Moore, 2005) like Equation (1). The discriminative training of the feature weights is again MERT (Och, 2003). The MERT module for DITG takes alignment F-score of a sentence pair as the performance measure. Given an input sentence pair and the reference annotated alignment, MERT aims to maximize the F-score of DITG-produced alignment. Like SMT (and un-like DPDI), it is the upper envelope which defines the intervals where the performance measure changes. 6.1 Word-to-word DITG","The following features about alignment link are","used in W-DITG:","1) Word pair translation probabilities trained","from HMM model (Vogel, et.al., 1996)","and IBM model 4 (Brown et.al., 1993;","Och and Ney, 2000).","2) Conditional link probability (Moore, 2005).","3) Association score rank features (Moore et","al., 2006).","4) Distortion features: counts of inversion","and concatenation.","5) Difference between the relative positions","of the words. The relative position of a","word in a sentence is defined as the posi-320 tion of the word divided by sentence length.","6) Boolean features like whether a word in the word pair is a stop word. 6.2 DITG with Hierarchical Phrase Pairs The 1-to-1 assumption in ITG is a serious limitation as in reality there are always segmentation or tokenization errors as well as idiomatic expressions. Wu (1997) proposes a bilingual segmentation grammar extending the terminal rules by including phrase pairs. Cherry and Lin (2007) incorporate phrase pairs in phrase-based SMT into ITG, and Haghighi et al. (2009) introduce Block ITG (BITG), which adds 1-to-many or many-to-1 terminal unary rules.","It is interesting to see if DPDI can benefit the parsing of a more realistic ITG.

(Note that span pairs of any category in the ITG normal form grammar can substitute for X1 or X2 .) If both conditions hold, then the span pair is assigned an alignment hypothesis which combines the alignment links among the lexical anchors (like of/的) and those links among the sub-span pairs.","HP-ITG acquires the rules from HMM-based word-aligned corpus using standard phrase pair extraction as stated in Chiang (2007).

Based on DPDI, HP-DITG is evaluated against the alignment systems GIZA++ and BITG. 7.1 Evaluation Criteria Four evaluation criteria are used in addition to the time spent on ITG parsing. We will first evaluate pruning regarding the pruning decisions themselves. That is, the first evaluation metric, pruning error rate (henceforth PER), measures how many correct E-spans are discarded. The major drawback of PER is that not all decisions in pruning would impact on alignment quality, since certain F-spans are of little use to the entire ITG parse tree.","An alternative criterion is the upper bound on alignment F-score, which essentially measures how many links in annotated alignment can be kept in ITG parse. The calculation of F-score upper bound is done in a bottom-up way like ITG parsing. All leaf hypernodes which contain a correct link are assigned a score (known as hit) of 1. The hit of a non-leaf hypernode is based on the sum of hits of its daughter hypernodes. The maximal sum among all hyperedges of a hypernode is assigned to that hypernode.

We use the manually aligned Chinese-English dataset as used in Haghighi et al. (2009). The 491 sentence pairs in this dataset are adapted to our own Chinese word segmentation standard. 250 sentence pairs are used as training data and the other 241 are test data. The corresponding numbers of F-spans in training and test data are 4590 and 3951 respectively.","In SMT experiments, the bilingual training dataset is the NIST training set excluding the Hong Kong Law and Hong Kong Hansard, and our 5-gram language model is trained from the Xinhua section of the Gigaword corpus. The NIST‟03 test set is used as our development corpus and the NIST‟05 and NIST‟08 test sets are our test sets. 7.3 Small-scale Evaluation The first set of experiments evaluates the performance of the three pruning methods using the small 241-sentence set. Each pruning method is plugged in both W-DITG and HP-DITG. IBM Model 1 and HMM alignment model are reimplemented as they are required by the three ITG pruning methods.","The results for W-DITG are listed in Table 1. Tests 1 and 2 show that with the same beam size (i.e. number of E-spans per F-span), although DPDI spends a bit more time (due to the more complicated model), DPDI makes far less incor-rect pruning decisions than the TTT. In terms of F-score upper bound, DPDI is 1 percent higher. DPDI achieves even larger improvement in actual F-score.","To enable TTT achieving similar F-score or F-score upper bound, the beam size has to be doubled and the time cost is more than twice the original (c.f. Tests 1 and 3 in Table 1) .","The DP pruning in Haghighi et.al. (2009) per-forms much poorer than the other two pruning methods. In fact, we fail to enable DP achieve the same F-score upper bound as the other two methods before DP leads to intolerable memory consumption. This may be due to the use of different HMM model implementations between our work and Haghighi et.al. (2009).","Table 2 lists the results for HP-DITG. Roughly the same observation as in W-DITG can be made. In addition to the superiority of DPDI, it can also be noted that HP-DITG achieves much higher F-score and F-score upper bound. This shows that 322 hierarchical phrase is a powerful tool in rectify-ing the 1-to-1 constraint in ITG.","Note also that while TTT in Test 3 gets roughly the same F-score upper bound as DPDI in Test 1, the corresponding F-score is slightly worse. A possible explanation is that better pruning not only speeds up the parsing/alignment process but also guides the search process to focus on the most promising region of the search space. 7.4 Large-scale End-to-End Experiment","ID Pruning beam size time cost Bleu-05","Bleu-","08 1 DPDI 10 1092h 38.57 28.31 2 TTT 10 972h 37.96 27.37 3 TTT 20 2376h 38.13 27.58 4 DP -- 2068h 37.43 27.12 Table 3: Evaluation of DPDI against TTT and DP for HP-DITG","ID WA-Model F-Score Bleu-05 Bleu-08 1 HMM 80.1% 36.91 26.86 2 Giza++ 84.2% 37.70 27.33 3 BITG 85.9% 37.92 27.85 4 HP-DITG 87.0% 38.57 28.31","Table 4: Evaluation of DPDI against HMM, Giza++ and BITG","Table 3 lists the word alignment time cost and SMT performance of different pruning methods. HP-DITG using DPDI achieves the best Bleu score with acceptable time cost. Table 4 compares HP-DITG to HMM (Vogel, et al., 1996), GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and BITG (Haghighi et al., 2009). It shows that HP-DITG (with DPDI) is better than the three baselines both in alignment F-score and Bleu score. Note that the Bleu score differences between HP-DITG and the three baselines are statistically significant (Koehn, 2004).","An explanation of the better performance by HP-DITG is the better phrase pair extraction due to DPDI. On the one hand, a good phrase pair often fails to be extracted due to a link inconsistent with the pair. On the other hand, ITG pruning can be considered as phrase pair selection, and good ITG pruning like DPDI guides the subsequent ITG alignment process so that less links inconsistent to good phrase pairs are produced. This also explains (in Tables 2 and 3) why DPDI with beam size 10 leads to higher Bleu than TTT with beam size 20, even though both pruning methods lead to roughly the same alignment F-score."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper reviews word alignment through ITG parsing, and clarifies the problem of ITG pruning. A discriminative pruning model and two discriminative ITG alignments systems are proposed. The pruning model is shown to be superior to all existing ITG pruning methods, and the HP-DITG alignment system is shown to improve state-of-the-art alignment and translation quality.","The current DPDI model employs a very limited set of features. Many features are related only to probabilities of word pairs. As the success of HP-DITG illustrates the merit of hierarchical phrase pair, in future we should investigate more features on the relationship between span pair and hierarchical phrase pair."]},{"title":"Appendix A. The Normal Form Grammar","paragraphs":["Table 5 lists the ITG rules in normal form as used in this paper, which extend the normal form in Wu (1997) so as to handle the case of alignment to null. 1 S → A|B|C 2 A → A B | A C | B B | BC | C B | C C 3 B → A A | A C | B A | B C B → C A | C C 4 C → Cw |Cfw |Cew 5 C → Cew Cfw 6 Cw → u/v 7 Ce → ε/v; Cf → u/ε 8 Cem → Ce| Cem Ce ; Cfm → Cf| Cfm Cf 9 Cew → Cem Cw ; Cfw → Cfm Cw"," Table 5: ITG Rules in Normal Form","In these rules, S is the Start symbol; A is the category for concatenating combination whereas B for inverted combination. Rules (2) and (3) are inherited from Wu (1997). Rules (4) divide the terminal category C into subcategories. Rule schema (6) subsumes all terminal unary rules for some English word u and foreign word v , and rule schemas (7) are unary rules for alignment to null. Rules (8) ensure all words linked to null are combined in left branching manner, while rules (9) ensure those words linked to null combine with some following, rather than preceding, word pair. (Note: Accordingly, all sentences must be ended by a special token end , otherwise the last word(s) of a sentence cannot be linked to null.) If there are both English and foreign words linked to null, rule (5) ensures that those English 323 words linked to null precede those foreign words linked to null."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Peter F.
