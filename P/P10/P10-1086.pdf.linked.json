The underlying idea is that a term is characterized by the contexts it co-occurs with. This is also well known as the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954): terms occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. There has been a lot of work to compute the sense similarity between terms based on their distribution in a corpus, such as (Hindle, 1990; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lin, 1998; Turney, 2001; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Pado and Lapata, 2007).","In the work just cited, a common procedure is followed. Given two terms to be compared, one first extracts various features for each term from their contexts in a corpus and forms a vector space model (VSM); then, one computes their similarity by using similarity functions. The features include words within a surface window of a fixed size (Lund and Burgess, 1996), grammatical dependencies (Lin, 1998; Pantel and Lin 2002; Pado and Lapata, 2007), etc. The similarity function which has been most widely used is cosine distance (Salton and McGill, 1983); other similarity functions include Euclidean distance, City Block distance (Bullinaria and Levy; 2007), and Dice and Jaccard coefficients (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), etc. Measures of monolingual sense similarity have been widely used in many applications, such as synonym recognizing (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), word clustering (Pantel and Lin 2002), word sense disambiguation (Yuret and Yatbaz 2009), etc.","Use of the vector space model to compute sense similarity has also been adapted to the multilingual condition, based on the assumption that two terms with similar meanings often occur in comparable contexts across languages. Fung (1998) and Rapp (1999) adopted VSM for the application of extracting translation pairs from comparable or even unrelated corpora. The vectors in different languages are first mapped to a common space using an initial bilingual dictionary, and then compared.","However, there is no previous work that uses the VSM to compute sense similarity for terms from parallel corpora. The sense similarities, i.e. the translation probabilities in a translation model, for units from parallel corpora are mainly based on the co-occurrence counts of the two units. Therefore, questions emerge: how good is the sense similarity computed via VSM for two units from parallel corpora? Is it useful for multilingual applications, such as statistical machine translation (SMT)?","In this paper, we try to answer these questions, focusing on sense similarity applied to the SMT task. For this task, translation rules are heuristically extracted from automatically word-aligned sentence pairs. Due to noise in the training corpus or wrong word alignment, the source and target sides of some rules are not semantically equivalent, as can be seen from the following 834 real examples which are taken from the rule table built on our training data (Section 5.1): 世界 上 X 之一 ||| one of X (*) 世界 上 X 之一 ||| one of X in the world 许多 市民 ||| many citizens 许多 市民 ||| many hong kong residents (*) The source and target sides of the rules with (*) at the end are not semantically equivalent; it seems likely that measuring the semantic similarity from their context between the source and target sides of rules might be helpful to machine translation.","In this work, we first propose new algorithms to compute the sense similarity between two units (unit here includes word, phrase, rule, etc.) in different languages by using their contexts. Second, we use the sense similarities between the source and target sides of a translation rule to improve statistical machine translation performance.","This work attempts to measure directly the sense similarity for units from different languages by comparing their contexts","1",". Our contribution includes proposing new bilingual sense similarity algorithms and applying them to machine translation.","We chose a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system as our baseline; thus, the units involved in computation of sense similarities are hierarchical rules."]},{"title":"2 Hierarchical phrase-based MT system","paragraphs":["The hierarchical phrase-based translation method (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007) is a formal syntax-based translation modeling method; its translation model is a weighted synchronous context free grammar (SCFG).

We use the Joshua implementation of the method for decoding (Li et al., 2009)."]},{"title":"3 Bag-of-Words Vector Space Model","paragraphs":["To compute the sense similarity via VSM, we follow the previous work (Lin, 1998) and represent the source and target side of a rule by feature vectors. In our work, each feature corresponds to a context word which co-occurs with the translation rule. 3.1 Context Features In the hierarchical phrase-based translation method, the translation rules are extracted by abstracting some words from an initial phrase pair (Chiang, 2005). Consider a rule with non-terminals on the source and target side; for a given instance of the rule (a particular phrase pair in the training corpus), the context will be the words instantiating the non-terminals. In turn, the context for the sub-phrases that instantiate the non-terminals will be the words in the remainder of the phrase pair. For example in Figure 1, if we 835 have an initial phrase pair 他 出席 了 会议 ||| he attended the meeting, and we extract four rules from this initial phrase: 他 出席 了 X1 ||| he attended X1, 会议 ||| the meeting, 他 X1 会议 ||| he X1 the meeting, and 出席 了 ||| attended. There-fore, the and meeting are context features of target pattern he attended X1; he and attended are the context features of the meeting; attended is the context feature of he X1 the meeting; also he, the and meeting are the context feature of attended (in each case, there are also source-side context features). 3.2 Bag-of-Words Model For each side of a translation rule pair, its context words are all collected from the training data, and two “bags-of-words” which consist of collections of source and target context words co-occurring with the rule’s source and target sides are created."]},{"title":"},...,,{ },...,,{","paragraphs":["21 21 Je If"]},{"title":"eeeB fffB = = ","paragraphs":["(1) where"]},{"title":")1( Iif","paragraphs":["i"]},{"title":"≤≤","paragraphs":["are source context words which co-occur with the source side of rule"]},{"title":"α","paragraphs":[", and"]},{"title":")1( Jje","paragraphs":["j"]},{"title":"≤≤","paragraphs":["are target context words which co-occur with the target side of rule"]},{"title":"γ","paragraphs":[".

Therefore, we need to first map a vector into the space of the other vector, so that the similarity can be calculated. Fung (1998) and Rapp (1999) map the vector one-dimension-to-one-dimension (a context word is a dimension in each vector space) from one language to another language via an initial bilingual dictionary.

","Table 6 shows results obtained by adding the above features to the system for the small data 840 condition. Although all these features have obtained some improvements on dev set, there was no significant effect on the test sets. This means simple features based on context, such as the sum of the counts of the context features, are not as helpful as the sense similarity computed by Equation (14). 6.4 Null Context Feature There are two cases where no context word can be extracted according to the definition of context in Section 3.1. The first case is when a rule pair is always a full sentence-pair in the training data. The second case is when for some rule pairs, either their source or target contexts are out of the span limit of the initial phrase, so that we cannot extract contexts for those rule-pairs. For Chinese-to-English NIST task, there are about 1% of the rules that do not have contexts; for German-to-English task, this number is about 0.4%. We assign a uniform number as their bilingual sense similarity score, and this number is tuned through MERT. We call it the null context feature. It is included in all the results reported from Table 2 to Table 6. In Table 7, we show the weight of the null context feature tuned by running MERT in the experiments reported in Section 5.2. We can learn that penalties always discourage using those rules which have no context to be extracted.

CE_SD, CE_LD and DE are Chinese-to-English small data task, large data task and German-to-English task respectively. 6.5 Discussion Our aim in this paper is to characterize the semantic similarity of bilingual hierarchical rules. We can make several observations concerning our features:","1) Rules that are largely syntactic in nature, such as 的 X ||| the X of, will have very diffuse “meanings” and therefore lower similarity scores. It could be that the gains we obtained come simply from biasing the system against such rules. However, the results in table 6 show that this is unlikely to be the case: features that just count context words help very little.","2) In addition to bilingual similarity, Alg2 relies on the degree of monolingual similarity between the sense of a source or target unit within a rule, and the sense of the unit in general. This has a bias in favor of less ambiguous rules, i.e. rules involving only units with closely related meanings. Although this bias is helpful on its own, possibly due to the mechanism we outline in section 6.1, it appears to have a synergistic effect when used along with the bilingual similarity feature.","3) Finally, we note that many of the features we use for capturing similarity, such as the context “the, of” for instantiations of X in the unit the X of, are arguably more syntactic than semantic. Thus, like other “semantic” approaches, ours can be seen as blending syntactic and semantic information."]},{"title":"7 Related Work","paragraphs":["There has been extensive work on incorporating semantics into SMT. Key papers by Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Chan et al (2007) showed that word-sense disambiguation (WSD) techniques relying on source-language context can be effective in selecting translations in phrase-based and hierarchical SMT. More recent work has aimed at incorporating richer disambiguating features into the SMT log-linear model (Gimpel and Smith, 2008; Chiang et al, 2009); predicting coherent sets of target words rather than individual phrase translations (Bangalore et al, 2009; Mauser et al, 2009); and selecting applicable rules in hierarchical (He et al, 2008) and syntactic (Liu et al, 2008) translation, relying on source as well as target context. Work by Wu and Fung (2009) breaks new ground in attempting to match semantic roles derived from a semantic parser across source and target languages.","Our work is different from all the above approaches in that we attempt to discriminate among hierarchical rules based on: 1) the degree of bilingual semantic similarity between source and target translation units; and 2) the monolingual semantic similarity between occurrences of source or target units as part of the given rule, and in general. In another words, WSD explicitly tries to choose a translation given the current source context, while our work rates rule pairs independent of the current context."]},{"title":"8 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have proposed an approach that uses the vector space model to compute the sense 841 similarity for terms from parallel corpora and applied it to statistical machine translation. We saw that the bilingual sense similarity computed by our algorithm led to significant improvements. Therefore, we can answer the questions proposed in Section 1. We have shown that the sense similarity computed between units from parallel corpora by means of our algorithm is helpful for at least one multilingual application: statistical machine translation.","Finally, although we described and evaluated bilingual sense similarity algorithms applied to a hierarchical phrase-based system, this method is also suitable for syntax-based MT systems and phrase-based MT systems. The only difference is the definition of the context. For a syntax-based system, the context of a rule could be defined similarly to the way it was defined in the work described above. For a phrase-based system, the context of a phrase could be defined as its surrounding words in a given size window. In our future work, we may try this algorithm on syntax-based MT systems and phrase-based MT systems with different context features. It would also be possible to use this technique during training of an SMT system – for instance, to improve the bilingual word alignment or reduce the training data noise."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S.
