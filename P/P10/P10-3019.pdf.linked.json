With this object, we give two contrasting examples of de-scriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiagueño) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1","."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["It has been proved (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan and Kay, 1994) that regular models have an expre-","1","This work is part of the undergraduate thesis Finite state morphology: The Koskenniemi’s two level morphology model and its application to describing the morphosyntaxis of two native Argentinean languages sive power equal to the noncyclic components of generative grammmars representing the morphophonology of natural languages. However, these works make no considerations about what class of formal languages is the natural for describing the morphology of one particular language. On the other hand, the criteria of classification of Amerindian languages, do not involve complexity criteria. In order to establish criteria that take into account the complexity of the description we present two contrasting examples in two Argentinean native languages: toba and quichua santiagueño. While the quichua has a natural representation in terms of a regular language using two level morphology, we will show that the Toba morphology has a more natural representation in terms of linear context-free languages."]},{"title":"2 Quichua Santiague ño","paragraphs":["The quichua santiagueño is a language of the Quechua language family. It is spoken in the Santiago del Estero state, Argentina. Typologically is an agglutinative language and its structure is almost exclusively based on the use of suffixes and is extremely regular. The morphology takes a dominant part in this language with a rich set of valida-tion suffixes. The quichua santiagueño has a much simpler phonologic system that other languages of this family: for example it has no series of aspirated or glottalized stops.","Since the description of the verbal morphology is rich enough for our aim to expose the regular nature of quichua santiagueño morphology, we have restricted our study to the morphology of finite verbs forms. We use the two level morphology paradigm to express with finite regular transducers the rules that clearly illustrate how naturally this language phonology is regular. The construction uses the descriptive works of Alderetes (2001) and Nardi (Albarracı́n et. al, 2002) 109","2.1 Phonological two level rules for the quichua santiague ño In this section we present the alphabet of the quichua santiagueño with which we have implemented the quichua phonological rules in the paradigm of two level morphology.

The toba is spoken in the Gran Chaco region (which is comprised between Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay) and in some reduced settlements near Buenos Aires, Argentina. From the point of view of the morphologic typology it presents characteristics of a polysynthetic agglutinative language. In this language the verb is the morphologically more complex wordclass. The grammatical category of person is prefixed to the verbal theme. There are suffixes to indicate plurals and other grammatical categories as aspect, locationdirection, reflexive and reciprocal and desiderative mode. The verb has no mark of time. As an example of a typical verb we can considerate the sanadatema:","Example 1 . s- anat(a) -d -em -a 1Act- advice 2 dat ben ” Iadviceyou” 2","One of the characteristics of the toba verb morphology is a system of markation active-inactive on the verbal prefixes (Messineo, 2003; Klein, 1978). There are in this language two sets or verbal prefixes that mark action:","1. Class I (In):codifies inactive participants, objects of transitive verbs and pacients of intransitive verbs. .","2.

Then, if we model this process using finite automata we will add many items to the lexicon (Sproat, 1992). The derivation of names from verbs is very productive. There are many nominalizer suffixes. The resulting names use obligatory possessing person nominal prefixes.","Example 3 . l- edaGan -at 3pos write instr","”his pencil”","The toba language also presents a complex system of causative suffixes that act as switching the transitivity of the verb. Transitivity is specially appreciable in the switching of the 3rd person prefix mark. In section 3.2 we will use this process to show how linear context free grammars are a better than regular grammars for modeling agglutination in this language, but first we will present the for-mer class of languages and its acceptor automata.","3.1 Linear context free languages and two-taped nondeterministic finite-state automata A linear context-free language is a language generated by a grammar context-free grammars G in which every production has one of the three forms (Creider et al., 1995): 1. A → a, with a terminal symbol","2. A → aB, with B a non terminal symbol and a a terminal symbol.","3. A → Ba, with B a non terminal symbol and a a terminal symbol.","Linear context-free grammars have been studied by Rosenberg (1967) who showed that there is an equivalence between them and two-taped nondeterministic finite-state automata. Informally, a two-head nondeterministic finite-state automata could be thought as a generalization of a usual nondeterministic finite-state automata which has two read heads that independently reads in two different tapes, and at each transition only one tape moves. When both tapes have been processed, if the automata is at a final state, the parsing is successful. In the ambit that we are studying we can think that if a word is a string of prefixes, a stem and suffixes, one automata head will read will the prefixes and the other the suffixes. Taking into account that linear grammars are in Rosenberg’s terms: ” The lowest class of nonregular context-free grammars”, Creider et al. (1995) have taken this formal language class as the optimal to model morphological processes that involve interaction between prefixes and suffixes.","3.2 Analysis of the third person verbal paradigm In this section we model the morphology of the third person of transitive verbs using two-taped finite nondeterministics automata. The modeling of this person is enough to show this description advantages with respect to others in terms of regular languages. The transitivity of the verb plays an important role in the selection of the person marker Class. The person markers are (Messineo, 2003):","1. i-/y- for transitive verbs y and some intrasitive subjects (Pr AcT).","2. d(Vowel) for verbs typically intransitives (Pr ActI). 3. n: subjets of medium voice (Pr ActM).","The successive application of the causative seems to act here, as was interpreted by Buckwalter (2001), like making the switch in the original verb transitivity as is shown en Example 4 in the next page. 112 Example 4 . IV de- que’e he eats TV i- qui’ -aGan he eats(something) IV de- qui’ -aGanataGan he feeds TV i- qui’ -aGanataGanaGan he feeds(a person) IV de qui’ -aGanaGanataGan he command to feed","If we want to model this morphological process using finite automata again we must enlarge the lexicon size. The resulting grammar, althought capable of modeling the morphology of the toba, would not work effectively. The effectiveness of a grammar is a measure of their productivity (Heintz, 1991). Taking into account the productivity of causative and reflexive verbal derivation we will prefer a description in terms of a context-free linear grammar with high effectivity than another using regular languages with low effectivity.","To model the behavior of causative agglutination and the interaction with person prefixes using the two-head automata, we define two paths determined by the parity of the causative suffixes wich have been agglutinated to the verb. We have also to take into consideration the optative posterior aglutination of reflexive and reciprocal suffixes wich forces the use of medium voice person prefix. From the third person is also formed the third person indefinite actor from a prefix, qa -, which is at left and adjacent to the usual mark of the third person and after the mark of negation sa- . Therefore, their agglutination is reserved to the last transitions. The resulting two-typed automata showed in Figure 2 also takes into account the relative order of the boxes and so the mutual restrictions between them (Klein, 1978)."]},{"title":"4 Future Research","paragraphs":["It is interesting to note that phonological rules in toba can be naturally expressed by regular Finite Transducers. There are, however, many South American native languages that presents morphological processes analogous to the Toba and some can present phonological processes that will have a more natural expression using Linear Finite Transducers. For example the Guarani language presents nasal harmony which expands from the root to both suffixes and prefixes (Krivoshein, 1994). This kind of characterization can have some value in language classification and the modeling of the great diversity of South American languages morphology can allow to obtain a formal concept of natural description of a language. ."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Lelia Albarracı́n, Mario Tebes y Jorge Alderetes(eds.) 2002.
