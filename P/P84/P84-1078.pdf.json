Introduction","This report descrnbes Paul. a computer text generation system designed to cre~:te collesive text through tile use of lexical substitutuons. Spec;hcalty. thts system ~s designed tn deterministically choose between pronominal:zabon sup(:rordinate substitution, and delinite noun phrase reitcrat}on. Fl~e system identifies a strength at antecedence recovery for each of the lexical substitutions, anti matches them against the strength of potenU,# entececJence of each element =n the text to select the proper sub3litubons for these elements.","P~ul is a natural language generation program initially developed at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center as part of the ongoing Epistle project I5.6}, \"[he emphasis of the the work reported here is in the research oJ discourse phenomena, the study of cohesion and its effects on mLJlhsententiat texts [3, 9]. Paul accepts as input LISP knowledge structures consisbng of case frame l1] formalisms representing each sentence to be gernerated. These knowledge structures are translated into Enghsh, with the appropriate lexical substitutions being made at this time. No attempt vs made by the system to create these knowledge structures. 2. Cohesion","The purpose of communication is for one person (the speaker or writer) to express her thoughts and ideas so that another (the listener or reader) can understand them. ]here aJe many restrictions placed on the realization of these thoughts inio language so that the listener may understand. One ot the most important requiroments fo~ an utterance is that it seem to be unified, that it form a text. The theory of text and what distinguishes it from isolated sentences that is used in Paul is that of Halliday and Hasan [3].","One of the items that enhances the unity of text is cohesion. Cohesion refers to the linguistic phenomena that establish relationships between sentences, thc~reby tying them together. There are two major goals that are accomplished tl~rougi~ cohesiu, that enhance a passage's qualily of text. The fiust is the obwous oesure to avoid unnecessary repetibon. The other goal is to dislinguL\",h new information from old. ,so that the listener can tully undemtand what fs being said.","[1} The room has a large window, The room has a window facing east.","{1} appears to he describing two windows, because there is no device indicating that the window of the second sentence is the same as the window of tile first sentence.

Cohesion us a device that will accomplish thas goal,","Cohesion is created when the interpretation of an element is dependent on the me.aning of another. ]he element in guestion can.at be hJIly understood until 1he element d is dependenl on zs ~dcntdned. rhe first presupposes [3] the second in that it requ,es for its understanding the exnstence of the second. An element at a sentence presupposes the existence of another when its interpretation requires relerence tO another. Once we can trace these lelerences to their sources, we can correctly interpret the elements of the sentences.","The very same devices that create these depende, leies for interpretation help distinguish olct intolrnation from new. I[ the use of a cohesive element pre~.upposes the exnste~ce of another role=once el the element lor its ir}terpretahon, tl~en tile hstener can be assured tltat the olher reference exists, and that the element =n question can be understood as old reformation. lhurefore, that act at associating seJltences through reference deponde.cies heips make the text unambiguous, arid cohcs=on can be seen to be a very important part of text. 3. Lexical Substitution In [3], Halliday and I-lasan cat.~log and discuss many devices used in English to acmove cohes,on. Fhese include refe;ence, substitution ellaDsis, and conjunction. Another f.t, mily ut devices they discuss is know,-\" as lexical substitulion. ]he lexlcal substitution devices incorporated into Paul are pronommalizatior,, s.perordinate substitution, and definite noun phrase reiteration.","Superordinate substitution is the replacement of an etement with a noun or phrase that ps a .;ore general term for the element As an example, consPder Figure 1, a sample hierarchy the system uses to generate sentences.",".................................................

The+ system tdeobfies an es;~e+~tial quality, usu[]liy ir=telligence, wilich acts as a block for further supurordinate subsbtution. If the item to be replaced with a superordmate has the prou.~rty of intelhgence, either d~reclly or through semantic inheritance, a superordinate list is made only {)f tho..:e entnes that have themselves the quality el intothgenco, a{j.qir, either d~rectly or through inheritance. If the item does=rt have intelhgence the list is allowed to extend as far as the hierarcl~ical entries will allow. Once the proper list of superordinates =3 established, Paul randomly chooses one, preventing repetition by remembering previous choices.","The other problem with superordinato substitution is that it may =ntroduce ambiguity. Again cons=tier Figure 1. If we wanted to perform a superord.]ato subshhlho;+ for POrJO. we would have the sup~'rordJt13te hst (POSSUM MAMMAL ANIM4L ) to choose from. But HEPZlI]AH is also a nlammal, so the rnammal cauld refer to either POGO or HEPZIBAH. And not only are both POGO e,r}d ItEPZIBAtl anunals, but sn is CtlURCHY, so the armnat could be any o,}e of them. ]herefore, saying lhe matnmal or the arr+mal would form an ambiguous refecence which the listener or reader would have rio v,,,ay to ur~derstand.","Paul reco{.lniz££ [hts ambiguity. Once the superordinate has been selected, it ~s tested against all the other nour~s mentioned so far in the text If any other noun is a rn{;mbet of th.e superordu+ale set m question, the reference is ambl,~!uous. 1his reference can be disarnbiguated by using some feature ot the eh:ment be,to replaced as a modilier. In our example of Figure 1. we hrd that all possums are grey. and therefore POGO ~s grey. Thus. the grey mamma! can refer only to POGO, and is not atnb=guous. In the Pogo world, the features the system uses to d~sarr;oiuuate these references are gender, s~ze, color, and skin type (furry. scaled, of foath{,~('d). Or+co the leature ~s arb~trC.rily selected and the correct value has been determined. ~t ~s tested to see that it genuinely diba+nb~guales the reference, tt any of the nouns that were members of the :,t;pcrordmate set have the same value to~ this feature, it cannot be use,') to (f~s.~mb~guate the reference, arid il is relected. For instance, tl~e size of POGO ~s small, but s~ying the .~n',all mammal ~3 still ambiguous bec~use HEPZll~Atl is also small, and the phrase could just as likely refer to her. The search for a disambiguatmg ieature continues until one is found.","Pronominalizat+on, the use of personal pronouns in place of an element, is mechan~c~dly simple. The selecbon of the appropriate persnnal pronoun is strictly gramm;-~lical. Once lhe syntactic case, the oendor, and the number of the element are known, the correct pronoun is dictated by the language.","the final ~ex~cal substitution available to Paul is the definite noun phrase, the use of a dehnite artielr~, t,'~e m English, as opposed to an indefinlle article, a or some The definite ~rticle clearly marks an item as erie that has been pre,~iously mentioned, and is therefore old information. \"f:',e .'~rlefu,te oracle 31mllatiy marks an item as not havlnq been pre..qc~usiy mentioned. ,~d therefore is new information. 1\"his capacity of the defimte article makes ils use required with superordinates. {2} My collie is smart.

A dog fetches my newspaper every day.","Willie the mocharlisms for performing the various lexical substitutions are conceptualiy slra~ghtforward, they don't solve the entire problotn uf usin~.l le,:icdl suOstltuhon. Nolhing has been said about how the system chooses WlllCh IOxICUl substilutlor'i to use. This is a serious issue because lexlcGI sLJbsbtutiol~ dOWCOS ace nc;t interchangeable. This is tru.,3, bec;~u:;e le~Jcal substiluhons, as Wltll most cohesive devices, create text by using pze:;uppo-~t;d dependencies tor Iheir inlerpreti'|tioi1s, as we have seeri. If those pr£~Supposod elemeats do not exist, or if it is not possible to Correctly idcnhly whtch of the m~'.ny possiDle elements is the one presuppns,.xi, then it is imoossiblo to correctly int(,rpret the element, arid the only possd.)le r¢su!t ~s cunlus~on. A computer text generation symptom mat incorporates lexical substituhon in its output must insure that tne presupposed element ex:sts, and that it can be readily identified by the reader.","Pa~d controls the se!ection of lexicai substitution devices by conceptually dividing the p+ helen rote two I'.,sks. \"rho first is to ~dentify the strength of antecedence rucov'crv of toO lexical substitution devices. The second ~s to iderztffy the str~..ngth el pote~:hal arrteceder~ce of each element in the passage, and determine which il any Icxical substitution would be appropriate. 4. Strength of Antecedence Recovery Each time a cohesive devic~ is used, a presupposition clependency is created. rhe itef~ tIlat i:; being presupposed must be correctly identified tor the correct interp~etabon of the element. The relative ease with wh=ch one c3n recover this pre~supposed item from the cohesive element is called the strength el antecedence recove,y. The stronger an eleraent's strength of antecedence recovery, the easier it is to identify the presupposed element.","The lexical substitution with the highest strength of antece-lonce recovery is the dehnite noun. This is because the element is actually a recetition of the original item, w~th a definite article to mark the fact that it is old information. There is no real need to refer to the presupposed element, since all the reformation is being repeated.","Superordinate subslitution is the lexical substitution witl; the next highest strength of antecedence recovery. Presupposition oepondency genuinely does ernst with Ihe use of superordmates, because some intorrnation is lost When w* ~. move up the semanhc hierarchy, all the traits that are specihc to the element in question are test. To recover this and fully understand the ret(;rence at Ilano. we must trace back to the original element in the hierarchy. Fortunately, the manner in which Paul pedorms suporordmate substitution faohtates this recovery. By insunng that the superordmate substitt;tlon will never be ambiguous, the system only generates suporofdmate ~L, bstttutlons that are readily recoverable.","The th,d device used by Paul. ~he personal pronoun, has the lowest strength of antecedence recovery. Pronouns genuinely ~re nothing more tharl plat:e holders, variables that lea=tHole the pnsihotls Of the elements they are replacing A pronoun contains no real semahhc irdormation. The only readily available p~eces of iniormation from a pronoun are the syntactic role Jn the currenl sentence, the gender, and the number of the replaced item. For this mason, pronouns are the hardest to recover of the substitutions discussed. 5. Strength of Potential Antecedence","Wl~tle the forms of lexical substitution provide clues (tO various degrees) teat aid the reader in recovering the presupposed elemeflt, the actual way m which the e!orr;er;t =S currerttly being used, how ;t was prev;:)usly used. its cir,,:um,~ tances within the current sentence and within the eqt~re text, can prowce addit;on31 clues. These factors combine to give tne 5pecIhc reference a s~ret;gth el potentiat antecedence. Some etemer~ts, try the ;,ature of their current and previous us~.~ge, will be easier to recover u;depetl~ont of u~e fox,cat subst~lutton dewce selected.","Strength of potential antecedence involves several factors, One is the syntachc role the element ~s pl~ying in tr}e current sentence, as well as in the previous relere;ice. Anoti~er is the d~stance of the previous reference from the current. Here distance is defined as the number of clauses between the references, and Paul arbitrarily uses a distance of no more than two clauses as an acceptable distance. The current expected"]},{"title":"382","paragraphs":["focus of the text also affects an element's potential strength of antecedence. In order to identify the current expected locus, Paul uses the detailed algorithm for focus developed by Sidner [10]. Paul identifies five classes of potenhal antecedence strength.
