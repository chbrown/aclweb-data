Anderson Ecological Linguistics 316 \"A\" st. s. E.","Washington, D. C., 20003 ABS~ACT","National and international standards committees are now discussing a two-byte code for multilingual information processing. This provides for 65,536 separate character and control codes, enough to make permanent code assiguments for all the charanters of ell national alphabets of the world, and also to include Chinese/Japanese characters.","This paper discusses the kinds of flexibility required to handle both Roman and non-Roman alp.habets. It is crucial to separate information units (codes) from graphic forms, to maximize processing p ower,","Comparing alphabets around the world, we find t.hat the graphic devices (letters, digraphs, accent marks, punctuation, spacing, etc.) represent a very limited number of information units. It is possible to arr_ange alphabet codes to provide transliteration equivalence, the best of three solutions compared as a _eramework for code assignments.","Information vs. Form. In developing proposals for codes in information processing, the most important decisions are the choices of what to code. In a proposal for a multilingual two-byte code, Xerox Corporation has n'~%de explicit a principle which we can state precisely as follows: Basic codes stand for independent1.y_, function-in~ information units (not for visual forms) The choice of type font, presence or absence of serifs, and variations like boldface, italics or underlining, are matters of form. Such choices are norrmlly made once for spans at least as long as one word. ~'[e do not use ComPLeX miXturEs, but consistent strings llke this, THIS, this, or THIS. By assigning the same basic code to variations of a single letter (as a, _~, A, A~, all variants will automatically be alphabetized the ~ame way, which is as it should be. The choice of variant forms is specified by supplementary \"looks\" information. (The capitalization of first letters of sentences, proper names, or nouns, is a kind of punctuation,)","Identical graphic forms may also be assigned more than one code because they are distinct units in information processing. Thus the letter form \"C\"' is used in the Russian alphabet to represent the sound /s/, but it is not the same information unit as English \"C\", so it has a distinct code. So far this seems relatively obvious.","The sane principle is now being applied in much more subtle cases. Thus the minus sign and the hyphen are assigned distinct codes in recent proposals because they are completely distinct information units. There are even two kinds of hyphens distinguished, a \"hard\" hyphen as in the word father-in-law, which remains always present, and a \"soft\" hyphen which is used only to divide a word at the end of a line, and which should automatically vanish when, in word-processing, the sane word comes to stand undivided within the line.","We can now frame the question \"what to code?\" as a matter of empirical discovery, what are the independently functioning information units in text? Relevant facts emerge from comparing a range of different alphabets.","What is a \"letter of the alphabet\"? -- the problem of diacritics and digraphs. The most obvious question turns out to be the most difficult of all. Western European alphabets are in many ways not typical of alphabets of the world. They have an unusually small number of basic letters, and to represent a larger number of sounds they use digraphs like English sh, ch, th, or diacritics as in Czech ~, ~. It seems at first entirely obvious that digraphs like sh should be coded simply as a sequence of two codes, one for s plus one for h. Indeed English, French, German and Scandinavian alphabets do alphabetize their digraphs just like a sequence, s__ plus h etc. But these national alphabets are not typical. Spanish, Hungarian, Polish, Croatian and Albanian treat their native digraphs as single letters for purposes of alphabetical order. Spanish II is not & sequence of two l's, but a new letter which follows all io, l~u sequences! similarly ch follows all c sequences, &","follows all ~ sequences as a separate letter.","There is just as much variation in handling letters\" with diacritics. The umlauted letter ~ is alphabetized as a separate letter following _o in Hungarian, and at the end of the alphabet in Swedish, but in German it is mixed in with o. In Spanish, ~ is treated as a separate letter, but the Slovak ~_ ~epresenting the same sound is mixed in with ordinary n.","In Table I., the digraphs and letters with diacritics which are not in parentheses or brackets are alphabetized separately as distinct single units. Those in parentheses are alphabetized am a sequence of two or more letters or (Slovak and Czech I', n, ~ ~t', d_~ are treated as equivalent to the simpler letter, completely disregarding the diacritic. Combinations in brackets are used to represent sounds in words burrowed from other languages. Double dashes mark sounds fur which an particular alphabet has no distinctive written symbol. (In Russian, palatal consonants are marked by choice of special vowel letters, while Turkish has a different kind of contrast, hence the blanks~ Even when a digraph or trigraph is treated as a sequence of letters for alphabetization, there may be other evidence that it functions as a single information unit. In syllable division (hyphenation), English never divides the digraphs sh, oh, or th when they function as single units (~t~-er, ~er) but does when they represent two ~its","t-house). The same is true of other letter combinations in all national standard alphabets where a single sound is represented by a combination of letters.","Within certain mechanical constraints, type-writer keyboards also put each distinct information unit on a separate key. Thus Spanish E mr Czech ~_, _~, ~_ are Produced by single keys, n~t by ~g a diacritic to a base letter. Mechanical limits have forced a sequence of two letters (like the Spanish oh, ~ to be typed with two separate key-s~rokes whether or not they represent a single functional unit, but occasionally we see exceptions, an in Dutch where the ~ digraph appears an a ligature on a single key and is printed in one Sound \" space not two.","Unit tmanalyzable letters exist in Serbian and Macedonian for most of the sound types (the columns) of Table I. Icelandic has single letters \"thorn\" and \"edh\" for the two rightmost columns. Even where the o~her languages use digraphs cr letters with diacritics, there is evidence from syllabification and usually also from alphabetical order that these are functionally independent information units. For transliteration from one national alphabet into another, these symbol equivalences are needed. The im~inciple stated on the preceding page thus implies that unique codes be available for English s h, c h, t_~h and unitary digraphs in other languages so these can be used when needed in information processing. (Information processing is not the shuffling of bits of scribal ink:) The principle does not compel use of those cedes -- English t h can be recorded first as a sequence of two cedes, then converted into a single cede only when needed, by a Program which has a dictions~y listing all wu~Is containing matary t_h.","Spatial arrangement of printe~ characters.

It appears to be economical in Europe, where 20 national alphabets can fit in 48 x 13 = 624 code cells if only letter forms are considered. But for non-L&tin alphabets there can be no similar savings. Here there are (considering only living alphabets) about 5~ alphabets based on 38 distinct sets of letters.","Solution ~.

This solution depends on the fact that there is a small number of types of information units which have ever been represented in a national standard alphabet. In the tentative arrangement of Table 3., most of the sound types noted ere represented by single unanalyz~ble characters in some national alphabet (as Georgian, Armenian, Hindi, ...), and most of the rest by clearly unitary digraphs. Despite the strange symbols, this is not a list of fine phonetic distinctions, it is a list of distinct categories of ~ritten symbols.","The idea fc~ this solution came from the one-byte code adopted in India, struct~ed identically with transliteration-equivalence for each of the alphabets of India. A printer with only Tamil letters can simply ~int a Tamil transliteration of an incoming Hindl message.

The third solution described above is designed to handle all the structures and fUnctions found in national standard alphabets and to fit them like a well-made glove, allowing the maximum capabilities of infcrmstion processing, but never compelling their use.
