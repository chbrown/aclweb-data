Strong or weak data determination is therefore a property of the grammar formalism and the data combined, and independent of the choice of discovery procedure.","Secondly, a discovery procedure may partition a phonological system in an interesting way. For instance, in the discovery procedure described here tile evaluation metric is not called apon to compare one grammar with another, but rather to make smaller, more local, comparisons. This leads to a factoring of the evaluation metric that may prove useful for its further investigation.","Thirdly, focussing on discovery procedures forces us to identify what the surface indications of the various constructions in the grammar are. Of course, this does not mean one should look for a one-to-one correspondence between individual grammar constructions and the surface data; but rather complexes of grammar constructions that interact to yield particular patterns on the surface. One is then investigating the logical implications of the existence of a particular constructions in the data.","Following from the last point, 1 think a discovery procedure should have a"]},{"title":"deductive","paragraphs":["rather than"]},{"title":"enumerative","paragraphs":["structure. In particular, procedures that work essentially by enumerating all possible (sub)grammars and seeing which ones work are not only in general very inefficient, but. also not. very insightful. These discovery by enumeration procedures simply give us a list of all rule systems that are empirically adequate as a result, but they give us no idea as to what properties of these systems were crucial in their being empirically adequate. This is because the structure imposed on the problem by a simple recursive enumeration procedure is in general not related to the intrinsic structure of the rule discovery problem. 3. A PHONOLOGICAL RULE DISCOVERY PROCEDURE","Below and in Appendix A I outline a discovery procedure: which I have fully implemented in Franz Lisp on a VAX 11/750 computer, for a restricted class of phonological rules, namely rules of the type shown in (1). (1) ~ ~ b / c","Rule (1) means that any segment a that appears in context Cin the input to the rule appears asa bin the rule's output. Context C is a feature matrix, and to say that a appears in context C means that C is a subse! of the fvature malrix"]},{"title":"344","paragraphs":["formed by the segments around a 1. A phonological system consists of an ordered 2 set of such rules, where the rules are considered to apply in a cascaded fashion, that. is, the output of one rule is the input to the next..","The problem the discovery procedure must solve is, given some data, to determine the set of rules. As an idealization, I assume that the input to the discovery procedure is a set of surface paradigms, a two dimensional array of words with all words in the same row possessing the same stem and all words in the same column the same affix. Moreover, l assume the root and suffix morphemes are already identified, ahhough I admit this task may be non-trivial. 4. DETERMINING THE CONTEXT THAT CONDI-TIONS AN ALTERNATION","Consider the simplest phonological system: one in which only one phonological rule is operative. In this system the alternating segements a and b can be determined by inspection, since a and b will be the only alternating segments in the data (although there will be a systematic ambiguity as to which is a and which is b). Thus a and b are strongly data determined.","Given a and b. we can write a set of equations that the rule context C that conditions this alternation must obey. Our rule rnust apply in all contexts C b where a b appears that alternates with an a, since by hypothesis b was produced by this rule. We can represent this by equation (2). (2) ~7]Cb, C matches C b","The second condition that our rule must obey is that it doesn't apply in any context. C a where an a appears. If it did, of course, we would expect a b, not an a, in this position on the surface. We can write this condition by equation (3). (3) ~¢C,, C does not match 6', These two equations define the rule context C. Note that in general these equations do not yield a unique value for C; depending apon the data tbere may be no C that simultaneously satisfies (2) and (3). or there may be several different C that simultaneously satisfies (2) and (3). We cannot appeal further to the data to decide which C to use, since they all are equally consistent with the data.","Let us call the set of C that simultaneously satisfies (2) and (3) S o Then S c is strongly data determined; in fact, there is an efficient algorithm for computing S c from the C,s and Cbs that does not involve enumerating and testing all imaginable C (the algorithm is described in Appendix A).","However, if S c contains more than one 6', the choice of which C from Sc to actually use as the rule's context is weakly","1 What is crucial for what follows is that saying context C matches a portion of a word W is equivalent to saying that C is a subset of W. Since both rule contexts and words can be written as sets of features, 1 use \"contexts\" to refer both to rule contexts and to words.","z I make this assumption as a first approximation. In fact, in real phonological systems phonological rules may be unordered with respect to each other. data determined. Moreover. the choice of v, hich ('from Sclo use does not affect any other decisions that the discovery procedure has to make - that is. nothing else in the complete grammar must change if we decide to use one C instead of another.","Plausibly, the evaluation metric and universal principles decide which C to use in this situation. For example, if the alternation involves nasafization of a vowel, something that usually only occurs in the context, of a nasal, and one of the contexts in S c involves the feature nasal but the other C in S c do not, a reasonable requirement is that the discovery procedure should select the context involving the feature nasal as the appropriate context Cfor the rule.","Another possibility is that .qc'S containing more than one, member indicates to the discovery procedure that it simply has too little data to determine the grammar, and it defers making a decision on which C to use until it has the relevant data. The decision as to which of these possibilities is correct is is not unimportant, and may have interesting empirical consequences regarding language acquisition.","McCarthy (1981) gives some data on a related issue. Spanish does not tolerate word initial sC clusters, a fact. which might be accounted for in two ways; either with a rule that inserts e before word initial sC clusters, or by a constraint on well-formed underlying structures (a redundancy rule) barring word initial sC. McCarthy reports that either constraint is adequate to account for Spanish morphopbonemics, and there is no particular language internal evidence to prefer one over the other.","The two accounts make differing predictions regarding the treatrnent of loan words. The e insertion rule predicts that loan words beginning with sC should receive an initial e (as they do: esnob, esmoking, esprey), while the well-formedness constraint makes no such prediction.","McCarthy's evidence from Spanish therefore suggests that the human acquisition procedure can adopt one potential analysis and rejects an other without empirical evidence to distinguish between them. ltowever, in the Spanish case, the two potential analyses differ as to which components of the grammar they involve (active phonological processes versus lexical redundancy rules) which affects the overall structure of the adopted grammar to a much greater degree than the choice of one C from S c over another. 5. RULE ORDERING","In the last section 1 showed that a single phonological rule can be determined from the surface data. In practice, very few, if any, phonological systems involve only one rule. Systems involving more than one rule show complexity that single rule systems do not. In particular, a rules may be ordered in such a fashion that one rule affects segments that are part of the context that conditions the operation of another rule. If a rule's context is visible on the surface (ie. has not been destroyed by the operation of another rule) it is said to be transparent, while if a rule's context is no longer visible on the surface it is opaque. On the face of it, opaque contexts could pose problems for discovery procedures."]},{"title":"345","paragraphs":["()r<h,rillg (,i r,lh,~ h~u- b<'(q+ a topic ~,ul>,,l+jlilial re.~e~-~r[h it+ ?h..<,h,g',.

We ran regard the hyp(itilesis tester as systematically searching through tile space of different rule orderings, seeking rub' orderings that successfully accounts for the ohserved data.","q'tJe output of this procedure is therefore a list of all possible rule orderings. As ] tnentioned before, I think that tile etlumeratlve approacit adopted here is basically flawed. So althougit this procedure is relatively efficient, in situations where rule ordering is strictly data determined (that is, where only one nile ordering is consistent with the data), in situations where the rules are tmordered (any rule ordering will do), the procedure will generate all possible n! orderings of the n rules.","This was most striking while working with some Japanese data. with 6 dislincl alternations, 4 of which were unordered with respect to each other. The discovery procedure, as presented above, required approximately 1 hour of CPU time to completely analyse this data: it. found <l different underlying forms and 512 different rule s.vstems that generate the Japanese data, differing primarily in tile ordering of the rules.","This demonstrates that a discovery procedure that simply enumerates all possible rule ordering is failing to capture some inlportant insight regarding rule ordering, since unordered rules are much more difficult for this type of procedure to handle, yet, unordered rules are the most comtnon situation in natural langnage phonology.","This problem may be traced back to the assumption made above that a phonological system consists of an ordered set of rules. The Japanese example shows that in many real phonological systems, the ordering of particular rules is simply not strongly data determined. What we need is some way of partitioning different, rule orderings into equivalence classes, as was done with this the different rule contexts in the single rule algorithm, and then compute with these equivalence classes rather than individual rule systems; that is. seek to localize the weak data determinacy.","Looking at the problem in another way, we asked the discovery procedure to find all sets of ordered rules that generate the surface data, which it did.

None the less, it is an empirical question as to whether phonology is best described in terms of ordered interacting rules~ all that l have shown is that such systems are not in principle unlearnable."]},{"title":"6.","paragraphs":["CONCLUSION","In this paper I have presented the details of a discovery procedure that can determine a limited class of phonological rules with arbitrary rule ordering. The procedure has the interesting property that it can be separated into two separate phases, the first, phase being superificial data analysis, that is, collecting the sets C, and C b of equations (2) and (3), and the second phase being the application of the procedure proper, which need never reference the data directly, but can do all of its calculations using C, and Cb ~. This property is interesting because it is likely that 6\", and C a have limiting values, as the number of forms in the surface data increases. That is, presumably the language only has a fixed number of alternations, and each of these only occurs in some fixed contexts, and as soon as we have enough data to see all of these contexts we will have determined C, and C b. and extra data will not. make these sets larger. Thus the computational complexity of the second phase of the discovery procedure is more or less independent, of the size the lexicon, making the entire procedure require linear time with respect to the size of the data. i think this is a desirable result, since there is something counterintuitive to a situation in which the difficulty of discovering a grammar increases rapidly with the size of the lexicon. 7.
