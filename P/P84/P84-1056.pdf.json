The theory of non-serial interactions we present predicts that speech is temporally organised in a very specific way; that is, tee system would not function effectively if the temporal distribution of various types of information in speech were different. The architecture we propose is developed from a study of the task of speech, unde:standing and, furthermore, is specific to this task. Consequently, the paper argues that general problem solving methods are unnecessary for speech understanding. ! INTRODUCTION ]t is generally accepted that (he control structures of speech understanding systems (SUSs) must allow for non-serial interactions between different knowledge sources or components within the system. By r, on-serial interaction (NS1) we refer to communication which extends beyond the normal, serial, flow of information entailed by the tasks undertaken by each component. For example, the output of the word recognition system will provide the input to morphosyntactic analysis, almost by definition; however, the operation of the morpho.~yntaetic anaiyser .,~hould be constrained on some occasions by prosodic cues: say, that he:\" is accented and followed by a \"pause\". whil,':'.t dog is not, in (1) Max gave her dog b4-';cuits. Similarly, the output of the morphosyntactic analyser will provide the input to scrnantie analysis, but on occasion, the operation of the rnorphosyntacLic analyser will be more efficient if it has access to information about the discourse: say, that the horse has no unique referent ip,"]},{"title":"(2) \"/he","paragraphs":["horse raced past the barn fell, because this information will facilitate the reduced relative interpretation (see Crain & Steedman, in press). Thus, NSIs will be required between components which occur both before and after the morphosyntactie analyser in the serial chain of processors which constitute the complete SUS.","NSls can be captured in a strictly serial, hierarchical model, in which the flow of information is always \"upwards\", by computing every possibility compatible with the input at each level of processing. However, this will involve much unnecessary computation within each separate component which could be avoided by utilising information already ten,:;orally available in the signal or context of utterance, ]::ut net part of the input to that level. An alternative architecture is the heterarchical system; this avoids such inefficiency, in principle, by allowing each component, to communicate with all other components in the system. However, controlling the flow of information and specifying the interfaces between components in such systems has proved very difficult (Rcddy & Erman, 1975). The most sophisticated SUS architecture to date is the blackboard model (Erman at a!., 1980). The model provides a means for common representation and a global database for communication between components and allows control of the system to be eentralised and relatively independent of individual components. The four essential elements of the model","blackboard entries, knowledge sources, the blackboard and an intelligent control mechanism - interact t.o emulate a problem solving style that is charactemsticatly incremental and opportunistic. NSIs arc thus allowed to occur, in principle, when they will be of greatest value for preventing unnecessary computation. What is striking about these system architectures is that they place no limlts on the kinds of interaction which occur between component.% that is. none of them are based on any theory of what kind of interactions and eomrnunication will be needed in a SUS. The designers of tile Hearsay-ll system were exphcit about this, arguing that. what was required was an architecture capable of supporting ally form of interaction, but which was still relatively efficient (Erman & Lesser, 1975:484)."]},{"title":"259","paragraphs":["qhcrc appear to bc al least two problems with such an approach Fir.~tly. the designer of an mdivMua] con'.pe~lent must stdl take ml.o account whmh other components should be activated by its outputs, as well as who prey,des ~ts inputs, precmcly because no prmc~plcs of interaction are provided by the model. This entails, even within the loosely structured aggregation hierarchy of the blackboard, some commttment to deci'.;ions about inter-component traffic in information - rational answers to these decismns cannot be provided without a theory of mteractmn between individual components in a SUS.","Secondly. a considerable amount of effort has gone into specifying global scheduling heuristics for maintaining an agenda of knowledge sourcc activation records m blackboard system~, and this has sometimes led to treating the control problem as a distinct issue independent of the don-~ain under consideration, localismg it on a scparatc, schcdu]ing, blackboard (I]alzcr, Errnan and London, t980; Haycs-Roth,"]},{"title":"1983a).","paragraphs":["Once again, this is because the blackboard framework, as iL is defined, provides no inherent constraints on mtcractions (|tayes-Hoth, 1983b). While this means that the model is powerful enough to replicate control strategies used in qualitatively different. AI systems, as well as generatise to problem-solwng in multiple domains (}laycs-I,:oth, 1983a), the blackboard method of control still fails to provide a complete answer to the scheduling problem. It is intended predommantty for solving problems whose solutien depends on heuristics which must cope with large volumes of nmsy data.","In the context of a blackboard-based SUS, where the assumptmn that the formation of the \"correct\" interpretation of an input signal will, mevitably, be accompanied hy the generatmn of many competing (partial) mterprctatmns is Impiicit m the redundancy encoded in the individual knowledge sources, the only real and practical answer to the control problem remains the development of global strategies to keep unnecessary computatmn within practical limits.

I INTERACTIVE DETERMINISM: A THEORY OF NON-SERIAL INTERACTION In this section, we concentrate on the study of NSI between morphosyntactm and prosodic information in specch, largely from the perspective of morphosyntactic analysis. This interaction occurs between two of the better understood components of a SUS and therefore seems an appropriate starting point for the development of a theory of NSIs. Lea (1950) argues that prosodic information will be of use for morphosyntaetic processing. This dmcussion is bascd on the observation (see Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980; Cooper & Sorenson, 1981), that there is a strong correlation between some syntactic boundaries and prosodic effects such as lengthening, step up in fundamental frequency, changes of amplitude and, sometimes, pausing. However, many of these effects are probably irrelevant to morphosyntactic analysis, being, for example, side effects of production, such as planning, hesitation, afterthorghts, false starts, and so forth. If prosody is to be utilised effectively to facilitate morphosyntactic analysis, then we rcqmre a theory eapab!c of indicating when an ambiguous prosodic cue such as lengthening is a consequence of syntactic environment and, therefore, relevant to morphosyntactie analysis. None of tea's proposals make this distinction.","In order to develop such a theory, we require a precise account of morphosyntactie analysm embedded in a model of a SUS which specifies the nature of the NSIs available to the morphosyntaetie analyser Conmdcr a simple modular architecture of a SUS m which most informatmn flows upwards through each lcvel of processing, as in the serial, hierarchical model This information is passed without delay, so any operation performed by a processor will be passed up to its successor m the cham of processors immediately (see Fig. l). Furthermore, we constrain the model as follows: at least from the point of word recognition upwards, only one interpretation is computed at each level. That is, word recognition returns a series of unique, correct words, then morphosyntactic analysis provides the unique, correct grammatical description of these words, and so forth. In order to implement such a constraint on the processmg, the model includes, in addition to the primary flow of information, secondary channels of commumcation which provide for the NSIs (represented by stogie arrows tn the diagram). These interactive channels are bidirectional, allowing one component to request certain highly restrtcted kinds of information from another component and, in principle, can connect any pair of processors in a SUS"]},{"title":"260","paragraphs":["DISCOURSE[ <-~ [ SEMANTICS I"]},{"title":"O\"","paragraphs":["PARSE '~---J"]},{"title":"4>","paragraphs":["WORDS"]},{"title":"'~1 PROSODY I","paragraphs":["Fig. 1 imagine a morphosyntactie analyser which builds a unique structure without backtracking and employs no, or very little, look-ahead Such a parser will face a ehmce point, irresolvable morphcsyntaetically, almost every time it encounters a structural ambiguity, whether local or global Further, suppose that this parser seeks to apply some general strategies to resolve such choices, that is, to select a particular grammatical interpretation when faced with ambiguity. If such a parser m to be able to operate dcterrninlstically, and still return the correct analysis without errer, m cases when a general strategy would yield the wrong analysis, then it will require interactive channels for transmitting a signal capable of blocking the application of the strategy and forcing the correct analysis. These are the secondary channels of communication posited in the model of the SUS above. A theory of NSls should specify when, in terms of the operation of any individual processor, interaction will be necessary; interactive channels for this parser must be capable of providing this information at the onset of any given morphosyntaetic ambiguity, which is defined as the point at which the parser will have to apply its resolution strategy. In order to make the concept of onset of ambiguity precise a model of the This diagram is not intended to be complete and is only included to illustrate the two different types of communication proposed in this paper. morphosyntactic component of a SUS was designed and implemented. This analyser (henceforth the LEXieal-CATegorial parser - because it employs an Extended Categorial Grammar (eg. Ades & Steedman, 1982) representing morphosyntactic information as an extension of the lexicon) makes specific predictions about the temporal availability of non-morphosyntactie information crucial to the theory of NSls presented here. LEXICAT's strategy for resolution of ambiguities is approximately a combination of late closure (Frazier, 1979) and right association (Kimball, 1973). LEXICAT is a species of shift-reduce parser which ernp~oys the same stack for the storage and analysis of input and inspects the top three cells of the stack before each parsing operation. Reduction, however, never involves more than two ee'.ls, so the top cell of the stack acts as a very restricted one word look-ahead buffer. In general, LEXICAT reduces the items in cells two and three provided thai. reduction between cells one and two is not grammatically possible*. ;Yhen LEXICAT encounters ambiguity, in the majority of situations this surfaces as a choice between shifting and reducing. When a shift-reduce ehmce arises between either cells one and two or two and three, reduction will be preferred by default; although, of course, a set of interactive requests will be generated at the point when thin choice arises, and these may provide information which blocks the preferred strategy. The approximate effect of the preference for reduction is that incoming material is attached to the constituent currently under analysis which is \"lowest\" in the phrase structure tree. LEXICAT is mrnilar to recent proposals by Church (1980), i:'ercira (in press) and Shieber (1983), in that it employs general strategies, stated in terms of the parser's basic operations, in order to parse determinislieally with an ambiguous grammar.","A theory of NSls should also specify how interaction occurs. When LEXICAT recogniscs a choice point, it makes a request for non-morphosyntactic information relevant to this thrace on all of the interactive channels to which it is connected; if any of these channels returns a positive response, the default interpretation is overridden. The parser is therefore agnostic concerning which channel might provide the relevant information; for example, analysing (3) ha fore the King rides h~:s horse it's :tsually groomed. The onset of this rnorphosyntactic ambiguity arises when the horse has bcen analysed as a noun phrase.

This highly restricted form of interaction is :;ufficient to guarantee that I,EXICAT will proouce the correct analysis even in cases of severe muttiplc ambiguity; for example, ,Jnalymng the noun compound in (b)lioron epoxy rocket motor chambers, (from Mareu:~, [980:253), th(:rc are fourteen + licit morph:~syntactm interpretations, assuming standard gramrnat.ical analyses (eg.

(198l). from syntactic structure, LEXICAT could produce the correct analyms without error, just through interaction with the prosodic analyser. As each noun enters the ar,alyser, reduction will be blocked by the general strategy but, because LEXICAT will reeognise the existence of ambLguity, an interactive request will be generated before each shift. The prosodic break channel will then prevent reduction after epoxy and after ~otor, forcing the correct analysis ((boron epoxy) ((rocket motor) chambers)), as opposed to the default right-branching structure.","Thus, NSI between the morphosyntaetie and prosodic components can be captured by a bistable, bidirectional link capable of transmitting a request and signaling a binary reponse, either blocking or allowing the application of the relevant strategy according to the presence or absence of a prosodic break. Given the simplicity of this interaction, the prosodic analyser requires no more information from Lhe parser than that a decision is requested concerning a particular boundary. Nor need the prosodic analyser decide, prior to an interactive request on this channel, whether a particular occurrence of, say lengthening, is signalling the presence of a prosodic break, rather than for instance stress, since the request itself will help resolve the interpretation of the cue. Moreover, we have a simple generalisation about when inLeractive requests will be made since Lhis account of NSIs predicts that prosodic infermatmn will only be relevant to morphosyntaetic analysis at the onset of a morphosyntactic ambiguity.","If we assume (boldly) that this account of NSI bcLween the morphosyntaetie and prosodic analysers will generalisc to a complete model of SUS, then such a model rnakcs a set of predictions concerning the temporal availability of interacQvc information in the speech signal and representaQon of the context of utterance. In effect, it claims that the SUS architecture simply presupposes that language is organiscd Jil the appropriate fashion since the model will not. function if it is not. We call this strong prediction about the temporal organisation of the speech signal the Interactive Determinism (ID) Hypothes,s since it is essenQally an extension of Marcus' (1980) Determinism Hypothesis.

This aspect of the ID hypothesis has been tested and corroborated by Paul Warren (1983; in prep; also see Briscoe, 1984:Ch4), who has undertaken a series of speech production experiments in which (typically) ten subjects read aloud a list of sentences. This list contains sets of pairs of locally ambiguous sentences, and some filler sentences so that the purpose of the experiment is not apparent to the subjects. Their productions arc analysed acoustically and the results of this analysis arc then checked statistically. The technique gives a good indicatio~ of whether the cues associated with a prosodic break are present at the appropriate points in the speech signal, and their cons,,stency across different speakers.","Returning to examples (3) and (4) above, we noted that a prosodic break would be required in (4), but not (3), to prevent attachment of rides and hzs horse. Warren found exactly this pattern of results; the duration of rides (and similar items in this position) is an average 51% longer in (4) and the fall in fundamental frequency is almost twice as great with a corresponding step up to horse, as compared to a smooth declination across this boundary in (3). Similarly, analysing (6) 7he company awarded the contract [to/was] the highest bidcler. I,E),qCAT prefers attachment of The company to awarded, treating awarded as the main verb. In the case where awarded must be treated as the beginning cf a reduced relative, Warren found that the duration of the final syllable of company is lengthened and that the same pattern of fall and step up in fundamental frequency occurs. Perhaps the mo'~t interesting cases are ambiguous constituent questmns; Church (19g0,117) argued that it is probably impossible to parse these dcterministieally by employing look-ahead: \"The really hard problem with wh-movement is finding the \"gap\" where the wh-element originated. This is not particularly difficult for a non-deterministic competence theory, but it is (probably) impossible for a deterministic processing model.\" LEXICAT predicts that in a sentence such as (7) ~Vho did you want to give the presents to 5~.e? the potential point of attachment of Who as direct object of want will bc ignored by default in preference for the immediate attachment of to give. Thus there is a prediction that the sentence, when spoken, should contain a prosodic break at this point. Warren has found some evidence for this prediction, i.e. want is lengthened as compared to examples where this is not the correct point of attachment of the prcposed phrase, such as (8) Who did you want t.~ give the presents to? but the prosodic cues, although consistent, are comparatively weak, and it is not clear that listeners are utilising them in the manner predicted by the theory (see Briscoe, 1984:Ch4).","A different kind of support is provided by sentences such as (9) Before the I~ng rides a servant grooms his horse. which exhibit the same local ambiguity as (3) and (,t) but where the semantic interpretation of the noun phrase makes the direct object reading implausible, in this case it is likely that an interactive channel between the semantic and morphosyntactlc analysers would block the incorrect interpretation. So there is a prediction that the functional load on prosodic information will decrease and, therefore, that the prosodic cues to the break may be less marked. This prediction was again corroborated by Warren who found that the prosodic break in examples such as (9) was significantly less rnarked acoustically than for c~arnplcs such as (4)*. In general then, these experimental results support the ID hypothesis. Ill CONTROl, STRUCI'URE AND ORGANISATION In a SU~J based on the ID model, the main flow of information will be defined by the tasks of each component, and their medium of communication, will be a natural consequence of these tasks; as for the serial, hierarchical model. However, in the ID model, unlike the hierarchical model, there arc less overheads because unnecessary computation at any icv(.l of processing will be eliminated by the NSIs between components. These interactions will, of course, require a large number of interactive channels; but these do not imply a common representation language because the information which passes along them is representation-independent and restricted to a minimal request and a binary response. Each channel in the full SUS will be dedicated to a specific interaction between components; so the morphosyntactie component will require a prosodic break channel and a unique referent channel (see example (1)), and so forth. Thus, a complete model of SUS will implement a theory of the types of NSI required between all components. Finally, the ID model will not require that any individual processor has knowledge of the nature of the operations of another processor; that is, the Note that this result is inexplicable for theories which attempt to derlve the prosodlc structure of a sentence directly from its syntactic structure; see Cooper 3: Paccia-Cooper (].980:181f)."]},{"title":"263","paragraphs":["morphosyr:tacLic analyser need riot know what is being eoiT~puted at the other end of the prosodic break channel, or how; nor riced the p:'osodic analyser know why it is eomputin~ the presence or absence of a prosodic break.

The control structure of this model is straightforward; after each separate operation of each individual c~mponent the results of this operation will be passed to the next component in the serial chain ol processors.

Furthermore, although each individual"]},{"title":"eomK.enent","paragraphs":["determines when .N3Is will occur, because of the restricted nature of this interaction each component can still be developed as a completely independent knowledge source.","The deterministic nature of the individual component~ of this SUS eliminates the need for any glob,d hcurm!ies to be brought into the analysis o[ the speech signal. Thus we have di--pensed neatly with the requirement for an over-powerful and over-general problem-solving framework, such as the blackboard, and replacr:d it with a theory specific to the domain under conmderalion; namely, language. The theory of X~q}s offers a uatisfaetory specific method for speech undci.-:tallding which allowrr the separate specialist c,~mpor;ent procedures of a SUS to be \"a!Forithmetized'\" and compiled. As Erman et al. (1980::L16) suggest: \"In such a ease tile flexibility of a system like Hcarsay-ll may no longer be needed\". \"fhe restrictions on the nature and directionality of NSI ehanneis in a SUE:, and the situations in which they [iced to be activated, a;Iowt; a modular system who'.~e control structure is not inuch more complex than th:.~t of the hierarchical mode}, and yet, via the net.work of interactive channels, achieves the efficiency sought 5y the heterarchieal and blackboard models, without the concomitant prcblems of common knowledge representations and complex eom!Tmni~zations protocols between separate knowledge sources. Thus, the ID mode! dispenses with the overhe.id costs of data-directed activation of '.mowledge sources and the need for opportunistic scheduling or a complex focus-of-control mechanism. IV CONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a very idealised model of a SUS with a simple organisation and control structure, Clearly, the ID model assumes a greater level of understanding of many aspects of speech processing than is current. For example, we have assurncd that the word recognition component is capable of returning a series of unique, correct lexical items; even with interaction of the kind envisaged, it is doubtful that our current understanding of acoustic-phcnetic analysis is good enough for it to be possible to build such a component now. Nevertheless, ti.. experimental work reported by Marslcn-Wilson & Tyler (1980) and Cole & Jakimik (1980), for example, suggests that listeners are capable of accessing a unique Icxical item on the basis of the acoustic signal and interactive fcedback from the developing analysis of the utterance and its context (often before the acoustic signal is complete). More seriously, from the perspective of interactive determinism, little has been said about the many other interactive channels which will be required for speech understanding and, in particular, whether, these channels can be as restricted a.~: the prosodic break channel. For example, consider the channel which will be required to capture the interaction in example (9); this will need to be sensiLive to something like semantic \"anomaly\". tIowever, ?.emantic anomaly is an inherently vague concept, particularly by comparison with that of a prosodic break. Similarly, as we noted above, the morphosyntactic analyser will require an interactive channel to the discourse analyser which indieates whether a noun phrase followed by a potential relative clause, such as tar horse in (3), has a unique referent. However. since this ehannel would only seem to be relevant to ambiguities involving relative clauses, it appears to east doubt on the claim that interaetive requests are generated automatically on every channel each time any type of ambiguity is encountered. This, in turn, suggests that the control structure proposed in the last section is oversimplified.","Nevertheless, by studying these tasks in terms of far more re,;trictcd and potentially more eomputationally efficient models, we are more likely to uncover restrictions on language which, once discovered, will take us a step closer to tractable solutions to the task of speech understanding. Thus, the work reported here suggests that language is organised in such a manner that morphosyntactic analysis can proceed detcrministically on the basis of a very restricted parsing algorithm, because nonstructural information necessary to resolve ambiguities will be available in the speech signal (or representation of the context of utterance) at the point when the choice arises during mcrphosyntaetic analysis.","Tile account of morphosyntactie analysis that thls constraint allows is more elegant, parsimonious 264 and empirically adequate than employing look-ahead (Marcus, 1980). Firstly, an account based on look-ahead is forced to claim that local and global ambiguities are resolved by different mechanisms (since the latter, by definition, cannot be resolved by the use of morphosyntaetic information further downstream in the signal), whilst the ID model requires only one mechanism. Secondly, restricted look-ahead fails to delimit accurately the class of so-called garden path sentences (Milne, 1982; Briscoe, 1983), whilst the ID account correctly predicts their \"interactive\" nature (Briscoe, 1982, 1984; Crain & Steedman, in press). Thirdly, look-ahead involves delaying decisions, a strategy which is made implausible, at least in the context of speech understanding, by the body of experimental results summarised by Tyler (1981), which suggest that morphosynta:':tie analysis is extremely rapid.","The generatisation of these results to a complete model of SUS represents commitment to a research programme which sets as its goal the discovery of const.raints on language which allow the associated processing tasks to bc implemented in an efficient and tractable manner What is advocated here, therefore, is the development of a computational theory of iangoage processing derived through the"]},{"title":"study of","paragraphs":["language from the perspective of these processing tasks, much in the ~ame way in whmh Marr (1982) developed his comput.ational theory of vision.
