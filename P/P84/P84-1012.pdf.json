This paper reviews the limitations of several proposed revisions. It proposes a new definition of YNQs baaed upon research on a type of conversational irnpIieature, termed here setdar imp/ie,,ture, that helps define appropriate responses to YNQs. By representing YNQs as sealer qtteriee it is possible to support a wider variety of system anti user responses in a principled way.","I INTRODUCTION If natural language interfaces to question-answering systems are to support a broad range of responses to user queries, the way these systems represent queries for response retrieval should be reexamined. Theorists of question-answering commonly define questions in terms of the set of all their possible [true) answers. Traditionally, they have defined t/us-no quesgiofts (YNQs) as propositional questions (?P) or as a special type of alternative question (?P V ?Q), in which the second alternative is simply the negation of the fir.~t (?P V ?\"P). So 'Does Mary like skiing?' would be represented as flikr(lffary,skling) or ?like(Alary.okiing) V \"~-Iikt(Mary, skiing) and the range of appropriate responses wouhl be gee, no and, possibly, unknown. • \" ilowever, both theoretleal wnrk and empirical studies of naturally occurring question-answer exchanges have shown this approach to be inadequate: ?~s, .o. and unknown form only a small portion of the set ¢,f all appropriate responses to a YNQ. Furthermore, for some YNQ's. none of these simple direct responses alone i~ appropri:,te. While it is widely recognized (llobbs, 1979, Pollack, 1982} that indirect resp.nses I to YNQs represent an important option for respondents in natural discourse, standard theories of question-answering have n,~t been revised accordiugly. A practical COllsPquence surface~ when attempts are made t.o support indirect responses to YNQs computationally. For lack of alternative representations, question-answering systems which would permit indirect responses must still represent YNQs as if the direct respons-s were the 'norm', and then resort to ad hoe manipulations to generate second-class 'indirect' responses, thus perpetuating an asymmetric distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' responses. However. resea.'h under way on how a type of generalized conversational implieatttre, termed here scalar irrtplieature, can be used to guide the generation and iaterpretion of indirect respt,nses to YNQs sugges/,s a revi~ed representation fi)r YNQs which scrotums)dates a wide variety of responses in a uniform way.","II CURRENT REPRESENTATIONS OF YNQ, S Among st:~ad:,rd accounts of ¥NQs, I-lintikka's (l.lh:tik.~a, 197~) is one of the shnl)lest and mo~t widely accepted, c~.,mbinh~g the llndirect r~sponses to YNQs tr~ defined h~:re as responses other than lltR, n0, or some expression of ignorance. concepts of YNQ\" as pn,positional question \" and as alternative question; as such, it will be used below to represent traditional approaches in general. To define attswerhood, the conditions under which a response eonnts as an answer to a natural-language query, Hintikka divides qneriq~s into two parts: an imperative or optaGve operator {[). roughly expressing 'bri,g it about that', and a daesideratu~,n, a specification of the epistemie state a questhmer desires. For Hintikka, a YNQ is a ~peciai case of alterna(Jve question in which the negative alternative 'or not P' has been suppressed. So the desideratum of a YNQ is of the f¢~rm"]},{"title":"([","paragraphs":["know thai P) V {I kin, u, that #t~3+P}. where net-l- indicates the negation-fi)rming process. 'Does Mary like skiing?' thus has a.s its desideratum I know that ,~htrg li];e.* skiing or I kno~ ihat Aiary does not like skiing, or, more concisely, fK~Jike{Marg, skling) V Ks~likc{'Marll, ekiing), where K S is the epistemic representatitm of 'S knows that'. The full sense of the query is then 'Bring it aboot that 1 know that Mary likes skiing or that I know that Mary does not like skiing', which can be represented by ! [KsP V K.~',P). Possible resp.nses are simply {P,-,P}, or {yes,no). A. tI_~othesls Confirmation Bolingcr (Boliuger, 1978) has called such interpretations into question by showing that YNQs may have very different meanings from their alternatlve-questioa counterparts; they also have more restricted paraphrase and intonation patterns. In 13oliuger's view the term I/US-no qtterl/ has hypnolized scholars into a.ssurrling that, simply because a class of question can be answered by a 2us or no, the~ altern:ttives are critcrial, and every YNQ is intended to elicit, one or the other. He proposes instead that YNQs be viewed as hypotheses put forward for confirmation, arncadmenL or diseonfirnladon - in any degree. Thus, in Bolinger's exampie (l), the","(1) Q: Do you like llonolnlu?","R: Just a little. questioner (Q)'s hypothesis 'you like tloaoh, iu' is amended by ~he respondent (R) in a re.-ponse v, hich is neither .t, es n,~r no bnt somewhere in between. In his example (2), Q's hypothesis 'it is","(2) Q: Is it difficult?","R: It's imposeS'de. difficult' is confirmed by R's as,ertion of a more positive resi~onse than a simple go.;. While Bolingcr makes a good ca'.:.e for the inadequacy of sttmdard views of YNQs, the revisi,m hv I)mposes is itself :,~, ]i,tited.

In fact, 'str,mg affirmation' might better t)e provided by a respon.-e -.uch as '1 am absolutely sure it's difficult' than by \"he response he suggests. And ther,~ are equally appropriate responses to the queries in (l) and {2) that are not easily explained in terms of degree of hypotl~esis confirmatit,n, u.~ shown iu (3) and (4)."]},{"title":"/48","paragraphs":["(:~;) Q: 1),, you like ! h,,a.hllu?","a.

Finally, l~.ii~ger does not propose a representatiozt to accommodate hi~ hy~,~,the~is-confirmation model. B. Fo~oesed YNf~.~ Similarly, Ki,'fer (Kid,for, 19~;0) points out evidence for the inadt,quacy of the standard view of YNQs, but proposes no unified sohrti.n. In a stt~dy of the indirect speech acts that may be p~.rh~rm,'d I,? \"(NQ~, h,\" nc~le~ that certain YNQs, which he terms .focussed YTVQs, aetu:dly function as v,h-queslions. Focussed YNQs I'¢,r Kit'f,'r are YNQs that are marked in some way (:~l)parenlly by sire:.~ i to il~di,.ate a background aasuntption which Q and l{ typic:ally share. For example, (Sa) is not a focussed YNQ while {Y~bHY, d ) are. While any of the four may be auswrted with 9~,~ or","a. 1.~ John h,aving for .~tockholm tomorrow?","b. Is .Mhn leaving for Stockholm TOMORROW?","c. Is John h.aviug for STOCKIR~I.M tomorr,~w?","d. [s JOIIN leaving fi~r St~wkh.~dm tom~)rrow? no, ii is also po~.ii,le that, if Q a~ks (,Sb). she want~ R to answer the question 'When is Johi! leaving for Stockholm?'; if she a.,;ks (Se) she may want to know 'Where is John going tomorrow?'; and if she asks (Sd) she may want to know 'Who is leaving for Stockhohn tomorrow?\" Titus a f,~cussed YNQ resemhles the wh-question that might be formed by replacing the focussed element in the desideratum with a corresponding Pro-element. In Kiefer's analysis, only one eh't~ent can he focussed, so resl~mses such as 'lie's leaving for Paris Thursday' will not be accommodated. Although Kiefer does not propose a representation for focugsed YNQs, a di..:j,nc! resembling the desideratum of a wh-question might I,e added to the traditional representation to areommodate his third :tlterna|ive: for (5d} this might take the form 'Is John leaving for Stoekhohn tomorrow, or, if not, who is?' or, in Hintikka's notation,","! KQleaving(.Iohn,Stockholm,tomorrow) V","Kq-leav ing{.Ioh n,Stoek h-Ira,tomorrow) V","3x Kqleav ing(x,Stoek holm,tomorrow). This represenl.atiou reflects another problem posed by Kiefer's analysis: the third disjunet is appropriate only when the second also is and not when the direct response ~les is true. For example, a response of 'Bill is' to (Sd) seems to convey that John h not leaving for Stockhoha tomorrow. Thus viewing some YNQs as wh*qm,,qions req.ires a rather more coml~lex representation than simply adding a wh-question as a third disjunct. * In addition, defining different representations for various YNQ subtypes seems a le~s than satisfactory solution to tbe linfitations presented by current representations of YNQs. A more unified solution to the problems identified by Bolinger and Kiefer would clearly be desirable. Such a solution is suggested by current research on the role conversational implieature plays in accounting for indirect re.~pons~s to YN~.~)s. III CONVERSATIONAL I'MPLICATURE AND YNQS In a large cl:~s of in,!irect respon:~e.~ to YNQs, query and response each refi, r to an entity, attribute, state, activity, or event that can bo viewed as appearing on sorae eea~e; such references \"In f~et, the third di~jon~t would have to be something like ~ KQ-~leaving(Jol, n,~3oekholm,to~,~,~rrou,} A tea~ingfz.Sterkl~olm,tomorrow). aThe idea.~ outlined in the following section are discussed in more detail in (tlir,~rhberg, 1984). will be termed scalars and responses in such exchanges will be termed scalar responnes, s In such scalar exchanges, questioners can infer both a direct response and additional implicit information flora the unreqm'sted information provided by the respondent. In {0) for example, Q is entitled to infer the direct response no or I don \"~ know","(6) Q: Are mushrooms poisonous?","R: Some are. and the additional information that It believes that there may be mushrooms that are not poisonous, ew, n though 3z(rnashroom(z) A poism~ous(x)) does not IogicMly i-,{v an)\" of this information. Clearly 'Some are' is an appropriate r,.~pouse to the query - more appropriate in fact than a simple no, wllich might convey that. no mushrooms are poisonous - but what makes it appropriate? Grire's (Grice, 1975) Cooperative Principle claims that, without contrary evide~cp, participants in convers~.tion assume their partners are trying to be cooperative. In consequence, they recognize certain conversational maxims, such as Grice's Mnzirn."]},{"title":"of Quantit|l","paragraphs":["u I Make your eoutribution as informative as is","required (for the current purposes of the exchange).","b) Do not make your contribution more informative","than is required. and his ~,~azint ol QuoJity","Try to make your contribution one that is true.","a) Do not say what you believe to be false.","b) Do not. say that for which you I~k adequate","evidence. Speaker and hearer's mutual recognition of these maxims may give rise to eort~erscttional ~mp~ieaturen: An utterance eonveraatios~allll intp~icates a proposition P when it conveys P by virtue of the bearer's assumption of the speaker's cooperativeness. While s speaker may not always obey the~e maxims, the hearer's expectations are based on her belief that such conventions represent the norm. A. Scalar Pred|eatlon Following Grice, Horn {flora, 1972) observed that, when a speaker refers to a value on some scale defined by eentantl,\" entai|ment 4, that value represents the highest value on its scale the speaker can t ruthful!y affirm. The speaker is saying as much {Quantity) as she truthfully (Quality) can. Higher values on that scale are thus implicitly marked by the speaker as not known to be the case or known not to be the ease. 5 Values lower on the scale will of course be marked as true, since they are entailed. Horn called this phenomenon scalar predleation, and Gazdar {Gazdar, 1979) later used a variation as the basis for a phenomenon he termed sea/at quantity irrtp[ieature. Here a much revi~d and extended version will be termed scalar implleature. Horn's simple notion of scalar predication does provide a principled ba.~is for interpreting ({3) attd similar indirect responses to YNQs where scales are defined by entailment. Some is the highest value on a quantifier scale that R can truthfully affirm. Truth°values of higher scalars such as all are either unknown to R or believed by him to be false. Thus, if Q recognizes R's implieature, roughly, 'As far as 1 know, not all mushrooms are poisonous', she will derive the direct response to her query as no or I don ~ know. H must believe either that some mushrooms are not poisonous or that some mushrooms may not be poisonous. 4W semantieMly entails Tiff T is true whenever W is. 5Whether x speaker implicates ignorance or falsity of • value is t subject of ~ome disagreement •merit Ilorn and those (Gasdar, lg7g, So~mes, 1082) who h•ve taken up his basic notion, In (ltirschberg, 1984) I contend that such implieatures should be viewed as didunctions, K(~T) V ~K(T), which may be dbamhiguated by the nature of the ordering relation or by the context."]},{"title":"49 d¢","paragraphs":["It is also important to note that, in (6), were R simply to deny Q's query or to assert ignora~ce with a simple"]},{"title":"[ don't know, Q","paragraphs":["would be entitled, by virtue of the Cooperative Principle, to assume that there is no scalar value whose truth R can in fact affirm.

So, indirect scalar responses may be defined UlU,n a number of metrics and may involve the affirmation or negation of higher, lower, or alternate values.
