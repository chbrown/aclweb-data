Makoto NAGAO","Department of Electrical Engineering","Kyoto University Sakyo. Kyoto. Japan ABSTRACT","A powerful grammar writing system has been developed. Thts grammar wrtttng system ts called GRADE (GRAmmar DEscriber). GRADE allows a grammar writer to write grammars Including analysts, transfer, and generation using the same expression. GRADE has powerful grammar writing facility. GRADE allows a grammar writer to control the process of a machine translation. GRADE also has a function to use grammatical rules written tn a word dictionary. GRADE has been used for more than a year as the software of the machine translation project from Japanese Into Engltsh. which ts supported by the Japanese Government and called Nu-proJect. 1. Objectives Vhen we develop a machine translation system, the intention of a grammar writer should be accurately stated tn the form of grammatical rules. Otherwise, a good grammar system cannot be achieved. A programming language to write a grammar, which ts composed of a grammar writing language, and a software system to execute tt. ts necessary for the development of a machine translation system (Bottet 82).","If a grammar writing language for a machine translation system is to have a powerful writing facility, tt must fulfill the following needs.","A grammar wrttlng language must be able to manipulate linguistic characteristics tn Japanese and other languages. The 11ngulstlc structure of Jcpanese tS largely different from that of Engltsh, for instance. Japanese does not restrict the word order strongly, and allows the omission of some syntactic components. Vhen a machine translation system translates sentences between Japanese and English, a grammar writer must be able to express such characteristics.","A grammar writing language should have a framework to write grammars tn analysis, transfer, and generation phase using the same expression. It Is undeslrable for the grammar writer to learn several different expressions for different stages of a machine translation.","There are many word specific linguistic phenomena tn a natural language. A grammar writer must be able to add word specific rules to a machine translation system one after another to deal wtth word specific linguistic phenomena, and improve hts machine translation system over a long period. Therefore. a grammar writing language must be able to handle grammatical rules written tn word dictionaries. There ts a natural sequence tn a translation process. For example, a parstng of noun phrases which do not contain sententtal forms is executed before a parsing of more complex noun phrases. An approximate parsing of compound sentences is executed before a parsing of complex sentences. Also. when an application sequence of grammatical rules are written explicitly, a grammar writing system can execute the rules efficiently. because the system Just needs to test the applicability of a restricted number of grammatical rules. So. a grammar writing language must be able to express several phases of a translation process in the expression explicitly.","A grammar writing language must be able to treat the syntactic and semantic ambiguities tn natural languages. But tt must have some mechanisms to avoid a combinatorial explosion. Keeping these points in mind, we developed a new programming system, which ts composed of the grammar writing language and its executing system. Ve wtll call it GRADE (Grammar Describer). 2. Expression of the data for a processing The form of data to express the structure of a sentence during an analysis, a transfer, and a generation process has a strong effect on the framework of a grammar wrtttng language. GRADE uses an annotated tree structure for expressing a sentence. Grammatical rules tn GRADE are described tn the form of tree-to-tree transformation wtth annotation to each node. 338","The annotated tree tn GRADE ts a tree structure whose nodes have ltsts of property names and their values. Figure 1 shows an example of the annotated tree."]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["-CAT - S~ -NUMBER - SINGULAI LE-NUMBER - -SEM = HUMAN E-CAT",": Engllsh Category Symbol E-NUMBER: English Number (SINGULAR or PLURAL) E-SEM :Engltsh Semantic Marker Ftgure 1 An example of the annotated tree tn GRADE","The annotated tree can express a lot of Information such as syntactic category, number. semantic marker, and other thtngs. The annotated tree can also express a flag tn tts node. whlch ts stmtlar to a flag tn a conventional programming language, to control the process of a translation. For example, in a grammar of a generation, a grammatical rule ts applled to all nodes tn the annotated tree, whose processtngs are not finished. In such a case, a grammatical rule checks the DONE flag whether ttts processed or not. end sets T to the newly processed ones. 3. Rewriting Rule tn GRADE","The bastc component of a grammar wrtttng language is a rewriting rule. The rewriting rule In GRADE transforms one annotated tree tnto anoti~er annotated tree. The rewriting rule can be used In the grammars of analysts, transfer and generation phase in a machtne translation system, because the tree-to-tree transformation by thts rewriting rule ts very powerful.","A rewriting rule tn GRADE conststs of a declaration part and amatn part. The declaration part has the following four components. (1) Directory Entry part, whtch contains a grammar writer's name, a verston number of the rewrttin 9 rule, and the last date of the revision. Thts part ts not used at the execution ttme of the rewriting rule. A grammar wrtter ts able to see the information by ustng the help factltty of the GRADE system. (2) Property Definition part, where a grammar writer declares the property names and thetr values. (3) Vartable Intt. part, where a grammar wrtter declares the names of variables. (4) Matchtng Instruction part, where a grammar wrtter specifies the mode to apply the rewriting rule to an annotated tree. The matn pant specifies the transformation tn the rewriting rule. and has the following three parts. (1) Matchtng Condition part. where the condition of a structure and the property values of an annotated tree ts described. (2) Substructure Operation part, whtch specifies operations for the annotated tree that has matched wtth the condition wrttten tn the matching condition pant. (3) Creatton part, whtch spec|ftes the structure and the property values of the transformed annotated tree. 3.1. Matching Condition part","The matchtng condition part specifies the condition of the structure and the property values of the annotated tree. The matchtng condition part allows a grammar writer to spectfy not only a rtgtd structure of the annotated tree, but also structures whtch may repeat several ttmes, structures which may be omttted, and structures tn which the order of thetn sub-structures ts not restricted. For example, the structure tn whtch adjectives (ADJ) repeat arbitrary ttmes and a noun (N) follows them tn Engllsh ts expressed as follows. ADJ ... ADJ N --->","matching_condition: • (ADJS N): AOJS: anyC~(ADJ)): The structure 11ke a combination of a verb (V) and an adverbial parttcle (ADVPART) tn thts sequence wtth or without a pronoun (PRON) tn between tn Engltsh tswrttten as follows.

Control of the grammatical rule applications","A grammar writing language must be able to express detailed phases of a translation process tn the expression expltctt]y. GRADE allows a grammar writer to divide a whole grammar into several parts. Each part of the grammar ts called a subgnammar. A subgrammar may correspond to a grammatical unit such as the parstng of a stmple noun phrase and the partng of a compound sentence. A whole grammar ts then described by a network of subgrammars. Thts network ts called a subgnammar network. A subgrammar network allows a grammar writer to control the process of a translation tn detatl. When • subgrammar network tn the analysts phase consists of a subgrammar for a noun-phrase (SG1) and a subgrammar for a verb-phrase (SG2) tn this sequence, the executor of GRADE first appltes SG1 to an input sentence, then appltes SG2 to the result of an application of SG1. 4.1.

When a grammar wrtter specifies the second type. which |s called ORDER(2). the executor of GRADE trtes to apply RRt+I ..... RRn to the result of the application of RRt. So.

After that. the executor checks the entry part and find the label of the start node START tn the network. Then the executor searches the node START and applles the subgrammar PRE-STEP-1 to the tnput tree. After the application, the executor appltes the subgrammer PRE-STEP-2 (node name: LOOP) and PRE-STEP-3 (node name: A) to the annotated tree tn thts sequence.

After that, the executor calls butlt-tn functton MAP-SG to apply 342 the subgrammar EVALUATE-CASE-FRAME to each sub-tree of the value of OK. and sets the result to eX again. The subgrammar EVALUATE-CASE-FRAME computes the evaluation score end sets the score to the value of the property SCORE tn the root node of the sub-trees.
