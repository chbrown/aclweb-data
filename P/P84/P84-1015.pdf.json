ABSTRACT","This paper presents a prototype, not completely operational, that is intended to use c-graphs in the translation of assemblers. Firstly, the formalization of the structure and its principal notions (substructures, classes of substructures, order, etc.) are presented. Next section de-scribes the prototype which is based on a Transformational System as well as on a rewriting system of c-graphs which constitutes the nodes of the Transformational System. The following part discusses a set of operations on the structure. Finally, the implementation in its present state is shown. 1. INTRODUCTION.","In the past [10,11], several kinds of representation have been used (strings, labelled trees, trees with \"decorations\", graphs of strings and (semantic) networks). C-graphs had its origin as an alternative in the representation and in the treatment of ambiguities in Automatic Translation. In earlier papers [4,5] this structure is named E-graph but c-graph is better suited since it is a generalized \"grafo de cadenas\" (graph of strings). This structure combines some advantages of the Q-systems [7] and of the trees of ARIANE-78 [1,2,11], in particular, the use of only one structure for all the translation process (asln the former) and foreseeable decidability and parallelism (as in the latter). This paper presents a prototype, not completely operational, that uses c-graphs and is intended to translate assemblers to refine the adequacy of this kind of structure in the translation of natural languages. 2. DEFINITIONS","C-graph. A c-graph G is a cycle free,labelled graph [1,9] without isolated nodes and with exactly one entry node and one exit node. It is completely determined by a 7-tupie: G=(A,S,p,I,O,E,¢), where A is a set of arcs, S a set of nodes, p a mapping of A into SxS, I the input node, 0 the output node, E a set of labels (c-trees, c-graphs) and E a mapping of A into E. For the sake of simplicity, arcs and labels will be merged in the representation of G (cf. Fig.1 . Interesting c-graphs are sequential c-graphs (cf. Fig.2a) and bundles (cf. Fig.2b)."]},{"title":"G= 1~7","paragraphs":["h~...~ e -- v k A={1 ..... 12} ; S={1 ..... 7} ; I={1} ; 0={7} p={ (1,1,2), (2,2,4), (3,4,5),"]},{"title":"(4,5,7), (5,5,6),","paragraphs":["(6,6,7), (7,6,7), (8,2,3), (9,3,4), (10,3,5), (11,1,2), (12,1,2)}","E={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i ,j,k}"]},{"title":"E={ (I ,a), (2,b), (3,f), (4,g), (5, i), (6,j),","paragraphs":["(7,k), (8,c), (9,d), (lO,e), (11,b), (12,h) } Fig.1.

A c-tree or a tree with decorations is an ordered tree, with nodes labelled by a label and a decoration that is itself a decorated tree, possibly empty.","Classes of c-graphs. There are three major classes: (1) recursive c-graphs (cf. Fig.3a) where each arc is labelled by a c-graph; (2) simple c-graphs (cf. Fig.l) where each arc is labelled by a c-tree and (3) regular c-graphs, a proper subclass of the second that is obtained by concatenation and alternation of simple arcs (cf. Fig.3b). By denoting concatenation by \".\" and alternation by \"+\", we have an evident linear representation. For example, G4=g+i.(j+k). Note that not every c-graph may be obtained by these operations, e.g.G.","Substructures. For the sake of homogeneity, the only substructures allowed are those that are themselves c-graphs. They will be called sub-"]},{"title":"61","paragraphs":["-c-graphs or seg's. For example, G1 and G2 are seg's of G. G2 a) A recursive c-graph. b) A regular c-graph. G4= Fig.3. Two classes of c-graphs.","Isolatability. It is a feature that determines, for each c-graph G, several classes of seg's An isolated seg G' is intuitively a seg that has no arcs that \"enter\" or that \"leave\" G'. Depending on the relation that each isolated seg keeps with the rest of the c-graph, several classes of isolatability can be defined.","a) Weak isolatability. A seg G' of G is weakly isolatable (segif) if and only if for every node x of G' (except I' and 0'), all of the arcs that leave or enter x are in G ~. E.g.: G5=i is a segif of G.","b) Normal isolatability. A seg G' of G is normaly isolatable (segmi) if and only if it is a segif and there is a path, not in G', such that it leaves I' and enters 0'. Example: G6=k is a segmi of G.","c) Strong isolatability. A seg G' of G is strongly isolatable (segfi) if and only if the only node that has entering arcs not in G' is I' and the only node that has leaving arcs not in G' is 0'. When G' is not an arc and there is no segfi contained strictly in G', then G' is an \"elementary segfi\"; if G contains no segfi, then G. is elementary. E.g. G4 is a segfi of G.","Order and roads. Two order relations are considered: (l) a \"vertical\" order or linear order of the arcs having the same initial node and (2) a \"horizontal\" order or partial order between two arcs on the same path. A road is a path from I to 0 Vertical order induces a linear order on roads. 3. DEFINITION OF THE PROTOTYPE.","The prototype consists of a model and a data structure. The model is essentially a generalization of a Transformational System (TS) analogous to ROBRA [2] and whose grammars are rewriting systems of c-graphs (RSC) [4,5,6]. Regarding data structure, we use c-graphs, 3.1A Transformational ~stem. This TS is a c-graph-~c-graph transducer. It is a \"control\" graph whose nodes are RSC and the arcs are labelled by conditions.","A TS is a cycle free oriented graph, with only one input and such that, CI) Each node is labelled with a RSC or &nul. (2) &nul has no successor. (3) Each grammar of the RSC has a transition","scheme S or c (empty scheme). ~4) Arcs of the same initial node are ordered. TS works heuristically. G~ven a c-graph gn as an input, it searches for the first path endin~ in &nul. This fact implies that all of the transition schemes on the path were satisfied. Any scheme not satisfied provokes a search of a new path. For example, if $1 is satisfied, TS produces Gl(gn)=g 1 and it proceeds to calculate G2(G1(go))=g ~. IY S 4' is satisfied the system stops and produce~ g~. Otherwise, it backtracks to GI and tests S2.-If it is satisfied g] is produced. Otherwise, it tests S3, etc. • Snul S 4 ~- &nul Fig.4.

It is a c-graph scheme composed of two parts: the structural descriptor that defines the geometrical form and the condition (between slashes) that tests label information. The first part use \"*\" as an \"element of structural description\" in the first rule. It denotes the fact that no seg must be right-concatenated to g3+~2+g4. The right side defines the transformation to be done.

These operations produce sequentlaI c-graphs and bundles respectively, as well as the polynomia] writing of regular c-graphs.","Expansion.

There may be several kinds of c-trees that can be constructed but we search for a tree that keeps vertical and horizontal or-ders, i.e. one that codes the structure of the c-graph. An \"and-or\" (y-o) tree is well suited for this purpose. The result of the operation will be a c-graph with one and only one arc labelled by the and-or tree. For example, arb(G)=G14 (cf. Fig. 7).

This operation inserts a c-graph G' into another, G, by merging two distinct nodes (x, y) of G with the input and output of G'. Addition requires only that insertion does not produce cycles. Note that if (I,0) are taken as a couple of nodes, we have alternation. Example, let (2,3) be a couple of nodes of G16 and take G'=G17=s+u. The resulting c-graph is G18. c G16=c ---c i 2 3 5 c GI8= c i 2 Fig.8. Addition of a c-graph. Erasing. This eliminates a substructure G' of a c-graph G. Erasing may destroy the structure even if we work with isolated seg's. Consequently, it is only defined on particular classes of seg's, namely segfi's and segmi's. For any other substructure, we eliminate the smaller segmi that contains it. A special case constitutes a segfi G' such that I and 0 do not belong to G'. Eliminating G' in such a case produces two non-connecting nodes in the c-graph that we have chosen to merge to preserve homogeneity. Example: let us take G and G'= GIO, then the result of erasing GIO from G is G19= G2.G4. 4. IMPLEMENTATION. A small system has been programmed in PROLOG [4] (mainly operations) and in PASCAL (TS and RSC). For the first approach, we chose regular c-graphs to work with, since there is always a string to represent a c-graph of this class.","In its present state, the system has two parts: (1) the Transformational System including the rewriting system and (2) the set of local and global operations.","The TS is interactive. It consists of an analyzer that verifies the structure of the TS given as a console input and of the TS proper. As data we have the console input and a segment composed of transition schemes. There are no finer controls for different modes of grammar execution.","Regarding operations and from a methodological point of vlew, algorithms for c-graph treatment can be divided in two classes: (I) the one where we search for substructures and (2) the one where this search is not needed. Obviously, local operations belong to the first class, but among global operations, only concatenation, alternation and expansion belong to the second one. Detailed description of algorithms of this part Of ~he system can be found in [4]. 5. CONCLUSION.","Once we have an operational version of the prototype, it is intended as a first approach to proceed to the translation of assemblers of the microprocessors available in our laboratory such as INTEL's 8085 or 8080 and MOTOROLA's 6800. 6.
