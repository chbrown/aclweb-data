MA 02139 AIISTRACI\" Natural langt~ages are often assumed to be constrained so that they are either easily learnable or parsdble, but few studies have investigated the conrtcction between these two \"'functional'\" demands, Without a fonnal model of pamtbility or learnability, it is difficult to determine which is morc \"dominant\" in fixing the properties of natural languages. In this paper we show that if we adopt one precise model of \"easy\" parsability, namely, that of boumled context parsabilio,, and a precise model of \"easy\" learnability, namely, that of degree 2 learnabilio\" then we can show that certain families of grammars that meet the bounded context parsability ct~ndition will also be degree 2 learnable. Some implications of this result for learning in other subsystems of linguistic knowledge are suggested. 1 I INTRODUCTION Natural languages are usually assumed to be constrained so that they arc both learnable and par'sable. But how are these two functional demands related computationally? With some exceptions, 2 there has been little or no work connecting these two key constraints on natural languages, even though linguistic researchers conventionally assume that learnability somehow plays a dominant role in \"shaping\" language, while eomputationalists usually assume that efficient prncessability is dominant. Can these two functional demands be recrtnciled? There is in fact no a priori reason to believe that the demands of learnability and parsability are necessarily compatible. After all. learuability has to do with the scattering of possible grammars with respect tu evidence input to a learning procedure. This is a property of a family of grammars. Efficient parsability, on the other hand. is a property of a single grammar. A family of grammars could be easily learnable but not easily parsable, or vice-versa. It is easy to provide examples of both sorts. For example, there are finite collections of grammars generating non-rccursivc languages that are easily learnable (just use a disjoint vocabulary as triggering evidcncc to distinguish among them), Yet by dcfinition these languages cannot be easily parsable. On the other hand as is wcll known even the class of all 1. This v,'ork has h~n ~rried out at the MIT Artificial Intelliger.¢e I,aboratory. Support for the l.aborator3\"s artificial intdligenc¢ research ~s provided m part by the Dcf~:nse Advanced Research Projects Agency. 2. See Ik~r~iek 1980 for a sketch of the connections between learnability and parsability. Iinite languages plus the tmiver~d inlirtite language coxcring them all is not learnable from just positive evidence (Gold 1967). Yet each of these languages is linite state and hence efficiently analyzable.","'lhis paper establishes tile first known resolts lbnnally linking efficient par~tbility to efficient Icarnability. It connects a particular model of efficient parsing, namely, bounded context pal.'sing with lookahead as developed by Marcus 1980. to a particular model of language acqnisilitm, the Bounded l)egree of Error (Ill)E) model of Wexlcr and Culicovcr 1980. The key result: bounded context parsability implies \"'easy\" learnability. Here, \"easily learnable\" means \"'learnable from simple, positive (grammatical) sentences of bounded dcgrec of embedding.\" In this case then, the constraints required to guarantee easy parsability, as enforced by the bounded context eortstraJllt, are at least as strong as those required for easy learnability. This means that if we have a language and associated grammar that is known to be parsable by a Marcus-type machine. then we already know that it meets the constraints of bounded degree learning, as defined by Wcxler and Culicover.","A number of extensions to the learnability-parsability connection are also suggested. One is to apply the result to other linguistic subsystems, notably, morphological and phonological rule systems. Although these subsystems are finite state, this does not automatically imply easy learnability, as Gold (1967) shows. In fact, identification is still computationally intractable -- it is NP-hard (Gold 1978), taking an amount of evidence exponentially proportional to the number of states in the target finite state system. Since a given natural language could have a morphological system of a few hundred or even a few thousand states (Kimmn 1983, for Finnish), this is a serious problem, Thus we must find additional constraints to make natural morphological systems tractably learnable. An analog of the bounded context model for morphological systems may suffice. If we require that such systems be k-reversible, as defined by Angluin (in press), then art efficient polynomial time induction algorithm exists.","To summarize, what is the importance of this result for computational linguistics? o It shows for the first time that parsability is stronger constraint titan learnability, at least given this particular way of defining the comparison. Thus computationalists may have been right in tbcusing on efficient parsability as a metric for comparing theories."]},{"title":"20","paragraphs":["o It provides an explicit criterion for learnability.

Wexler and Culicover 1980 page 108.","If we substitute 2 for U in the theorem, we get the Degree 2 constraint.","Once IIDE is established for some family of languages, then convergence of a learning procedure is easy to proved. Wexler and Culicover 1980 have the details, but the key insight is that the number of possible errors is now bounded from above.","The BDE property can be defined in any grammatical framework, and this is what we shall do here. We retain the idea of mapping from some underlying \"base\" structure to the surface sentence. (If we are parsing, we must map from the surface sentence to this underlying structure.) The mapping is not necessarily transformational, however; for example, a set of context-free rules could carry it out. In this paper w? assume that the mapping from surface sentences to underlying structures is carried out by a Marcus-type parser. The mapping from structure to sentence is then defined by the inverse of the operation of this machine. This fixes one possible target language. (The full version of this paper defines this mapping in full.)","Note further that the BDE property is defined not just with respect to possible adult target languages, but also with respect to the distribution of the learner's possible guesses. So for example, even if there were just ten target languages (defining 10 underlying grammars), the BDE property must hold with respect to those languages and any intervening learner languages (grammars). So we must also define a"]},{"title":"family","paragraphs":["of languages to be acquired. This is done in the next section.","BI)E, then, is our criterial property for easy learnability.

That is. it is possible to find dcte.rmiuistically the production that vpplied at a given step in a derivation by examining just a btnmded mnuber of tokens (fixed in advance) to the left and right at that point in the derivation. Following Aho and UIIman we have this definition for bounded right-context grammars: G is bounded right-context if the following four conditions: (1) S=:'aA,~=:'a#~ and (2) S=%,Bx=~-~,~x = a'B,b are rightmost derivations in the grammar; (3) the length ofx is less than or equal to the length of,/, and (4) the last m symbols of a and a' coincide, and the first n symbols of,., and ~, coincide imply that A=B, a'=v, and ,/' = x. We will u~ the term \"bounded context\" instead of \"bounded right-context.\" To extend the definition we drop the requirement that the derivation is rightmost and use instead non-canonical derivation sequences as defined by Szymanski and Williams (1976). This model corresponds to Marcus's (1980) use of attention shi.Bs to postpone parsing decisions until more right context is examined. The effect is to have a lookahead that can include nonterminai names like NP or VP. For example, in order to successfully parse Have the students take the exam, the Marcus parser must delay analyzing hare until the full NP the students is processed. Thus a canonical (rightmost) parse is not produced, and the lookahead for the parser includes the sequence NP--take, successfully distinguishing this parse from the NP--taken sequence for a yes-no question. This extension was first proposed by Knuth (1965) and developed by Szymanski and Williams (1976). In this model we can postpone a canonical rightmost derivation some fixed number of thnes t. This corresponds to building t complete subtrees and making these part of the lookahead before we return to the postponed analysis.","The Marcus machine (and the model we adopt here) is not as general as an l.R(k) type parser in one key respect. An I.R(k) parser can use the entire left context m making its parsing decisions. (It alst) uses a bounded right context, its h)okahead.)The 1.R(k) ,nachine can do this because the entire left context can be stored as a regular set in the finite control of the parsing machine (see Knuth 1965). That is, l.R(k) parsers make use uf an encoding of the left context in order to keep track of what to do. The Marcus machine is much mure limited than this. l.ocal parsing decisions arc made by examining strictly litend contexts an)und file current locus of parsing contexts. A finite state encoding of left context is not permitted.","The BCP class also makes sense its a pn)xy for \"'efficiently parsable\" because all its members are analyzable in time linear in the length t)[\" their input sentences, at least if file associated gr~lllllllars are COlttext-fiee. If die ~r~lllllTlars are nol etmtext-free. then BCP members are parsahle in at ~orst quadratic (n squared) time. (See Szymanski and Williams 1976 fur proofs of these results.) III CONNIT_q'ING PARSABII.ITY AND I.EARNABII.ITY We can now at least furmalize our problem of comparing learnability and parsability. The question now becomes: What is the relationship between the Ill)t\" property and the BCP property? Intuitively, a grammar is BCP if we can always tell which of two rules applied in a given bounded context. Also intuitively, a family of grammars is III)E il: given any two grammars in the family G and G\" with different roles R and R\" say. we can tell which rule is the correct one by looking at two derivations ofbotmded degree, with R applying in one and yielding surface string s, and R\" applying in the udder yielding surface string s'. with s not equal to s'. This property must hold with respect to all possible adult and learner grammars. So a space of possible target grammars must be considered. The way we do this is by considering some '*fixed\" grammar G and possible variants of G formed by substituting the production rules in G with hypothesized alternatives.","The theorem we want to now prove is: If the grammars formed by augmenting G with possible hypothesized grammar rules arc BCP. then that family is also BDE. The theorem is established by using the BCP property to directly construct a small-degree phrase marker that meets the BDE condition. We select two grammars G, G' from the family of grammars. Both are BCP, by definition. By assumption, there is a detectable error that distinguishes G with rule R from G' with rule R'. Letus .say that Rule R is of the form A~a; R' is B=*'a'.","Since R' determines a detectable error, there must be a derivation with a common sentential form ,t, such that R applies to ,I, and eventually derives sentence s, while R' applies to ¢, and eventually derives s' different from s. The number of steps in the derivation of the the two sentences may be arbitrary, however. What we must show is that there are two derivations bounded in advance by some constant that yield two different sentences.","The BCP conditions state that identical (re.n) contexts imply that A and B are equal. Taking the contrapositive, if A and B are unequal, then the 0n,n) context must be nonidentical. This establishes that BCP implies (re.n) context error detectability. 3","We are not yet done though. An (Ul.U) context detectable error could consist of tenninal and nonterminal elements, not just terminals (words) as required by the detectable error condition. We must show that we can extend such a detectable error to a surface sentence detectable error with an underlying structure of bounded degree. An easy lemma establishes this. If R' is an (m.n) context detectable error, then R' is bounded degree of error detectable. The proof (by induction) is omitted: only a sketch will be given here. Intuitively. the reason is that ~e can extend any nonterminals in the error-detectable (m,n) context to some valid surface sentence and bound this derivation by some constant fixed in advance and depending only on the grammar. This is because unbounded derivations are possible only by the repetitiort of nontermirmls via recursion: since there are only a finite number of distinct nonterminals, it is only via recursion that wc can obtain a derivation chain that is arbitrarily deep. But. as is well knuwn (compare the proof of the pumping lemma for context-free grammars), any such arbitrarily deep derivation producing a valid surface sentence also has an associated truncated derivation, bounded by a constant"]},{"title":"22","paragraphs":["dependent on the grammar, that yields a valid sentcnce of the language. Thus we can convert any (re.n) context detectable error to a bounded degree of error sentence. This proves the basic result.","As an application, consider the strictly context-sensitive language anbnc n. This language has a grammar that is BCP in the extended sense (Szymanski and Williams 1976). The family of grammars obtained by replacing the rules of this IICP grammar by alternative rules that are also 11CP (including the original grammar) meets the BDE condition. This result was established independently by Wexler 1982. IV EXTENSIONS OF THE BASIC RESULT In the domain of syntax, we have seen that constraints ensuring efficiem parsability also guarantee easy lcarnability. This result suggests an extension to other domains of linguistic knowledge. Consider morphological rule systems. Several recent models suggest finite state transducers as a way to pair lexical (surface) and underlying titans of words (Koskenniemi 1983: Kaplan and Kay 1983). While such systems may well be efficiently analyzable, it is not so ~ell known that easy learnability does not follow directly from this adopted formalism. To learn even a finite state system one must examine all possible state-transition combinations. This is combinatorially explosive, as Gold 1978 proves. Without additional constraints, finite trzmsducer induction is intractable.","What is needed is some way to localize errors: this is what the bounded degree ofern)r condition does.","Is there ill) an;dog tlf the the IICP condition for finite state systems that also implies easy learnahility? The answer is yes. The essence of BCP is that derivations are backwards and forwards deterministic within local (m.n) contexts. But this is precisely the notion of"]},{"title":"k-reversibilit.I;","paragraphs":["as defined by Angluin (in press).

Since k-reversibility is a sufficient, but evidently not a necessary constraint fi,r Icarnability. there could be other conditions guaranteeing the Ic;,rnability of finite state systems. For instance. One of the~, the strict cycle condition in phonology, is also examined in the full paper. We show that the strict cycle also st, flices to meet the III)E condition.
