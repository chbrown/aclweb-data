Introduction","paragraphs":["A meier ar,.a of Al research has been the development of \"expert sys.tcms\" - systems which are able to answer user's que:~titms concerning a particular domain. Studies identifying desirabl,, iutora,'tive capabilities for such systems [Pollack et al. 82] have ft,und that. it is not sufficient simply to allow the user to ,~k a question and Itavo the system answ~.r it. Users often want to question the system's rea-~oning,to make sure certain constraints have been taken into consideration, anti so on. Thus we must strive to provide expert systems with the ability to interact with the user in the kind of cooperative di:LIogues that we see between two bullish ctmversational partners.","Allowing .,uch interactions between the system and a user raises difficulties for a Natural-Language system. Since the user is interacting with a system a.s s/he would with a human export, s/he will nizam likely exp-ct the system to b(have as a human expert. Among other things, the n:.er will expect the systenl to be adhering to the cooperative principles of conversation [Grice 7,5, .loshi"]},{"title":"821.","paragraphs":["If these principte~ are not followed by the system, the user is bkeiy to become confu~ed.","In this paper I.focus on one a,;pect of the cooperative behavior found between two conversat, ional partners: responding to recognized differences in the beliefs of the two participants. Often when two people interact, ouc reveals-a belief or assumption that is incompatible with the b~*liefs held by the other. Failure to correct this disparity may not only implicitly confirm the disparate bcli,'f, but may even make it impos~;ibie to complete tile ongoing task. Imagine the following excilange:","U. Give ll|e the ItUI.L NO of all Destroyers whose MAST_IIEIGIIT is above 190.","E. All Destrt,yers that I know al)out |lave a MAbT_HEIGllT between 85 and 90. Were you thinking of the Aircraft-Carriers? in this example, the user (U) ha.s apparently ctmfused a Destroyer with an Aircraft-Carrier. This confusion has caused her to attribute a property value to Destroyers that they do not have. In this case a correct a/tswer by the expert (E} of *none\" is likely to confuse U'. In order to continue the conver.-ation with a minimal amount of eoafu.~ion, the user's incorrect belief must first be addressed.","My primary interest is in what an expert system, aspiring to human expert performance, should include in such responses. In particular, [ am concerned with system responses to te~'ognized disparate beliefs/assumptions about cbflct.~. In the past this problem has been h, ft to the tutoring or CAI systems [Stevens et aL 79, Steven~ & ('ollins 80, Brown g:: Burton 78, Sleeman 82], which attetupt to correct student's misconceptions concerning a particular domain. For the most part, their approach ha.~ been to list a priori :dl mi.-conceptions in a given domain. Tile futility t,f this appr,~ach is empha'.,ized in [gleeman ,~2].

These correspond to three reasons why u user might misclassify an object:","TYPE ONE - Object Shares Many Properties with Posited Supe~ordinate - This may cause the user wrongly to c.nclude that these shared attributes are inherited from the superordinate.

The properties that they share arc no_..~t those inherited from the posited superordinate; but those inherited from this other common superordhlate. Figure 3-1 shows a representation of this situation. OBJECT and OTIIEIi-LIBJEC'E have many common properties because they slt:.t.re a CtHltllton superordinate (COMMON-St !I'E|2OI2DINATE).

Thus, the teacher denies the posited superordinate, vegetable, and gives the corr,-ct one, fruit. She backs this up by refuting evidence that the student may I)e using to support the misconception. In this ca...e, the stl.h nt may wrongly believe that tomatoes are vegetables becau~.e lh~'y are like some other objects which are vegetables, lettuce and green beans, in that all three share the common super.rdln:tte: I,l:mts grown in vegetable garden.

The iuformation included in this kind of response is similar to that which McKeown's TEXT system, which answers questions about database structure [McKeown 82 l, would include if the user had asked about the diff~.rence between two entities.

In the following example the similarity of the two attributes, in this case a common function, is mentioned in the response: U. Where are the gills on the whale? S. Whales don't have gills, they breathe through lungs.","The strategy followed was: (1) Deny attribute given, (2) Give correct attrihutc, (3) Bring in similarities/differences of the attributes which may have led to the confusion.

In some situations the user model alone will not be enough to distinguish the two cases. The use of past immediate focus (see [Sidner 83]) looks to be promising in this case. Heuristics are currently being worked out for determining the most likely misconception type based on what kinds of things {e.g., sets of attributes or objects) have been focused on in the recent past. TYPE THREE - The user w~s simply given bad information or has done some complicated reasoning which can not be duplicated by the system.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["• In this paper I have argued that any Natural-Language system that allows the user to engage in extended dialogues must be prepared to handle misconceptions. Through studying various transcripts of how people correct misconceptions, I found that they not only correct the wrong information, but often include additional information to convince the user of the correction and/or refute the reasoning that may have led to the misconception. This paper describes a framework for allowing a computer system to mimic this behavior.","The approach taken here is first to classify object-related misconceptions according to the KB feature involved. For each resulting class, sub-types are identified in terms of the structure of a KB rather than its content. The sub-types characterize the kind of information that may support the misconception. A correction strategy is associated with each sub-type that indicates what kind of information to include in the response. Finally, algorithms are being developed for identifying the type of a particular misconception based on a user model and a model of the discourse situation."]},{"title":"6.
