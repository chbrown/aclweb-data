INTRODUCTION","Linguistic knowledge usable for machine translation is always imperfect. We cannot be free from the uncertainty of knowledge we have for machine translation. Especially at the transfer stage of machine translation, the selection of target language expression is rather subjective and optional.","Therefore the linguistic contents of machine translation system always fluctuate, and make gradual progress. The system should be designed to allow such constant change and improvements. This paper explains the details of the transfer and generation stages of Japanese-to-English system of the machine translation project by the Japanese Government, with the emphasis on the ideas to deal with the incompleteness of linguistic knowledge for machine translation. 2. DESIGN STRATEGIES 2.1 Annotated Dependency Structure","The intermediate representation we adopted as the result of analysis in our machine translation is the annotated dependency structure. Each node has arbitrary number of features as shown in Fig. i. This makes it possible to access the constituents by more than one linguistic cues. This representation is therefore powerful and flexible for the sophisticated grammatical and semantic checking, especially when the completeness of semantic analysis is not assured and trial-and-error improvements are required at the transfer and generation stages. 2.2 Multiple L~aver Grammar","We have three conceptual levels for grammar","rules.","lowest level: default grammar which guarantees the output of the translation process. The quality of the translation is not assured. Rules of this level apply to those inputs for which no higher layer grammar rules are applicable.","kernel level: main grammar which chooses and generates target language structure according to semantic relations among constituents which are determined in the analysis stage.","topmost level: heuristic grammar which attempts to get elegant translation for the input. Each rule bears heuristic nature in the sense that it is word specific and it is applicable only to some restricted classes of inputs. 2.3 Multiple Relation Structure","In principle, we use deep case dependency structure as a semantic representation. Theoretically we can assign a unique case dependency structure to each input sentence. In practice, however, analysis phase may fail or may assign a wrong structure. Therefore we use as an intermediate representation a structure which makes it possible to annotate multiple possibilities as well as multiple level representation. An example is shown in Fig. 2. Properties at a node is represented as a vector, so that this complex dependency structure is flexible in the sense that different interpretation rules can be applied to the structure. 2.4 Lexicon Driven Feature","Besides the transfer and generation rules which involve semantic checking functions, the grammar allows the reference to a lexical item in the dictionary. A lexical item contains its special grammatical usages and idiomatic expressions. During the transfer and generation stages, the~e rules are activated with the highest priority. This feature makes the system very flexible for dealing with exceptional cases. The improvement of translation quality can be achieved progressively by adding linguistic information and word usages in the dictionary entries.","2.5 Format-Oriented Description of Dictionary Entries","The quality of a machine translation system heavily depends on the quality of the dictionary. In order to build a machine translation dictionary, we collaborate with expert translators. We developed a format-oriented language to allow computer-naive human translators to encode their expertise without any conscious effort on programming. Although the format-oriented language we developed lacks full expressive power for highly sophisticated linguistic phenomena, it can cover most of the common lexical information translators may want to describe. The formatted description is automatically converted into statements in GRADE, a programming language developed by the Mu-Project. We prepared a manual according to which a man can fill in the dictionary format with linguistic data of items. The manual guarantees a certain level of quality of the dictionary, which is important when many people have to work in parallel."]},{"title":"420","paragraphs":["(Due %0 the advance of electronic instrumentation, auwmsted ship increases in number.)

ORGANIZATION OF GRAMMAR RULES FOR TRANSFER AND GENERATION STAGES 3.1 Heuristic Rule First","Grammar rules are organized along the principle that \"if better rule exists then the system uses it; otherwise the system attempts to use a standard rule: if it fails, the system will use a default rule.\" The grammar rule involves a number of stages for applying heuristic rules. Fig. 3 shows a processing flow for the transfer and generation stages. Heuristic rules are word specific. GRADE makes it possible to define word specific rules. Such rules can be invoked in many ways. For example, we can associate a word selection rule for an ordinary verb in a dictionary entry for a noun, as shown in Fig. 4."]},{"title":"421 ternal","paragraphs":["P re-transfer ~ post-transfer loop loop in TRANSFER internal representation -- ~ representation for Japanese for English"]},{"title":"++,/ \\ +..,,o,","paragraphs":["phrase structure,s/ tree"]},{"title":"~ structure","paragraphs":["transformation MORPHOLOGICAL SYNTHESIS Fig. 3.

We developed a number of dictionary formats specially designed for the ease of dictionary input by computer-naive expert translators.","The expressive power of format-oriented description is, however, insufficient for a number of common verbs such as \"~ ~ \" (make, do, perform .... ) and \"~ ~ \" (become, consist of, provide, ...) etc. In such cases, we can encode transfer rules directly by GRADE. An example is shown in Fig. 7. Varieties of usages are to be listed up with their corresponding English sentential structures and semantic conditions. 3.4 Post-Transfer Rules","The transfer stage bridges the gap between Japanese and English expressions. There are still many odd structures after this stage, and we have to adjust further more the English internal representation into more natural ones. We call this part as post-transfer loop. An example is given in Fig. 8, where a Japanese factitive verb is first transferred to English \"make\", and then a structural change is made to eliminate it, and to have a more direct expression. 4. GENERATION PROCESS","4.1 Translation of Japanese Postpositions Postpositions in Japanese generally express the case slots for verbs. A postposition, however, has different usages, and the determination of English prepositions for each postposition is quite difficult. It also depends on the verb which governs the noun phrase having that postposition.","Table 2 illustrates a part of a default table for determining deep and surface case labels when no higher level rule applies. This sort of tables are defined for all case combination. In this way, we confirm at least one translation to be assigned to an input. A particular usage of preposition for a particular English verb is written in the lexical entry of the verb.","4.2 Determination of Global Sentential Structures in Target Language Fig. 6.

An example of dictionary transfer rules of popular verbs.","Grobal sentential structures of Japanese and English are quite different, and correspondingly the internal structure of a Japanese sentence is not the same as that of English. Fundamental difference from Japanese internal representation to that of English is absorbed at the (pre-, post -) transfer stages. But at the stage of English generation, some structural transformations are still required in such oases as (a) embedded sentential structure, (b) complex sentential structure. We classified four kinds of embedded senten-","tial structures.","(i) a case slot of an embedded sentence is vacant, and the noun modified by the embedded sentence comes to fill the slot.","(~)The form like \"NI~\" V ~ N2\" m \" (N 2 ~ NI~'V )","N2\".

An example of the structural transformation is shown in Fig. 9. The relative clause \"vhy...\" is generated after the structural transformation.","Connection of two sentences in the compound and complex sentences is done according to Table 3. An example is given in Fig. i0. 4.3 The Process of Sentence Generation in English","After the transfer is done from the Japanese deep dependency structure to the English one, conversion is done to a phrase structure tree with all the surface words attached to the tree. The processes explained in 4.1 and 4.2 are involved at this generation stage. The conversion is performed top-down from the root node of the dependency tree to the leaf. Therefore when a governing verb demands a noun phrase expression or a to-infinitive expression to its dependent phrase, the structural change of the phrase must be performed.

SUMMARY This paper described a number of strategies we employed in the transfer and generation stages of our Mu system to make the system both powerful and fault-tolerant. As is mentioned above, our system has many advantages such as the flexibility of the generation process, the utilization of strong lexical information. The system is in the course of development in collaboration with a number of computer scientists from computer industries and expert translators. Some of the translation results are attached in the last, which show the present level of the translation system. Progressive improvement is expected in the next two years.
