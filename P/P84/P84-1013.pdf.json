Ballard","Dept. of Computer Science Duke University Durham, N.C. 27708 ABSTRACT The Layered Domain Class system (LDC) is an experimental natural language processor being developed at Duke University which reached the prototype stage in May of 1983. Its primary goals are (I) to provide English-language retrieval capabilities for structured but unnormaUzed data files created by the user, (2) to allow very complex semantics, in terms of the information directly available from the physical data file; and (3) to enable users to customize the system to operate with new types of data. In this paper we shall discuss (a) the types of modifiers LDC provides for; (b) how information about the syntax and semantics of modifmrs is obtained from users; and (c) how this information is used to process English inputs. I INTRODUCTION","The Layered Domain Class system (LDC) is an experimental natural language processor being developed at Duke .University. In this paper we concentrate on the typ.~s of modifiers provided by LDC and the methods by which the system acquires information about the syntax and semantics of user-defined modifiers. A more complete description is available in [4,5], and further details on matters not discussed in this paper can be found in [1,2,6,8,9].","The LDC system is made up of two primary components.

The User-Phrase portion of LDC resembles familiar natural language database query systems such as INTELLECT, JETS. LADDER, LUNAR. PHLIQA, PLANES, REL, RENDEZVOUS, TQA, and USL (see [10-23]) while the overall LDC system is similar in its objectives to more recent systems such as ASK, CONSUL, IRUS, and TEAM (see [24-319.","At the time of this writing, LDC has been completely customized for two fairly complex domains. from which examples are drawn in the remainder of the paper, and several simpler ones.

Among the simpler domains LDC has been customized for are files giving employee information and stock market quotations. II MODIFIER TYPES PROVIDED FOR","As shown in [4]. LDC handles inputs about as complicated as students who were given a passing grade by an instructor Jim took a graduate course from As suggested here, most of the syntactic and semantic sophistication of inputs to LDC are due to noun phrase modifiers, including a fairly broad coverage of relative clauses. For example, if LDC is told that \"students take courses from instructors\", it will accept such relative clause forms as students who took a graduate course from Trivedi courses Sarah took from Rogers instructors Jim took a graduate course from courses that were taken by Jim students who did not take a course from Rosenberg We summarize the modifier types distinguished by LDC in Table i. which is divided into four parts roughly corresponding to pre-norninal, nominal, post-nominal, and negating modifiers. We have included several modifier types, most of them anaphorie, which are processed syntactically, and methods for whose semantic processing are being implemented along the lines suggested in [7]."]},{"title":"52","paragraphs":["Most of the names we give to modifier types are selfexplanatory, but the reader will notice that we have chosen to categorize verbs, based upon their semantics, as tr~Isial verbs, irrtplied para~ter verbs; and operational verbs. \"Trivial\" verbs, which involve no semantics to speak of, can be roughly paraphrased as \"be associated with\". For example, students who take a certain course are precisely those students associated ~ith the database records related to the course. \"Implied parameter\" verbs can be paraphrased as a longer \"trivial\" verb phrase by adding a parameter and requisite noise words for syntactic acceptability. For example, students who fai/a course are those students who rrmlce a grade of F in the course. Finally, \"operational\" verbs require an operation to be performed on one or more of its noun phrase arguments, rather than simply asking for a comparison of its noun phrase referent(s) against values in specified fields of the physical data file. For example, the students who oz~tscure Jim are precisely those students who Trtake a grade h~gher than the grade of Jirm At present, prepositions are treated semantically as trivial verbs, so that \"students in AI\" is interpreted as \"students associated with records related to the AI course\".

This information frees us from having to store all possible field values in the dictionary, as some systems do, or to make reference to the physical data file when new data values are typed by the user, as other systems do. The domain-specific d/ctlon~ry file contains some standard terms (articles, ordinals, etc.) and also both root words and inflections for terms acquired from the user. The sample dictionary entry (longest Superl long (nt meeting week)) says that \"longest\" is the superlative form of the adjective \"long\", and may occur in noun phrases whose 'head noun refers to entities of type meeting or week.

Finally, the macro file contains the meanings of modifiers, roughly in the form in which they were acquired using the specification language discussed in the previous section.
