JAPAN Abstract Analysts grammar of Japanese tn the Mu-proJect ts presented, It is emphasized that rules expressing constraints on stngle linguistic structures and rules for selecting the most preferable readtngs are completely different In nature, and that rules for selecting preferale readings should be utilized tn analysts grammars of practical HT systems. It ts also clatmed that procedural control ts essential tn integrating such rules tnto a unified grammar. Some sample rules are gtven to make the points of discussion clear and concrete. 1. Introduction","The Hu-ProJect ts a Japanese nattonal project supported by grants from the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science & Technology of STA(Sctence and Technology Agency). whlch atms to develop Japanese-English and English-Japanese machine translation systems. Ve currently restrict the domain of translation to abstracts of scientific and technological papers. The systems are based on the transfer approach[;], and consist of three phases: analysts, transfer and generation. In thts paper, we focus on the analysts grammar of Japanese tn the Japanese-English system. The grammar has been developed by using GRADE which ts a programming language specially designed for thts project[2]. The grammar now consists of about 900 GRADE rules. The experiments so far show that the grammar works very well and ts comprehensive enough to treat various linguistic phenomena tn abstracts. In thts paper we wtll discuss some of the basic design principles of the grammar together wtth its detatled construction. Some examples of grammar rules and analysts results wtll be shown to make the points of our discussion clear and concrete. 2. Procedural Grammar","There has been a prominent tendency tn recent computational linguistics to re-evaluate CFG and use tt dtrectly or augment tt to analyze sentences[3.4.5]. In these systems(frameworks), CFG rules Independently describe constraints on stngle linguistic structures, and a universal rule application mechanism automatically produces a set of posstble structures which satisfy the given constraints. It ts well-known, however, that such sets of posstble structures often become unmanageably large. Because two separate rules such as NP ..... • NP PREP-P VP ..... • VP PREP-P are usually prepared tn CFG grammars tn order to analyze noun and verb phrases modifted by prepositional phrases. CFG grammars provide two syntactic analyses for She was given flowers by her uncle. Furthermore. the ambiguity of the sentence ts doubled by the lexlcal ambiguity of \"by\". which can be read as etther a locattve or an agenttve preposition. Since the two syntactic structures are recognized by compZetely independent ru]es and the semantic interpretations of \"by\" are given by independent processes tn the ]ater stages. It ts difficult to compare these four readings during the anaZysts to gtve a preference to one of these four readings. A rule such as","\"If a sentence ts passlve and there ts a \"by\"-prepostttonal phrase, tt ts often the case that the prepositional phrase ftlls the deep agenttve case. (try thts ana]ysts first)\" seems reasonable and quite useful for choosing the most preferable interpretation, but tt cannot be expressed by refining the ordinary CFG rules. Thts ktnd of ru]e ts quite different In nature from a CFG ru]e. It ts not a rule of constraint on a stng]e ]tngutsttc structure(in fact. the above four readings are a]l ]tngulsttcal]y posstb]e), but tt ts a \"heuristic\" ru]e concerned with preference of readings, which compares several alternative analysts paths and chooses the most feastble one. Human translaters (or humans tn general) have many"]},{"title":"267","paragraphs":["such preference rules based on vartous sorts of cue such as morphological forms of words, collocations of words, text styles, word semantics, etc. These heuristic rules are quite useful not only for increasing efficiency but also for preventing proliferation of analysts results. As Wllks[6] potnted out, we cannot use semanttc Information as constraints on stngle linguistic structures, but Just as preference cues to choose the most feastble Interpretations among linguistically posstble Interpretations. We clatm that many sorts of preference cues other than semanttc ones exist tn real texts whtch cannot be captured by CFG rules. We will show tn thts paper that. by utilizing vartous sorts of preference cues. our analysts grammar of Japanese can work almost determtntsttcally to gtve the most preferable Interpretation as the ftrst output, wtthout any extensive semanttc processing (note that even \"semant|c\" processing cannot dtsambtguate the above sentence. The four readings are semantically possible. It requtres deep understanding of contexts or situations, whtch we cannot expect tn a practical MT system).","In order to Integrate heuristic rules based on var|ous levels of cues tnto a untfted analysts grammar, we have developed a programming langauage.

The matn components of the grammar are as follows. (1) Post-Morphological Analysts (2) Determination of Scopes (3) Analysts of Stmple Noun Phrases (4) Analysts of Stmple Sentences (5) Analysts of Embedded Sentences (Relative Clauses) (6) Analysts of Relationships of SentenCes (7) Analysts of Outer Cases (8) Contextual Processing (Processing of Omttted case elements. Interpretation of 'Ha' . etc.) (9) Reduction of Structures for Transfer Phase","Each component conststs of from 60 to 120 GRADE rules.","47 morpho-syntacttc categories are provtded for Japanese analysts, each of whtch has tts own lextcal description format. 12.000 lextcal entrtes have already been prepared according to the formats. In thts classification. Japanese nouns are categorized |nto 8 sub-classes according to thetr morpho-syntacttc behavtour, and 53 semanttc markers are used to characterize thetr semanttc behaviour. Each verb has a set of case frame descriptions (CFD) whtch correspond to different usages of the verb. A CFD g|ves mapping rules between surface case markers (SCN - postpostttonal case particles are used as SCN's tn Japanese) and thetr deep case interpretations (DCZ 33 deep cases are used). DC! of an SCM often depends on verbs so that the mapping rules are given %o CFD's of Individual verbs. A CFO also gtves a normal collocation between the verb and SCM's(postpositonal case particles). Oetatled lextcal descriptions are gtven and discussed tn another paper[7].","The analysts results are dependency trees whtch show the semanttc relationships among tnput words. 4. Typtcal Steps of Analysts Grammar","In the following, we w111 take some sample rules to Illustrate our points of discussion. 4-; Relative Clauses","Relative clause constructions in Japanese express several different relationships between modifying clauses (relative clauses) and thelr antecedents.

It ts Important to analyze them correctly. especially to determine scopes of conjunctions correctly, because they often lead to proliferation of analysis results. The particle \"TO\" plays almost the same role as the Engllsh \"and\" to conjunct noun phrases. There are several heuristic rules based on various levels of information to determine the scopes. <Scope Decision Rules of ConJuncted Noun Phrases by Partlcle 'TO'> (Rule 1) Stnce parttcle \"TO\" ts also used as a case particle, tf It appears tn the position: Noun 'TO\" verb Noun, Noun 'TO' adjective Noun. there are two posstble Interpretations. one tn whlch \"TO\" Is a case parttcle and \"noun TO adjective(verb)' forms a relattve clause that modifies the second noun. and the other one tn which \"TO\" ts a conjunctive particle to form a conJuncted noun phrase.

However. thetr clatms have not been well appreciated by other researchers (or even by themselves). One often argues agatnst procedural grammars, saytng that: the linguistic facts Wtnograd's grammar captures can also be expressed by ATN. and the expressive power of ATN ts equivalent wtth that of the augmented CFG. Therefore; procedural grammars have no advantages over the augmented CFG. They Just make the whole grammars complicated and hard to maintain.","The above argument, however, mtsses an Important po|nt and confuses procedural grammar wtth the representation of grammars tn the form of programs (as Shown tn Vtnograd[9]). Ve showed tn thts paper that: the rules whtch gtve structural constraints on ftnal analysts results and the rules whtch choose the most preferable linguistic structures (or the rules whtch block \"garden path\" structures) are different tn nature. [n order to Integrate the latter type of rules tn a untfted analysts grammar, tt ts essential to control the sequence of rule applications explicitly and Introduce strategic knowledge tnto grammar organizations. Furthermore. Introduction of control specifications doesn't necessarily lead to the grammar In the form of programs.
