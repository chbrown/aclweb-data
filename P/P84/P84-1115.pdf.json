As part of conceptual work being done in information science at the University of Constance an international Delphi poll wss carried out from 1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing a mid-term pro@aosis for the development of \"information linguistics\". The term \"information linguistics\" refers to a scientific discipline combining the fields of linguistic data processing, applied computer science, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and information science. A Delphi poll is a written poll of experts - carried out in this case in two phases. The results of the first round were incorporated into the second round, so that participants in the poll could react to the trends as they took shape. I. Some demoscopic data I. I Return rate Based on sophisticated selection procedures 385 international experts in the field of information linguistics were determined and were sent questionnaires in the first round (April 1982). 90 questionnaires were returned. In the second round 360 questionnaires were mailed out (January 1983) and 56 were returned, 48 of these from experts who had answered in the first round. The last questionnaires were accepted at the end of June 1 983. Overlapping data in the two rounds first round (90) second round (56) 2 48 8 In the following we refer to four sets of data: Set A 90 from round I Set--B 48 from round I with answers in round 2 8et--C 56 from round 2 Set--D 48 from round 2 with answers in round I But we shall concentrate primarily on Set C becanse - according to the Delphi philosophy - t~e data of the second round are the most relevant. There were 8 persons within Set C who did not answer in the first round. But the~ also were aware of the results of the first round; therefore a Delphi effect was possible. (In the following the whole integers refer to absolute numbers; the decimal figures to relative/procentual numbers) I .2 Qualification accordin~ to academic degree The survey singled out highly competent people, as reflected in academic degree( data from A and C): Tab.1 Qualification of l~articipants Set A Set C B.S./B.A 23 25.6 16 28.6 M.S./M.A./Dipl. 40 44.4 28 50.0 Ph.D./Dr. 62 68.9 37 66.1 Professor 14 15.6 15 26.8"]},{"title":"1.3 A~e","paragraphs":["Since Delphi polls are concerned with future developments, it has been claimed in the past that the age and experience of people in the field influence the rating.

These topics were chosen based on the author's experience in information linguistics, on a pretest with mostly German researchers and practitioners, on advices from members of FID/LD, and on long discussions with Don Walker, Hans Karlgren, and Udo Hahn.

Answer parameters for the sub-areas 3.1 Competence (--CO) At the beginning of every sub-area participants were requested to rate their competence according to three parameters \"good\" (with a speciaiist's knowledge), \"fair\" (with a working knowledge), and \"superficial\" (with a layman's knowledge).

Tab.9 (data from Set C) shows that the negative parameters (--, -)--were never or only sel~om used. Information linguistics is not judged - accordir~ to the estimation of the experts - as a socially harmful scientific discipline. 4. Answer parameters for the single topics The following parameters were used as ratin~ for the sub-areas and the single topics. Their definitions were given in more detail in the questionnaire.

More detailed results 5 • I Sub-areas 5.1.1 Competence Competence was an important influence on evaluation. In general one can say that people with \"good\" competence (or more correctly: with competence estimation of \"good\") in a sub-area gave topics higher ratings for importance and feasibility both from the research and the application points of view. Nevertheless, there were differences. Those with \"good\" competence differed more widely in evaluations of research-oriented topics than in application-oriented topics, whereas those with \"superficial\" competence in the sub-areas were closer to the average in their evaluations of application-oriented topics than of research-oriented topics. Here are some examples of the differences (as reflected in the averages of the sub-areas). Tab. 11 is to be read as follows: (line I) in the sub-area \"Acoustic\" those with \"good\" competence evaluated 5.6% higher than the average with respect to importance for research, whereas people with \"superficial\" competence in the same sub-area evaluated 6.9% lower than average.

Those who gave high ratin~s for desirability (DE++) in general gave higher values to the single topics in the respective sub-areas, both in comparison to the average values and to the values of those who gave only high desirability (DE+) to a given sub-area. The differences between DE++ and DE+ are even higher than those between C/g und C/s. 0nly the F/R data in the translation and retrieval areas are lower for D++ than for D+, in all other cases the D++ values are higher.

In particular, ranking is unjustified. One cannot simply conclude that, say, the sub-area \"Semantics\" (92.6) is more important than that of \"Abstracting\" (75.6) with respect to research because the average value is higher; or that Indexing (79.2) is more feasible from an application point of view than Abstracting (52.3). $uch conclusions may be true, and this is why the values in Tab. 13 and 14 are given, but the parameters should actually only be applied to the single topics in the sub-areas. Cross-group ranking is not allowed for methodological reasons. But nevertheless the It is obvious that general true: data are interesting enough.","the following relation is in"]},{"title":"I/R (-values) > I/A > F/R > F/A","paragraphs":["There are some exceptions to this general rule, such as Re-I/A>I/R (both in Set A and Set C); Ha-F/R>I/R (in Set C); (Re-F/R ant F/A)>I/R--(in Set_C); and I1-F/R>~/R(both in Set_A and SetC). There seems to be a non-trivial g~p between importance and feasibility (both with respect to research and application). In other words, there are more problems than solutions. And there is an even broader gap between application and research. From a practical point of view there is some skepsis concerning the possibility of solving important research problems. And what seems to be feasible from a research point of view looks different from an application one. The values in the second round are in general higher than in the first one. This is an argument against the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that the feedback-mechanism - i.e. that the data of the previous round are made known at the start of the following round -has an averaging effect.

Between the two rounds the decline in the sub-areas \"Software\" and \"Hardware\" (apart from the parameter F/R) is striking. There is an overall increase for '%lorphology\" and \"Information Languages\" for all parameters, and a dramatic increase for the topics in \"Indexing\" for F/R (9.7%), and a dramatic decline for the \"Translation\"- and \"Question-Answering\"-topics for the parameter F/A (9.8"]},{"title":"and 8.4%).","paragraphs":["The dates of realization do not change dramatically° On the average there is a difference of one year (and this makes sense because there was almost one year between round I and 2). There is a tendency from a research point of view for the expectation of realization to be somewhat earlier from an application standpoint. But the differences are not so dramatic as to justify the conclusion that researchers are more optimistic than developers/practitioners. 5.2 Single topics Tab. 15 and 16 show the two highest rated topics in each sub-area in the first two columns and the two lowest rated topics in each sub-area in the last two columns. These represent average data from Set C. The four columns in the middle show the estimation of participants who work in research or application, respectively. As part of the demoscopic data it was determined whether participants work more in research or in application (cf. Tab.6). Notice that both groups answered from a research and application point of view. In a more detailed analysis (which will be published later) this- and other aspects- can be pursued.

It was an extremely time-consuming task to answer the questionnaire, which was more like a book than a folder. I hope the results justify the efforts. The analysis would not have been possible without the help of m~ colleagues - Udo Hahn for the conceptual desi~a, and Dr.J.Staud together with Annette Woehrle, Frank Dittmar and Gerhard Schneider for the statistical analysis.
