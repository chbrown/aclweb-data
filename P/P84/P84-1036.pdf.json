I INTRODUCTION","In previous papers it has been pointed out that ill a well-structured Lexical Data Has(. it becomes possible to detect automatical;y, an(l ~e evidence through interactlve queries a number Of morphologica] , syntact.ic, or semant i~. relationships between lexical entries, .~uch ~lb synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy, der ivat ion, case-argument, lexical field, etc.","The present article examines hyponymy, a.~ dI: example of paradigmatic relation, and what can b(. called \"restriction or modification\" relaLion, as a syntagmat ic relation, l-~y reSLl'iet Jell or modification relation, l mean that part of a so-called \"aristotellan\" definition which has tiJe function of linking th(~ \"genus\" and the \"differentia specifica\".","When evidenced in a lexicon, tile hyponymy relation produces hierarchical trees partitioniI*K the lexicon in many semant ica i ly coilerent subsets. These trees are not created once and for al i, but it is important that uhey are procedurally activated at the query moment. While evidencing the second relation considered, one can investigate as to whether it is possible to discover any correlation be~wneI* lexical or grammatical features in definitions and particular kinds of \"definienda\", and thus try to answer questions such as the following: \"Are there any connections between these restriction relations and ~he fundamental ways of definition, i.e. the criterial parameters by which people defines things?\"","For both relations, the paper presents the different procedures by which they are\" automatically recognized and extracted from the natural language definitions, the degree of reliability of their automatic labeling, the use of these labels in interactive queries on the lexical data base, and finally the theoretical results of their implementation in a"]},{"title":"Machine-Dictionary.","paragraphs":["II THE LANGUAGE OF DEFINITIONS AS A SUBLANGUAGE","1 am trying to develop and exploit the idea of considering the language of dictionary definitions as a particular sublanguage within natural language. This perspective cannot obviously be adopted for subject matter restrictions in definitions, but only for the purpose of the text, i.e. the specific communicative goal. From this restriction on the purpose of the text, certain lexico-grammatical restrictions do result, which prove to be very useful. As to tile restrictions on tile lexical richness of definitions, these are not due to the fact that they relate to a specific domain of discourse, but only to the property of closure (although not satisfied at 100%') that the defining vocabulary should in principle be simpler and more restricted than the defined set of ]emmas, i.e. the former should be a proper subset of the latter.","This kind of quantitative restriction on the vocabulary of definitions would not be of any interest in itself, if it were not accompanied by other kinds of constraints both on a) the lexical, and on b) the grammatical side.","a) From the frequency list of the words used in definitions (about 800,000 word-occurrences, and 75,000 word-types), it appears in fact that some words have a much greater importance than in normal language, as evidenced by a comparison with the data of the"]},{"title":"Lessico di Frequenza della Lingua Italiano Contemporaneo","paragraphs":["(Bortolini et al., 1971). These are the defining generic terms"]},{"title":"170","paragraphs":["which are traditionally used by lexicographers, such as ACT, EFFECT, PERSON, OBJECT, WHO, PROCESS, CAUSE, etc. It is not by chance that these same concepts are of relevance in many Artificial Intelligence systems.","b) Not only single words, or classes of words, are particularly relevant in the defining sublanguage. There are also lexical patterns and syntactic patterns which occur with great frequency, and which play a very special role in defining sentences.","The combination of these constraints carl be and actually is very useful, when trying to exploit the information contained in definitions, and when transforming an archive of natural language definitions into a knowledge base. structured as a network. Some important parts of knowledge are in fact already retrievable in interactive mode from the Italian Lexica] Data Base, which has recently been restructured.","Analyses on large corpora of definitions, carried out on many dictionaries (Amsler. I')80; Calzolari, 1983a, 1983b; Michiels, Noel, 1')82) have in fact shown that the definitions sublanguage displays several regularities of lexJca] and syntactic occurrences and patterns. These general lexica] c]asses and the classes of recurrent patterns can be more or less eusi]y captured for instance by pattern-matching r. les. and if possible characterized with formal rules. II] HYPONYMY RELATION Hyponymy is the most important relation to b(, evidenced ill a lexicon. Due tO it.% taxollom i {: nature, it gives the lexicon, when implemented, a particular hierarchical structure: its result is obviously not a tree, but many tangled hierarchies (Amsler, 1980).","Instead of evidencing and labelling this relation by hand, I have tried to characterize it procedurally. The procedure which automatically coded (with a precision of more thah 90% calculated on a random sample of 2000 definitions) true superordinates in all the definitions (approx. 185.000 for ]03.000 iemmas). was based almost exclusively on the position of the \"genus\" term at the beginning of the definitional phrases, giving Nouns, Verbs. and Adjectives as superordinates of defined entries of the same lexical category. Ad hoc subroutines solved exceptional cases where a) quantifiers, or other modifiers preceded the genus term (e.g. aletta ---> piccolo gruppo di Donne dietro l'angolo dell'ala), or b) more than one genus was present in the definition (e.g. Qssordore ---> attutire, smorzarsi detto di suono), or c) a prepositional phrase, usually of locative type, was at the beginning of the phrase (e.g. piazzato ---> nel rugby, calcio al pallone collocate sul terreno).","Even though the first immediate purpose of this procedure is of classificationa] nature, the ultimate goal is the extraction and formalization of the most relevant relationship between lexical items which is implicitly stored in any standard printed dictionary. It is in fact now possible to retrieve in the ]exica] data base not only all the definitions in which any possible word-form appears, together with the defined lemmas (e.g. SUONO appears in 328 definitions), but also to retrieve on-line, if desired, only the definitions in which the given word-form is used as a superordinate, therefore with the list of its hyponyms (e.g. the same word SUONO is used as superordinate of only 65 words, i.e. of a subset of the preceding set containing MUSICA, RUNORE, SQUILLO, SUSSURRO, etc.~.","The query-language so far implemented for the lexica] data base permits therefore to retrieve information on this hierarchical relation. identifying on-line the a]lowable interconnections within the entire lexicon. The links produced can he analyzed, evaluated, and, if necessary, interactive]y corrected.","From explorations on the trees thus obtained. we can also try Lo set up classes and subclasses of superordinates, on the basis of the upper nodes to which many other nodes are connected as descendants. Only as an example, the identification criterion for the noun-class \"SET-OF\" containing ]NSIEME, GRUPPO, COLLEZJONE, COMPLESSO. AGGREGATO. etc., among the set of noun-superordinates, is the fact that they are linked one to the other in the tree which results from querying the data base. Their hyponyms will obviously be for the most part collective nouns.","The identification of word-classes like this one leads to the next step Jn the formalization of the hyponymy relation, which will consist in the insertion of a label indicating a semantic class to these sets of superordinates. It will thus be possible to retrieve, for example, all the nouns generically definable as \"SET-OF\", independently of tile particular word denoting a set used in definitions. Since it is already possible to trace these chains of hyponyms going upwards or downwards for more than one level, one can immediately ask whether, for example, MASSERIA belongs to the set of collectives even if it is defined as HANDRIA, because MANDRIA is defined as BRANCO, which is in turn defined as INSIENE, which finally is one of the nouns belonging to the class \"SET-OF\"."]},{"title":"171","paragraphs":["IV RESTRICTION RELATION","Even though some refinements are still required in order to improve the reliability of the automatic recovery of ISA-re]ated terms chains, this kind of structural relation within the lexicon, that is hyponymy, is at a good stage of implementation in the Italian ]exica] data base.","Much still remains to be done as far as other very interesting rel at iouships bt~tween tile entries are concerned. I am now considering what could be called \"restriction or modificatioi*\" relation, since its purpose is to restrict or modify the meaning of the genus term.

Using rather simple pattern-matching procedures some classes and subclasse~ of definitions can be separated, and a small number of simpler types of definitions have already been converted into a formalized coded format also with regard to this restriction relation. A new virtual Relation is thus added to the original data base. The distinguished elements of a number of simple natural language patterns are mapped into some general structured information formats. Up to now, some of the definitions displaying the following restriction relations have been treated: REL.FORM (e.g."]},{"title":"o formo di)","paragraphs":["REL.PROV (e.g."]},{"title":"provvisto di)","paragraphs":["REL.APT (e.g."]},{"title":"otto o)","paragraphs":["and the corresponding relational links generated.

V FUTURE PERSPECTIVES","A comparison with the definitional corpora of other dictionaries, also of other languages, will certainly prove to be useful in establishing the set of the most general or primitive Relations, used for definition in lexicographieal practice, often overlapping with the primitive Relations stated in many AI systems. These relations, mapped into a formal link in the data base, can then be paraphrased in each language, in the standard language.","The data base structure envisaged does permit both to maintain at a lower level (the starting level), and to eliminate at an upper level, many peculiarities and variations in the linguistic"]},{"title":"172","paragraphs":["expression of the same or of similar concepts or relations; their effect is to facilitate the comprehension by the users of the printed dictionary, inhibiting however immediate comprehension by procedural routines in the mechanical processing of dictionary"]},{"title":"data.","paragraphs":["By applying similar methods of automatic conversion and mapping into suitable formats, as extensively as possible throughout the lexicon, many definitional expressions can be submitted to an attempt of standardization, thus achieving major precision, which gives a considerable improvement when performing, for example, information retrieval operations on the content of a dictionary.","This more structured, but, in another sense. simplified version of definitions, which also accounts for their relational nature, provides an excellent basis for testing and studying the \"knowledge of the world\" which underlies the structure of a dictionary.
