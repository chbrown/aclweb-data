The transducer is a specialized production system giving the linguists the tools for expressing infon~ation in a syntax that is close to theoretical linguistics.

INTRODUCTION","The GTT-system (Geneva Teaching Transducer)1 is a ger~ral tree-to-tree transducer developed as a tool for training linguists in machine translation and computational linguistics. The transducer is a specialized production system tailored to the requirements of ecmputational linguists providing them with a means of expressing information in a format close to the linguistic theory they are familiar with.","GIT has been developed for teaching purposes and cannot be considered as a system for large scale development. A first version has been inplemented in standard Pascal and is currently running on a Univac 1100/61 and a VAX-780 under UNIX. At present it is being used by a team of linguists for experimental devel~t of an MT system for a special purpose language (Buchmann et al., 1984), and to train students in cc~putational linguistics. 2. THE UNIFORMITY AND SIMPLICITY OF THE SYSTEM","As a tool for training ccr~putational linguists, major emphasis was placed on developing a system that is user friendly, uniform, and which provides a legible syntax.","One of the important requirements in machine translation is the separation of linguistic data and algorithms (Vauquois, 1975). The linguist should have the means to express his knowledge declaratively without being obliged to mix ~u-This project is sponsored by the Swiss government. tational algorithms and linguistic data. Production systems (Rosner, 1983) seem particularly suited to meet such requirements (Johnson, 1982); the production set that expresses the object-level knowledge is clearly separated from the control part that drives the application of the productions. Colmerauer's Q-system is the classic example of such a uniform production system used for machine translation (Colmerauer, 1970; Chevalier, 1978: TAUM-METEO). The linguistic knowledge is expressed declaratively using the same data structure during the whole translation process as well as tb~ sane type of production rules for dictionary entries, morphology, analysis, transfer and generation. The disadvantage of the Q-system is its quite unnatural rule-syntax for non-prrx/rammers and its lack of flexible control mechanism for the user (Vauquois, 1978).","In the design of our system the basic uniform sch~re of Q-systems has been followed, but the rule syntax, the linguistic data structure and the control facilities have been modernized according to recent developments in machine translation (Vauquois, 1978; Bo£tet, 1977; Johnson, 1980; Slocan, 1982). These three points will be developed in the next section. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYST~4 3.1 Overview","The general framework is a production system where linguistic object knowledge is expressed in a rule-based declarative way. The system takes the dictionaries and the grammars as data, cc~piles these data and the interpreter then uses them to process the input text. The decoder transforms the result into a digestable form for the user. 3.2 Data structure The data structure of the system is based on a chart (Varile, 1983). One of the main advantages of using a c~art is that the data structure does not change throughout the whole process of translation (Vauquois, 1978).","In the Q-system all linguistic data on the arcs is represented by bracketed strings causing an unclean mixture of constituent structure and other linguistic attributes such as grammatical and semantic labels, etc. With this representation"]},{"title":"88","paragraphs":["type checking is not possible. Vauquois proposes two changes : I) Tree structures with uun~lex labels on the nodes in order to allow interaction between different linguistic levels such as syntax or semantics, etc. 2) A dissociation of the gecmetry from a particular linguistic level. With these modifications a single tree structure with complex labels increases the power of representation in that several levels of interpretation can be processed simultaneously (Vauquois, 1978; Boftet, 1977).","In our system each arc of the chart carries a tree geometry and each node of the tree has a plex labelling consisting of a possible string and the linguistic attributes. Through the separation of gecmetry and attributes, the linguist can deal with two distinct objects: with tree structures and complex labels on the nodes of the trees. tring='linguist' ] at=noun, gender=p~ Figure i. Tree with cc~plex labelling","The range or kind of linguistic attributes possible is not predefined by the system. The linguist has to define the types he wants to use in a declaration part.","e.g.: category = verb, noun, np, pp. semantic-features = human, animate. gender = masc, fern, neut. An important aspect of type declaration is the control it offers. ~ne system provides strong syntactic and semantic type checking, thereby constrain-ing the application range in order to avoid inappropriate transductions. The actual implementation allows the use of sets and subsets in the type de-finition. Further extensions are planned.","C~'ven that in this systmm the tree geometry is not bound to a specific linguistic level, the linguist has the freedom to decide which infommation will be represented by the geometry and which will be treated as attributes on the nodes. This representation tool is thus fairly general and allows the testing of different theories and strategies in MT or computational linguistics. 3.3 The rule slnltax The basic tool to express object-knc~ledge is a set of production rules which are similar in form to context-free phrase structure rules, and well-known to linguists from fozmal grammar. In order to have the same rule type for all operations in a translation system the power of the rules must be of type 0 in the Chomsky classification, including string handling facilities.","The rules exhibit two important additions to","context-free phrase structure rules:","- arbitrary structures can be matched on the left-hand side or built on the rlght-hand side, giving •"]},{"title":"(ge~etry)","paragraphs":["(conditions)","the pfx~er of unrestricted rules or transforma-","tional grammar ~ - arbitrary conditions on the application of the","rule can be added, giving the pc~er of a context","sensitive grammar.","The power of unrestricted rewriting rules makes the transducer a versatile inset for expressing any rule-governed aspect of language whether this be norphology, syntax, semantics. The fact that the statements are basically phrase structure rules makes this language particularly congenial to linguists and hence well-suited for teaching purposes.","The fozmat of rules is detenuined by the separation of tree structure and attributes on the nodes. Each rule has three parts: geometry, conditions and assignments, e.g.: RULE1 a + b ~ c(a,b) IF cat(a) = [det] and cat(b) = [nou~ (assist) ~ cat(c) := [n~; The geometry has the standard left-hand side, production symbol (~, and right-hand side of a production rule. a,b,c are variables describing the nodes of the tree structure. The '+' indicates the sequence in the chart, e.g. a+b : a b Tree configurations are indicated by bracketing, c(a,b) correspc~ds to : ----9"]},{"title":"/c\\ a b","paragraphs":["Conditions and asslgrm~nts affect only the objects on the nodes. 3.4 Control structure","The linguist has ~ tools for controlling the application of the rewriting rules : i) The rules can be grouped into packets (grammars) which are executed in sequence. 2) Within a given grammar the rule-application can be controlled by means of paraneters set by the linguist. According to the linguistic operation envisaged, the parameters can be set to a ccmbination of serial or parallel and one-pass or iterate. In all, 4 different combinations are possible : parallel and one-pass parallel and iterate serial and one-pass serial and iterate 89","In the parallel mode the rules within a grammar are considered as being unordered from a logical point of view. Different rules can be applied on the same piece of data and produce alternatives in the chart. The chart is updated at the end of every application-cycle. In the serial mode the rules are considered as being ordered in a sequence. Only one rule can be fired for a particular piece of data. But the following rules can match the result prDduced by a preceding rule. The chart is updated after every rule that fired. The parameters one-pass and iterate control the nunber of cycles. Either the interpreter goes through a cycle only once, or iterates the cycles as long as any rule of the grammar can fire.","The four ccmbinations allow different uses according to the linguistic task to be performed, e.g.: Parallel and iterate applies the rules non-deterministically to cc~pute all possibilities, which gives the system the power of a Turing Maritime (this is the only control mode for the Q-system). Parallel and one-pass is the typical ccrnbination for dictionaries that contain alternatives. Two different rules can apply to the sane piece of data. The exhale below (fig. 2) uses this combination in the first GRAMMAR 'vocabulary'.","Serial and one-pass allows rule ordering. A possible application of this combination is a preference mechanism via the explicit rule ordering using the longest-match-first technique. The","'preference' in the example below (fig. 2) makes use of that by progressive weakening of the selectional restriction of the verb 'drink'. Rule 24 fires without semantic restrictions and rule 25 accepts sentences where the optional argument is missing. The ~le should be sufficiently self-explanatory. It begins with the declaration of the attributes and contains three grannars. The result is shown for two sentences (fig. 3). To demonstrate which rule in the preference gran~ar has fired each rule prDduces a different top label: rule 21 = PHI, rule 22 . PH2, etc. Figure 2.
