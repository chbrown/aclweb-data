Outline of the TIBAQ ~lethod","hhen the TIBA~ (~ext-and-~nference based ~nswering of ~uestions) project was ~esigned, main emphasis was laid on the automatic build-up of the stock of knowledge from the (non-~re-edited% input text. The experimental system based 6n this method converses automatically the natural language input (both the questions and new Fieces of information, i.e. Czech sentences in their usual form) into the reDresentat-ions of n,eaning (tectogranmlatical representations, TR's]; these TR's serve as input structures for the inference procedure tilat enriches the set of TR's selected by the system itself as possibly relevant for an answer to the input question. In this enriched set suitable TR's for direct and indirect answers to the given question are retrieved, and then transfered by a synthesis procedure into the output (surface) form if sentences (for an outline of the method as such, see Haji~ov~, 197~; 3aji~ov~ and Sgall, 19~i; Sgall, 1982).","B. :?hat Kind of Structure Inferences ~houl~i Be Based on","To decide what kind of structures the inference procedure should operate, one has to take into account several criteria, some of which seemingly contradict each other: the structures should be as simple and transparent as possible, so that inferencing can be perfor,ued in a well-defined way, and at the s~e ti~ue, these structures ~hould be as\"exDressive\"as the natural language sentences are, not to lose any piece of information captured by the text.","\"~atural language has a major drawback in its ambiguity: when a listener is told that the criticisl~ of the Polish delegate was fully justified, one does not know (unless indicated by the context or situation) whether s/he should infer that soE~eone criticized the Polish delegate, or whether the Polish delegate criticized someone/something. On the other hand, there are means in natural language that are not preserved by most languages that logicians have used for drawing consequences, but that are critical for the latter to be drawn correctly: when a listener is told that ~ussiau is ~poken in SIBERIA, s/he draws conclusions partly different from those when s/he is told that in Siberla, RUS3IAN is spoken (caoitals denoting the intonation center); or, to borrow one of the widely discussed examples in linguistic writings, if one hears that Jonn called :ary a ~U~LICA~ and that then she insult-ed I~IM, one should infer that the sneaker considers \"being a ~eoublican\" an insult~ this is not the case, if the speaker said that then she I~SULTED hi~. These and similar considerations have led the authors of TIDAn to a stronc conviction that the structures representing F.nowledge and serving as the base for inferencing in a q-uestion-answerin[~ system with a natural language interface should be linguistically based: they should be deprived of all ambiguities of natural language and at the same til:ie they should pre-serve all the information relevant for drawing conclusions that the natural lanci-uage sentences encompass. The exr.erir,~ental syster~, based on TI~A(:, which was carried out by the group of formal linauistics at Charles University, Prague [implemented on ~C 1040 c~:n?11ter, compatible with 15::4 360) works with representations of :~eaning (tectogrammatical representations, fR's2 worked nut in the framework of functional generahive descrintion, or ~GD (for the linguistic background of this aopro~ch we refer to Sgall, 1964; ~;~all et ai.,1959;"]},{"title":"291","paragraphs":["Haji~ov~ and Jgall, 19:~O ).

The other group o~ gr~mmatemes is not - with some exceptions - %~ord-class specific and similarly as the set of the types of complementations is closely connected with the kinds of the dependency relations between the governor and the dependent node; thus the Locative is accom}~anied by one member of the set {in, on, under, between .... ].","%'he dependency relations are very rich and varied, and it is no wonder that there were many efforts to classify them. In FGD, a ,lear boundary is being made between -~tJcipants (deep cases) and(free) modifications: participants are those com- !~lementations that can occur with the same verb token only once and that have to be sr~uci~ied for each verb (and similarly for each noun, adjective, etc.), while free modifications are those comolementations that may appear more than once with the same verb token and that can be listed for all the verbs once for all; for a ~ore detaile:i discussion and the use of operational criteria for this classification, see ?anevov~ 1974; 1980; Eaji~ov~ and Panevov~, in press; Haji~ov~, 1977; 1983. Doth ;~articipants and modifications can be (semantically) optional or obligatory; ~oth optional and obligatory oarticiDants are to be stated in the case frames of verbs, while modificatiors belong there only with such verbs with which they are obligatory.","In the nresent version of FGD, the following five participants are distinguished: actor/bearer, patient (objective), addressee, origin, an~ effect. The list o4 ~odifications is by far richer and more differentiated; a good starting ~oint for tills differentiation can be found in Czech gram~lars (esp. ~milauer, 1947). %'bus one can arrive at the following grou~?ings: (a) local: where, lirection, \"~lhich ~:ray, (b) tem~3oral: when, since when, till when,","how long, for ho%J long, luring, (c) causal: cause, condition real and un-","rdal, aim, concession, consequence, (d) manner: manner, regard, extent, norm","(criterion) , substitution, accompani-","ment, means (instrument), difference,"]},{"title":"292","paragraphs":["benefit, comparison.

[q_eans of Implementation The inference rules are progranm~ed in 9-1anguage (Colmerauer, 1982), which provides rules that carry out transforr~at~ ions of oriented graphs. Since the structures accepted by the rules must not contain complex labels, every complex sy~bol labelling a no~e in WR's has the form of a whole subtree in the Q-language notation (in a \"~-tree). The set of TR's constitutes a semantic network, in which the individu~l T!{'s are connected into a com[~lex whole hy means of pointers between tl]e occurrences of lexical units and the corresponding entries in the lexicon. (Ouestions of different objects of the same kind referred to in different TR's will be handled only in the future ex]~eriments.)

The Retrieval Procedure","Th~ retrieval of an answer in the enriched set of assertions (TR's) is performed in the following stepsl","(a) first it is checked whether the lexical value of the root of the TR is identical with that of the TR of the question; if the question has the form \"What is performed (done, carried out) by X?\", then the TR from the enriched set must include an action verb as a label of its root; (b) the path leading from the root to the wh-word is checked (yes-no questions are. excluded from the first stage of our experiments); the rightmost path in the relevant TR must coincide with the wh-path in its lexical labels, contextual--boundness, grammatemes and functors (with some possible deviations determined by conditions of substitutability: Singular - Plural, Manner - Accompaniment, etc.); the wh-word in the question must be matched by ~-lexical unit of the potential answer, where the latter may be further expanded; (c~ if also the rest of the two compared TR s meet the conditions of identity or substitutability, the relevant TR is marked as a full answer to the given question; if this is not the case but at least one of the nodes depending on a node included in the wh-path meets these conditions, then the relevant TR is marked as an indirect (partial) answer.","B. Towards an Effective Application of Inference Rules","In the course of the experiments it soon became clear that even with a very limited number of inference rules the memory space was rapidly exceeded. It was then necessary to find a way how to achieve an effective application of the inference rules and at the same time not to restrict the choice of relevant answers. Among other things, the following issues should be taken into consideration:","The rules substituting subtrees for subtrees are used rather frequently, as well as those substituting only a label of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one element of the complex symbol in the CDS), preserving the overall structure of the tree untouched. These rules operate in both directions, so that it appears as use-ful to use in such cases a similar strategy as with synonymous expressions, i.e. to decide on a single representation both in the TR of the question and that included in the stock of knowledge; this would lead to an important decrease of the number of TR's that undergo further inference transformations.","Only those TR's are selected for the final steps of the retrieval of the answer (see point (a) in III.A) that coincide with the TR of the question in the lexical label of the root, i.e. the main verb. If the inference rules are ordered in such a way that the rules changing an element of the label of the root are applied before the rest of the rules, then the first step of the retrieval procedure can be made before the application of other inference rules. This again leads to a con-295 siderable reduction of the number of TR's on which the rest of the inference rules are applied; only such TR's are left in the stock of relevant TR's (i)that agree with the TR of the question in the label of the root (its ~exical label may belong to superordinated or subordinated lexioal values: device - amplifier, etc.), (ii) that i~clude the lexical label of the root oC the question in some other place than at the root of the relevant TR, (iii) if the question has the form \"Which N \" (i.e the wh-n~de depends on its •","o-",",","o head in the relation of general relationship), then also those TR's are preserved that contain an identical N node (noun) on any level of the tree. The use of Q-language brings about one difficulty, namely that the rules have to be formulated for each level for the tree separately. It is possible to avoid this complication by a simple temporary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which results in a tree in which all nodes with lexical labels are on the same level; the rules for a substitution of the lexical labels can be then applied in one step, after which the tree is \"returned\" into its original shape. These and similar considerations have led us to the following ordering of the in-dividual steps of the inference and retrieval procedure: I. application of rules transforming the input structure to such an extent that the lexlcal label of the root of the tree is not preserved in the tree of a potential answer;","2. a partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree;","3. application of rules substituting other labels pertinent to the root of the tree;","4. partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree;","5. application of inference rules operatinq on a single tree;","6. application of inference rules operating on two trees;","7. the steps (b) and (c) from the retrieval of the answer (see III.A above).
