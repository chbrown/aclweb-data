I use the term \"identify\" in a very. narrow, though important and basi-, sense -- one that intimately involves perception.

A crucial component of referent identification is the act of perceptually searching for something that satisfies the description. The description is decomposed by the agent into a plan of action for identifying the referent. The intended and expected physical, sensory, and cognitive actions may be signalled by tile speaker's choice of predicates. For example, a speaker uttering the phrase \"the magnetic screwdriver\", may intend for the hearer to place various screwdrivers against some piece of iron to determine which is magnetic. Speakers know that hearers map (at least some) predicates, onto actions that determine their extensions, and thus, using a model of the heater's capabilities and the causal connections among people, their senses, and physical objects, design their expression, D, so that hearers can successfully execute those actions in the context of the overall plan.","Not only does a speaker plan for a hearer to identify the referent of a description, but he often indicates his intention that the hearer do so. According to Searle, one possible way to do this is to use a definite determiner. Of course, not all definite NP's are used to refer: for example, in the sentence \"the last piece is the nozzle', the referent of the first NP is intended to be identified, whereas the referent of the second NP is not. The attributive use of definite noun phrases [6] is a case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent. Yet other nonanaphoric u~es of definite noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunicatiou, having the hearer wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc. '~","To respond appropriately, a hearer decide~ when identi[icatiou is the act he is supposed to perform on a description, what part this act \" will play in the speaker's and hearer's plan~, and how aud when to perform the act.

This should guarantee that, for example, a speaker does not intend someone to pick out the referent of \"3 ~, \"democracy\", or \"the first man to land on Mars ~. The condition is satisfied in the experimental task since it rapidly becomes mutual knowledge that the task requires communication about the objects in front of the hearer.","The second condition states that X fulfills the description D. Here, 1 am ignoring cases in which the description is not literally true of the intended referent, including metonymy, irony, and the like (but see [12]). Lastly, D should be a description that is identifiable to this particular Agt. It should use descriptors whose extension the agent already knows or can discover via action. I am assuming that we can know that a combination of descriptors is identifiable without having formed a plan for identifying the referent.","To give a name to the state of knowledge we are in after having identified the referent of D, we will use {IDENTIFIED-REFERENT Agt D X). That is, Agt has identified the referent of D to be X. Of course, what has been notoriously difficult to specify is just what Agt has to know about X to say he has identified it as the reforent of D. At a minimum, the notion of identification needs to be made relative to a purpose, which, perhaps, could be derived from the bodily acti.ns that someone (in the context} is intended to perform upon X. Clearly, \"knowing who the D is\" 18, 9], is no substitute for having identified a referent. After having picked out the referent of a doseription D, we may still not not know who the D is. On the other hand, we may know who or what the description denotes, for example, hy knowing ~ome \"standard name\" for it, and yet be unable to use that kn.wledge to pick out the object. For example, if we ask \"Which is tho Seattle train?\" and receive the reply \"It's train number 11689\", we may ~till not be able to pick out and board the train if its serial number is not plainly in view.","Finally, athough not stated in this definition, the means by which the act is performed is some function mapping D to some procedure that, when executed by Agt, enables Agt to discover the X that is the referent of D. 4.1. Requesting","Con.~ider what it takes to make a request. Hector Levesque and I [4, 5] argu~, that requests and other illocutionary acts can be defined in terms of interacting plans -- i.e., as beliefs about the conversants' shared knowledge of the speaker's goals and the causal consequences of achieving those goals. In this formalism, illocutionacy acts are no longer conceptually primitive, but rather amount to theorems that can be proven about a state of affairs. The proof requires an axiomatization of agents' beliefs, expectations, goals, plans, actions, and a cur* relation of utterance mood with certain propositional attitudes. The important point here is that the definition of a request is not merely stipulated, but is derived from an independently motivated theory of action. Any act that brings about the right effects in the right way satisfies the request theorem.","Briefly, a request is an action (or collection of actions) that makes it ( 1 ) shared knowledge that the speaker's goal is that the hearer thinks the speaker wants the hearer to adopt the goal of doing a particular act, thereby making it (2) shared knowledge between the speaker and hearer that the speaker wants the hearer to do that act. This inference requires an additional \"gating\" condition that it be shared knowledge that the speaker is both sincere and can perform the requested act (i.e., he knows how, and the preconditions of that act are true).","The processing of an utterance is assumed to begin by applying the propositional attitude correlated with its mood to the propositional content associated with its literal interpretation. Thus, correlated with imperatives and interrogatives is the attitude above {correspending to goal (I)): 6 (MUTUAL-BELIEF Hearer Speaker","(GOAL Speaker","(BEL Hearer","(GOAL Speaker","(GOAL Hearer","(DONE Hearer Act P)))))} .","(DONE Hearer Act P) is true if Hearer has done act Act and has brought about P. For yes/no interrogatives, Act would be an INFORMIF [11]; for imperatives, it would be the act mentioned in the sentence. Declaratives would be correlated with a different propositional attitude. Beginning with the utterance-correlated attitudes, a derivation process that constitutes plan-recogniti.n reasoning determines what the speaker meant [7]. Thus, for example, what the speaker meant could be classified as a request if the derivation included making (2) true by making the above formula true.","An act may simultaneousJy achieve the goals constituting more than one illocutionary act. This ability underlies the analysis of indirect speech acts. Formalisms have been developed [5, 11] that describe when we can conclude, from a speaker's wanting the hearer to want the precondition of some act to hold, (or wanting the hearer to believe the precondition does hold), that the speaker wants the hearer to adopt the goal of performing the act. The conditi.ns licensing this inference are that it be mutually known that the act (or its effect) is an expected goal of the speaker, and that it be mutually known that: the hearer can perform the act. is cooperative, and does not want not to do it.","Returning to the troublesome existential sentences, this pattern of reasoning, which I term the \"illoculionary act analysis\" {[AAI, can be used to derive a request for reh'rent identification. The reasoning is similar to that needed to infer a request to open the door on hearing a speaker, with two arm-loads of groceries, say \"the door i~ closed\". The general form of this reasoning involves the a.~serti.n o! an action's precondition when the effect of the action is an expected goal of the speaker. In the case at hand, the speaker's existential assertion causes the hearer to believe the existential precondition of the referent identification act, since speaker and hearer both think they are talking about objects in front of the h~'arer, and because the description is identifiable. Ilence, the hearer concludes he is intended to pick out its referent. The hearer may go on to infer that he is intended to perform other acts, such as to pick up the object. This inference process also indicates when the indirect request interpretation is not iutended, for example, if it is mutually known that the description is not identifiable, or if it is mutually known that the hearer would not want to identify the referent.","I argue that this kind of reasoning underlies the propositional act account. First, I show that Searle's conditions on referring are a special case of the conditions for requesting referent identification. Then, I show that if one extends the definition of IDENTIFY-REFERENT to cover Searle's more general concept of identificatiou, the IAA is applicable in the same circumstances a~s Searle's analysis.

This condition is captured in the IAA by its bee.ruing umtual knowledge that the speaker intends to achieve the effect of the referent identification act, IDENTIFIED-IH'H\"I';RENT. Finally, Searle's Gricean intent recognition Condition [G) takes h-ld in the same way that it does for other illocutionary acts. namely in virtue of a \"feature\" of the utterance (e.g., utterance mood, or a definite determiner} that is correlated with a complex prop.sitional attitude. This attitude becomes the basis for subsequent reasoning about the speaker's plans. In summary, Searle's conditions can be acconnted for by simply positing an action that the speaker requests aml that the hearer reasons about and performs.","So far, the IAA and PAA are complementary. They each account for different aspects of referring. The IAA characterizes utterances who~e sole p.rpose is to secure referent identification, and the PAA characterizes the use of referring phrases within an illocutionary act. I now precede to show how the IAA can subsume the PAA.","Searle argues that tree use of the definite article in uttering an NP is to indicate the speaker's intention to refer uniquely. Moreover, from Condition 5, this intention is supposed to be recognized by the hearer. We can get this effect by correlating the following expression with the delinite determiner: A D [(MUTUAL-BELIEF Hearer Speaker","(GOAL Speaker (BEL Hearer 3 !

However, we again regard identification as an act that the hearer performs, not something the speaker does to/for a hearer. If an analysis of this \"rSincerity can be dispensed with at no significant loss of generality SThat is, I am suggesting that the interpretation of how the speaker intends the noun phrase to be interpreted le.g., referentially, attributively, etc.} begins with such a propositional attitude. If the referential reading is unsuccessful, the hearer needs to make other inferences to derive the intended reading. extended notion can be made similar in form to the analysis of the perceptual identification act, then the IAA completely subsumes the PAA. Because both accounts are equally vague on what constitutes identification (as are, for that matter, all other accounts of which [ am aware), the choice between them must rest on other grounds. The grounds favoring the identification request analysis include the use of separate utterances and illocutionary acts for referring, and the independently motivated satisfaction of Searle's conditions on referring."]},{"title":"5.2. Searle vs. Russell","paragraphs":["Using the propositional act of referring. Searle argues against Russews [13] theory of descriptions, which holds that the uttering of an expression \"the ~\" is equivalent to the assertion of an uniquely existential proposition ~there is a unique ~b\". Thus, when reference fails, it is because the uniquely existential proposition is nc, t true. Searle claims instead that the existence of the referent is a precondition to the action of referring. In referring to X, we do not a~ssert that X exists any more than we do in hitting X (lbid, p. 1G0.) However, the precondition is necessary for successful performance. Searle's argument against this theory essentially comes down to: ... It [Russell's theory] presents the propositional act of definite reference, when performed with definite descriptions ... as equivalent to the illocutionary act of asserting a uniquely existential proposition, and there is no coherent way to integrate such a theory into a theory of illocutionary acts. Under no condition is a prol.J:~itional act identical with the illocntionary act of asserti.n, for a. propositional act can only occur as part of s, uuc illocutionary act, never simply by itself (Ibid, p. 15.
