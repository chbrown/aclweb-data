Instead of considering words as basic syntactic units to which grammatical information is attached, we use simple sentences (subject-verb-objects) as dictionary entries, Hence, s full dictionary item is a simple sentence with a description of the corresponding distributional and transformational properties,","The systematic study of French has led to an organization of its lexicon-grammar based on three main components: - the lexicon-grammar of free sentences, that is, of sentences whose verb imposes selactionel restrictions on its subject and complements (e.g. to fall, to eat, to watch), - the lexicon-grammar of frozen or idiomatic expressions (e.g. N takes N into account, N faiaea a question, - the lexicon-grammar ot support verbs. These verbs do not have the common selactional restrictions, but more complex dependencies between subject and complement (e.g. to have, to make in N has an impact on N, N makes a certain impression on N)","These three components interact in specific ways. We present the structure of the lexicon-grammar built for French and we discuss its algorithmic implications for parsing.","The construction of a lexicon-grammar of French has led to an accumulation of linguistic information that should significantly bear on the procedures ot automatic analysis of natural languages. We shall present the structure of a lexicon-grammar built for French <2> and will discuss its algorithmic main implications. 1. VERBS","The syntactic properties of French verbs have been limited in terms of the size of sentences, that is, by restricting the type of complements to object complements. We considered 3 main types of objects: direct, and with prepositions ~ and de. Verbs have been selected from current dictionaries according to the reproducibility of the syntactic judgments carried out on them by a team of linguists. A set of about 10~000 verbs has thus been studied.","The properties systematically studied for each verb are the standard ones: 1 E.R.A. 247 of the C.N.R.S. afiliated to the Universities Paris 7 and Paris Viii. 2 Publication of the lexicon-grammar is under way. The main segments available are: Boons, Guillet, Lecldre 1976a, 1976b and Gross 1975 for French verbs, Giry-Schneider 1978, A. Meunier 1981, de Ndgroni 1978, for nominalizations, - distributional properties, such as human or non human nouns, and their pronominal shapes (definite, relative, interrogative pronouns <3>, clitics), possibility of sentential subjects and complements que (that S), ai 3 (whether S, if S) or reduced infinitive forms noted V Comp,","transformational properties, such as passive, extraposition, clit icization, etc, /~logether, 500 properties have been checked against the 1~000 verbs <4>.","More precisely, each property can be viewed as a sentence form. Consider for example the transitive structure (1) N O V N 1 We are using Z.S. Harris' notation for sentence structure: noun phrases are indexed by numerical subscripts, starting with the subject indexed by 0. We can note the property \"human subject\" in the following equivalent ways: (2) Nhum V N 1 or N O (:: Nhum) V N t w~ere the symbol :: is used to specify a structure . A passive structure will be noted (3) N I be V-ed by N O A transformation is a relation between two structures noted \"=°': (1) = (3) corresponds to the Passive rule The syntactic information attached to simple sentences can thus be represented in a uniform way by means ot binary matrix (Table 1). Each row ot the matrix corresponds to a verb, each column to a sentence form. When a verb enters into a sentence form, a \"+\" sign is placed at the intersection of the corresponding row and column, if not s \"-\" sagn. The description of the French verbs does not have the shape of a 10,000x500 matrix. Because of its redundancy (cf. note 4 1, the matrix has been broken down into about 50 submatrices whose size is 200x40 on the average. It is such a system of submatrices that we call a lexicon-grammar. J Actually, the shape of interrogative pronouns: qu~ (who), que-quoi (what) has been used to define a formal notion of object. 4 Not all properties are relevant to each of the 10~000 verbs. For example, the properties of clitics associated to object complements are irrelevant to intransitive verbs."]},{"title":"275 i!tt I","paragraphs":["dt~-, ='eml:~l,¢ - - - ='em~ 4- -+ + 4- 4. - ;'e~lmmmr +-4.4-+ b~km - + ÷ - -- :=pkmr + - - - m f~ + .... +-4\"4-4---- +-+- +- -- +-+- +-++ @--- +--- N I :tz i z I =\" Iz I z I z I =. }; -4\"- ---+---+- ..... +- -","+!","4= + .... +-+--i","4= ++-@-+-4\"--","o==u~ ++-+-++ 4\"+--+-++","--4--","e=","- -+---4-I","de - -÷-4---i","4= -÷---+-+-- .I > I~. z:lz~"]},{"title":"-ii","paragraphs":["+ ÷ ÷ + - -]rm~","+","+ - + -","+","- 4. .... ,~=","-ear~"]},{"title":"2-+;;-- .++'-*- +","paragraphs":["; - 4.-@- -l|uW dkw==¢ + .... + + Intransitive Verbs (From Boons.

Also, we have not observed a single example of verbs with 30blects according to our definition.","In 2. and 3. we will make more precise the lexicel nature of the Nl's attached to the verbs.","The signs in a row of the matrix provides the syntactic paradigm of a verb, that is, the sentence forms into which the verb may enter. The lexicon-grammar is in computer form. Thus, by sorting the rows of signs, one can construct equivalence classes for verbs: Two verbs are in the same class if their two rows of signs are identical.","We have obtained the following result: for 10,000 verbs there are about 8,000 classes. On the average, each class contains 1.25 verb. This statistical result can easily be strengthened. When one studies the classes that contain more than one verb, it is always possible to find syntactic properties not yet in the matrix and that will separate the verbs. Hence, it our description were extended, each verb would have • unique syntactic paradigm.","Thus, the correspondence between a verb morpheme end the set of sentence forms where it may occur is one-to-one.","Another way of stating this result is by saying that structures depend on individual lexical elements, which leads to the following representation of structures: N O eat N 1 N o owe N 1 to N 2 We still use class symbols to describe noun phrases, but specific verbs must appear in each structure. Class symbols of verbs are no longer used, since they cannot determine the syntactic behsviour of individual verbs. The nature of the lexicon-grammar should then become clearer. An entry of the lexicon-grammar of verbs is • simple sentence form with an explicit verb appearing in • row. In general, the decleretive sentence is taken as the representative element of the equivalence class of structures corresponding to the \"+\" signs of a row.","The lexicon-grammar suggests a new component for parsing algorithms. This component is limited to elementary sentences. It includes the following steps: - (A) Verbs are morphologically recognized in the input string. - (B) The dictionary is looked up, that is, the space of the lexicon-grammar that contains the verbs is searched for the input verbs. - (C) A verb being located in the matrix, its rows of signs provide a set of sentence forms. These dictionary forms are matched with the input string. This algorithm is mcomplete in several respects: - In step (C). matching one of the dictionary shapes with the input string may involve another component of the grammar. The structures represented in the lexicon-grammar are elementary structures, subject only to \"unary\" transformations, in the sense of Harris' transformations or of early generative grammar (Chomsky 1955). Binary or generalized transformations apply to elementary sentences and may change their appearance in the sentence under analysis (e.g. conjunction reduction). As a consequence, their effect may have to be taken into account in the matching process."]},{"title":"276","paragraphs":["Looking up the matrix dictionary may result in the finding of several entries with same form (homographs) or of several uses of a given entry. We will see that these situations are quite common. in general, more than one pattern may match the input, mulbple paths of analysis are thus generated and require book keeping.","We will come back to these aspects of syntactic computation. We now present two other components of the lexicon-grammar of simple sentences. 2 IDIOMS","The sentences we just described can be called free sentences, for the lexlcal choices Of nouns in each noun phrase N i has certain degrees of freedom. We use this distributional feature to separate free from frozen sentences, that is, from sentences with an idiomatic part.","The main difference between free end frozen sentences can be stated in terms of the distributions of nouns: - in a frozen nominal posibon, a change of noun either changes the meaning of the expression to an unrelated expression as in to lay down one's arms vs to lay down one's feet or else, the variant noun does not introduce any difference in meaning (up to stylistic differences), as m to put someone off the (scent. track, trail) or else. an idiomatic noun appears at the same level as ordinary nouns of the distribution, and the general meaning of the (free) expression is preserved, as in to miss (an opportunity, the bus] - in a free position, a change of noun introduces a change of meaning that does not affect the general meaning of the whole sentence. For example, the two sentences The boy ate the apple My sister ate the pie that differ by distributional changes in subject and object positions have same general meaning: changes can be considered to be localized to the arguments of the predicate or function with constant meaning EAT.","We have systematically described the idiomatic sentences of French, making use of the framework developed for the free sentences. Sentential idioms have been classified according to the nature (frozen or not) of their arguments (subject and complements). With respect to the structures of Table 2, a new classificatory feature has been introduced: the poaslbdity for a frozen noun or noun phrase to accept a free noun complement. Thus, for example, we built two classes CP1 and CPN corresponding to the two types of constructions N O V Prep C 1 :: Jo plays on words N O V Prep Nhum'a C 1 =: Jo got on Sob's nerves The symbol C refers to a frozen nominal position and Prep stands for preposition.","Although frozen structures tend to undergo less transformations than the free forms, we found that every transformation that applies to a free structure also applies to some frozen structures. There is no qualitative difference between free and frozen structures from the syntactic point of view. As a consequence, we can use the same type of representation: a matrix where each idiomatic combination of words appears in a row and each sentence shape m a column (of.

There are examples such as They went astray • where words such as astray cannot be found io any other syntactically unrelated sentence; notice that the causative sentence The# led them astray Is considered as syntactically related. In this case, the expression can be direcly recogmzed by dictionary look-up. But such examples are rare.

Rather, the nature of frozen forms suggests simultaneous searches for the composing words.","About the diHerence between free and frozen sentences, we have observed that many free sentences (if not all) have highly restricted nominal posdlons. Consider for example the entry N O smoke N t =n Jo smokes the finest tobacco In the direct object complement, one will find few other nouns: nouns of other smoking material, objects made of smoking material such as cigarette, cigar, pipe and brand names for these oblects. This is a common situation with technical verbs. Such examples suggest that, semantically at least, the nominal arguments are halted to one noun, which comes close to having the status of frozen expression. Thus, to smoke would have here one complement, perhaps tobacco, and all other nouns occurring m its place would be brought in by syntactic operations. We consider that this situatmn is quite general although not always transparent. Our analysis of free elementary sentences has shown that when subjects and Oblects allow wide variations for their nouns, then well defined syntactic operations account for the variation: - separation of entries: For example, there is another verb N O smoke Nt, as m They smoke meat, and a third one: N O smoke N 1 out in They smoked the room out; or consider the verb to eat in Rust ate both rear wings of my car This verb will constitute an entry different of the one in to eat lamb;","various zerolngs: The following sentence pairs will be related by different deletions: Bob ale s nrce preparation = Bob ale a nice preparation of lamb Bob ate a whole bakery = Bob ate a whole bakery of apple pies","Other operations introduce nouns in syntactic positions where they are foreign to the semantic distributions, among them are","ralsmg operations, which induce distributional differences such as I imagined the situation I imagined the bridge destroyed situation is the \"natural\" direct oblect of to imagine, while brrdge ts derived; - other restructuration operations (Gulllet, Lecl~re 1981), as between the two sentences This confirmed Bib's opinion of Jo This confirmed Bob m his opinion of Jo","Although the full lexicon of French has not yet been analyzed from this point of view, we can plausibly assert that a targe class of nommal distributions could be made semantically regular by using Z.S. Harris' account of elementary distributions, namely, by determining a basic form for each meaning, for example A person eats food with undetermined human subject and characteristic object, and by"]},{"title":"278","paragraphs":["introducing classificatory sentences that describe universe: (The boy, My sister) ia • person, etc. the semantic (A pie, This cake) is food, etc.","Classificatory and basic sentences are combined by syntactic operations such as relatlvizstion: The person who is the boy eats food which is this pie WH-ia deletion: The person the boy eats food this pie redundancy removal: The boy eats this pie In this way, the semantic variations are explicitly attributed to lexical variations, and not to intuitive abstract features, that is, arbitrary features, or acmes or the like. The requirement of using WORDS in such descriptions is a crucial means for controlling the construction of an empirically adequate linguistic system. In this respect, one is led to categorizing words by evaluating actual classificatory sentences. Hence, all the knowledge linguistically expressible (i.e. in terms of words) is represented by both the basic and the classificatory sentences. A good deal of the inferences that one has to draw in order to understand sentences era contained in the derivations that lead to the seemingly simple sentences.","From a formal point of view, the entries of the lexicon-grammar become much more specifi~ We have eliminated class symbols altogether, replacing them by specific nouns <5>. Entries are then of the type {persen) 0 eat (food) 1 (person) 0 ;We (ObleCt) 1 to (person) 2 (per=ran) 0 k~ck the bucket An application of this representation of simple sentences is the treatment of certain metaphors. Consider the two sentences (1) Jo filled the turkey with truffles (2) Jo filled his report with poor jokes (1) is a proper use of fo fill, while (2) is • metaphoric or figurative meaning. The properties of these sentences vary according to the lexical choices in the complements {Boons 1971). For example, the with-complement that can be occupied by an internal noun in the proper meaning can be omitted: Jo tilled the turkey with • certain filling = Jo filled the turkey 5 It is doubtful that actual nouns such as food will be available in the language for each distribution of each entry, but then, expressions such as smoking stuff can be used {in the object of to smoke), again avoiding the use ot abstract features. iThis is not the case in the figurative meaning: *Jo filled hie report How to represent (1) and (2) is a problem in terms of number of entries. On the one hand, the two constructions have common syntactic and semantic features, on the other, they ere significantly different in form and content. Setting up two entries is • solution, but not a satisfactory one, since both entries are left unrelated. A possible solution in the framework of lexicon-grammars is to consider having just one entry: N O fill N 1 with N 2 and to specify N t lexJcally by means of columns of the matrix. For example N 1 =: food N t =: text 11~en, the content of N 2 is largely determined end has to be roughly of the type N 2 =: stuffing N 2 =: eubtext An inclusion relation <6> holds between the two complements. We can write for this relation N 2 is in N 1","But now, in our parsing procedure, we have to compensate for the tact that in the lexicon-grammar, the nouns that are represented in the free positions ere not the ones that in general occur in the input sentences. In consequence, occurrences of nouns will have to undergo a complex process of identification that will determine whether they have been introduced by syntactic operations (e.g. restructuration), or by chains of substitutions defined by classificatory sentences, or by both processes. 3. SUPPORT AND OPERATOR VERB8","We have alluded to the tact that only • certain class of contences could be reduced to entries of the lexicon-gremmr as presented in 1. and 2. We will now give examples of simple sentences that have structures different of the structures of free and frozen sentences, in sentences such as (1) Her remarks made no difference (2) Her remarks have some (importance for, influence) on Jo (3) Her remarks ere in contradiction with your plan it is difficult to argue that the verbs to make, to have and to be in semantically select their subjects end complement& Rather, these verbs should be considered as auxiliaries. The predicative element is here the nominal form in complement position. This intuition can be given a formal basis. Let us look at nominalizationa as being relations between two simple sentences (Z.S. Harris 1964), as in 6 This relation is an extension of the Vaup relations of 3. To fill could be considered as a (causative) Vop."]},{"title":"279","paragraphs":["Max walked : Max look a walk Her remarks are important for Jo = Her remarks are of a certain importance for Jo = Her remarks have s certain importance for Jo Jo resembles Max : Jo has a certain resemblance with Max = Jo (bears. carries) a certain resemblance with Max -- There is a certain resemblance between Jo and Max It is then clear that the roots walk, important and resemble select the other noun phrases. We call support verbs (Vsup) the verbs in such sentences that have no selectional function, Some support verbs are semantically neutral, others introduce modal or aspectual meanings, as for example in Bob loves Jo = Bob Is in love with Jo = Bob fell in love with Jo = Bob has a deep love for Jo to tall, as other motion verbs do, introduces an inchoative meaning. In this example, the mare semantm relation holds between Bob and love, and the support verbs simply add their meaning to the relation.","If we use s dependency tree to schematize the relations in simple sentences, we can oppose ordinary verbs with one obleCt and support verbs of superficially identical structures such as in figure 1: described Ma~x love Bo b's~~ Jo Two problems arise in connection with the distribution of support verbs: - s noun or a nommalized verb accepts a certain set of support verbs and this set varies with each nominal; not every verb is a support verb; thus in the sentence (4) Max described Bob'a love for Jo to describe is not a Vsup. The question is then to delimit the set of Vaups, if such a set can be isolated, or else to provide general conditions under which s verb acts as a Vaup,","One of the structural features that separates support verbs from other verbs is the possibility of clefting noun complements. For example, for Jo is a noun complement of the same type in both structures, but we observe *If is for Jo that Max described Bob'a love It is for Jo that Bob has a deep love The main semantic difference between the two constructions lies in the cyclic structure of the graph. This cyclic structure is also found in more complex sentences such as (5) This note put her remarks in contradiction with your plan (6) Bob gave a certain importance to her remarks Both verbs fo put and to give have two complements, exactly as in sentences such as (7) Bob put (the book) 1 (in the drawe~| 2 (8) Bob gave (e book) t (to Jo) 2 Whde in (7) and (8), there is no evidence of any formal relation between both complements, in (5) and (6) we find dependencies already observed on support verbs (cf. figure 2). gave B°~msrks has"]},{"title":"BJ ove","paragraphs":["put The notre ~ her remarks, in contra~ctmn"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["with your plan Figure I Figure 2"]},{"title":"280","paragraphs":["The verbs to put and to give are semantically minimal, for they only introduce s causative and/or an agentive argument with respect to the sentence with Vsup. We call such verbs operator verbs (Vop). There are other operator verbs that add various modaltties to the minimal meanings, as in The note introduced a contradiction between her remarks and your plan Bob attributed a certain importance to her remarks Other syntactic shapes are lound: Bob credsted her remarks with a certain importance","Again, the set of nouns (supported by o Vsup) to which the Vops apply vary from verb to verb. As a consequence, we have to represent the distributions of Vsups and Vops with respect to nominals by means of a matrix such as the one in Table 4'. In each row, we place a noun and each column contains a support verb or an operator verb. A preliminary classification of Ns (and V-ns) has been made in terms of a few elementary support verbs (e.g. to have, to be Prep).","In a sense, this representation is symmetrical with the representation of free sentences. With free sentences, the verb is taken as the central item of the sentence. Varying then the nouns allowed with the verb does not change fundamentally the meaning of the corresponding sentences. With support verbs, the central item is a noun. Varying then the support verbs only introduces a distributional-like change in meaning.","The recognition procedure has to be modified, in order to account for this component of the language: - first, the took-up procedure must determine whether s verb is an ordinary verb (i.e. an entry found in a row of the lexicon-grammar) or a Vaup or a Vop, which are to be found in columns; - simultaneously, nouns have to be looked up in order to cheek their combination with support verbs. 4. CONCLUSION","We have shown that simple sentence structures were of varied types. At the same time, we have seen that their representation in terms of the entries of traditional \"linear\" dictionaries, that is, In terms of words alphabetically or otherwise ordered, is inadequate. An improvement appears to involve the look-up of two-dimensional patterns, for example the matrices we proposed for frozen sentences and their generalization to support verbs and operator verbs. More generally, syntactic structures are determined by combinat|ons of a verb morpheme with one or more noun morpheme(s). Hence, the general way to access the lexicon will have to be through the selectional matrix of Tables 3 and 4, In practice, syntactic computations are context-free computations in natural language processing. Context-free algorithms have been studied in many respects by computer scientists, theoreticians and speciahsts ot programming languages. The principles of these algorithms are clearly understood and currently in use, even for natural languages where new problems arise because of the numerous ambiguities and the various terminologies attached to each theoretical viewpoint.","The tact that context-free recognition is a mastered technique has certainly contributed to the shaping of the grammars used in automatic parsing. The numerous sample grammars presented so far are practically all context-tree. There is also a deep linguistic reason for building context-free grammars: natural languages use embedding processes and tend to avoid discontinuous structures.","Much less attention has been peJd to the complex syntactic phenomena occurring Jn simple sentences and to the organization of the lexicon. The tact that we could not separate the syntactic properties of verbs from their lexical features has led us to construct a representation for linguistic phenomena which is more specJhc than the current context-free models. A context-free component will still be useful in the parsing procesS, but it will be relevant only to embedded structures found in complex sentences, with not much incidence on meaning,","To summarize, the syntactic patterns are determined by pairs (verb, noun): - the frozen sentence N O k~ck the bucket Js thus entirely specified, while the pair (take, bull) needs to be disambiguated by the second complement by the horns, requiring thus a more complex device to be identified;","(take, walk) and (take, food) are support sentences, so are (have, faith) and (have, food);","the verbs have, kick and take together with concrete obiect select ordinary sentence forms.","But the selectional process for structures may not be direct. The words in the previously discussed pairs may not appear in the input text. Words appearing in the input are then related to the words in the selectJonal matrix by: cfassifJcatlonal relations: food classifies cake, soup, etc. concrete obiect classifies ball, chair, etc. - relations between support sentences, such as Jo (had, took,threw out) some food Jo (took, was out for, went out for) a walk Jo (has, keeps, looses) faith in Bob relations between support and operator sentences: Thie gave to Jo faith in Bob","All these relations in fact add a third dimension to the selectional matrix. The complete selectional device is now a complex network of relations that cross-relates the entries. It will have to be organized in order to optimize the speed of parsing algorithms."]},{"title":"281","paragraphs":["REFERENCES","Boons, J.-P, 1971.
