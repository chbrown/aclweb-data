{"sections":[{"title":"i","paragraphs":["Syntactic Processing","Martin Kay Xerox Pals Alto Research Center In computational linguistics, which began in the 1950's with machine translation, systems that are based mainly on the lexicon have a longer tradition than anything else---for these purposes, twenty five years must be allowed to count as a tradition. The bulk of many of the early translation systems was made up by a dictionary whose entries consisted of arbitrary instructions In machine language. In the early 60's, computational llnsulsts---at least those with theoretical pretentlons---abandoned this way of doing business for at least three related reasons: First systems containing large amounts of unrestricted machine code fly in the face of •II principles of good programming practice. The syntax of the language in which linguistic facts are stated is so remote from their semantics that the opportunities for error are very great and no assumptions can be made •bout the effects on the system of Invoking the code associated wlth any given word. The systems became virtually unmaintainabl• and eventually fell under their own weight. Furthermore, these failings were magnified as soon as the attempt was made to impose more structure on the overall system. A general backtracking sohsme. for example, could •11 too easily be thrown into complete disarray by an instruction in s singl• dictionary entry that affected the control stack. Second. the power of general, and particularly nondeterminlstlc, algorithms In syntactic analysis came to be appreciated, if not overappreciated. Suddenly. It was no longer necessary to seek local criteria on which to ensure the correctness of individual decisions made by the program provided they were covered by more global criteria. Separation of program and linguistic data became an overriding principle and. since it was most readily applied to syntactic rules, these became the maln focus of attention. The third, and doubtless the most important, reason for the change was that syntactic theories in which • grammar was seen as consisting of • set of rules. preferably including transformational rules, captured the Imagination of the most influential nonoomputational linguists, and computational linguists followed suite if only to maintain theoretical respsotablllty. In short, Systems with small sets of rules in • constrained formalism and simple lexlcal entries apparently made for simpler. cleaner, and more powerful programs while setting the whole enterprise on a sounder theoretical footing. The trend is now In the opposite direction. There has been a shift of emphasis away from highly structured systems of complex rules as the principle repository of Information •bout the syntax of • language towards • view In which the responsibility ia distributed among the lexicon, semantic parts of the linguistic description, and • cognitive or strategic component, Concomitantly. Interest has shifted from algorithms for syntactic analysis and generation, tn which the control structure and the exact sequence of events are paramount, to systems in which • heavier burden Is carried by the data structure and in which the order o~ events is • matter of strategy. This new trend is • common thread running through several of the papers in this section, Various techniques for syntactic analysis, not•sly those based on some form of Augmented Transition Network (ATN). represent grammatical facts In terms of executabl• machine code. The danger• to which thin exposed the earlier system• •r• avoided by ln~i~tinR that this code by compiled from 8tat•ments in a torm•llsm that allows only for lingutsticaJly motivated operations on carefully controlled parts of certain data structures. The value of nondeterminl•tic procedures is undlmlni•hed, but it has become clear that It does not rest on complex control structures and a rigidly determined sequence of events. In discussing the syntactic processors that we have developed, for example, Ron Kaplan and I no longer flnd it useful te talk in terms of a parsing algorithm. There •re two central data structures, a chart and •n agenda. When additions tO the chart slve rise to certain kinds of configurations in which some element cont•t,s executable code, • task is created and placed on the • good•. Tasks are removed from the agenda and executed in an order determined by strategic considerations which constitute part cf the linguistic theory. Strategy can determine only the order in which alternative analyses are produced. ~any traditional distinctions, such as that between topdown and bottom-up processing, no longer apply to the procedure as a whole but only to partlcuisr strategies or their parts. Thls looser or|snlzatlon of programs for syntactic processing came. at least in pert. from e generally felt need to break down the boundaries that had traditionally separated morphological, syntactic, and semantic processes. Research dlrectad towards speech understanding systems was quite unable to r•spent these boundaries because, in the face of unc,rtair data. local moves in the analysis on one lever required confirmation from other levels so that s common data structure for •II levels of analysis and • schedule that could change continually were of the eseenoe. Puthermore. there was a mouvement from within the artificial-intelligence community to eliminate the boundaries because, frnm that perspective, they lacked sufficient theoretical Justification. Zn speech research In particular, and artificial Intelligence in general, the lexicon took on an important Position if only because it la th,~-~e that the units or meaning reside. Recent pro ..sols t, linguistic theory involve s larger role for the lexicon. Eresnan (1978) has argued persuasively that the full mechanism of transformational rules can. and should, be dispensed with except in cases Of Uhbountte~ movement such me relatlvlutlon and toploallast~cn, The remaining members of the familiar ltst 0¢ transformations can be handled by weaker devices in the lexlcon and, since they all turn out to ~e lexically |•yarned. this IS the appropriate place t~ state the information. Against this background, the papers that follow, different though they are in many usye. constitute fairly coherent set.
