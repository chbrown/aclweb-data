Small","Department of Computer Science University of Maryland College Park, Maryland 20742 This paper describes an approach to conceptual analysis and understanding of natural language in which linguistic knowledge centers on individual words, and the analysis mechanisms consist of interactions among distributed procedural experts representing that knowledge. Each word expert models the process of diagnosing the intended usage of a particular word in context. The Word Expert Parser performs conceptual analysis through the Interactlons of tl~e individual experts, which ask questions and exchange information in converging on a single mutually acceptable sentence meaning. The Word Expert theory is advanced as a better cognitive model of natural language understanding than the traditional rule-based approaches. The Word Expert Parser models parts o~ tSe theory, and the important issues of control and representation that arise in developing such a model [orm the basis of the technical discussion. An example from the prototype LISP implementation helps explain the theoretical results presented. [. Introduction","Computational understanding of natural language requires complex Interactions among a variety of distinct yet redundant mechanisms. The construction of a computer program to perform such a task begins with the development of an organizational framework which Inherently .incorporates certain assumptions about the nature ot these processes and the environment in which they take place. Such cognitive premises affect nro?oundly the scope and substance of computational ~nalysis for comprehension as found in the program.","This paper describes a theory of conceptual parsing which considers knowledge about language to be distributed across a collection of procedural experts centered on individual words. Natural language parsing with word experts entails several new hypotheses about the organization and representation of linguistic and pragmatic knowledge for computational language comprenension. The Word Expert Parser [1] demonstrates hpw the word expert qTt~T~ed w£~h certain ocher choices oaseo on previous work, affect structure and process in a cognitive model of parsing.","The Word Expert Parser is a cognitive model of conceptual language analysis in which the unit of ltngu~stic knowledge is the word and the fqcu~ o~ research ts the set or processes unoerlyinR comprehension. The model is aimed directly at problem~ of word sense ambiguity and idiomatic expressions, and in greatly generalizing the notion of wora sense, promotes these issues to a central place in the study of language parsing. Parsing models typically cope unsatisfactorily with the wide heterogeneity of usages of particular words. If a sentence contains a standard form of a word, it can usually be parsed; if it involves a less prevalent form which has a different part of speech, perhaps it too can be parsed. Disti.nguishing amen 8 the ~any senses of a common vero, adjective, or pronoun, tar example, or correctly translating idioms are rarely possible,","At the source of this difficulty is the reliance on rule-based formalisms, whethar syntactic or semantic (e.g.. cases), which attempt to capture ~he linguistic contributions inherent in constituent chunks or sentences that consist of more than single words. A crucial assumption underlying work on the Word Expert Parser is that the ~undamental unit of linguistic Knowledge is the word. and that understanding its sense or role in a particular context is the central parsing process.

At the closing of the concept bin, the \"into expert resumes, marks its concept as a location, and terminates. With all the word experts completed and all concept bins closed, the expert for \".'\" runs and completes the parse. The concept level workspace now contains five concepts: a picture concept designating an intellectual philosopher, an event concept representing the throwing action, another picture concept describing a fruit pit which came from a peach, a setting concept representing a location, and the picture concept which describes precisely the nature of this location. Work on the mechanism to determine the schematic roles of the concepts has just begun, and is described briefl~ later. A program trace that shows the actions ot the Nora Expert Parser on the example just presented is available on request. 3. Structure of the Model","The organization of the parser centers around data repositories on two levels -- the sentence level workspace contains a word bin for each word (and sub-lexical morpheme) of the input and the concept level workspace contains a concept bin (described above) for each concept referred to in the input sentence. A third level of processing, the schema level workspaee, while not yet implemented, will contain a schema for each conceptual action of the input sentence. All actions affecting the contents of these data bins are carried out by the word expert processes, one of which is associated with each word bin in the wo rkspace. In addition to this first order information about lexical and conceptual objects, the parser contains a central tableau of control state descriptions available to any expert that can make use of self referential knowledge about its own processing or the states of processing of other model components. The availability of such control state information improves considerably both the performance and the psychological appeal of the model -- each word expert attempting to disambiguate its contextual usage knows precisely t~e progress of its neighbors and the state of convergence (or the lack thereof) of the entire parsing process.","Word Experts","The principal knowledge structure of the model is the word sense discrimination expert. A word expert represents the the linguistic knowledge required to dlsamblguate the meaning of a single word in any context. Although represented cumputationslly as coroutlnes, these experts differ considerably from ad hoc LISP programs and have approximately the same ~elatlon ~o LISP as an augmented transition network [15] grammar. ° 2use as rh~ graphic represeptatlon of an augmented transltlon networ~ aemonstrates the basic control paradigm of the ATN parsing approach, a graphic representation for word experts exists which embodies its functional framework. Each word expert derives from a branching discrimination structure called a word sense discrimination network or sense net. A sense nec consists of an ordered se~ of • /~tr~Ti~g (the nodes of the network), and for each one, the set of possible answers to that question (the branches emanating from each node). Traversal of a sense network represents the process of converging on a single contextual usage of a word. The terminal nodes of a sense net represent distinct word senses of the word modeled by the network. A sense net for the word \"heavy\" appears in part (a) of Figure 2. Examination of this network reveals that four senses are represented -- the three adjective usages shown in Figure 1 plus the numinal sense of \"thug\" as In \"Joe's heavy told me to beat it.\"","Expert Representation","The network representation of a word expert leaves out certain computational necessities of actually using it for parsing. A word expert has two fundamental activities. (I) An expert asks questions about the lexical and conceptual data being amassed by its neighbors, the control states of various model components, and more general issues requiring common sense or knowledge of the physical world. (2) In addition, at each node an expert performs actions to affect the lexical and conceptual contents of the workspaces, the control states of itself, concept bins,","6An ATN without arbitrarily complex LISP computations on each arc and at each node, that is.","7In addition to common sense knowledge of the physical world, this could include information about the plot, characters, or focus of a children's story, or in a specialized domain such as medical diagnosis [17], could include highly domain specific knowledge. and the parser as a whole, and the model's expectations. The current procedural representation of the word expert for \"heavy\" appears as part (b) of Figure 2.","Each word expert process Includes three components -- a declarative header, a start node, and a body. The header provides a description of the expert's behavior for purposes of inter-expert constraint forwarding. If sense discrimination by a word expert results in the knowledge that a word to its right, either not yet executed or suspended, must map to a specific sense or conceptual category, then it should constrain it to do so, thus helping it avoid unnecessary processing or fallacious reasoning. Since word experts are represented as processes, constraining an expert consists of altering the pointer to the address at which it expects to continue execution. Through its descriptive header, an expert conditions this activity and insures that it takes place without disastrous consequences.","Each node in the body of the expert has a type deslgnated by a letter following the node name. either Q (question), A (action), S (suspend), or T (terminal). By tracing through the question nodes (treating the others as vacuous except for their gore pointers), a sense network for each word expert process can be derived. The graphical framework of a word expert (and thus the questions it asks) represents its principal linguistic task of word sense disamblguatlon. Each question node has a type, shown following the Q in the.node -- MC tmultiple choice), C (conditional), YN (yes/no/, and PI (posslble/Imposslble). In the example expert for \"heavy\", node nl represents a conditional query into the state of the entire parsing process, and n?de n[2 a multiple choice question involving the conceptual nature of the word to \"heavy\"s right in the input sentence. b Multiple choice questions typically delve into the aslc relations among ob3ects ann actions zn the world. For example, the question asked at node n12 of the \"heavy\" expert is typical:","\"Is the object to my right better described as","an artistic object a a form of precipitation, or","a physical object? Action nodes in the \"heavy\" expert perform such tasks as determining the concept bin to which it contributes, and pqstin 8 expectations for the word to its right. In terms ot its side effects, the \"heavy\" expert is fairly simple. A full account of the word expert representation language will be available next year [12].","Expert Questions","The basic structure of the Word Expert Parser depends principally on the role of individual word experts in affectlug.(1) each other:s actions and ~2) the neclaratlve result or computatlonal analysis. ~xperts affect each other by posting expectations on the central bulletin board, constraining each other, changing control states of model components (most notably themselves), and augmenting data. structures in. the workspeces. ° .They contribute to the conceptua£ ans ecnematlc result ot toe parse by contrlbuting object names, descrlptions~ schemata, ane other useful data to the concept level workspace. To determine exactly what contributions .to make, i.e.j the accurate ones In the particular run-tlme context at handj the experts as~ questions ot various kinds about the processe sot the model and the world at large.","Four types of questions may be asked by an expert, and whereas some queries can be made in more than one way, the several question types solicit different kinds of information. Some questions requlre fairly involved inference to be answered adequately, and others demand no more than simple register lookup. This variety corresponds well, in my opinion, with human processing involved in conceptual analysis. Certain contextual clues to meaning are structural; taking advantage of them requires solel~ knowledge of the state of the parsing process (e.g., 'building a noun prase\"). Other clues subtly present themselves through more global evidence, usually having to do with linking together high order information about the specific domain at hand. In story comprehension, this involves the plot, characters, focus of attention, and general social psychology as well as common sense knowledge about the world. Understanding texts uealing with specialized subject matter requires knowledge about that particular subject, other subjects related to it, and of course, common sense. The questions asked by a word expert in arriving at the correct contextual interpretation of a word probe sources of both kinds of information, and take different forms.","8The blackboard of the Hearsay speech understanding system [~6]. ~s anelggous to the entire wormspace ot the parser, xnoluaxng the word bins, concept bins, and oulletin board. ii"]},{"title":"(~","paragraphs":["'s the current~ oncept of type) \"viceure\"? / yes"]},{"title":"~","paragraphs":["es the word on~ right contribute to the current / ,concept? ,/ .

After deciding on a concept, the principal role of a (content) word expert is to discriminate among the possibly many remaining senses of the word. Note that a good deal of this disambiguation may take place during the initial phase of concept determination. After asking enough questions to discover some piece of conceptual data, this data augments what already exists in the word's concept 5in, including declarative structures put there both by itself and by the other lexical participants in that concept.

Such a mechanism can be viewed in an entirely analogous fashion to the mechanisms just described for performln 8 local disamblguation of word senses. Rather ~han word experts, however, the experts on this level are conceptual in nature. The concept level thus becomes the main level of activity and a new level, call it the schema level workspace, turns into the ma~n repository rot inferred Information. When a concept bin has closed, a concept expert is retrieved from a disk file, and initialized. If it is an event concept, its function is to fill its conceptual cases with settings and pictures; if it is a setting or picture, it must aetermlne its schematic role. The activity on this level, therefore, involves higher order processing than sense discrimination, but occurs in Just about the same way. The ambiguities involved in mapping known concepts into conceptual case schemata appear identical to those having to do with ma2ping words into concepts. Discovering that the word \"pit maps in a certain context to the notion of a \"fruit pit\" requires the same abilities and knowledge as realizing that \"the red house\" maps in some context to the notion of \"a ~ocation for smoking pot and listening to records\". The implementation of the mechanisms to carry out this next level of inferential disambiguation has already begun. It should be quite clear that this schematic level is by no means the end of the line -- active expert-baseo p~ot following and general text understanding flt nicely Int? the word expert framework and constitute its loglca~ extension. 4. Summary and Conclusions","The Word Expert Parser is a theory of o rganization and cgntro ~ for a conceptual, lansuage an@.~yzer. Th~ contro~ envlrosment ts cnaracter~zeo ny a co£~ectlon ot generator-like coroutines, called word experts, which cooperatively arrive at a conceptual interpretation of an ~nput sentence. Many torms of linguistic ann non-lln~uistlc knowledge are available to these experts In performing their task, including control state Knowledge and knowledge of the world, and by eliminating all but the mpst persistent forms of ambiguity, the parser models numan processing.","This new model of parsin£ claims a number of theoretical advantages: (I) Its representations of linguistic knowledge reflect the enormous redundancy in natural languages -- without this redundancy in the model, the inter-expert handshaking (seen in many..forms in the example parse) would not be possible. ~z) ~ne model suggests some interesting approaches to language acquisition. Since much of a word expert's knowledge Is encoded in a branching discrimination structure,, addlng new information about a word involves the addition oz a new branch. This branch would be placed in the expert at the point where the contextual clues for dlsambiguatlng the new usage differ from those present for a known usage. (3) Idiosyncratic uses of langua8@ are easily e ncooea, s~nce the wore expert provides a c~esr way to no so. These uses are indistinguishable from other uses in their encodings in the model. (4) The parser represents a cognltively plausible model or se~uentlal coroutine-like processing in human ~anguage understanding. The organization of linguistic knowledge around the word, rather than the rewrite rule, motivates interesting conjectures about the flow of control In a human language understander.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","I would llke to thank Chuck Rieger for his Insights, encouragement, and general manner.
