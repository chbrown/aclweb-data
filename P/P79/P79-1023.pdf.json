EUFID is a natural language frontend for data management systems. It is modular and table driven so that it can be interfaced to different applications and data management systems. It allows a user to query his data base in natural English, including sloppy syntax and misspellings. The tables contain a data management system view of the data base, a semantic/syntactic view of the application, and a mapping from the second to the first. We are entering a new era in data base access. Computers and terminals have come down in price while salaries have risen. We can no longer make users spend a week in class to learn how to get at their data in a data base. Access to the data base must be easy, but also secure. In some aspects, ease and security go together because, when we move the user away from the physical characteristics of the data base, we also make it easier to screen access. EUFID is a system that makes data base access easy for an untrained user, by accepting questions £n natural English. It can be used by anyone after a few minutes of coaching. If the user gets stuck, he can ask EUFID for help. EUFID is a friendly but firm interface which includes security features. If the user goes too far in his questions and asks about areas outside of his authorized data base, EUFID will politely misunderstand the question and quietly log the security violation. One beauty of EUFID is its flexibility. It is written in FORTRAN for a PDP-II/70. With minor modifications it could run on other minl-computers or on a large computer. It is completely table driven so ~hat it can handle different data bases, different views of the same data base, or the same view of a restructured data base. It can be interfaced with various data management systems--currently it can access a relational data base via INGRES or a network data base via WWDMS. EUFID is an outgrowth of the SDC work on a conceptual processor which was started in 1973. 1 It is now demonstrable with a wide range of sentences questioning two data bases. It is still a growing system with new power being added. In the following sections we will explore the features that make EUFID so flexible and easy to use. The main features are: • natural English • help • semantic tables • data base tables s mapping tables s intermediate language • security i. NATURAL ENGLISH EUFID has a dictionary containing the words that the users may use when querying the data base. The dictionary describes how words relate to each other and to the data base. Unlike some other natural language systems, EUFID has the words in the sentence related to fields in the data base by the time the sentence is \"understood.\" More will be said about this process in the section on semantic tables. EUFID is forgiving of spelling and grammar errors. If i~ does not have a word in the dlctionary t but has a word that is close in spelling, it will ask the user if a substitution can be made. It also can \"understand\" a sentence even when all words are not present or ~ome words are not grammatically correct. For example, any of these queries are acceptable: \"What companies ship goods?\" \"Companies?\" (list all companies) \"What company shop goods?\"","(\"shop\" will be corrected to \"ship\". The plural","\"companies\" will be assumed) Users are free to structure their input in any way that is natural to them as long as the subject matter covers what is in the data base. EUFID would interpret these questions in the same way: \"Center shipped heavy freight to what warehouses in 1976?\" \"What warehouses did Center ship heavy freight to in 1976?\" Each user may define personal synonyms if tile vocabulary in the dictionary is not rich enough for him. For example, for efficiency a user might prefer to use \"wh\" for \"warehouse\" and \"co\" for \"company\". Another user of the same data base might define \"co\" for \"count\". 2. HELP Basically, EUFID has only four commands. These are \"help\", \"synonym\" (to define a synonym), \"comment\" (to criticize EUFID), or \"quit\". These four commands are described in the help module as well as the general guidelines for questions. If the user hits an error while using EUFID, he wlll receive a sentence or two at his terminal which describes the problem. In some cases he will be asked for clarification or a new question as shown in these exchanges.","User: \"What are the names of female secretaries' children?\"","EUFID: \"Do you mean (i) female secretaries or (2) female children?\"","User: \"2\" or","User: \"What is the salary of the accounting department?\"","EUFID: '~e are unable to understand your question because \"salary of department\" is not meaningful. Please restate your question.\" If the description is not enough to clarify the problem, the user can ask for help. First, HELP will give a deeper description of the problem. If that is not enough, the user can ask for additional information which may include a llst of valid questions. 3. TABLES EUFID is application and data base independent. Thls independence is achieved by having three sets of tables-- the semantic dictionary tables, the data base tables, and the mapping tables which map from the semantic view to the data base. Conceivably, a single semantic view could map to two data bases that contain the same data but are accessed by different data management systems. 91 3.1 SEMANTIC TABLES The semantic view is defined by an application expert working with a EUFID expert. Together the 7 determine the ways chat a user mlghc want to talk about the data. From this, a llsC of words is developed and the basic sentence structures are defined. Words are classed as: entitles (e.g.,"]},{"title":"company)","paragraphs":["events (e.g., send) funcClons (after 1975) parrs of a phrase or idiom (map coordlnaCes) connectors (co) system words (the) anaphores (ic) two or more of the above (ship an enClCy plus","ship an event) An entity corresponds approximately co a noun and an event co a verb. Connectors are preposlClons which are dropped after the sentence is parsed. System words are conjunctions, auxiliaries, and decermlners whloh participate in determining meaning buc do noC relate co data base fields. Anaphores are words chac refer Co previous words and are replaced by them while parsln 8. Basically then, the only words chat relate co the items in the data base are entities, events, and funcclons. Entities and events are defined using a case structure representation which combines synCacclc and sm---clc information. Lexlcal items which may co-occur with an entity to form noun phrases, or wlch a verb co form verb phrases, fill cases on the enClCy or event.

The dace"]},{"title":"bus","paragraphs":["cables actually consist of two cables. The CAN table contains information about"]},{"title":"groups","paragraphs":["and dace iC ~a. A group (also called entity or record in ocher systems) is Idenclfled by the group name. A dare Icam in che CAN cable consists of Che data ices \"mine, che grOUp CO which IC belongs, a uniC code, an output Idenclflar, and some field type informaClon. Notably missing is anything about the byte wichln the record or the number of bytes. ~UFID accesses the dace base through s data management sysCom. Therefore, the dace can be reorganized ~rLChou¢ changing the EUFID cables aa long as the dace iCeml retain their names and chair groupings. The second data beam cable is the P~L cable which contains an encz 7 for each group with its links co ocher groups. For nscwork dace bases, cha link is the chain name for the primary chain chac connects master and derail records. For relational dace bases, every dace item pair in the two groups chac can have the same value is a potential link. 3.3 MAPPING TABLES The mapping cablu cell the program how to gec from the semantic nods, as found in the semantic dictionary, co the dace base field names. Each entry in the mapping table has a node name followed by two parts. The first parr describes the pacCsrn of cases and their fillers for chac node name. The second parr is called a production and ic gives the mapping for each case filler. A node may map co a node higher in the sentence tree before iC maps co a dace bus item. For exalpls, \"company name\" in the question '~at companies are locacnd in Los Angeles?\" may map to a group containing ge~sral company ~n~ormacion. However, \"company name\" in the question \"W~'mt companies ship Co Los Angeles?\" may map to a group concain~ng shipping company information. 92 Therefore, it is necessary to first map \"company name\" up to a higher node that determines the meaning. At the point where a unique node is determined, the mapping is made to a data item name via the CAN table. This data item name is used in the generatlon of the query to the data management system. 4. INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE EUFID is adaptable to most data management systems with-out changes to the central modules. This is accomplished by using an intermediate language (IL). The main parts of EUFID analyze the question, map it to data items, and then express the query in a standard language (IL). A translator is written for each data management system in order to rephrase the IL query into the language of the data management system. This is an extra step, but it greatly enhances EUFID's flexibility and portability. The intermediate language looks like a relational retrieval language. Translating it into QUEL is straightforward, but translating It to a procedural language such as WWDMS is very difficult. The example below shows a question with its QUEL and WWDMS equivalent.","QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES IN R&D?","INGRES IL:","RETRIEVE [JOB.EHFLOYEE,JOB.ADDRESS] WHERE (DIV.NAHE = \"R&D\") AND (DIV.JOB = JOB.NAHE) AND (JOB.NAME = \"SECRETARY\") AND (JOB.CLASS = \"EXECUTIVE\")","QUEL: range of div is dlv range of Job is Job retrieve (Job.employee,Job.address) where dlv.name = \"R&D\") and dlv. Job= Job.name and Job.name = \"secretary\" and Job.class = \"executive\"","W~ IL:","RETRIEVE [JOB.EMPLOYEE,JOB.ADDRESS] WHERE (DIV.DNAME - \"R&D\") AND (DIV.DIV JOB CH - JOB.DIV_JOBCH) AND (JOB.JNAME - \"SECRETARY\") AND (JOB.CLASS - \"EXECUTIVE\")","WW'DMS QUERY:","INVOKE 'WWDMS/PERSONNEL/ADF'","REPORT EUFID-1 ON FILE 'USER/PASSWD/EUFID' FOR TTY","QI.

RETRIEVE E-JOB","WHERE JNANE - \"SECRETARY\"","AND CLASS - \"EXECUTIVE\" WHEN R2 PRINT ql PRINT Q2 END 5. SECURITY EUFID protects the data base by removin B the user from direct access to the data management system and data base. At the most general level, EUFID will only allow users to ask questions within the semantics that are defined and stored in the dictionary. Some data items or views of the data could be omitted from the dlctlonazy. At a more specific level, EUFID controls access through a user profile table. Before a user can use EUFID, a 93 system person must define the user profile. This cable states which applications or subsets of applications are available to the user. One user may be allowed Co query everything that is covered by the semantic dictionary. Another user may be restricted in his access. The profile table is built by a concept graph editor. When a new login id is established for EUFID, the system person gives the application name of each application that the user may access. Associated with an applicatlon name is a set of file names of the tables for the application. If access is to be restricted, a copy of the CAN and mapping function tables is made. The copies are chanEed to delete the data items which the user is not to know about. The names of the restricted tables are then stored in the user's profile record. EUFID will still be able to find the words that are used co talk about the data item, but when EUFID maps the word to a removed data item it responds to the user as though the sentence could not be understood. 6. CONCLUSION EUFID is a system that makes data base access easy and direct for an end user so that he does not need to go through a specialist or learn a language to query his own data base, It is modular and table driven so that it can be interfaced with different data management systems and different applications. It is written in hlgh-level transportable languages to run on a small computer for maximum transportability. The case grammar that it uses allows flexibility in sentence syntax, ungrammatical syntaxj and fast, accurate parsing.
