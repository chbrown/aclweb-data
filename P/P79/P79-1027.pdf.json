Mann","USC Information Sciences Institute","When a document is to appear ill several dialects or closely related langu-Res, there are many practical reasons for adapting It from one to another rather than preparing separate translations. IIowever, manual adaptlon can be tedious, errorful, and requires a bidialectal adaptor (often unavailable) and/or qualified linguist (if available, very expensive). Computer-aided adaption might be an alternative, but Is it feasible to write a computer program which contributes enough to be worth the bother and cost?","For the source dialect ($D) is provided a root dictionary and a suffix dictionary; each entry contains the string of characters by which that morpheme is recognized, morphological category, morphophonemic properties .... and for roots, the \"0 for,n. For each target dialect (TD) is provided a suffix dictionary, a list of the regular sound changes (RSC's) which when applied to a \"O root will yield the correct TI} reflex, and a list of pairs of roots not cognate in the SD and TD,","This paper describes an experiment in computattonally assisting tile adapt;on of text from one dialect of central Peruvian Quechua (a polysynthetic, al:glutinative. American Indian language) to ~everal others. The overall results are extremely encouraging: computer-aided dialect adaptton is feasible and has important advantages over entirely manual methods.","Bolow we describe the dialect situation, the data and processes of the experimental program, and a field test of text produced by the program.","Six dialects differing phonologically, lexically, and l;ran|n|atlcally were involved. The rich dlvcrsity of differences are dominated by a few kinds of systematic difference. The program treats these classes of difference separately rather than by a single method (such as string substitution): this requires a detailed analysis of the source dialect text. Examples of the kinds of d l fferences involved:","Phonolog.icah the reflexes of four proto-Ouechua ('O) phonemes"]},{"title":"('/~/'l~/'fMf/fl/)","paragraphs":["--in the government-mandated orthography-- are: Panao: tr ch II Ji.

(An early penctl-and-lmper ,,xperi;nent sul%~,ested that for Ouechua, word-by-word methods could effect approximately 95% of the required ehange,~.) After orthographic adjustments, a simple. recursivc, exhaustive search attempts to decompose each word Into a root and zero or more suffixes by matching the word's characters to the strings of characters of dictionary entries subject to constraints of a built-in morphology. Tests are applied 1) during the search to teat the suitability of a matching suffix as the immediate succe~or to what precedes, and 2) after all the word is matched to morphemes to test the. overall suitability of that sequence of morphemes. Th-sc tests constrain possible decompositions to within managable ltnlits. Word decomposltioq is complicated by various morphophonemic processes.","Pluralization differences are accommodated by 1) tagging as plural each decomposition which contains a plural morpheme, 2) deleting that plural morpheme, and 3) inserting the appropriate pluralize! for the TD word.",",Synthesis of a TD word proceeds by 1) substituting the SD root by the corresponding TD root from the (:oiuputationaily derived TI} root dictim|ary, Z) selecting for each morpheme the correct allomorph, 3) concatenation of the allomorphs, and 4) orthographic adjustment. Examples are shown in Figure 1.","Many words have multiple decompositions but this is tolerable because synthesis of alternative decompositions of one 5D word usually yield identical TD words. Nonidentical alternatives for one SD word are left to the choice of the human editor/checker.","About 40 pages of text were adapted into each of 5 target dialects for use in the field test.

The computer converted text which otherwise would have been at best only marginally lntellit~lble to a speaker of another dialect into --with a few exceptions-- fully comprehensible text. Thus the program brings a text being adapted close enough to the TD that it can be edited/corrected by a native speaker of the TD without much coaching or reference to the 3D text.","Since Inevitably there is a non-trivial residue of changes Infeasible for the computer, its output requires subsequent manual correcting/editing. Therefore, rather than strive to make the program do everything imaginable, it is wise to do the overwhelming number of systemic, \"low level\" changing and not unduly complicate the prol~ram to accommodate too much. The test identified many relatively infrequent changes not handled by the present program. For most of them, computational adaptlon is not feasible.
