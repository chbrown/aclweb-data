B~s, Pierre-Francois Jurie, & Karine Baschtmg v1 TUTORIALS Constrained Grammatical Formalisms Aravind Joshi, University of Pennsylvania; K. Vijay-Shanker, University of Delaware; David Weir, Northwestern University","Our goal is to review a range of constrained grammatical formalisms by considering the following aspects: key features of language structure the formalisms try to capture, linguistic adequacy, mathematical and computational properties, parsing strategies, kinds of structural descriptions supported, strategies for embedding them in the urdication framework, etc. We will focus on those formalisms characterized as mildly context-sensitive. The presentation will be based on examples rather than on formal proofs. Therefore, it will be appropriate for a wide range of computational linguists, even those whose investments in the construction of a lexicon and a grammar do not allow them the luxury of playing with alternative formalisms now. Psycholinguistic Approaches to Language Comprehension Michael Tanenhaus, University of Rochester","I will present a selective review of recent psycholinguistic work in three areas: (1) word recognition and lexical access; (2) parsing, with a focus on attachment ambiguity and gap-filling; and (3) anaphora resolution. In each of these areas, I will summarize some of the influential ideas and the empirical results that have emerged during the last few years. Basic information will be provided about some of the methodological advances that are enabling psycholinguists to provide detailed information about immediate or \"on-line\" comprehension processes. I will also identify some of the controversial issues that I expect will be the focus of psycholinguistic research for the next few years, and I will outline some areas where more interaction between computational linguistics and experimental psycholingulsts would be especially fruitful. Morphology and Computational Morphology Richard Sproat, AT&T Bell Laboratories","Why study the structure of words computationally-why not just look up words in a dictionary without considering their internal structure? Knowledge of morphology is useful in applications as diverse as speech synthesis, parsing, machine translation, spelling correction, and Japanese text-editing. The tutorial will outline some major results in theoretical morphology which affect computational issues, including recent linguistic work on the phonological, syntactic and semantic properties of words. Particular pieces of work in computational morphology will be discussed, all of which deal with theoretically interesting issues to a greater or lesser extent, and many of which were done with a particular application in mind. Among the systems discussed will be the Decomp module of the M1Talk text-to-speech system, and the KIMMO Two-Level morphological analysis system. There will also be some discussion of computational work in areas closely related to morphology, including the interpretation of compound nouns in English, and the recognition of word boundaries in inputs where such boundaries are not marked, such as speech or Chinese text. Some of the recent debate on the computational complexity of morphological analysis will be addressed. Speech Technology Jared Bemstein and Patti Price, SRI International","This tutorial will review the basics of speech production and perception, followed by a an overview of the major speech processing applications including coding-decoding for transmission, speaker recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and related medical and educational applications. The core of the tutorial is an in-depth review of speech synthesis and recognition, along with a discussion of metrics for their evaluation and current directions of research. The presentation on text-to-speech synthesis will cover current practice and research issues in letter-to-sound conversion, prosodic construction, and spectral composition. The presentation of recognition will emphasize methods for acoustic feature extraction, lexical modeling, and word matching. The integration of syntactic and semantic lmowledge in recognition and synthesis will also be covered.","PANEL Computational Linguistics and Research in the Humanities Don Walker (Chair), Bellcore; Patrick Hanks, Collins Publishers; Mary Dee Harris, SRA Corporation; Mark Liberman, AT&T Bell Laboratories; Martha Palmer, Unisys; Antonio Zampolli, University of Pisa & CNR","Humanists have carried out careful analyses of selected bodies of literary texts, although usually not with sophisticated linguistic tools. Computational linguists have developed new techniques for examining linguistic structure, but only recently have begun to study naturally occurring texts and to explore the characteristics of particular collections. A Text Encoding Initiative has just been established to formulate and disseminate international guidelines for the encoding and interchange of machine-readable texts intended for literary, linguistic, historical, or other textual research. A Data Collection Initiative has also been started to collect, annotate, and tag a large body of English texts. Other initiatives in the United States, Europe, and Japan are pursuing similar directions. The session will consider these developments and explore the mutual relevance of corpus-based language analysis and language-based corpus analysis in this larger context. Organized with the cooperation of the Association for Computers and the Humanities and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing. vii"]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENTS","paragraphs":["A Transfer Model Using a Typed Feature Structure Rewriting System with Inheritance R6mi Zajac .................................................................................................................................................................... 1 A Semantic-Head-Driven Generation Algorithm for Unification-Based Formalisms Smart M.
