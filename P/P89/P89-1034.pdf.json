First to provide a linguistically well motivated categorial grammar for French (henceforth, FG) which accounts for word order variations without overgenerating and without unnecessary lexical ambiguities. Second, to enhance parsing efficiency by eliminating spurious parses, i.e. parses with • different derivation trees but equivalent semantics. The two goals are related in that the parsing strategy relies on properties of the grammar which are independently motivated by the linguistic data. Nevertheless, the knowledge embodied in the grammar is kept independent from the processing phase."]},{"title":"1. LINGUISTIC THEORIES AND WORD ORDER","paragraphs":["Word order remains a pervasive issue for most linguistic analyses. Among the theories most closely related to FG, Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG : Zeevat et al. 1987), Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG : Steedman 1985, Steedman 1988), Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG : Karttunen 1986) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG: Pollard & Sag 1988) all present inconveniences in their way of dealing with word order as regards parsing efficiency and/or linguistic data. * The workreported here was carried outin the ESPR/T Project 393 ACORD, ,,The Construction and Interrogation of Knowledge Bases using Natural Language Text and Graphics~."]},{"title":"280","paragraphs":["In UCG and in CCG, the verb typically encodes the notion of a canonical ordering of the verb arguments. Word order variations are then handled by resorting to lexical ambiguity and jump rules ~ (UCG) or to new combinators (CCG). As a result, the number of lexical and/or phrasal edges increases rapidly thus affecting parsing efficiency. Moreover, empirical evidence does not support the notion of a canonical order for French (cf. B~s & Gardent 1989).","In contrast, CUG, GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985) and HPSG do not assume any canonical order and subcategorisation information is dissociated from surface word order. Constraints on word order are enforced by features and graph unification (CUG) or by Linear Precedence (LP) statements (HPSG, GPSG). The problems with CUG are that on the computational side, graph-unification is costly and less efficient in a Prolog environment than term unification while from the linguistic point of view (a) NP's must be assumed unambiguous with respect to case which is not true for - at least - French and (b) clitic doubling cannot be accounted for as a result of using graph unification between the argument feature structure and the functor syntax value-set. In HPSG and GPSG (cf. also Uszkoreit 1987), the problem is that somehow, LP statements must be made to interact with the corresponding rule schemas. That is, either rule schemas and LP statements are precompiled before parsing and the number of rules increases rapidly or LP statements are checked on the fly during parsing thus slowing down processing."]},{"title":"2.

It is derived from UCG and conserves most of the basic characteristics of the model : monostratality, lexicalism, unification-based formalism and binary combinatory rules restricted to adjacent signs. Furthermore, FG, as UCG, analyses NP's as type-raised categories.","FG departs from UCG in that (i) linguistic entities such as verbs and nouns, sub-categorize for a set - rather than a list-of valencies ; (ii) a feature system is introduced which embodies the interaction of the different elements conditioning word order ; (iii) FG semantics, though derived directly from InL ~, leave the scope of seeping operators undefined.","The FG sign presents four types of information relevant to the discussion of this paper : (a) Category, Co) Valency set ; (c) Features ; (d) Semantics. Only two combinatory rules-forward and backward concatenation - are used, together with a deletion rule."]},{"title":"A Category can be","paragraphs":["basic or complex.

It derives either from using other rules or combinators for derivation than just functional application (Pareschi and Steedman 1987, Wittenburg 1987, Moortgat 1987, Morrill 1988) or from having anordered set valencies (Karttunen 1986), the latter case being that of FG.","Various solutions have been proposed in relation to this problem.

However as explained above, two semantically equivalent formulae of InL' need not be syntactically identical. Reducing two formulae to a normal form to check their equivalence or alternatively reducing one to the other might require 2* permutations with n the number of predicates occaring in the formulae. Given that the test must occur each time that two edges stretch over the same region and given that itrequires exponential time, this solution was disguarded as computationaUy inefficient.","Pareschi's lazy parsing algorithm (Pareschi, 1987) has been shown (I-Iepple, 1987) to be incomplete. Wittenburg's predictive combinators avoid the parsing problem by advocating grammar compilation which is not our concern here. Morilrs proposal of defining equivalence classes on derivations cannot be transposed to FG since the equivalence class that would be of relevance to our problem i.e., ((X,Z)Y, X(ZY)) is not an equivalence class due to our analysis of modifiers. Finally, Moortgat's solution is not possible since it relies on the fact that the grammar is structurally complete ~ which FG is not.","The solution we offer is to augment a shift-reduce parser with a heuristic whose essential content is that no same functor may consume twice the same valency. This ensures that for all semantically unambiguous sentences, only one parse is output. To ensure that a parse is always output whenever there is one, that is to ensure that the parser is complete, the heuristic only applies to a restricted set of edge pairs and the chart is organized as aqueue. Coupled with the parlial-associativity of FG, this strategy guarantees that the parser is complete (of. §4). 3.1 THE HEURISTIC","The heuristic constrains the combination of edges in the following way 2.","Let el be an edge stretching from $1 to E1 labelled with the typefl~, a predicate identifier pl and a sign Sign1, let e2 be an edge stretching from E1 to $2 labelled with type fl and a sign Sign,?, then e2 will reduce with el by consuming the valency Val of pl if e2 has not already reduced with an edge el'by consuming the valency Valofpl where el 'stretches from $1\" to E1 and $1' ~ $1.","In the rest of this section, examples illustrate how A structurally complete grammar is one such that : If a sequence of categories X I..

First cas : if lg(P) = 1, then we have P = L(P) = L(Q) = Q. Second cas : if lg(P) > 1, then we have lg(Q) > 1 since L(P) = L(Q). Thus there exist P't, P'2, Q't, Q'2, i, k, j, 1, such that P = P'~+u P'2 and Q = Q't+~Q'2","By the Lemma 1 P't and Q't must be both functors or both arguments. And ifP'~ and Q'~ are functors (res. arguments) then P'2 and Q'2 are arguments (resp. functors). So by Property 2, we have :","i = i', k = k', P'l -- Q't, and P'2 =- Q' 2 . Then the induction hypothesis implies that P't = Q't and that P'2 = Q'2\" Thus we have proved that P = Q.

Calder 1987) developed at Edinburgh University (Centre for Cognitive Studies). Modifications to the parsing algorithm have been introduced at the \"Universit6 Blaise Pascal\", Clermont-Ferrand. The system runs on a SUN M 3/50 and is being extensively tested. It covers at present : declarative, interrogative and negative sentences in all moods, with simple and complex verb forms. This includes yes/no questions, constituent questions, negative sentences, linearity phenomena introduced by interrogative inversions, semi free constituent order, clitics (including reflexives), agreement phenomena (including gender and number agreement between obj NP to the left of the verb and participles), passives, embedded sentences and unbounded dependencies."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["B~s, G.G. and C.
