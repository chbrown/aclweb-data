Locative expressions denote regions of space, and serve as arguments to predicates, locating objects and events spatially. Since simple locatives occupy argument positions, they do NOT participate in scope ambiguities m pace one common view, which sees locatives as logical operators. Our proposal justifies common representa-tional practice in computational linguistics, account-ing for how locative expressions function anaphoritally, and explaining a wide range of inference involving locatives. We further demonstrate how the argument analysis may accommodate multiple locative arguments in a single predicate. The analysis is implemented for use in a database query application."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Locative expressions take diverse forms: in New York, here, there, nowhere, and on a boat he has in Ohio. They combine with common nouns (city on the Rhine), or with verbs or verb-phrases (work in Boston), always locating objects and situations in space. Some temporal expressions are similar, but we focus here on spatial locatives.","The analysis was developed for use in an NLP system producing database queries; it is fully implemented and has been in frequent (developmental) use for 18 months. It is important to provide facilities for reasoning about location in database query applications because users typically do not query locative information in the exact form it appears in the database. A database may e.g. contain the information that a painting is in the Guggenheim Museum, perhaps even that it's in the Guggenheim in New York, and yet be helpless when queried whether that same painting is in the US. In our implementa-tion information about location is represented using the logical analysis provided here. I","i of course, the in£ormation that New York is in the US must be provided by a compatible geographical knowledge base. The provides general service: first, in collecting the data relevant to a semantic analysis of locatives; second, in presenting the proposal in a fashion which applies to other natural languages and other logical representations; and third, in noting the consequences of our proposal for the organization of NLP systems, specifically the cooperation of syntax and semantics.","The behavior of locatives in inference and anaphora reflects their semantics. This behavior justifies the hypothesis that (unquantified) locatives refer to regions, while related sequences of locatives refer to the intersection of the regions associated with their components. E.g. the phrase (sequence) in Canada on the Atlantic Coast refers to the (maximal) region which is both in Canada and on the Atlantic Coast.","Locative adverbials within a verb phrase will then be seen to contribute to a location argument in predicates which identifies an area within which the predicate is asserted to hold. The view that locatives occupy an ARGUMENT position within a predication is contrasted with the view that they are EXTER-NAL OPERATORS (cf. Cresswell [7]), or MODIFIERS on predications (cf. Davidson [8] or Sondheimer [18]). In fact, however, the analysis of locative phrases as arguments jibes well with the practice of most computational linguists; cf. Allen [1], pp.198-207 and the references there, [1], p.218. The present effort contributes to the justification and explication of this practice.","Our approach is closest to Jackendoff [12]. We follow Jackendoff first, in suggesting that locative phrases are referential in the same way that noun phrases (NPs) are; and second, in taking locative adverbials to function as arguments. But there is a significant foundational problem implicit in the hypothesis that locatives are arguments: locatives, unlike standard arguments in the predicate calculus, appear optionally and multiply. Predicate logic does not accommodate the occurrence of multiple arguments in a single argument position. We solve this technical problem by allowing that multiple locatives CON-42 STRAIN a single argument within a predication. This effectively challenges a standard assumption about the syntax-semantics interface, viz. how syntactic elements map into arguments, but leads to an elegant semantics.","In addition to the adverbial use of locatives, we recognize a predicative use illustrated by (1). We return to these in Section 6 below.

(11) shows no analogous scope ambiguity. Thus, locatives appear to behave differently from at least some other adjuncts in that they no show no scope variation with respect to negation.","The simplest explanation of this failure to induce scope ambiguity is to deny that simple locatives have scope, i.e. to deny that they are logical operators or external modifiers. We propose exactly this when we postulate that they are arguments rather than operators. We grant that locatives in sentence-initial position DO display properties which suggest scope, but this needn't vitiate the argument analysis, s","Note that the \"commutativity of locatives\" shown in (6) is another indication of failure to scope: locatives fall to scope with respect to each other. 3.1.1 Scope versus Focus In evaluating the claim that no SCOPE AMBIGUITY is possible in (11), it is important not to be confused by the possibility of interpreting the FOCUS of negation in various ways. The association of negation with a focused element is a well-discussed, if not not a well-understood, phenomenon in the literature (see Jackendoff ([11], pp.229-78), Chomsky ([4], pp.199-208), and Rooth [17] for discussions of focus). The crucial point about focus is that it affects arguments and adjuncts alike, and that ambiguities involving the association of negation with focus affect both. For example, (13) Elizabeth Browning didn't adore Robert. The focus can be either on adore or on Robert, giving different presuppositions, 4 even though the proper name Robert is never analyzed as scope-inducing. 3.2"]},{"title":"Preposed Locatives","paragraphs":["PaEPOSED locatives do show properties that resemble scope. Cf. Thomason and Stalnaker ([21], p.205):","nit is worth emphasizing that we are nanking a semantic point boa-e--there may be a syntactic (attachment) ambiguity in (11), but it's not one that has any semantic significance.","t Relevant here is Horn's [10] notion of metallnguistic negation, which accounts for purely contrastive or contradicting negation. The issues Horn discusses are also orthogonal to the ambiguity in (12), since the ambiguity persists outside of contrastive contexts.","In that restaurant, if John is asked to wear a (14) tie, he wears a tie.","Here the preposed locative does not belong exclusively to either the antecedent or the consequent of the conditional; rather, the sentence says: if John is asked to wear a tie in that restaurant, he wears a tie in that restaurant. Thomason and Stalnaker argue hence that the locative must be treated semantically as a sentence operator. Cf. Cresswell ([7], p.217) points out another example where the result of preposing a locative is not a simple paraphrase of its \"source\":","(15) At our house, everyone is eating. Everyone is eating at our house.","Here there is a reading of the first which can be paraphrased Everyone at our house is eating, where the quantifier is restricted to people at our house. The most important point to make here is that \"preposing\" generates new readings, readings unavailable for unpreposed adverbial locatives. So if these examples are evidence for a sentence-operator semantics for locatives, then it's a semantics limited to locatives found in this position. The \"wide-scope\" readings occur only for locatives in this \"topic\" (sentence-initial) position, s It would be semantically implausible to regard the preposed adverbials here as mere stylistic variants of nonpreposed elements, s • But we note further that locations can be restricted by discourse context alone: (16) Joan lived in LA. She often went swimming. We naturally interpret Joan as swimming in LA; and such effects can extend indefinitely through discourse.","We propose to analyze both Thomason and Stalnaker's example and Cresswell's example as R.E-STRICTINO TOPIC locatives that restrict some location roles in the sentence to follow. In the case of (14), the restriction applies to the locations of both the antecedent and consequent clauses of the condi-tional sentence; in the case of (15), the restriction","5Note that this is not normally the case for sentence-operator adverbials; The number of the planeta is necessarily nine is semantically ambiguous between a wide- and narrow-scope reading of neeessarlb.","eIt is syntactically implausible as well to regard restrict-ing topic elements as stylistic variants of unpreposed elements, since some preposed dements can only occur preposed: Of the dogs at the show, only Schnauzers were affected. 44 applies to the quantifier Everyone, limiting its do-main to those individuals at \"our house. \"7 This has the consequence that there is a class of restrictive topic-position modifiers that cannot be analyzed as preposed adverbials. 3.3 Analogy with NPs Jackendoff ([12], Chap.3) is partially devoted to articulating the strong semantic analogy between locative phrases and noun phrases. The analogy includes quantification, a distinction between definite and in-definite reference, deictic reference, and anaphora. Jackendoff's programmatic point is that the semantic status of locatives is therefore the same as that of NPs: they both refer and both function as arguments.","It is noteworthy that locatives have explicitly quantificational forms, as in: (17) Bill sang everywhere Mary sang. This suggests that quantified locatives have the same relationship to simple locatives as general NPs (such as erery small country) have to singular NPs (such as the smallest country, a small country, and Honduras). Though SIMPLE locatives show no scope variation with respect to other scope operators, quantified locatives (such as everywhere and nowhere) clearly do. But this scope is due to the quantification, not to the locative function. Since locatives occupy argument positions in predications, quantified locatives are simply quantifications over those predications, exactly analogous to nonlocative quantifications.","Second, we find similarly noteworthy the indefinitely referring locative somewhere. We note that its particular reference (like that of someone) is available for subsequent anaphoric use. That is, (18) may be understood to claim that Ed works where AI works, s","(18) AI lives somewhere on the Ohio, and Ed works there.","Third, we note that deictic locative reference is possible (using here or there), just as deictic nonlocative reference is (using pronouns or demonstra-tives). We address the fourth and final reminder of the analogy between NP and locative reference, locative anaphora, in Section 3.4, immediately below.","~'We don't claim to offer a complete analysis of these topic-locatives (nothing we have said makes it clear how these restrictions are enforced, or what the constraints on them are); but we offer a plausibility argument that these ewe cases of a somewhat different color.","SThis contrasts with examples of locative anaphors with shnple locative antecedents, examined below in Section 3.4. cf. (19). 3.4 Anaphora Viewing simple locatives as analogous to singular NPs, we obtain a simple account of the anaphoric potential of locatives by taking them to denote spatial regions. The functioning of locatives as antecedents for the locative pro-form there then provides addi-tional evidence that simple locatives are in a class with singular NPs. Consider: (19) A1 lives on the Ohio, and Ed works there. (19) makes the claim, not that AI lives in the same place Ed works, but that he lives on the same river that AI works on. Thus the reference of both on the Ohio and there appears to be the entire spatial region which is ON the Ohio (as opposed to any particular subregion of it). This region is uniquely (though vaguely) determined in a given context by the name of the river and the particular preposition on. We are, in effect, claiming that the PP on the Ohio acts as a sort of definite description of a particular spatial region. Anaphoric reference back to it is reference back to that same region.","A further note is worthwhile here. If the locative phrase on the Ohio in (19) refers to the entire region which may be so described (as we've just argued), then the LOCATION role of the predicates LIVE and WORK must be construed as specifying a region 'within which' a relation is somewhere instantiated. Indeed, we postulate this as a general property of location roles within all predicates. 3.5 Regional Intersection Next consider a more complicated version of (19):","(20) AI lives on the Ohio in Kentucky, and Ed works there. In (20) one may understand there as referring to the intersection of the regions 'on the Ohio,' and 'in Kentucky' (and again, NOT to the particular subpart of that intersection where AI lives). In fact, this reading is preferred. (There may also be understood to refer to one of the component superregious, and our analysis is fully compatible with this possibility.) Let's consider how best to supply the intersective reference for the pronoun there.","In (20) the two locative expressions in the first clause simultaneously constrain the same location role. In general, each successive locative in a clause further narrows the region filling the location role: (WORK agent : Ed"]},{"title":"(21)","paragraphs":["loc : ( n~reg: {0N(Ohio), IN(Kentucky) })) 45"]},{"title":"'n~'","paragraphs":["is the intersection operation over regions.

Cf. McConnell-Ginet ([14],p.167ff) for a similar proposal about manner adverbs. Second, we allow that multiple locatives (in the same verb phrase) jointly determine a single location argument via the intersection of regions. Thus we allow several syntactic dependents corresponding to a single semantic argument. This challenges a standard working assumption about the syntax-semantics mapping made in a number of frameworks, 9 but it leads to a neuter semantic account: by allowing several locative specifiers to constrain a single role, we account more easily for the permutability of locatives, and we provide the right range of anaphoric antecedents."]},{"title":"5 Formal Aspects","paragraphs":["Here we describe the logical expressions into which locatives (and sentences containing them) are translated, and the semantic interpretations of the logical expressions."]},{"title":"5.1 Overview of NFLT","paragraphs":["Our logical formalism is called NFLT. t° It is a modification and augmentation of standard predicate calculus, with two modifications relevant here: predicates and functors of variable arity, and a semantic interpretation in terms of situation-types. 5.1.1 Predicate and Function Expressions Predications and functional terms in NFLT have an explicit rolemark for each argument; in this respect NFLT resembles semantic network formalisms and differs from standard predicate calculus, where the","9This doesn't contradict Montague's semantic theoriea, but it abandons the favored \"functional application n mode of interpretation.
