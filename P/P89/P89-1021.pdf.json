Thus, they pose problems for the semantic interpretation algorithms typically used in natural language database interfaces. We focus on the comparison attribute ambiguities that occur with CEs. To resolve these ambiguities our natural language interface interacts with the user, finding out which of the possible interpretations was intended. Our multi-level semantic processor facilitates this interaction by recognizing the occurrence of comparison attribute ambiguity and then calculating and presenting a list of candidate comparison attributes from which the user may choc6e. I I PROBLEM DESCRIPTION. Although there has been considerable work on the development of natural language database interfaces, many difficult language interpretation problems remain. One of these is the semantic interpretation of comparative expressions such as those shown in sentences (1) through (3)."]},{"title":"(1) Does ACME","paragraphs":["construct better buildings than ACE?"]},{"title":"(2) Does ACME","paragraphs":["construct buildings faster than ACE?","(3) Are more oranges than apples exported by Mexico? To interpret a comparative expression (CE) a 'natural language processor must determine (1) the entities to he compared, and (2) the attribute(s) of those entities to consider in performing the comparison. The selection of comparison attributes is made difficult by the high level of lexical ambiguity exhibited by comparative predicates. For example, what pieces of data should be compared to answer query (1)? If the database contains information about foundation type, structural characteristics, wiring, and in-sulation, any of these attributes could be used. Similarly, when comparing orange and apple exports as in query (3), we might compare numeric quantity, weight, volume, or monetary value. To further complicate matters, the plausible comparison attributes for a comparative predicate change with the arguments to which that predicate is applied. Table 1 shows several examples of likely comparison attributes to use with the predicate \"bigger\" depending on the types of entity that are being compared. Since the system must determine for a comparative predicate the lexical definition intended by the user, this problem is, at heart, one of lexical ambiguity resolution.","The problems discussed so far are similar to the well known vagueness and context sensitivity of adjectives (although they occur here even in sentences without adjectives such as (3)). Any proposed method of CE interpretation should also treat several other phenomena that are unique to comparatives. These are bipredicational comparisons, cross-class comparisons, and pairability constraints. Bipredlcational comparisons in-volve two predicates, as shown in example (4) (the 169","Table 1: Examples of argument sensitivity in the","meaning of ~bigger\".","Argument type hotels number of rooms hospitMs number of beds houses square feet","number of rooms, or","number of bedrooms","wheat farms number of acres","d~iry farms number of cows countries number of people,","or land ~rea cars length,","curb weight,","passenger space, or","passenger limit predicates are in boldface), and they use a different comparison attribute for each argument of the comparative. (4) John's car is wider than Mary's car is long. Bipredicational CEs have strong pairabillty constrn;nts (Hale 1970). That is, there are restrictions on the pairing of predicates in s bipredicational CE. Example (5) gives a sentence that is semantically anomalous because it violates palrability constraints. (5) ? Bob's car is wider than it is heavy. A crc~s-class comparison involves arguments of radically different types as shown in (6).","(6) Is the Metrodome bigger than Ronald Reagan? I Interpreting this comparison requires that we find a stadium attribute and a person attribute which are in some sense comparable (e.g. stadium-height and person-height). Pairability constraints also apply indirectly to cross-class comparisons as can be seen in the oddness of (7).","I Although this is am unusual comparison to request, it is perfectly un~ble, and the literal interpretation is easily answered. As pointed out to me by Karen Rysn, temce (6) has several po~ible metaphoric interpretations (e.g. \"Does the Metrodome get more news coverage than IRonaid Reapn?\"). In this paper we will generally ignore metaphm-ic intcrpretatiom. HoweveF, using the approach we describe below, they could be handled in much the same way as the more liter, d ones. (7) ? The party was longer than my car. ~- Although we have only one predicate (\"longer\") in this sentence, it is difficult to find a comparable pair of attributes. The attribute describing the length of a party is not comparable to any of the attributes describing the length of a car.","When faced with ambiguous input a natural language interface has two options. In the first one, it guesses at what the user wants and prorides the answer corresponding to that guess. In the second, it interacts with the user to obtain a more completely specified query. Although Option 1 is easier to implement, it is also inflexible and can lead to miscommunication between the user and the interface. With Option 2, the system lets the user select the desired interpretation, resuiting in greater flexibility and less chance of misunderstanding. It is the second option that we are exploring. To carry out Option 2 for CE interpretation the system must present to the user a list of the permissible comparison attribute pairs for the given CE. In Section 3 we will see how pairability constraints can be used to delimit these pairs. Comparatives add significant expressive power to an interface (Ballard 1988), and it is therefore important that reliable techniques be developed to resolve the lexical ambiguities that occur in CEs."]},{"title":"2 PRIOR WORK.","paragraphs":["For purposes of discnssion we will divide comparative expressions into the following commonly used classes: adjectival, adverbial, and adnomlnal, where the comparative element is based on an adjective, an adverb, or a noun, respectively. See (1)--(3) for an example of each type. Within linguistics, adjectival comparatives are the most studied of these three varieties. (See (Rusiecki 1985) for a detailed description of the various types of adjectival comparative.) For work on the syntax of CEs see (Bresnan 1973), (Pinkham 1985) and (Ryan 1983). Klein (1980), (1982) presents a formal semantics for adjectival CEs without using degrees or extents. It would be difficult to apply his work computationally since there is no easy way to determine the positive and negative extensions of adjectives upon which his the-ory rests. Hoeksema (1983) defines a set-theoretic","2Scnt~mce (7) can perhaps be interpreted metaphorically (perhaps with humorotm intent), but it se~ns more difficult to do so than it does with (6). It is certainly hard to im~ what truth conditions (T) might have! 170 semantics for adjectival comparatives based on primitive grading relations that order the domain with respect to gradable adjectives. HIS primary concern is the relationship of comparatives to coordination and quantification, and he pays little attention to lexical ambiguities. Cresswell's work (Cresswell 1976) handles both adjectivals and adnominals and is closer in spirit to our own (see Section 3.1). It contains analogs of our Codomain Agreement Principle, mappings and base orders. The main difference is that whereas Cressweli always uses degrees, we also allow base orders to be defined directly on the domain entities.","Most of the work done on lexical ambiguity resolution (e.g. (Hirst 1984) and (Wilks 1975)) has focussed on homonymy (when words have a small number of unrelated meanings) rather than polysemy (when words have many closely related meanings) as occurs with CEs. The techniques developed for homonymy depend on large semantic differences between meanings and thus are not as useful for CEs.","Although comparatives are frequently used as examples in the NLP literature (e.g. (Hendrix, Sacerdoti, Sagalowicz, and Slocum 1978), (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983) and (Pereira 1983)), no one has presented a detailed treatment of the ambiguities in the selection of comparison attributes. Most NLP researchers provide neither a detailed explanation of how they treat comparatives nor any characterization of the breadth of their treatment. Two exceptions are the recent papers of Ballard (1988) and Rayner and Banks (1988). The former treats adjectival and adnomihal comparatives, and is primarily concerned with the interpretation of expressions like \"at least 20 inches more than twice as long as\". The selection of comparison attributes is not discussed in any detail. Rayner and Banks (1988) describe a logic programming approach to obtaining a parse and an initial logical formula for sentences containing a fairly broad range of CEs. They do not discuss lexical semantics and thus do not deal with comparison attribute selection.","This paper is an abbreviated version of a longer paper (Olawsky 1989), to which the reader is referred for a more detailed presentation. 3 SOLUTION APPROACH. In ~his section we describe a rule-based semantic processor that follows Option 2. To provide for user-controlled comparison attribute selection we augment the common lexical translation process (e.g. (Bronnenberg, Bunt, Landsbergen, Scha, Schoenmakers, and van Utteren 1980) and (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988)) with a Mapping Selector that communicates with the user and returns the results to the rule-based translator. The implementation of the approach described here is in progress and is proceeding well. 3.1 Semantic Description of Comparatives. We base our approach on the semantic interpretation of a comparative predicate as a set-theoretic relation. A comparison defined by the relation 7~ is true if the denotations of the first and second arguments of the comparative predicate (i.e. its subject and object 3) form an element pair of 7~. It is tempting to claim that comparatives should be defined by orders rather than relations (we call this the Comparison Order Claim). However, it can be shown (Olawsky 1989) that the comparison relation Lw for a bipredicational comparative like longer than ... wide is neither asymmetric nor antisymmetric 4, and hence, Lw is not an order. 5 Comparison relations are not defined directly in our semantic description. Instead they are specified in terms of three components: a base order, a subject mapping, and an object mapping. The base order is a set-theoretic order on some domain (e.g. the obvious order on physical lengths). The subject mapping is a mapping from the domain of the denotation of the subject of the CE to the domain of the base order (e.g. the mapping from a rectangle to its length). The object mapping is defined analogously. Let comparison relation ~ be defined by the base order B, and the subject and object mappings M, and Mo. Then (a,b) E 7~ if and only if (M,(a),Mo(b)) E B. It should be noted here that comparison attribute selection is now recast as the selection of subject and object mappings.","3Our rea~ns for calling the first and second arguments of a CE the subject and object are syntactic and beyond the scope of this paper (see (Ryan 1983)).","4It is ~ euy to show that Lt# is nontransitive.","SKleln ((1980), p. 23) and Hoel~enm ((1983), pp. 410-411) both make clalms slmilar (but not identical) to the Comparmon Order Claim. It seems to us that bipredicationak pose a problem for Hoeksema's analysis (see (Olawaky 1989)). Klein appears to relax his assumptions slightly when he deals with them. Cresswell (1976) dearly avoids the Comparison Order Claim."]},{"title":"1'7'1","paragraphs":["By definition, the subject and object mappings must have the same"]},{"title":"codomain,","paragraphs":["and this codomain must be the domain of the base order. We call this the Codomain Agreement Principle, and it is through this principle that pairability constraints are enforced. For example, when interpreting the CE in sentence (5), we must find a subject mapping for the width of Bob's car and an object mapping for its weight, and these mappings must have the same codomain. However, this is impossible since all width mappings will have LENGTH as a codomain, and all weight mappings will have WEIGHT as a codomain. The Codomain Agreement Principle also helps explain the interpretation of sentences (6) and (7).","Before concluding this section we consider the semantic description of CEs in TEAM ((Grosz, Haas, Hendrix, Hobbs, Martin, Moore, Robinson, and Rosenschein 1982) and (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983)), comparing it to ours. Since comparative expressions were not the main focus in these papers, we must piece together TEAM's treatment of CEs from the examples that are given. In (Grosz, Haas, Hendrix, Hobbs, Martin, Moore, Robinson, and Rosenschein 1982), the CE \"children older than 15 years\" is translated to ((*MORE* OLD) child2 (YEAR 15)) where \"*MORE* maps a predicate into a comparative along the scale corresponding to the predicate\" (p. 11). This implies that TEAM requires the same nmpping to be used for both the subject and object of the comparative. That would not work well for bipredicational CEs, and could also lead to problems for crose-claes comparisons. In (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983) the examples contain predicates (e.g."]},{"title":"salary.of","paragraphs":["and earn) which, on the surface, are similar to mappings. However, in contrast to our approach, it does not appear that any special significance is given to these predicates. There is nothing in either paper to indicate that the many types of CEs are consistently translated to a base order, subject mapping and object mapping as is done in our systerrL Furthermore, there is nothing analogous to the Codomain Agreement Principle discussed in either paper.\" Now, we move on to a presentation of how the semantic description presented above is applied in our system. 3.2 General Comments. We use a multi-level semantic processor (see (Bates and Bobrow 1983), (Bronnenberg, Bunt, Landsbergen, Scha, Schoenmakers, and van Utteren 1980), (Grosz, Haas, Hendrix, Hobbs, Martin, Moore, Robinson, and Rosenschein 1982), (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983) and (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988) for descriptions of similar systems). At each level queries are represented by logic-based formulas (see (Olawsky 1989) for examples) with generalized quantifiers ((Barwise and Cooper 1981), (Moore 1981) and (Pereira 1983)) using predicates defined for that level. The initial level is based on often ambiguous English-oriented predicates. At the other end is a description of the query in unambiguous database-oriented terms (i.e. the relation and attribute names used in the database). Between these levels we have a domain model level where formulas represent the query in terms of the basic entities, attributes and relationships of the subject domain described in a domain model. These basic concepts are treated as unambiguous. Linking these levels are a series of translators, each of which is responsible for handling a particular semantic interpretation task.","In this paper we restrict our attention to the translation from the English-oriented level (EL) to the domain model level (DML) since this is where CEs are disambiguated by choosing unambiguous mappings and base orders from the domain model. To perform its task the EL-DML translator uses three sources of information. First, it has access to the domain model, a frame-based representation of the subject domain. Second, it uses the semantic lexicon which tells how to map each EL predicate into a DML formula. Finally, this translator will, when necessary, invoke the Mapping Selector--a program that uses the semantic lexicon and the domain model to guide the user in the selection of a comparison attribute pair.","For our semantic formulas we extend the usual ontology of the predicate calculus with three new classes: sets, mass aggregations, and bunches. Sets are required for count noun adnominal comparatives (e.g. \"Has ACME built more warehouses than ACE?\") where we compare set cardinalities rather than entity attribute values. Given a class of mass entities (e.g. oil), a mass aggregation is the new instance of that class result-ing from the combination of zero or more old instances. For example, if John combines the oil from three cans into a large vat, the oil in that vat is an aggregation of the oil in the cans. It is not necessary that the original instances be physically combined; it is sufficient merely to consider"]},{"title":"172","paragraphs":["them together conceptually.

When translating an input sentence containing a comparative expression from EL to DML, the system first applies Trans and Btrans rules to translate the predications that do not represent mappings or base orders. Next, comparison attributes must be selected. The system recognizes comparison attribute ambiguity when there is more than one applicable MTrans rule for a particular EL mapping predicate.

All three of these DML mappings would then be candidates with either VOLUME or AREA as the corresponding base order.","The system examines the semantic lexicon to determine a list of candidate mappings for each EL mapping. A candidate is removed from one of these lists if there is no compatible mapping in the other list.

Once this is completed, the processor can easily translate the EL base order to the DML base order listed in both of the MTraus rules it used (with any necessary adjustments in the direction of comparison)."]},{"title":"4 COMMENTS AND CONCLU- SIONS.","paragraphs":["We are currently examining some additional issues. First, once candidate mappings are obtained, how should they be explained to the user? In the present design text is stored along with the declaration of each mapping, and that text is used to describe the mapping to the user. This approach is somewhat limited, especially for adnominal comparatives given their flexibility and the relatively small information content of the *CAR-DINALITY ~ mapping. A more general technique would use natural language generation to explain the semantic import of each mapping as applied to its arguments. Perhaps there are compromise approaches between these two extremes (e.g. some kind a pseudo-English explanations).","Second, it seems desirable that the system could work automatically without asking the user which mappings to use. Perhaps the system could choose a mapping, do the query, present the resuits and then tell the user what interpretation was assumed (and offer to try another interpretation). This works well as long as either (a) the system almost always selects the mapping intended by the user, or (b) the cost of an incorrect choice (i.e. the wasted query time) is small. If the system frequently makes a poor choice and wastes a lot of time, this approach could be quite an-noying to a user. Crucial to the success of this automatic approach is the ability to reliably predict the resources required to perform a query so that the risk of guessing can be weighed against the benefits. A similar issue was pointed out by an anonymous reviewer. We noted in Section 1 that for sentence (3) (repeated here as (8))","(8) Are more oranges than apples exported by Mexico? the comparison could be based on quantity, weight, volume, or value. If the answer is the same regardless of the basis for comparison, a \"friendly\" system would realize this and not require the user to choose comparison attributes. Unfortunately, this realization is based on extensional rather than intentional equivalence, and hence, the system must perform all four (in this case) queries and compare the answers. The extra cost could be prohibitive. Again, the system must predict query performance resource requirements to know whether this approach is worthwhile for a particular query. See (Olawsky 1989) for more information on further work.","To summarize, we have examined a number of issues associated with the semantic interpretation of comparative expressions and have developed techniques for representing the semantics of CEs and for interacting with the user to resolve comparison attribute ambiguities. These techniques will work for adjectival, adverbial, and adnomihal comparatives and for both numerically and non-numerieally based comparisons (see (Olawsky 1989) for more on this). We are presently completing the implementation of our approach in Common Lisp using the SunView x° window system as a medium for user interaction. Most previous techniques for handling lexical ambiguity work best with homonymy since they depend on large semantic differences between the possible interpretations of a lexieal item. Our approach, on the other hand, does not depend solely on these semantic differences and handles polysemy well. 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
