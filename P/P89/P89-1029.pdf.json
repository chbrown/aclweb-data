Unfortunately they exclude grammars that use x-bar theory - and these grammars have strong linguistic justification. We define a more general class of unification grammars, which admits x-bar grammars while preserving the desirable properties of offline parsable grammars. Consider a unification grammar based on term unification. A typical rule has the form t o --~ t 1 ... t n where t o is a term of first order logic, and tt...t n are either terms or terminal symbols. Those t i which are terms are called the top-level terms of the rule. Suppose that no top-level term is a variable. Then erasing the arguments of the top-level terms gives a new rule C 0 ---,¢.

The .parsing problem for offline parsable grammars ts solvable. Yet these grammars apparently have enough formal power to describe natural language - at least, they can describe the crossed-serial dependencies of Dutch and Swiss German, which are presently the most widely accepted example of a construction that goes beyond context-free grammar (Shieber 1985a).","Suppose that the variable M ranges over integers, and the function letter \"s\" denotes the successor function. Consider the rule 1 p(M) ---) p(s(M)) A grammar containing this rule cannot be offline parsable, because erasing the arguments of the top-level terms in the rule gives 2 p ---~ p which immediately leads to infinite ambiguity. One's intuition is that rule (1) could not occur in a natural language, because it allows arbitrarily long derivations that end with a single symbol: p(s(0)) ~ p(0) p(s(s(0))) ~ p(s(0)) ~ p(0) p(s(s(s(0)))) ~ p(s(s(0))) ~ p(s(0)) --> p(0) ,,°. Derivations ending in a single symbol can occur in natural language, but their length is apparently restricted to at most a few steps. In this case the offline parsable grammars exclude a rule that seems to have no place in natural language.","Unfortunately the offline parsable grammars also exclude rules that do have a place in natural language. The excluded rules use x-bar theory. In x-bar theory the major categories (noun phrase, verb phrase, noun, verb, etc.) are not primitive. The theory analyzes them in terms of two features: the phrase types noun, verb, adjective, preposition, and the bar levels 1,2 and 3. Thus a noun phrase is maJor-cat(n,2) and a noun is major-cat(n,1). This is a very simplified account, but it is enough for the present purpose. See (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag 1985) for more detail.","Since a noun phrase often consists of a single noun we need the rule 3 major-.cat(n,2) ~ major-.cat(n,l) Erasing the arguments of the category symbols gives 4 major-cat ~ major-cat and any grammar that contains this rule is infinitely ambiguous. Thus the offline parsable grammars exclude rule (3), which has strong linguistic justification.","One would like a class of grammars that excludes the bad rule p(s(Y)) -., p(Y) and allows the useful rule 237 major-cat(n,2) --~ major-cat(n,1 ) Offline parsable grammars exclude the second rule because in forming the context-free backbone they erase too much information - they erase the bar levels and phrase types, which are needed to guarantee finite ambiguity. To include x-bar grammars in the class of offline parsable grammars we must find a different way to form the backbone - one that does not require us to erase the bar levels and phrase types.","One approach is to let the grammar writer choose a finite set of features that will appear in the backbone, and erase everything else. This resembles Shieber's method of restriction (Shieber 1985b).Or following Sato et.al. (1984) we could allow the grammar writer to choose a maximum depth for the terms in the backbone, and erase every symbol beyond that depth. Either method might be satisfactory in practice, but for theoretical purposes one cannot just rely on the ingenuity of grammar writers. One would like a theory that decides for every grammar what information is to appear in the backbone.","Our solution is very close to the ideas of Xu and Warren (1988). We add a simple sort system to the grammar. It is then easy to distinguish those sorts S that are recursive, in the sense that a term of sort S can contain a proper subterm of sort S. For example, the sort \"list\" is recursive because every non-empty list contains at least one sublist, while the sorts \"bar level\" and \"phrase type\" are not recursive. We form the"]},{"title":"acyclic backbone","paragraphs":["by erasing every term whose sort is recursive. This preserves the information about bar levels and phrase types by using a general criterion, without requiring the grammar writer to mark these features as special. We then use the acyclic backbone to define a class of grammars for which the parsing problem is solvable, and this class includes x-bar grammars.","Let us review the offline parsable grammars.

The language and the derivation trees generated by a unification grammar are the ones generated by its ground grammar.

In other words, the depth of a p.arse tree is bounded by the length of the stnng it derives. By definition, a unification grammar is depth-bounded iff its ground grammar is depth-bounded. One can prove that a context-free grammar is depth-bounded iff it is finitely ambiguous (the grammar has a f'mite set of symbols, so there is only a finite number of strings of given length L, and it has a finite number of rules, so there is only a finite number of possible parse trees of given depth D).","Depth-bounded grammars are important because the parsing problem is solvable for any depth-bounded unification grammar. Consider a bottom-up chart parser that generates partial parse trees in order of depth. If the input (~ is of length L, there is a depth D such that all parse trees for any substring of a have depth less than D. The parser will eventually reach depth D; at this depth there are no parse trees, and then the parser will halt.","The essential properties of offline parable grammars are these:","Theorem 1.

If t is a parse tree for a in G, let t' be formed by replacing each non-terminal f(xt...xn) in t with the symbol f. t' is a parse tree for ct in the context-free backbone, and it has the same depth as t. Therefore a has arbitrarily deep parse trees in the context-free backbone, so the context-free backbone is not depth-bounded. This contradiction shows that the unification grammar must be depth-bounded.","Theorem 2 at once implies that the parsing problem is solvable for offline parsable grammars.","We define a new kind of backbone for a unification grammar, called the acyclic backbone, The acyclic backbone is like the context-free backbone in two ways: there is an algorithrn to decide whether the acyclic backbone is depth-bounded, and ff the acyclic backbone is depth-bounded then the original grammar is depth-bounded. The key difference between the acyclic backbone and the context-free backbone is that in forming the acyclic backbone for an x-bar grammar, we do not erase the phrase type and bar level features. We consider the class of unification grammars whose acyclic backbone is depth-bounded.

In any x-bar grammar, the sorts \"phrase type\" and \"bar level\" will each contain a finite set of terms; therefore they are not cyclic sorts, and in forming the acyclic backbone we will preserve the phrase types and bar levels. In order to get this we result we need not make any special provision for x-bar grammars - it follows from the general principle that if any sort s contains a finite number of ground terms, then each term of sort s will appear unchanged in the acyclic backbone.","We must show that it is decidable whether a given unification grammar has a depth-bounded acyclic backbone. We will generalize algorithm 1 so that given the acyclic backbone G' of a unification grammar G, it decides whether G' is depth-bounded. The idea of the generalization is to use a set S of pairs of terms with variables as a representation for the set of ground instances of pairs in S. Given this representation, one can use unification to compute the functions and predicates that the algorithm requires. First one must build a representation for the set of pairs of ground terms [A,B] such that (A --> B) is a rule in the ground grammar of G'. Clearly this representation is just the set of pairs of terms [C,D] such that (C ~ D) is arule ofG'.","Next there is the function that takes sets S t and S 2 and finds the set link(Si,S 2) of all pairs [A,C] such that for some B, [A,B] e S t and [B,C]","S 2.

It is easy to check whether a set of pairs of terms represents the empty set or not - since every sort includes at least one ground term. a set of pairs represents the empty set iff it is empty. It is also easy to decide whether a set T of pairs with variables represents a set S of ground pairs that includes a pair of the form [A,A] - merely check whether A unifies with B for some pair [A,B] in T. In this case there is no need for renaming, and once again the reader can show that the test is correct using the basic properties of unification.","Thus we can \"lift\" the algorithm for checking depth-boundedness from a context-tree grammar to a unification grammar. Of course the new algorithm enters an infinite loop for some unification grammars - for example, a grammar containing only the rule 1 p(M) -+ p(s(M)) In the context-free case the algorithm halts because if there are arbitrarily long chains, some symbol derives itself - and the algorithm will eventually detect this. In a grammar with rules like (1), there are arbitrarily long chains and yet no symbol ever derives itself. This is possible because a ground grammar can have infinitely many non-terminals.","Yet we can show that if the unification grammar G contains no cyclic function letters, the result that holds for cfgs will still hold: if there are arbitrarily long chain derivations, some symbol derives itself. This means that when operating on an acyclic backbone, the algorithm is guaranteed to halt. Thus we can decide for any unification grammar whether its acyclic backbone is depth-bounded or not.","The following is the central result of this paper:","Theorem 3. Let G' be a unfication grammar without cyclic function letters. If the ground grammar of G' allows arbitrarily long chain derivations, then some symbol in the ground grammar derives itself.

Then the maximum depth of a term that contains no cyclic function letters is C+I. For consider a term as a labeled tree, and consider any path from the root of such a tree to one of its leaves. The path can contain at most one variable or function.. letter of each non-cyclic sort, plus one variable of a cyclic sort. Then its length is at most C+I.

Since the number of such terms is finite, unification on the acyclic backbone can produce only a finite number of distinct terms.","Let D t be the set of lists (A,B) such that (A","B) is a rule of G'.

This happens because in forming the backbone one erases too much information. Shieber's restriction method can solve this problem in many practical cases, but it offers no general solution - it is up to the grammar writer to decide what to erase in each case. We have shown that by using a simple sort system one can automatically choose the features to be erased, and this choice will allow the x-bar grammars.","The sort system has independent motivation. For example, it allows us to assert that the feature \"person\" takes only the values 1st, 2nd and 3rd. This important fact is not expressed in an unsorted definite clause grammar. Sort-checking will then allow us to catch errors in a grammar - for example, arguments in the wrong order. Robert Ingria and the author have used a sort system of this kind in the grammar of BBN Spoken Language System (Boisen et al., 1988). This grammar now has about 700 rules and considerable syntactic coverage, so it represents a serious test of our sort system. We have found that the sort system is a natural way to express syntactic facts, and a considerable help in detecting errors. Thus we have solved the problem about offline parsable grammars using a mechanism that is already needed for other purposes.","These ideas can be generalized to other forms of unification. Consider dag unification as in Shieber (1985b). Given a set S of sorts, assign a sort to each label and to each atomic dag. The arity of a label is a set of sorts (not a sequence of sorts as in term unification). A dag is well-formed ff whenever an arc labeled 1 leads to a node n, 241 either n is atomic and its sort is in the arity of 1, or n has outgoing arcs labeled Ir..l n, and the sorts of 11...1 n are ill the arity of 1. One can go on"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["develop the theory for dags much as the present paper has developed it for terms.","This work is a step toward the goal of formally defining the class of possible grammars of human languages. Here is an example of a plausible grammar that our definition does not allow. Shieber (1986) proposed to make the list of arguments of a verb a feature of that verb, leading to a grammar roughly like this: vp ~ v(Args) arglist(Args) v(cons(np,nil)) ~ [eat] arglist(nil) ----r e arglist(cons(X,L)) ~ X arglist(L) Such a grammar is desirable because it allows us to assert once that an English VP consists of a verb followed by a suitable list of arguments. The list of arguments must be a cyclic sort, so it will be erased in forming the acyclic backbone. This will lead to loops of the form arglist(X) ~ arglist(Y) Therefore a grammar of this kind will not have a depth-bounded acyclic backbone. This type of grammar is not as stroagly motivated as the x-bar grammars, but it suggests that the class of grammars proposed here is still too narrow to capture the generalizations of human language.
