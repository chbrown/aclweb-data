All uses of definite descriptions for the purpose of referring are functional in the sense that they are supposed to identify the referent. But some uses of definite descriptions exhibit a type of relevance (or irrelevance) that goes beyond identification purposes. Consider the following example. As part of his effort to re= cruit more young people into the police force, the mayor of New York proclaims in a public speech: 1 New York needs more policemen. Instead of gNew York\" he might have used UThe Big Apple, s or ~The city by the Hudson, ~ or some such description. It would not do, however, to say that","2 The city with the world's largest Jewish community needs more policemen even though this description might be useful enough in identifying New York for the audience. It is simply irrelevant in this context. On the other hand,"]},{"title":"5O","paragraphs":["this same description might be quite relevant in a different context. For example, suppose the mayor were giving a speech at a reception in honor of Israel's Prime Minister. Under those circumstances, the statement","$ The city with the world's largest Jewish community welcomes Israel's Prime Minister. would make perfect sense. The difference, of course, is in the relevance of the description to the state= ment in (3), and its irrelevance to the one in (2). Uses of definite descriptions such as illustrated in example (3), are what I call conversationally relevant.","The distinction between functionally and conversationally relevant descriptions is part of a general model of referring that is based on what I have termed the dea4:riptlve approach to reference [Kronreid 1990]. An ellucidation of the speech act of referring cannot be complete without understanding the role of conversationally relevant descriptions in the larger discourse. My hypothesis in [Kronfeld 1086] was that conversationally relevant descriptions function as part of implicatures of a particular type. The problem is to specify what this type is. An outline of a solution is the topic of the present paper."]},{"title":"3 Implicature","paragraphs":["Why should we think that whenever a conversationally relevant description is used an implicature always exists? The reason for this has to do with the fact that discourse is something more than a simple sum of the isolated sentences that constitute its parts. Discourse consists of a sequence of utterances that are tied together in ways that make sere. Typically, there are m~o~uf why a speaker says what he says in the order and manner that he says it, and in general a hearer must have a clue as to what these reasons are (this is why plan recognition is so important for plan-based theories of speech acts). Of course, the hearer cannot hope to know or even guess all of the reasons that led the speaker to participate in the discourse, but he can, indeed must, recognize aome of them. As ALlen, Cohen, Gross, Perranlt, and Sidner have pointed out [Allen 1978; Perranlt and Cohen 1978; Alien and Perranlt 1978; Allen and Perranlt 1980; Gross and Sidner 1986; Sidner 1983; Sidner 1985], the recognition of what the speaker is \"up to e contributes to coherence and comprehensibility of the discourse and is essential for the hearer's generation of an appropriate response.","Now, the unstated reasons whose recognition is required for discourse coherence are by de~nition implicated, since they must be inferred in order to preserve the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative. This is precisely what an implicature is. Moreover, turning to conversationally relevant descriptions, we should observe that by their very nature, they cannot be merely functionally relevant. That is, the assumption that they are intended merely as tools for identification is not enough to make the discourse coherent. This, after all, is pre. cisely what distinguishes functionally relevant descriptious from the conversationally relevant ones. Hence, additional assumptions are required in order to make sense of the way the speaker uses the latter descriptions. These assumptious themselves must be implicated.","Thus, in using a conversationally relevant description, the speaker implicates something. The content of implicatures that accompany such descriptions depends on circumstances, but they all share a rather specific form. My method in uncovering this form is this: taking the heater's perspective, I begin by postulating that if the referring expremion used by the speaker is merely functionally relevant, the speaker must be viewed as uncooperative. I then outline a sequence of deductions that eliminate the apparent conflict between what the speaker says and the assumption of his cooperation."]},{"title":"3.1 Recognition","paragraphs":["The general mechanism for the recognition of a conversationally relevant description follows the familiar Gricean path. The hearer begins by assuming that the referring expression is only functionally relevant, and then gets into diflicnlties. An obvious strategy is illustrated by Example (3) above. At first glance it appears that the mayor violated the third maxim of manner ('Be briei~): he used"]},{"title":"61","paragraphs":["a long and cumbersome description ('the city with the largeat Jewish couunltym), although a much shorter and functionally superior one is available ('New York'}. However, a hearer can easily make sense of the mayor's behavior by assuming that the referring expression is not merely a tool for identification. That is, it must be conversationally relevant.","Another strategy for letting the hearer recog-","a conversationally relevant description is illustrated by \"Smith's murderer ~ (interpreted \"attributively'). There, the assumption that the description is only functionally relevant would lead to an inexplicable violation of the second maxim of quality. It is obvious that no one knows yet who murdered Smith. Thus, if the description is only functionally relevant, the hearer would be pussled as to how the speaker could form an opinion about the sanity of a person whose identity is unknown to him."]},{"title":"3.2 Asserted universality","paragraphs":["When a conversationally relevant description is used (or implied), the proposition which the speaker is trying to express lends itself to the Russellian analysis. Thus, if a speaker asserts a statement of the form 4 The D is F, and \"The D ~ is a conversationally relevant description, then the proposition expessed by the speaker is this: 5 (3x)(D(x) & (VY)CD(Y) --* x = y) & F(x)). ~ Note that (5) is equivalent to the conjunction of two propositions. The first one is the uniqueness condition: 6 (U'niquenels) (3z)CDCz) ~ CVy)(DCy) ~ z = y)~). The second is a universal generalization: .v,"]},{"title":"(u~-..er,~ztx)","paragraphs":["('v'z)(D(.,.) --, F(.,)).","Both the uniqueness and the universality condi-tions have to be satisfied if what the speaker means is to be true. But from this it does not follow that the speaker ~sert8 these conditions. Both Strawson 11971] and following him Searle [1969, 157E.] have argued in their criticism of Russell's theory of descriptions that the uniqueness condition, though presupposed, is not ~erted. For example, when a speaker says that the Queen of England is ill, he does not ~ert that there is one and only one Queen","SContextu~l information may be needed to augment the descriptive content of \"The D.\" of England. This, no doubt, is true of the uniqueness condition, but I think that when a conversationally relevant description is used, the un~eerm6/- /ty condition is indeed asserted, or at least strongly implied. In a sense, what the speaker attempts to convey is that any object that is denoted by the description \"the D t has the property F, and this is why it is so natural to insert \"whoever he is\" in the classical examples of attributive uses of definite descriptious. By saying \"Smith's murderer, whoever he is, is insane\" the speaker obviously means that for any person, if that person is Smith's murderer, that person is insane, which has the exact same form as (7). Note that the convention for using definite descriptions to express universal statements already exists in the language ('The whale is a mammar' i.e., for any z, if z is a whale, then z is a mammal). Moreover, very frequently, when a conversationally relevant description is used, the speaker would maintain that the universality condition is true even if uniqueness fails. Suppose it turns out that not one but two culprits are responsible for Smith's sorry state. If our speaker asserted that Smith's murderer, whoever he is, is insane, he is very likely to say now that both are insane, rather than withdraw his judgment altogether. All in all, it seems to me very plausible to assume that when conversationally relevant descriptions are used, the universal claim is not only part of the truth conditious (together with uniqueness), but part of what is asserted as well."]},{"title":"3.3 Justification","paragraphs":["A rational speaker who follows the Gricean maxims is expected, among other things, to obey the second maxim of quality. That is, he is expected to have \"adequate evidence ~ for what he asserts. What counts as adequate evidence obviously depends on context: we have di~erent standards for assertions in a scientific article and in a gossipy chat. Nevertheless in all verbal exchanges, a speaker is expected to be able to provide reasonable justification for what he says. He must be able to answer ques-tions such as \"how do you know?\" \"why do you think so?\" and so on. If he cannot, the assumption about his cooperation cannot be maintained.","If a universal statement such as (7) is part of what the speaker asserts, he must be able, then, to justify it. The hearer may not know exactly what the speaker's evidence is for believing this generalisatlon but the hearer can reason about the type of evidence or justification that the speaker is expected to have.

An extensional justification of a generalization such as \"All A's are F\" would rely on the fact that aLl, or most, or a good sample of the things with the property A have been examined and were found to have property F. In such a case there would not be any attempt to explain why this is so, only a claim that as things stand, all A's do, in fact, have the property F. An intensional justification of a universal generaKsation, on the other hand, would attempt to show that anything with the property of being A m~t have the property of being P, because of a more general principle or theory from wldch the gsneral~ation can be derived. 2","The distinction I have just described is obviously not restricted to science, nor am I interested in elucidating different scientific methods of corrobora-tion. Rather, I want to apply this distinction to the kind of justification that a speaker is expected to have for what he says, in view of Grice's second maxim of quail W. In a sense, what I am after is a \"folk theory\" of justification, not the foundation of knowledge. Thus, the extensional/intensional distinction between types of justification is indifferent to the question whether the evidence for a statement is good or bad, as an intensional justification can be either silly or brilliant. Moreover, the distinction applies to all sorts of judgments, not merely theoretical ones. The biggotted justification for holding stereotypic beliefs would presumably be extensional ('Look, I don't know why they are all such dirty cowards, but I have met enough of them to know that they are:'). On the other hand, when the notorious fundamentalist preacher Jimmy Swaggart states that all adulterers are sinners, he does not intend us to believe that he has examined all (most, enough) adulterers and found that they happen to be sinners. If someone who is not an adulterer now would become one, he would have to be a sinner as well, and the reason for that is simple. Within $waggart's world view, adulterers rn~t be sinners simply because the bible says so, and whatever the bible says is true. The same distinction applies to the most mundane generalisations that can appear in discourse. \"A11 the nursery schools in our area are simply unacceptable ~ my friend tells me. I assume the justification for what he says is extensional (he has checked out each and every one), but then he adds: \"... they are all Montessori schools,\" and an intensional justification is revealed.","Clearly, extensional and intensional justification are not mutually exclusive. Nor do they exhaust the types of justification one can use. Thus, the justification of the most fundamental principles of any theory (scientific or otherwise), although clearly not extensional, would not be intensional either, since","~Statisticai correlations belong to the extensional realm. Causal explanatiorm to the intensional one."]},{"title":"63","paragraphs":["by definition they are not derivable from any other principles (they would still support counterfactuak, though). However, apart from such fundamental ax/oms, the justification of any universal general-isation, if it is not extensional, must be intenaionaL","Now back to the univereali W condition that the speaker asserts when he uses a conversationally re]- evant description. As mentioned already, the hearer may not know why the speaker believes the general-isation, but from the heater's point of view it stands to reason that the speaker's justification is intendonul, because of the uniqueness condition. If the uniquene~ condition is presupposed, an extensional justification of the universal generalization amounts to no more than this: there is evidence that the referent happens to have the property F. But if this were all that the speaker had in mind, it would be very misleading to give the impression that a universal generalization was meant. To see why, consider a case in which an author tells you that all his books are published by Cambridge University Press. If later you are to find out that he has publi-qhed only one book, you would surely be pusaled, although as things are, his statement was technically true. In other words, if the uniqueness condition is presupposed, it makes little sense to assert a universal generalization, unless the speaker believes that the gsneralisation m~t be true whether the uniqueness condition is true or not. Thus, if the speaker has intensional justification for what he says, the uniquencss condition no longer interferes with universality. If the author tells you that he has just signed a lifetime contract with Cambridge University Press, and therefore all his books m~t be published there, the fact that he has written only one book (so far) does not matter any more. In view of the contract, if he were to write others, they would be published by Cambridge.","For the speech act to be coherent, therefore, the speaker must have an inter~ional justification for (7). This is why frequently when a conversationally relevant description is used (for example, in the paradigmatically \"attributive ~ uses of definite descriptious), it is natural to replace the auxiliary verb with an appropriately tensed occurrence of \"mnst. ~ For example,","10 The inventor of the sewing machine,","wae very whoever he or she was, ntuet haue been smart.","11 If my political ~nalysis is correct, the. Democratic candidate in 1992 will ~.avebVto be a conservative.","12 The thief who stole your diamond ring,","knew mu,t ~we known how valuable it was. My hypothesis, therefore, is that conversationally relevant descriptions are used to assert universal generalizations for which the speaker has inteusional justification. Therefore, when a speaker says \"The D is F\" and \"The D\" is conversationally relevant, a first approbation of what is usually being implicated is this: 13 Any D must be F. When the modal verb is actually added, the speaker simply makes (part of) the implicature explicit."]},{"title":"3.4 The meaning of \"must\"","paragraphs":["As it stands, the implicature expressed by (13) is hopelessly vague. The problem is with the modal verb ~must.\" How is it to be interpreted? Compare, for example, the following uses:","14 (a) The bird m~t have entered through","the attic.","(b) Whether I like it or not, I m~t pay","my taxes.","(¢) The Butcher of Lion m,~t pay for his","crimes. If I do not pay my taxes, I will be punished. This is why I feel that I must do it. But if the bird did not enter through the attic, or if the Butcher of Lion does not pay for his crimes, neither bird nor beast will be punished as a result of that. Moreover, if the bird did not enter through the attic, th e speaker uttering 14(a) would simply be wrong. But whether or not the Butcher of Lion ever pays for his crimes, the speaker uttering 14(c) would nevertheless be right. Thus, in each case, the intended interpretation of the modal verb is radically different.","Is the word \"must\" multiply ambiguous then? Not necessarily. As Angelika Kratser has argued [1977; 1979; 1981], the force of modal verbs such as \"must\" is relative to an implied contextual element. The examples in 14 are elliptical pronouncements whose full meaning can be given by the following:","15 (a) In view of what we know, the bird must have entered through the attic.","(b) In view of what the law is, I must pay my taxes, whether I like it or not.","(¢) In view of our moral convictions, the Butcher of Lion must pay for his crimes.","The interpretation of \"must\" in each example is indeed different, but there is, Kratzer argues, a core of meaning which is common to alL This core is"]},{"title":"64","paragraphs":["specified as a/unct/oa that can be precisely formulated within the framework of possible-world semantics. Schematically, Kratser's suggestion is that the meaning of \"must\" is given by the function m~t-in-dew-o/, which accepts two arguments. One argument is the proposition within the scope of the modal verb (e.g., The bird came through the attic in 14(a)). Values for the other argument are phrases such as \"what is known,\" awhat the law is,\" \"our moral convictions,\" etc. Thus, for example, sentence 15(a) is interpreted as","16 Must=In-View-Of(What is known, The bird entered through he attic) The sentence is true in possible world uJ just in case the proposition expressed by \"The bird entered through the attic\" logically follows from what we know in w [Kratzer 1977, 346]. 3","Kratser's suggestion can be used in the elucidation of the implicature conveyed by a conversationally relevant description. Let f stand for phrases such as \"what is known,\" \"What the law is,\" etc. Applying Kratser's analysis to (13) we get 17 In view of/, any D must be F. or more accurately: lS Must=In-View-Of(/, any D /a F). (18), then, is the implicature conveyed by a typical use of a conversationally relevant description. How \"in view of .f\" is to be interpreted is up to the hearer to find out, but we may assume that possible values for f come from a list that is scanned by the hearer until a particular item on the list provides a satisfactory interpretation. Such a list may contain the following (see Kratzer 1981, 44-45, for possible-world interpretation):","• FactuoJ: In view of facts of such and such kinds... (including institutional facts such as what the law is).","aPhrases such as \"what is known, ~ \"our moral convic-tions, n \"what the facts are, ~ and so on are represented by Krat~er u functions from possible worlds to sets of propositions. For example, \"what is known ~ is represented as a funo tion J\" which assigns sets of propositions to possible worlds such that for each possible world w, f(w) contains all the propositions that are known in that world. According to Kratser's first suggestion, for any function / from worlds to sets of propositions, and for every proposition P, \"It must be the case that P in view of f' is true in to just in case/(to) entails P. As Kratler notes, this is only the first step in the elucidation of the meaning of modal verbs, and it works only when .f(to) is guaranteed to be consistent (as is indeed the case when f is \"what is known ~ ). When/(to) can be inconsistent (e.g., when [ is ,d~ the/,Lw/e ), problems arise, which Kratzer solves using the concept of the set of all consistent subsets.","• Epiatemi¢: In view of what is known... (or alternatively, what is believed, assumed, hypothesised, and so on).","• Stereotypical: In view of the normal course of events...","• Deontic: In view of what is the right thing to do...","• Teleoloqical: In view of our objectives ... (or alternatively, our wishes, our intentions, and SO on). While the l~t may turn out to be much longer, there is no reason to assume that it will be infinite.","The assumption that a conversationally relevant description is used to implicate a modal operator provides a formal reason why in paradigmatically attributive uses, if nothing fits the description, the speech act as a whole must fail. If (18) is part of what the speaker means in these cases, the description is within the scope of a modal operator, hence, within an intensional context in which substitution is not guaranteed to be a valid form of ;nference. Suppose that Ralph asserts that in view of what we know about the normal human propensity for violence, Smith's murderer, whoever he is, must be insane; and suppose Ralph thinks that Smith's murderer is Jane's uncle. Substituting \"Jane's uncle s for ~Smith's murderer\" yields the wrong result: it is not the case that in view of what we know about the normal human propensity for violence, Jane's uncle, whoever he is, must be insane. Since in general substitution is not allowed in intensional contexts, when the description fads (i.e., no one murdered Smith), Ralph's speech act must fail too. The fact that he may know quite well who he thought the culprit was does not matter.","By way of summary, here are the steps that a hearer might go through in calculating the implicature that is typically intended when a conversationally relevant description is used: 1. Recognising a conversationally relevant de-","scription 2. Identifying the universal generalization 3. Postulating an intensional justification 4. Locating an appropriate set of propositions rel-","ative to which the modal operator is interpreted","Of course, this mechanism is much more flexible than I make it out to be, and a speaker can use it to satisfy various other goals. For example, a definite description can be used to provide information [Appelt 1985], or to highlight shared knowledge, or simply to avoid mechanical repetition of a proper name. The following quotation illustrates how a conversationally relevant description can achieve all these goals simultaneously:"]},{"title":"65","paragraphs":["19 In the Democratic primaries, Mr. Jackson, who is considered a long shot for the Vice-Presidential nomination, received more than seven million votes.

There is nothing in view of which it m~t be the case that any 46 year old Chicago clergyman has not said whether he wants the second spot on the democratic ticket. Thus, the implicature that usually accompanies a conversationally relevant description is ruled out. Nor is there an obvious implicit description that is used to convey a similar implicature.

Still, the use of conversationally relevant descriptions is clearly not restricted to assertions.
