The most","popular parsing method for context-free natural lan-","guage grammars, is the genera/ context-free parsing","method of Earley [1]. It was noted by Lang [2], that","Earley-like methods can be used for simulating a class","of non-determlnistic pushdown antomata(NPDA). Re-","cently, Tondta [3] presented an algorithm that simulates","non-determlnistic LRoparsers, and claimed it to be a fast","Mgorithm for practical natural language processing sys-","tems. The purpose of the present paper is threefold:","1 A novel formalism is presented for Earley-like parsers. A key rSle herein is played by the concept of bilinear grammaxs. These are defined as context-free grammars, that satisfy the constraint that the right hand side of each grammar rule have at most two non-terminals. The construction of parse matrices • for bilinear grammars can be accomplished in cubic time, by an algorithm called C-paxser. It includes an elegant way to represent the (possibly infinite) set of parse trees. A case in point is the use of predict functions, which impose restrictions on the parse matrix, if part of it is known. The exact form and effectiveness of predict functions depend on the bilineax grammar at hand. In order to parse a genera] context-free grammar G, a possible strategy is to define a cover for G that satisfies the bilinear grammar constraint, and subsequently parse it with C-parser using appropriate predict functions. The resulting parsers axe named Earley-like, and differ only in the precise description for deriving covers, and predict functions.","2 We present the Lang algorithm by giving a bilinear grammar corresponding to an NPDA. Employing the correct predict functions, the parser for this grammar is equivalent to Lang's algorithm, although it works for a slightly different class of NPDA's. We show that simulation of non-deterministic LR-parsers can be performed in our version of the Lang framework. It follows that Earley-like Tomita parsers can handle all context-free grammars, including cyclic ones, although Tomita suggested differently[3].","3 The formalism is illustrated by applying it to Recursire Transition Networka(RTN)[S]: Applying the techniques of deterministic LR-parsing to grammars written as RTN's has been the subject of recent studies [9,10]. Using this research, we show how to construct efficient non-deterministic LR-parsers for RTN's."]},{"title":"2 C-Parser","paragraphs":["The simplest parser that is applicable to all context-free languages, is the well-known Cocke-Younger-Kasa~i (CYK) parser. It requires the grammar to be cast in Chomsky normal form. The CYK parser constructs, for the sentence zl ..zn, a parse matrix T. To each part zi+1 ..zj of the input corresponds the matrix element T.j, the value of which is a set of non-terminals from which one can derive zi+1..zj. The algorithm can easily be generalized to work for any grammar, but its complexity then increases with the number of non-terminals at the right hand side of grammar rules. Bilinear grammars have the lowest complexity, disregarding linear grammars which do not have the generative power of general context-free grammars.

We adopt restrictions on NPDA's similarly to [2], the main one being that one or two symbols be pushed on the stack in a singie move, and each stark symbol is removed when it is read. If two symbols &re pushed on the sta~k, the bottom one must be identical to the symbol that is removed in the same transition. Formally we write an NPDA as & 7-tuple (Q, E, r, 6, q0, Co, F), where Q is the set of state symbols, E the input alphabet, r the pnshdown symbols, 6 : Q x (I\" tJ {e}) × (E U {¢}) --* 2 Qx((~}uru(rxr)) the transition function, qo E Q the initial state, ¢0 E 1̀the start symbol, and F C_ Q is the set of final states.

In this section we wish to show that an alternative method exists, and, moreover, that it can be applied to the class of bilinear tadpole grammars. This class consists of all bilineax grammars without epsilon rules, and with no useless symbols, with non-termlnals (the head) preceding terminals (the tail) at the right hand side of rules.Thus, rules are of the form A -* a6, where we use the symbol 6 as a variable over possibly empty sequences of terminals, and a denotes a possibly empty sequence of at most two non-terminals. Capital romu letters are used for non-terminals. Note that a CNLR cover is a member of this class of grammars, as are all grammars that are in Chomsky normal form.","First we change the grammar a little bit by adding q0 to the set of non-terminals of the grammar, assum-ing that it was not there yet. Next, we create a new 140 grammar, inspired by the grammar of 5.3.1, with pairs < A, C > as non=terminals. The rules of the new grammar are such that (with implicit universal quantification over all variables, as before) < A, C >-..~ 6 -- A -.~ 6 < A,C >.--~< B,C > 6 m__A..-~ B6 < A,C >-~< B,C >< D,B > 8 =_ A-. BD8 The start symbol of the new grammar, which can be seen as a parametrized version of the tadpole grammar, is defined to be < S, qo >. A non-terminal < B, C > is a useful one, whence C E ~(B) according to the definition of ~, if it occurs in a derivation of the parametrized grammar: < S, qo >---\" ~ < B, C > A, where i¢ is an arbitrary sequence of non-terminals, and A is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Then, we conclude that q0 E ~(B) -< S, q0 >-.'< B, q0 > A C E ~r(B) ̂C <> q0 --- 3A,~(< A,C >--'< B,C >/, ̂< S, qo >--* \" s < C,D >< A,C > A) This definition may be rephrased without reference to the parametrized grammar.

This correspondence between their non-terminals leads to a tight connection between the two covers. Indeed, the cover we obtained from the LL/LR-automaton can be obtained from the cover of section 4, by eliminating the e-rules-I~ ~ --~ e. Of course, the predict functions associated to both covers differ considerably, as it axe the non-terminals deriving e, the items beginning with a dot, that axe the object of prediction in the Earley algorithm, and they axe no longer present in the LL/LR-cover. 9 Efficiency We have discussed a number of bilinear covers now, and we could add many more. In fact, the space of bilinear covers for each context-free grammar, or RTN grammar, is huge. The optimal one would be the one that makes C-parser spend the least time on the average sentence. In general, the least time will be more or less equivalent to the smallest content of the parse matrix. Naively, this content would be proportional to the size of the cover. Under this assumption, the smallest cover would be optimal. Note that the number of non-terminals of the CNLR cover is equal to the number of states of the LR-antomaton plus the number of non-terminals of the original grammar. The size of the Earley cover is given by the number of items. In worst case situations the size of the CNLR cover is an exponential function of the size of the original grammar, whereas the size of the Ea~ley cover dearly grows linearly with the size of the original grammar. For many grammars, however, the number of LR(0)-states, may be considerably smaller than the number of items. This seems to be the case for the natural language grammaxs considered by Tomita[3]. His 141 data even suggest that the number of LR(0) states is a sub-linear function of the original grammar size. Note, however, that predict functions may influence the relation between grammar size and average parse matrix content, as some grammars may allow more restrictive predict functions then others. Summarizing, it seems unlikely, that a single parsing approach would be optimal for all grammars. A viable goal of research would be to find methods for determining the optimal cover for a given grammar. Such research should have a solid experimental back-bone.","The matter gets still more complicated when the original grammar is an attribute grammar. Attribute evaluation may lead to the rejection of certain parse trees that are correct for the grammar without attributes. Then the ease and efficiency of on-the-fly attribute evaluation becomes important, in order to stop wrong parses as soon as possible. In the Rosetta machine transla-tion system [11,12], we use an attributed RTN during the analysis of sentences. The attribute evaluation is bottom-up only, and designed in such a way that the grammar is covered by an attributed Earley cover.","Other points concerning efficiency that we would like to discuss, are issues of precomputation. In the conventional Earley parser, the calculation of the cover is done dynamically, while parsing a sentence. However, it could just as well be done statically, i.e. before parsing, in order to increase parsing performance. For instance, set operations can be implemented more efficiently if the set elements are known non-terminals, rather than unknown items, although this would depend on the choice of programming language. The procedure of generating bilinear covers from LR-antomata should always be performed statically, because of the amount of computation involved. Tomita has reported [3], that for a number of grammars, his parsing method turns out to be more eflicient than the Earley ~gorithm. It is not clear, whether his results would still hold if the creation of the cover for the Earley parser were being done statically.","Onedmight be inclined to think that if use is made of precomputed sets of items, as in LR-parsers, one is bound to have a parser that is significantly different from and probably faster than Earley's algorithm, which computes these sets at parse time. The question is much more subtle as we showed in this paper. On the one hand, non-deterministic LR-parsing comes down to the use of certain covers for the grammar at hand, just like the Earley algorithm. Reversely, we showed that the Earley cover can, with minor modifications, be obtained from the LL/LR-automaton, which also uses precomputed sets of items."]},{"title":"10 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We studied parsing of general context-free languages, by splitting the process into two parts. Firstly, the grammar is turned into bilinear grammar format, and subsequently a general parser for bilinear grammars is applied. Our view on the relation between parsers and covers is similar to the work on covers of Nijholt [7] for grammars that are deterministically parsable.","We established that the Lung algorithm for simulating pushdown automata, hides a prescription for deriving bilinear covers from automata that satisfy certain constraints. Reversely, the LR-parser construction technique has been presented as a way to derive automata from certain bilinear grammars.","We found that the Earley algorithm is intimately related to an automaton that simulates non-deterministic LL-parsing and, furthermore, that non-deterministic LR-automata provide general parsers for context-free grammars, with the same complexity as the Earley algorithm. It should be noted, however, that there are as many parsers with this property, as there are ways to obtain bilinear covers for a given grammar."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1 Earley, J. 1970.
