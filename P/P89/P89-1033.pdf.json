Lambek Calculus (LC) constitutes an example for a natural deduction 1 style parsing method.","In natural language processing, the task of a parser usually consists in finding derivations for all different readings of a sentence. The original Lambek Calculus, when it is used as a parser/theorem prover, has the undesirable property of allowing for the derivation of more than one proof for a reading of a sentence, in the general case.","In order to overcome this inconvenience and to turn Lambek Calculus into a reasonable parsing method, we show the existence of \"relative\" normal form proof trees and make use of their properties to constrain the proof procedure in the desired way."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Sophisticated techniques have been developed for the implementation of parsers for (augmented) context-free grammars.

One solution to this problem is to describe normal forms for equivalent derivations and to use this knowledge to prune the search space of the parsing process [Hepple/Morrill 1989].","Other approaches to cope with the problem of spurious ambiguity take into account the pecularities of categorial grammars compared to grammars With \"context-free skeleton\". One characteristic of categorial grammars is the shift of information from the grammar rules into the lexicon: grammar rules are mere combination schemata whereas syntactic categories do not have to be atomic items as in the \"context-free\" formalisms, but can also be structured objects as well.","The inference rule of a Hilbert-style deduction system does not refer to the internal structure of the propositions which it deals with. The alternative to Hilbert-style deduction is natural deduction (in the broad sense of the word) which is \"natural\" in so far as at least some of the inference rules of a natural deduction system describe explicitly how logical operators have to be treated. Therefore natural deduction style proof systems are in principle good candidates to function as a framework for categorial grammar parsers. If one considers categories as formulae, then a proof system would have to refer to the operators which are used in those formulae."]},{"title":"272","paragraphs":["The natural deduction approach to parsing with categorial grammars splits up into two general mainstreams both of which use the Gentzen sequent representation to state the corresponding calculi. The first alternative is to take a general purpose calculus and propose an adequate transla-tion of categories into formulae of this logic. An example for this approach has been carried out by Pareschi [Pareschi 1988], [Pareschi 1989]. On the other hand, one might use a specialized calculus. Lambek proposed such a calculus for categorial grammar more than three decades ago [Lambek 1958].","The aim of this paper is to describe how Lambek Calculus can be implemented in such a way that it serves as an efficient parsing mechanism. To achieve this goal, the main drawback of the original Lambek Calculus, which consists of a version of the \"spurious ambiguity problem\", has to be overcome. In Lambek Calculus, this overgeneration of derivations is due to the fact that the calculus itself does not giye enough constraints on the order in which the inference rules have to be applied.","In section 2 of the paper, we present Lambek Calculus in more detail. Section 3 consists of the proof for the existence of normal form proof trees relative to the readings of a sentence.

There is no room to express additional constraints concerning the combination of categories. Clearly, some kind of feature handling mechanism is needed to enable the grammar writer to state e.g. conditions on the agreement of morpho-syntactic features or to describe control phenomena. For the reason of linguistic expressiveness and to facilitate the description of the parsing algorithm below, 273 we extend Lambek Calculus to Unification Lambek Calculus (ULC).","First, the definition of basic category must be adapted: a basic category consists of an atomic category name and feature description. (For the definition of feature descriptions or feature terms see [Smolka 1988].) For complex categories, the same recursive definition applies as before. The syntax for categories in ULC is given informally in figure 4 which shows the category of a control verb like \"persuade\". We assume that variable names for feature descriptions are local to each category in a sequent. The (/:left)- and (\\:left)-inference rules have to take care of the substitutions which are involved in handling the variables in the extended categories (figure 5). Heed that the substitu-tion function o\" has scope over a whole sequent, and therefore, over a complete subproof, and not only over a single category.

In this section, we show that such a set of a possibly abundant number of proofs for the same reading of a sequent possesses one distinguished member which can be regarded as the representative or the normal form proof tree for this set.","In order to be able to use the notion of a \"reading\" more precisely, we undertake the following definition of structures which determine readings for our purposes. Because of their similarity to syntax trees as used with context-free grammars, we also call them \"syntax trees\" for the sake of simplicity. Since, on the semantic level, the use of a \"left'-rule in Lambek Calculus corresponds to the functional application of a functor term to some argument and the \"right\"-rules are equivalent to functional abstraction [van Benthem 1986], it is essential that in a syntax tree, a trace for each of these steps in a derivation be represented. Then it is guaranteed that the semantic representation of a sentence can be constructed from a syntax tree which is annotated by the appropriate partial semantic expressions of whatever semantic representation language one chooses. Structurally distinct syntax trees amount to different semantic expressions.","A syntax tree t condenses the information of a proof for a sequent s in the following way:","1. Labels of single.node trees, are either lexical categories or arguments of lexical categories. 2. The root of a non.trivial tree has either","(a) one daughter tree whose root is labelled with the value category of the root's label. This case catches the application of a \"right'-inference rule; or","(b) two daughter trees. The label of the root node is the value category, the label of the root of one daughter is the functor, and the label of the root of the other daughter is the argument category of an application of a \"left\"-inference rule.","Since the size of a proof for a sequent is correlated linearily to the number of operators which occur in the sequent, different proof trees for the same sequent do not differ in terms of size - they are merely structurally distinct. The task of deft-274 ning those relative normal forms of proofs, which we are aiming at, amounts to describing proof trees of a certain structure which can be more easily correlated with syntax trees as would possibly be the case for other proofs of the same set of proofs.","The outline of the proof for the existence of normal form proof trees in Lambek Calculus is the following: Each proof tree of the set of proof trees for one reading of a sentence, i.e. a sequent, is mapped onto the syntax tree which represents this reading.

This is obviously not the way one wants to take when parsing a sentence. The goal is to construct the normal form proof directly. For this purpose, a description of the properties which distinguish normal form proofs from non-normal form proofs is required.","The essence of a proof tree is its nesting of current functors which can be regarded as a partial order on the set of current functors occuring in this specific proof tree. Since the current functors of two different rule applications might, coincidently, be the same form of category, obviously some kind of information is missing which would make all current functors of a proof tree (and hence of a syntax tree) pairwise distinct. This happens by stating which subsequence the head of the current functor spans over. As for information on a subsequence, it is sufficient to know where it starts and where it ends.","Here is the point where we make use of the expressiveness of ULC. We do not only add the start and end position information to the head of a complex category but also to its other basic subcategories, since this information will be used e.g. for making up subgoals.
