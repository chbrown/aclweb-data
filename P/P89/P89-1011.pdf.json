Most theories assume that the candidates in this cohort are successively whittled down both on the basis of further acoustic-phonetic or phonological information, as more of the speech input becomes available, end on the basis of the candidates' compatibility with the linguistic and extralingulstie context of utterance. When only one candidate remains, word recognition is said to have taken place.","Most psycholinguistlc work in this area has focussed on the process of word recognition"]},{"title":"after","paragraphs":["a cohort of candidates has been selected, emphasising the role of further lexical or 'higher-level' linguistic constraints such as word frequency, lexical semantic relations, or syntactic and semantic congruity of candidates with the linguistic context (e.g. Bradley & Forster, 1987; Marslen-Wilson & Welsh. 1978). The few explicit and well-developed models of lexical access and word recognition in continuous speech (e.g. TRACE, McCleliand & Elman, 1986) have small and tmrealistic lexicons of. at most, a few hundred words and ignore phonological processes which occur in fluent speech. Therefore, they tend to ove~.stlmatz the amount and reliability, of acoustic information which can be directly extracted from the speech signal (either by human or machine) and make unrealistic and overly-optimistic assumptions concerning the size and diversity of candidates in a typical cohort. This, in turn, casts doubt on the real efficacy of the putative mechanisms which are intended to select the correct word from the cohort.","The bulk of engineering systems for speech recognition have finessed the issues of lexical access and word recognition by attempting to map directly from the acoustic signal to candidate words by pairing words with acoustic representations of the canonical pronunciation of the word in the lexicon and employing pattern-matching, best-fit techniques to select the most likely candidate (e.g. Sakoe & Chiba, 1971). However, these techniques have only proved effective for isolated word recognition of small vocabularies with the system trained to an individual speaker, as, for example, Zue & Huuonlocher (1983) argue. Furthermore, any direct access model of this type which does not incorporate a pre-lexical symbolic representation of the input will have di£ficulty capturing many rule-governed phonological processes which affect the ~onunciation of words in fluent speech. since these processes can only be chazacteris~ adequately in terms of operations on a symbolic, phonological representation of the speech input (e.g. Church. 1987; Frazier, 1987; Wiese, 1986).","The research reported here forms part of an ongoing programme to develop a computationally explicit account of lexical access and word recognition in connected s1~e-~_~, which is at least informed by experimental results concerning the psychological processes and mechanisms which underlie this task.

The querying facilities can be used to explore the lexical structure of English and simulate different approaches to lexical access and word recognition. Previous work in this area has often relied on small illustrative lexicons which tends to lead to overestimation of the effectiveness of various approaches.","There are two broad questions to ask concerning the process of lexical access.

The phonetic trmmcriptlon of one possible utterance of (la) in (lb) demonstrates some of the problems involved in any 'dL,~ct' mapping from the speech input to lexical enu'ies not mediated by the application of phonological rules. For example, the palatalisation of final/d/before/y/in /did/means that any attempt to relate that portion of the W'~e¢___h input to the lexicel entry for d/d is h'kely to fail. Sitrfi/ar points can be made about the flapping and glottalisadon of the B/phonemes in/hit/and/It/, and the vowel reductions to schwa. In addition.

Church (1987) and Frazier (1987) argue persuasively that, far fxom creating problems, such phonological processes provide imporu~ clues to the correct syllabic segmentation of the input and thus, to the locadon of word bounderies. However, this argument only goes through on ~ assump6on that quire derailed 'narrow' phonetic information is recovered from the signal, such as aspiration of M in/rE/ and /tam/ in (1) in order m recoguise tim preceding syllable botmdsrles. It is only in. terms of this represer~,tion that phonological processes c~m be recoguised and their effects 'undone' in order to allow correct matching of the input against the canonical phonological represenU~ons contained in lexical entries.","Other researchers (e.g. Shipman & Zne, 1982)have argued (in the context of isolated word recogu/tion) that the initial representation which contacts the lexicon should be a broad mmmer-class transcription of the stressed syllables in the speech signal. The evidence in favot~ of this approach is, firstly, that extraction of more detailed information is nouniously diffic~dt and, secondly, that a broad transcription of this type appears to be vexy effective in partit/oning the English lexicon into small cohom. For example, Huttenlocher (1985) reports an average cohort size of 21 words for a 20,000 word lexicon using a six-camgory manner of articulation transcription scheme (employing the categories: Stop, Strong-Fricative, Weak-Fricative, Nasal, Glide-Liquid, and Vowel).","This claim suggests that the English lexicon is functionally organised to favour a system which initiates lex/cal access from a broad manner class pre-lexical representation, because most of the discriminatory iv.formation between different words is concentra~i in the manner articulation of stressed syllables. Elsewhere, we have argued that these ideas are mis|-~d;_ngly presented and that there is, in fact, no significant advantage for manner information in suessed syllables (e.g. Carter et al., 1987; Caner, 1987, 1989). We found that there is no advantage per s~ to a manner class analysis of stressed syllables, since a similar malysis of unstressed syllables is as discriminatory and yields as good a partitioning of the English lexicon. However, concantrating on a full phonemic malysis of stressed syllables provides about 10% more information them a similer analysis of tmstressed syllables. This research suggests, then, that the pre-lexical represenw.ion used to initiate lexical access can only afford m concentram exclusively on stressed syllables ff these are analysed (at least) phonemically. None of these studies consider the extracud~ility of the classifications fxom speech input however, whilst there is a g~m~ral belief that it is easier to extract infonnation from stressed portions of the signal, the~ is little reason to believe that mariner class infm'mation is, in general, more or less accessible than other phonologically relevant features.","A second argument which can be made against the use of broad represmUstions to contact the lexicon (in the context of conn~ speech) is that such representations will not support the phonological parsing n~essary to 'undo\" such processes as palatallsation. For example, in (1) the final/d/of d/d will be realised as/j/ and camgurised as a sarong-fricative followed by liquid-glide using the proposed broad manner ~ransoripfion. Therefore. palamlisadon will need m be recoguised before the required stop-vowel-stop represenr~ion can be recovered and used to initiate lexical access. However, applying such phonological rules in a constrained and useful manner requires a more detailed input transcription. Palamllsation inustra~es this point very cle~ly; not all sequences which will be transcribed as strong-fl'lcative followed by liquid-glide can undergo this process by any means (e.g. /81/), but there will be no way of preventing the rule oven-applying in many inappropriate conmxts and thus presumably leading to the get.ration of many spurious word candidates."]},{"title":"85","paragraphs":["A third argument against the use of exclusively broad representations is that these representations will not support the effective recognition of syllable-boundaries and some word-boundaries on the basis of phonotactic and other phonological sequencing constraints. For example, Church (1987) proposes an initial syllabification of the input as a prerequisite to l~dcal access, but his sylla \"bificafion of the speech input exploits phonotactic constraints and relies on the extraction of allophonic features, such as aspiration, to guide this process. Similarly, Harringmn et al. (1988) argue that approximately 45% of word boundaries are, in principle, recognisable because they occur in phoneme sequences which are rare or forbidden word-internally. However, exploitation of these English phonological constraints would be considerably impaired if the pre-lexical representation of the input is restricted to a broad classification.","h might seem self-evident that people are able to recognise phonemes in speech, but in fact the psychological evidence suggests that this ability is mediated by the output of the word recognition process rather than being an essential prerequisite to its success. Phoneme-monimrin 8 experiments, in which subjects listen for specified phonemes in speech, are sensitive to lexical effects such as word frequency, semmfic association, and so forth (see Cutler et al., 1987 for a summary of the expemnen~ literature and putative explmation of the effect), suggesting that information concemm 8 at least some of the phonetic contain of a word is not available until after the word is recoguised. Thus, people's ability to recognise phonemes tells us very little about the nann~ of the representation used to initiate lexical access. Better (but still indireoO evidence comes from mispronunciation monitoring and phoneme confusion experiments (Cole, 1973; Miller & Nicely, 1955; Sheperd, 1972) which suggest that tlsteners eere likdy to confuse or ~ phonemes along the dimensions predicted by distinctive feature theory. Most e~rcn result in reporting phonemes which differ in only one feanu~ from the target, This result suggests that listenexs are actively considering detailed phonetic information along a munber of dimemions (rather than simply, say, manner of articulation).","Theoretical and experimental considerations suggest then that, regardless of the current capabilities of automated acoustic-phonetic fxont-ends, sysmms must be developed to extract as phonetically detailed a pm-lexical phonological represemation as possible. Without such a representation, phonological processes cannot be effectively recoguL~i and compensated for in the word recognition process and the 'extra' information conveyed in stressed syllables cannot be exploited. Nevertheless in fluent connected speech, unstressed syllables often undergo phonological processes which render them highly indemmlinam; for example, the vowel reductions in (I). Therefore, it is implausible m assume that my (human or machine) front-end will always output an accurate narrow phonetic, phonemic of perhaps even broad (say, manner class) mmscription of the speech input. For this reason, fur~er processes involved in lexical access will need to function effectively despim the very variable quality of information extracted from the speech signal.","This last point creates a serious difficulty for the design of effective phonological parsers. Church (1987), for example, allows himself the idealisation of an accurate 'nsrmw' phonetic transcription. It remains to be demonstramd that any parsing mclmiques developed for determlnam symbolic input will transfer effectively to real speech input (and such a test may have to await considerably better automated front-ends). For the purposes of the next section. I assume that some such account of phonological parsing can be developed and that the pre-lexical representation used to initiate lexical access is one in which phonological processes have been 'undone' in order to consuuct a representation close to the canonical (phonemic) representation of a word's pronunciation. However, I do not assume that this representation will necessarily be accuram to the same degree of detail throughout the input."]},{"title":"LEXICAL ACCESS STRATEGIES","paragraphs":["Any theory of word recognition must provide a mechanism for the segmentation of connected speech into words. In effect, the theory must explain how the process of lexical access is triggered at appropriate points in the speech signal in the absence of completely reliable phonetic/phonological cues to word boundaries. The various theories of lexical access and word recognition in conneomd speech propose mechanisms which appear to cover the full specumm of logical possibilities. Klan (1979) suggests that lexicai access is triggered off each successive spectral frame derived from the signal (i.e. approximately every 5 msecs.), McClelland & Elman (1986) suggest each successive phoneme, Church (1987) suggests each syllable onset, Grosjean & Gee (1987) suggest each stressed syllable onset, aud Curler & Norris (1985) suggest each pmsodiceliy smmg syllable onset. Finally, Maralan-Wilson & Welsh (1978) suggest that segmentation of the speech input and recognition of word boundaries is an indivisible process in which the endpoint of the previous word defines the point at which lexical access is Iriggered again.","Some of these access strategies have been evaluated with respect to three input transcriptions (which are plausible candidates for the pre-lexical represen~uion on the basis of the work discussed in the previous section) in the context of a realistic sized lexicon.

It was assumed, for the purposes of the experiment, that look-up off weak syllables would be restricted to closed-class vocabulary, would not extend into a strong syllable, and that this process would precede attempts to incorporate a weak syllable *backwards' into an open-class word.","The direct access approach was not considered because of its implausibility in the light of the discussion in the previous section. The stressed syllable account is v=y slmilar to the strong syllable approach, but given the problem of stress shift in fluent speech, a formulation in unms of strong syllables, which are defined in terms of the absence of vowel reduction, is preferable.","Work by Marslen-Wilson and his colleagues (e.g. Marslen-Wilson & Warren. 1987) suggests that, whatever access strategy is used, there is no delay in the availability of information derived fi'om the speech signal to furth= select from the cohort of word candidates. This suggests that s model in which units (say syllables) of the pre-lexical representation are 'pre-packaged' and then used to wlgser a look-up attempt are implausible. Rathe~ the look-up process must involve the continuous integration of information from the pre-lexical representation immediately it becomes available. Thus the question of access strategy concerns only the points at which this look-up process is initiated.","In order to simulate the continuous aspect of lexlcel access using the dictionary database, d~:__M3_ase look-up queries for each strategy were initiated using the two phonemes/segments Horn the trigger point and then again with three phonemes/segmonts and so on until no hu~er English words in the database were compatible with the look-up query (except for closed-class access with the strong syllable strategy where a strong syllable boundary terminated the sequence of accesses). The size of the resulting cohorts was measured for each successively larger query;, for example, using a fine class transcription and triggering access from the /r/ of rainbow yields an initial cohort of 89 cmdidams compatible with/re//. This cohort drops to 12 words when /n/ is added and to 1 word when /b/ is also included and finally goes to 0 when the vowel of/s is -dO,'d= Each sequence of queries of this type which all begin at the same point in the signal will be refened to as an access path.

This problem becomes considerably worse when moving to a less determinate transcription, illustrating very clearly the undesirable consequences of ignoring the basic linguistio constraint that word boundaries occur at syllable boundaries.

This essmnption is based on the Cohort theory claim (e.g. Marslan-Wilsun & Welsh, 1978) that words can be recogulsed before their acoustic offset, using syntactic and semantic expectations to filter the cohort. This claim has been challenged experimentally by Grosjean (1985) and Bard et al. (1988) who demcmstrate that many monosyllabic words in context are not recognised until after their acoustic offset. The experiment reported here supports this expesimental result because even with the fine class transcription there are 5 word candM~t_~ which extend beyond the correct word boundary end 11 full matches which end before the correct boundary.

It seems implausible that expectation-based corm~ainm could be powerful enough to correcdy select a unique candidate before its acoustic offset in all contexts. Therefore, the results for the word strategy reported here are overly-optim.isdc, because in order to guarantee that the correct sequence of words are in the cohorts recovered from the input, a lexical access system based on the word strategy would need to operate nondemrministically; that is, it would need to consider several pumndal word boundaries in most cases. Therefore, the results for a practicM syr.em based on Otis approach am likely to be significantly worse.","The syllable strategy is effective under the assumption of • determinate and accurate phonemic prelexieal representation, but once we abandon this idealisation, the effectiveness of this strategy declines ~trply.

Further theoretical evidence in support of the strong syllable strategy is provided by Cutler & Carter (1987) who demmmtrate that a listener is six times more likely to e~mter a word with a prosodically strong initial syllable than one with a weak initial syllable when listening to English speech. Experimental evidence is provided by Cutler & Norris (1988) who report results which suggest that listeners tend to treat strong, but not weak, syllables as appropriate points at which to undertake pre-lexical segmentation of the speech input.","The architecture of a lexical access system based on the syllable strategy can be quite simple in terms of the organisation of the lexicon and its access routines.
