The type inheritance mechanism is mainly used to classify common properties of the bilingual lexicon (sect. 1), and rewriting is fully exploited to describe the relation between a surface structure produced by a unification-based parser and the abstract structme used for transfer (sect. 2), and to describe the relation between Japanese and English structures (sect. 3). An example is detailed in sect. 4. 1. LEXICAL TRANSFER AS A HIERARCHY OF BILINGUAL LEXICAL DEFINITIONS","The type system is used to describe a hierarchy of concepts, where a sub-concept inherits all of the properties of its super-concepts. The use of type inheritance to describe the hierarchy of lexical types is advocated for example in [Pollard and Sag 1987, \" chap.8].","We use a type hierarchy to describe properties which are common to"]},{"title":"bilingual","paragraphs":["classes of the bilingual lexicon. The level of description of the bilingual lexicon is the logico-semantic level: a verb for example has a relational role and links different objects through semantic relations (agent, recipient, space-location .... ). Semantic relations in the bilingual lexicon are common to English and Japanese.","Predicates can be classified according to the semantic relations they establish between objects. For example, predicates which have only an agent case are defined as Agent-Verbs, and verbs which also have a recipient role are defined as Agent-Recipient-Verbs, a sub-class of Agent-Verbs. On the leaves of the hierarchy, we find the actual bilingual entries, which describe only idiosyncratic properties, and thus are very simple.","The translation relation defined by TRANSLATE is described in sect. 3. We shall concentrate on the propositional part PROP defined here as a disjunction of types:","PROP = SPEAKER I HEARER I REG-~mM I BOCK r ASK I ~ I TCt~4 I NEGATIC~ ...","The simple hierarchy depicted graphically Figure 1 is written as follows:","VERB s [japanese:JV[relaticn:JPROP], english:EJ [relation:EPROP] ].","AG-VERB = VERB[japanese: [agant:#j-ag], english: [agent: #e-ag], trans-ag: PR~P","[ japanese: #j-ag,","english: #e-ag] ]. in This definition can be read: an Agent-Verb"]},{"title":"is-a","paragraphs":["Verb which"]},{"title":"has-properties","paragraphs":["agent for Japanese and English. We need to express how the arguments of a relation are translated. This is specified using a trar~late-ag slot with type symbol Pimp, which will be used during the rewriting process (see details in sect 3 and 4). Symbols prefixed with # are tags, which are used to represent co-references (~sharing>O of slructures.","In this clef'tuition, we have a one-to-one mapping between the agent argument, and at this level of representation (semantic relations), this simple case arises frequently. However, we must also describe mappings between structures which do not have such simple correspondence, such as idiomatic expressions. In that case, we have to describe the relation between predicate-argument structures in a more complex way, as shown for example in sect.4.","AG-BEC-V = ~C--V [ japanese: [recipient: #j-recp], english: [recipient: #e-recp], trans-recp: P~ [japanese: #j-recp,","english: #e-recp] ].",";CJ-REC-OBJ-V ~ ~J-BEC-V [japanese: [object: #j-obj], english: [object: #e-obj], trans-obj :PBOP [ japanese: #j-obj,","eng] 18h: #e-obj ] ].

PROP"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["°°''\" SPEAKER HEARER REG-FORM ASK SEND Figure 1: a simple hierarchy of types.","The type system is interpreted using the rewriting mechanism described in [Ait-Kaci 84], which gives an operational semantics for type inheritance: a feature structure which has a type ~3--v for example is unified with the definition of this type: [ japanese: [agent: #j-ag], english: [agent: #e-ag], trans-ag: PBOP [ japanese: #j-ag,","~glish: #e-ag] ] and the type symbol AG-V is replaced with the super-type VERB in the result of the unification. If type VERB has a deC'tuition, the structure is further rewritten, thus achieving the operational interpretation of inheritance. Disjunctions like Pt~Dp create a non-deterministic choice for further rewriting: the symbol E,I~Dp is replaced with the disjunction of symbols of the righthand-side creating alternative paths in the rewriting process. This process of rewriting is applied on every 2 sub-structure of a structure to be evaluated, until no type symbol can be rewritten.","As the rewriting system does not have any explicit control mechanism for rule application, whenever several rules are applicable all paths are explored, and all solutions are produced in a non deterministic way. This could be a drawback for a practical machine translation system, as only one translation should be produced in the end, and due to the non deterministic behavior of the system, this could also lead to severe efficiency problems. However, the system is primarily intended to be used as a tool for developing a linguistic model, and thus the production of all possible solutions is necessary in order to make a detailed study of ambiguities.","Furthermore, according to the principles of second generation MT systems [Ynvge 57, Vauquois 75, Isabelle and Macklovitch 86], a transfer grammar should be purely contrastive, and should not include specific source or target language knowledge. As a result, the synthesis grammar should implement all necessary language specific constraints in order to rule out ungrammatical strucmr~ that could be produced after transfer, and make appropriate pragmatic decisions. 2. RELATING SURFACE AND ABSTRACT SPEECH ACTS","A problem in translating dialogues is to translate adequately the speaker's communicative strategy which is marked in the utterance, a problem that does not arise in text machine translation where a structural translation is generally found sufficient [Kume et al. 88]. Indirectness for example cannot be translated directly from the surface structure produced by a syntactic parser and needs to be further analyzed in terms independent of the peculiarities of the language [Kogure et al. 1988]. For example, take the representation produced by the parser for the sentence [Yoshimoto and Kogure 1988]: watashi-ni tourokuyoushi-wo o-okuri jtadake, masu ka"]},{"title":"I-dative","paragraphs":["registration-form-acc honor-send can-rT.eive-a-favor"]},{"title":"polite interr Figure 2: example of a Japanese sentence","paragraphs":["The representation has already categorized to a certain extent surface speech acts types.

For example, one can write directly SP~ instead of PROP in the trans-spk slot of the above definition. Another possibility for a mono-directional system is to access the bilingual lexicon using the Japanese entry during parsing. This means that the dictionaries of the system would have to be organized as a single integrated bilingual lexical rhtabas~.","Starting from the abstract speech act description, we need only one definition for specifying the direct mapping of Abstract Speech Acts by tagging, which also introduces the type symbol PROP that will trigger the rewriting process for the transfer grmnmar:. ~LA.~ -","[ japanese: JASA [speech-act-type: #sat, manner: #manner, speaker: #J-spk, hearer: #j-hrr, s-act: #j-act-u-PROP] ],","englimh: EASA [speech-act-type: #sat, manner: #manner, speaker: #e-spk, hearer: #e-hrr, s-act: #e-act=EPROP] ],","trans-act: PI%0P [ japanese: # j-act,","english: #e-act ] ],","trans-spk: PIK)P [japanese: # j-spk,","english: #e-spk] ],","trans-hrr: PROP [japanese: #j-hrr,","english: #e-hrr] ] .","In this simple example, the definition of the symbol PR3P contains the full bilingual dictionary. Unifying a structure with ~,l~Zi, means that a structure is unified with a very large disjunction of clef'tuitions. There are several possible ways to overcome this problem. One can use the hierarchical type system to restrict the set of candidates to a small sub-set of definitions and instead of using pROP, use the most adequate specific symbol for translating an argument: such a symbol can be viewed as the initial symbol of a sub-grammar which describes the transfer relation on a 4.

There could be one-to-one mapping between two substructures, but as in the example of 2~.X2H, the relation is in general not purely compositional, and not one-to-one, and argument description can be as refined as necessary. Here, the object TE-1 (<~hand>>) is a part of the meaning of ~touch~ in this kind of construction, and the semantic relation that links the predicate and the object being touched is a spatial destination in Japanese (perceived as a goal or a target) and an object in English.

The two main characteristics of the formalism are (1) type inheritance which provides a clean way of defining classes and sub-classes of objects, (2) the rewriting mechanism based on typed unification of feature structures which provide a powerful and semantically clear means of specifying (and computing) relations between classes of objects. This latex behavior is somehow similar to the PROLOG mechanism, and grammars can be written to be reversible, which is the case for our transfer grammar. We hope this feature will be useful in the future development of the grammar, allowing for a precise constrastive analysis of Japanese and English.","At present, the transfer grammar is in a very early stage of development but nevertheless, capable of translating a few elementary sentences. It covers basic sentence patterns; compound noun phrases and coordination of noun phrases; verb phrases including auxiliaries, medals and adverbs; sentence adverbials; conditionals.","The transfer module and the generation module [Emele 89] use the same formalism and integration is thus simple to achieve. As for efficiency considerations, the transfer and generation of the sentence in Figure 2 takes approximately 5 seconds on a Symbolics with our current implementation. However, this figure is not very meaningful because our dictionaries and grammars are still very small, and the implementution of the interpreter itself is still evolving.","Full integration with the analysis module (a unification-based parser which produces a set of feature structures) remains to be worked out, but should not cause major problems. In this respect, the closest related works are a transfer model proposed by ['Isabelle and Macklovitch 86] and a model in the LFG framework proposed by [Kudo and Nomura 86] (see also [Beaven and Whitelock 88).","There are two major topics for further research: I) the extension of the formalism to include full logical expressions, as described for example in [Smolka 88], and some kind of control mechanism in order to treat default values and prune some solutions (when an idiomatic expression is found for example); (2) the development of a transfer grammar for a larger language fragment, using outputs of the parser already available described in [Yoshimoto and Kogure 1988].
