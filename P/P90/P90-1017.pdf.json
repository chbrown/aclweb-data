In addition, the direct-mapping approach is not bidirectional in the general case. Thus, even if we did take (1,), (2,), and (3,) to be the translations for (1), (2), and (3), we would not be able to apply the same direct mapping on the English sentences of (1), (2), and (3) (translating in the opposite direction) because we would still need to translate like and usually into Spanish and German.

Furthermore, the pieces that have been solved are accounted for by mechanisms that are not general enough to carry over to other pieces of the problem, nor do they take advantage of cross-linguistic uniformities that can tie seemingly different languages together.","Gretchen Brown has provided a model of German-English translation that uses lezical semantic structures [Brown, 1974]. The work is related to the model developed for UNITRAN since both use a form of conceptual structure as the basis of translation. While this approach goes a long way toward solving a number of translation problems (especially compound noun disamhiguation), it falls short of providing a systematic solution to the thematic divergence problem. This is largely because the conceptual structure does not serve as a common representation for the source and target languages. Instead, it is used as a point of transfer, and as such, it is forced to encode certain language-specific idiosyncrasies such as the syntactic positioning of conceptual arguments. In terms of the representations used in UNITRAN, this approach is analogous to using a language-to-language mapping from the RLCS's of the source language to the RLCS's of the target language without using an intermediate language-independent structure as a pivot form. In","sit should be noted that promotion and demotion structruces are inverses of each other. Thus, although this CLCS looks somewhat \"English-like,\" it is possible to represent the CLCS as something that looks somewhat \"Spanish-like:\" [State Beclze","([Thing PERSON],","[Place ATcirc","([Thing PI~RSOiN],","[Event GOLoc","([Thing PERSON],","[Path TOLo©","([Place ATLoc ([Thing PERSON], [Place HOME])])])])],","[M ..... HABITUALLY])] In this case, we would need to use the :DEMOTE marker (see mechanism 3) instead of the :PROMOTE marker, but this marker would be used in the RLCS associated with usually instead of the RLCS associated with soler. The justification for using the \"English-like\" version for this example is that the [Manner HABITUALLY] constituent is generally thought of as an aspcctual clement associated with a predicate (e.g., in German, the sentence would be Ich gehe gewJhnlich nach Hause ('I go usually home')); this constituent cannot be used as a predicate in its own right. Thus, the complicated \"Spanish-like\" predicate-argument structure is not a likely conceptual representation for constructions that use [Manner HABITUALLY].","1°The default object being eaten is [Thing FOOD], although this is not syntactically realized in this example. this approach, there is no single language-independent mechanism that links the conceptual representation to the syntactic structure; thus, it is necessary to handcode the rules of thematic divergence for English and German, and all divergence generalizations are lost.","In 1982, Lytinen and Schank developed the MOP-TRANS Spanish-English system based on"]},{"title":"conceptual de- pendency","paragraphs":["networks [Lytinen & Schank, 1982]. 11 This approach is related to the UNITRAN model of translation in that it uses an interlingual representation as the pivot from source to target language. The key distinction is that the approach lacks a generalized linking to syntax. For example, there is no systematic method for determining which conceptual argument is the subject and which is the object. This means that there is no uniform mechanism for handling divergences such as the subject-object reversal of example (1).","The LMT system is a logic-based English-German machine translator based on a modular logical grammar [McCord, 1989].

Thus, the G routine activates steps (a) and (b) normally: the logical subject [Thi.g REFERENT] is mapped to the external argument I, and the non-logical-subject [Thl,s PERSON] is mapped to the internal position Mary.","Now we have seen how argument positioning divergences are solved during the translation processJ ¢ In the next section, we will look at how we account for the second part of thematic divergences: different predicate positionings. 4.2 Divergent Predicate Positionings In the last section, we concentrated primarily on thematic interchange of arguments. In this section, we will concentrate on thematic interchange of predicates. In so doing, we will have accounted for the entire space of thematic divergences.","There are two ways to be in a predicate-argument relationship: the first is by complementation, and the second is by adjunction. That is, syntactic phrases include base-generated complements and base-generated adjuncts, both of which participate in a predicate-argument structure (where the predicate is the head that subcategori~.es for the base-generated complement or adjunct), ts","In order to show how predicate divergences are solved, we must enumerate all possible source-language/target-language predicate positionings with respect to arguments z~, z2,..., zk, ..., z,+ and modifiers nt, n~,..., nz, ..., n~. In terms of the syntactic structure, we must examine all the possible positionings for syntactic head 7~t with respect to its complements zzt, z~t,...,zht,...,znt and adjuncts rill, n2 I,"]},{"title":"... ,nil,... , nrnl.","paragraphs":["xrIt should be noted that the solution presented here (as well as that of the next section) does not appeal to an alreadycoded set of conceptual \"frames.\" Rather, the syntactic structures are derived procedurally on the basis of two pieces of information: lexical entries (i.e., the RLCS's) and the result of composing the RLCS's into a single unit (i.e., the CLCS). It would not be possible to map declarativelp, i.e., from a set of static source-language frames to a set of static target-language frames. This is because the ~ and ~-1 routines are intended to operate recursively: an argument that occurs in a divergent phrasal construction might itself be a divergent phrasal construction. For example, in the sentence le saele gustar leer a Jnan ('John usually likes to read'), there is a simultaneous occurrence of two types of divergences: the verb soler exhibits a predicate positioning divergence with respect to its complement gustar leer a Juan, which itself exhibits an argument positioning divergence. The procedural mappings described here are crucial for handling such cases.","iSWe have left out the possibility of a base-generated specifier as a participant in the predicate-argument relationship. Of course, the specifier is an argument to the predicate, but it turns out that the syntactic specifier, which corresponds to the logical subject in the LCS, has a special status, and does not participate in predicate divergences in the same way as syntactic complements and adjuncts.

The source-language/target-language predicate positionings for these two cases are represented as shown in figure 5. Part (a) of this figure accounts for the translation of usually to soler (or vice versa), and part (b) accounts for the translation of like to gem (or vice versa).","The ~ and ~-1 routines do not take into account the predicate divergences that were just presented. As in the case of argument divergences, predicate divergences require override markers. The :PROMOTE marker is used to map a modifier of the CLCS to a syntactic head position (and vice versa). The :DEMOTE marker is used to map a non-subject argument of the CLCS to a syntactic head position (and vice versa).

The solution has been implemented in UNITRAN, a bidirectional system currently operating on Spanish, English, and German, running in Commonlisp on a Symbolics 3600 series machine.
