Weischedel","BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation","10 Moulton Street Cambridge, MA 02138 ABSTRACT","A user may typically need to combine the strengths of more than one system in order to perform a task. In this paper, we describe a component of the Janus natural language interface that translates intensional logic expressions representing the meaning of a request into executable code for each application program, chooses which combination of application systems to use, and designs the transfer of data among them in order to provide an answer. The complete Janus natural language system has been ported to two large command and control decision support aids."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["The norm in the next generation of user environments will be distributed, networked applications. Many problems will be solvable only by use of a cornbination of applications. If natural language technology is to be applicable in such environments, we must continue to enable the user to talk to computers about his/her problem, not about which application(s) to use.","Most current natural language (NL) systems, whether accepting spoken or typed input, are designed to interface to a single homogeneous underlying system; they have a component geared to producing code for that single class of application systems, such as a single relational database[12]. Providing an English interface to the user's data base, a separate English interface to the same user's planning system, and a third interface to a simulation package, for instance, will neither be attractive nor cost-effective. By contrast, a seamless, multi-modal, natural language interface will make use of a heterogeneous environment feasible and, ff done well, transparent; this can be accomplished by enabling the user to state information needs without specifying how to decompose those needs into a program calling the various underlying systems required to meet those needs. We believe users who see that NL technology does insulate them from the underlying implemantation idiosyncrasies of one application will expect that our models of language and understanding will extend to simultaneous access of several applications.","Consider an example. In DARPA's Fleet Command Center Battle Management Program (FCCBMP), several applications (call them underlying systems) are involved, including a relational data base (IDB), two expert systems (CASES and FRESH), and a decision support system (OSGP). The hardware platforms include workstations, conventional time-sharing machines, and parallel mainframes. Suppose the user asks Which of those submarines has the greatest probability of locating A within 10 hours? Answering that question involves subproblems from several underlying applications: the display facility, to determine what \"those submarines\" refers to; FRESH, to calculate how long each submarine would take to get to A's vicinity; CASES, for an intensive, parallelizable numerical calculation estimating the probabilities; and the display facility again, to present the response.","While acoustic and linguistic processing can determine what the user wants, the problem of translating that into an effective program to do what the user wants is a challenging, but solvable problem. In order to deal with multiple underlying systems, not only must our NL interface be able to represent the meaning of the user's request, but it must also be capable of organizing the various application programs at its disposal, choosing which combination of resources to use, and supervising the transfer of data among them. We call this the multiple underlying systems (MUS) problem. This paper provides an overview of our approach and results on the MUS problem. The implementation is part of the back end of the Janus natural language interface and is documented in [7]."]},{"title":"2. Scope of the Problem","paragraphs":["Our view of access to multiple underlying systems is given in Figure 2. As implied in the graphical representation, the user's request, whatever its modality, is translated into an internal representation of the meaning of what the user needs. We initially explored a first-order logic for this purpose; however, in Janus [13] we have adopted an intensional logic [3, 14] to investigate whether intensional logic offers 227 more appropriate representations for applications more complex than databases, e.g., simulations and other calculations in hypothetical situations. From the statement of what the user needs, we next derive a statement of how to fulfill that need, an execution p/an composed of abstract commands. The execution plan takes the form of a limited class of data flow graphs for a virtual machine that includes the capabilities of all of the application systems. At the level of that virtual machine, specific commands to specific underlying systems are dispatched, results from those application systems are composed, and decisions are made regarding the appropriate presentation of information to the user. Thus, the multiple underlying systems (MUS) problem is a mapping, MUS: Semantic representation -- > Program that is, a mapping from what the user wants to a program to fulfill those needs, using the heterogeneous application programs' functionality.","Though the statement of the problem as phrased above may at first suggest an extremely difficult and long-range program of research in automatic programming (e.g., see [8]), there are several ways one can narrow the scope of the problem to make utility achievable. Restricting the input language, as others have done [4, 6], is certainly one way to narrow the problem to one that is tractable.","In contrast, we allow a richer input language (an intensional logic), but assume that the output is a restricted class of programs: acyclic data flow graphs. The implication of this restriction is that the programs generatabla by the MUS component may include only: • Functions available in the underlying applications systems • Routines preprogrammed by the application system staff, and • Operators on those elements, such as functional composition, if-then-else, operators from the relational algebra, and mapping over lists (for in-stance, for universal quantification and cardinality of sets). If all the quantifiers are assumed to be restricted to finite sets with a generator function, then the quantifiers can be converted to simple loops over the elements of sets, such as the MAPCAR of Lisp, rather than having to undertake synthesis of arbitrary program loops. We assume that all primitives of the logic have at least one transformation which will rewrite it, potentially in conjunction with other primitives, from the level of the statement of the user's needs to the level of the executable plan. These transformations will have been elicited from the application system experts, e.g., expert system builders, database administrators, and systems programming staff of other application systems. (Some work has been done on automating this process.)"]},{"title":"3. Approach","paragraphs":["The problem of multiple systems may be decomposed into the following issues, as others have done [4, 9]: • Representation. It is necessary to represent underlying system capabilities in a uniform way, and to represent the user request in a form independent of any particular underlying system. The input/output constraints for each function of each underlying system must be specified, thus defining the services available. • Formulation. One must choose a combination of underlying system services that satisfies the user request. Where more than one alternative exists, it is preferable to select a solution with low execution costs and low passing of information between systems • Execution. Actual calls to the underlying systems must be accomplished, information must be passed among the systems as required, and an appropriate response must be generated."]},{"title":"3,1.

Representing Application Capabilities","To represent the functional capabilities of underlying systems, we define services and servers. A server is a functional module typically corresponding to an underlying system or a major part of an underlying system. Each server offers a number of services: objects describing a particular piece of functionality provided by a server. Specifying a service in MUS provides the mapping from fragments of logical form to fragments of underlying system code. Each service has associated with it the server it is part of, the input variables, the output variables, the conjuncta computed, and an estimate of the relative cost in applying it. SAMPLE SERVICES:","Land-avoidance-distance: owner: Expert System 1 inputs: (x y) locals: (z w) pattern: ((in-class x vessel) (in-class y vessel) (in-class z interval) (In-class w length-measure) (starts-interval z x) (ends-interval z y) (interval-length z w)) outputs: (w) method: ((route-distanca (location-of x)","(location-of y)))) cost: 5 Great-circle-distance: owner: Expert System 1 inputs: (x y)"]},{"title":"locals: (z w)","paragraphs":["pattern: ((in-class x vessel) (in-class y vessel) (in-class z Interval) (in-class w length-measure) (starts-interval z x) (ends-interval z y) (interval-length z w)) outputs: (w) method: ((gc-distance (location.of x)","(location-of y)))) cost: 1","In the example above, there are two competing services for computing distance between two ships: Great-circle-distance, which simply computes a great circle route between two points, and Land-avoidance-distance, which computes the distance of an actual path avoiding land and sticking to shipping lanes. The second is far more accurate when near land; both for calculating delays and in estimating fuel costs; however, the computation time is greater. 3.1.3. Clause Lists","Typically, the applicability of a service is contingent on several facts, and therefore, several proposi-tions must all be true for the service to apply. To facilitate matching the requirements of a given service against the needs expressed in an utterance, we convert expressions in WML to an extended disjunctive normal form (DNF), i.e., a disjunction of conjunctions. We chose DNF because: • In the simplest case, an expression in disjunctive normal form is simply a conjunction of clauses, a particularly easy logical form to cope with, • Even when there are disjuncts, each can be in-dividually handled as a conjunction of clauses, and the results then combined together via union, and • In a disjunctive normal form, the information necessary for a distinct subquery is effectively isolated in one disjunct. For details of the algorithm for converting an intensional expression to DNF, see [7]; a model-theoretic semantics has been defined for the DNF. For the sentence, Display the destroyers within 500 miles of Vinson, whose WML representation was represented earlier, the clause list is as follows: ((in-class ?a display) (object-of ?a ?b) (in-class ?b destroyer) (in-class ?c interval) (in-class ?d interval) (equal ?c ?d) (starts-interval ?d VINSON) (in-class ?s length-measure) (interval-length ?d ?s) (in-class ?f length-measure) (measure-unlt ?f miles) (measure-quantity ?f 500)"]},{"title":"(less-than ?e ?f)","paragraphs":["(ends-lnterval ?c ?b))","The normal form in this case is the same as the standard disjunctive normal form: a simple conjunction of clauses. However, there ere oases where extensions to disjunctive normal form are used: in particular, certain expressions containing embedded sub-expressions (such as universal quantifications, cardinality, and some other set-related operators) are left in place. In such cases, the embedded subexpressions are themselves normalized; the result is a context object that compactly represents a necessary logical constraint but has been normalized as far as possible. #S(CONTEXT :OPERATOR FORALL 229 :OPERATOR-VAR var :CLASS-EXP expression :CONSTRAINT expression) states that var is universally quantified over the CLASS-EXP expression as var appears in the CONSTRAINT express/on. As an example, consider the query Are all the displayed cartiers ci ? Its WML expression is given below, followed by its normalized representation.","Note that contexts are defined recursively; thus, arbitrary embeddings of operators are allowed.

Formulation","For a request consisting only of a conjunction of literals, finding a set of appropriate services may be viewed as a kind of set-covering problem. A beam search is used to find a low cost cover. Queries containing embedded subqueries (e.g., the quantifier context in the example above) require recursive calls to this search procedure.","Inherent in the collectio/: of services covering a DNF expression is the data flow that combines the services into a program to fulfill the DNF request. The next step in the formulatior, process is data flow analysis to extract the data ~low graph corresponding to an abstract program fulfillin~ the request.","In Figure 1, the data flow graph for Display the destroyers within 500 miles of Vinson is pictured. Note that the data base (IDB) is called to identify the set of all destroyers, their locations, and the location of Vinson. An expert system is being called to calculate the distance between pairs of locations 1 using land avoidance routes. A Lisp utility for comparing measures is called, followed by the display command in an expert system. 3.3. Execution","In executing the data flow graph, evaluation at a node corresponds to executing the code in the server specified. Function composition corresponds to passing data between systems, Where more than one data flow path enters a node, the natural join over the input lists is computed. Aggregating operations (e.g., computing the cardinality of a set) correspond to a mapping over lists."]},{"title":"4. Challenging Cases","paragraphs":["Here we present several well-known challenging classes of problems in translating from logical form to programs. 4.1. Deriving procedures from descriptions.","The challenge is to find a compromise between arbitrary program synthesis and a useful class of program derivation problems. Suppose the user asks for the square root of a value, when the system does not know the meaning of square root, as in Find the square root of the sum of the squares of the residuals. Various knowledge acquisition techniques, such as KNACQ [15], would allow a user to provide syntactic and semantic information for the unknown phrase to be defined. Square root could be defined as a function that computes the number that when multiplied times itseff is the same as the input. However, that is a descriptive definition of square root without any in-dication of how to compute it. One still must synthesize a program that computes square root; in fact, in early literature on automatic programming and rigorous approaches to developing programs, deriving a program to compute square root was often used as an example problem.","Rather than expecting the system to perform such complex examples of automatic programming, we assume the system need not derive programs for terms that it does not already know. For the example","'The distance function takes any physical objects as its arguments and looks up their location. 230 above, the system should be expected to respond I don't know how to compute square root.","By making that assumption, we know that all concepts and relations in the domain model, that is, all primitives appearing in WML as input to the MUS component, have a translation specified by the applications programmer to a composition of underlying services. As stated in Section 2, we further restrict the goals of the MUS component to synthesize programs of a simple structure: acyclic data flow graphs of services where one of the services is applying a function to every element in a finite list. Therefore, the arbitrary program synthesis problem including arbitrary loops and/or recursions is avoided, limit-ing the scope of inputs handleable but allowing solution of a large class of problems.","To our knowledge, no NL interface allows arbitrary program synthesis. Most assume equivalence at the abstract program level to synthesis of composi-tions of the select, project, and join operations of relational algebra. Our component goes beyond previous work in that the programs it generates include more than just the relational algebra. 4.2. Side-effects.","It is well-known that generating a program with side-effects is substantially harder than generating a program that is side-effect free. If there are no side effects, transformations of program expressions can be freely applied, preserving the value(s) computed. Nevertheless, side-effects are critical to many interface tasks, for example, changing a display, updating a data base, and setting a value of a variable.","Our component produces acyclic data flow graphs. The only node that can have side-effects is the final node in the graph. This keeps the MUS processing simple, while still allowing for side-effects at the final stage, such as producing output, updating data in the underlying systems, or running an application program having side-effects. All three of those cases have been handled in demonstrations of Janus.","Though this issue has not been discussed in other NL publications to our knowledge, we believe this restriction to be typical in NL systems. 4.3. Collapse of"]},{"title":"information.","paragraphs":["It has long been noted [5] that a complex relation may be represented in a boolean field in a data base, such as the boolean field of the Navy Blue file which for a given vessel was T/F depending on whether there was a doctor onboard the vessel. There was no information about doctors in the data base, except for that field. In a medical data base, a similar phenomenon was noticed [11]; patient records contained a T/F field depending on whether the patient's mother had had melanoma, though there was no other information on the patient's mother or her case of melanoma.","The challenge for such fields is mapping from the many ways that may occur linguistically to the appropriate field without having to write arbitrarily many patterns mapping from logical form to the data base. Just a few examples of the way the melanoma field might be referenced follow: Did Smith's mother ever have melanoma ? How many patients had a mother suffering from melanoma ? Was me/anoma diagnosed for any of the patients' mothers?","Our approach to this problem has been to adopt disjunctive normal form (clause form) as the basis for matching services against requirements in the user request. No matter what the form of user request, transforming it to disjunctive normal form means that the information necessary for a disjunct is effectively isolated in one disjunct. The service represented by the field corresponding to \"patient's mother had melanoma\" covers two conjoined forms: (MOTHER x y) (HAD-MELANOMA y). All of the examples above, given appropriate definitions of suffer and diagnose, will have the two relations as conjuncts in the disjunctive normal form for the input, and therefore, will map to the required data base service. 4.4. Hidden joins.","In data bases, a relation in English may require a join to be inferred, given the model in the underlying system. Suppose that a university data base as-sociates an office with every faculty member and a phone number with every office. Additionally, some faculty members may be associated with a lab facility; labs have telphones as well. Then to answer the query, What is Dr. Ramehaw's phone number?, the relation between faculty members and phone numbers must be determined. There are two possibilities: the office phone number or the lab phone number.","Most approaches treat this as an inference problem. It can be visualized as finding a relation between two nominal notions faculty member and phone number [1,2]. One such path uses the relation OFFICE(PERSON, ROOM) followed by the relation PHONE(ROOM,PHONE-NUMBER). A general heuristic is to use the shortest path. Computing hidden joins complicates the search space in searching for a solution among the underlying services, as can be seen in the architectures proposed, e.g., [1,4, 9]. In contrast to the typical approach where one 231 infers the hidden join as needed, we believe such joins are normally anticipatable, and provide support in our lexical definition tools (KNACQ) for specifying them. In KNACQ [15], a knowledge engineer, data base administrator, or other person familiar with the domain and with frame representation specifies for each frame (concept in KL-ONE terminology) and each slot (role in KL-ONE terminology) one or more words denoting that concept or role. In addition, the KNACQ user identifies role chains (sequences of role relations), such as RI(A, B) and R2(B, C), having special linguistic representation. In the example above, KNACQ would prompt the user to select from six possibilities for nominal compounds, possessives, and prepositional connectives relating PERSON to PHONE-NUMBER. In this way, the search space is substantially simplified, since hidden joins have been elicited ahead of time as part of the knowledge acquisition and installation process. 4.5. Data coercion.","At times, the type required by the underlying functions is not directly stated in the input (English) expression but must be derived. One procedure may produce the measure of an angle in degrees, whereas another may require the measure of an angle in radians. Differing application systems may assume a person is referred to by differing attributes, e.g., by social security number in one, but by employee number in another. In How far is Vinson from Pear/ Harbor?, one must not only infer that the positions of Vinson and Pearl Harbor must be looked up, but also make sure that the coordinates are of the type required by the particular distance function chosen.","In our approach, we assume that there are services available for translati~,g between each mismatch in data type. For the examples above, we assume that there is a translation from degrees to radians and vice versa; that there is a translation from person identified by social security number to person with employee number, and vice versa; that there is a translation function from ships and ports to their location in latitude and longitude. Such translations may already exist in the applications or may be added as a new application. If there are n different ways to identify the same entity (the measure of an angle, a person, the position of a vessel or port, etc.), there need not be (n*'2)/2 translation functions of course; a canonical representation may be chosen if as few as 2n translation functions are available to provide intertranslatability to the canonical form.","In constructing the data flow graph, we assume that the canonical representation is used throughout. Then translation functions are inserted on arcs of the data flow graph wherever the output/input assump-tions are not met by the canonical form. Of the five challenging problems, this is the only one we have not yet implemented."]},{"title":"5. Related Work","paragraphs":["Most previous work applying natural language interfaces provided access to a single system: e.g., a relational data base. Two earlier efforts (at Honeywell [4, 9] and at USC/Information Sciences Institute [6]) dealt with multiple systems. We will focus on comparison with their work.","A limitation common to those two approaches is the minimal expressiveness of the input language: user requests must be expressed as a conjunction of simple relations (literals), equivalent to the select/project/join operations of a relational algebra. This restriction is relaxed in Janus, allowing requests to contain negation of elementary predicates, existential and universal quantification, cardinality and other aggregates, a limited form of disjunction (sufficient for the most common cases), and of course simple conjunction. Wh-questions (who, what, etc.), commands, and yes/no queries are handled, and some classes of helpful responses are produced.","All three efforts employ a search procedure. In the Honeywell effort, graph matching is at the heart of the search; in the USC/ISI effort, the NIKL classifier [10] is at the heart of the search; in our effort, a beam search with a cost function is used.","Only our effort has been tested on applications with a potentially large search space (800 services); the other efforts have thus far been tested on applications with relatively few services."]},{"title":"6.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["The work offers highly desirable utility along the following two dimensions: • It frees the user from having to identify for each term (word) pieces of program that would carry out their meaning. • It improves the modularity of the interface, insulat-ing the presentation of information, such as table i/o, from details of the underlying application(s). We have found the general approach depicted in Figure 2 quite flexible. The approach was developed in work on natural language processing; however, it seems to be valuable for other types of I/O modalities. Some preliminary work has suggested its utility for table input and output in managing data base update, data base retrieval, and a directly manipulable image of tabular data. Our prototype module generates code from forms in the intensional logic; then the components originally developed for the natural language processor provide the translation mechanism to and from intensional logic and underlying systems that actually store the data."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and was monitored by ONR under Contracts N00014-85-C-0079 and N00014-85-C-0016.
