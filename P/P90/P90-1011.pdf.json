Levesque $ Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Abstract 1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A crucially important adequacy test of any theory of speech acts is its ability to handle performatives. This paper provides a theory of performatives as a test case for our rationally based theory of illocutionary acts. We show why \"I request you...\" is a request, and \"I lie to you that p\" is self-defeating. The analysis supports and extends earlier work of theorists such as Bach and Harnish [1] and takes issue with recent claims by Searle [10] that such performative-as-declarative analyses are doomed to failure.","*This paper was made possible by a contract from ATR International to SRI International, by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation, and by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

There is something special about performative sentences, sentences such as \"I promise to return\": uttering them makes them true. How and when is this possible? Not all verbs can be uttered in the first-person present tense and thereby make the sentence true. In general, the successful verbs seem to correspond to those naming illocutionary acts, but not to perlocutionary ones such as \"frighten.\" But, even some illocutionary verbs cannot be used performatively: e.g., \"I lie to you that I didn't steal your watch\" is self-defeating [12]. So, which verbs can be use performatively, and in Searle's words [10], \"how do performatives work?\"","Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to provide a solution to questions such as these. But, such questions are not merely of theoretical in-terest. Natural language database questionanswering systems have been known to receive performative utterances [14], dialogue systems that recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., [6]) will need to infer the correct illocutionary force to function properly, dialogue translation systems [5] will have to cope with markers of illocutionary 79 force that function performatively (e.g., sentence final particles in Japanese), and proposals for \"agent-oriented programming languages\" [7, 13], as well as Winograd and Flores' [15] COORDINA-TOR system, are based on performative communication. For all these systems, it is important to understand the semantics and pragmatics of such communicative acts, especially their intended effects. To do so, one needs a full theory of illocutionary acts, and a formal theory that predicts how utterances can be made true by uttering them.","The currently accepted theory of performatives is that they are in fact assertions, hence true or false, and additionally constitute the performance of the named illocutionary act, in the same way as an indirect reading of an illocutionary act is obtained from the direct illocutionary act. That is, the named illocutionary act is derived from the assertion as an indirect speech act. The most compelling defense of this performative-as-assertion analysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Harnish [1], who address many of the linguistic phenomena discussed by Sadock [9], but who, we believe, have misanalyzed indirect speech acts. However, in a recent paper, Searle [10] forcefully criticizes the performative-as-assertion approach on the following grounds:","• Assertions commit the speaker to the truth of what is asserted • Performative statements are self-referential","• \"An essential feature of any illocutionary act is the intention to perform that act\" Searle claims that accounts based on self-referential assertions are \"doomed to failure\" because one cannot show that being committed to having the intention to be performing the named illocutionary act entails that one in fact has that intention. Moreover, he questions that one should derive the named illocutionary act from an assertion, rather than vice-versa. However, Searle has imparted into Bach and Harnish's theory his notion of assertions as commitments to the truth without providing a precise analysis of commitment. What may be doomed to failure is any attempt to base an analysis of performatives on such a theory of assertions.","This paper provides a formal analysis of performatives that treats them as declarative utterances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb to Searle's criticisms, and does not require an entirely new class of illocutionary acts (the \"declarations\") as Searle and Vanderveken [12] have proposed. The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions [2].","As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties:","• A sincere utterance of \"I request you to open the door\" is both a request and an assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other. • \"I lie that the door is open\" is self-defeating.","Briefly, the ability to capture performatives is met almost entirely because such utterances are treated as indicative mood utterances, and because illocutionary acts are defined as attempts. Since attempts depend on the speaker's beliefs and goals, and these mental states are introspectable in our theory if a speaker sincerely says, for example, \"I request you to open the door,\" he must believe he did the act with the requisite beliefs and goals. Hence, the utterance is a request.","To meet the desiderata we need first to present, albeit briefly, the theory of rational interaction, the treatment of declarative mood utterances, and then the illocutionary act definitions for requesting and asserting. Finally, we combine the various analyses natural language processor's task by making explicit the intended word sense of the action, and by reducing the combinatorics inherent in determining the attachment of the prepositional phrases. 80 2 Abbreviated theory of rational action Below, we give an abbreviated description of the theory of rational action upon which we erect a theory of intention. The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further details of this logic can be found in [2]. 2.1 Syntax The language we use has the usual connectives of a first-order language with equality, as well as operators for the propositional attitudes and for talking about sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x p) say that p follows from x's beliefs or goals (a.k.a choices) respectively; (AGT x e) says that x is the only agent for the sequence of events e; el _<as says that el is an initial subsequence of e2; and finally, (HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) say that a sequence of events describable by an action expression a will happen next or has just happened, respectively. Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying the agent (x) axe also defined.","An action expression here is built from variables ranging over sequences of events using the constructs of dynamic logic [4]: a;b is action composi-tion; a[b is nondeterministic choice; a[[b is concurrent occurrence of a and b; p? is a test action; and finally, a* is repetition. The usual programming constructs such as IF/THEN actions and WHILE loops, can easily be formed from these. Because test actions occur frequently in our analysis, yet create considerable confusion, read p?;a as \"action a occurring when p holds,\" and for a;p?, read \"action a occurs after which p holds.\" We use e as a variable ranging over sequences of events, and a and b for action expressions.","We adopt the following abbreviations and domain predicates."]},{"title":"(BEFORE a p) de___f (DONE p?;a) z (AFTER a p) def= (HAPPENS a;p?)","paragraphs":["def <~p --"]},{"title":"=le (HAPPENS","paragraphs":["e;p?)."]},{"title":"(LATER p) d~f","paragraphs":["= ~p A Op.","1This differs from the BEFORE relation described in [3], which is here labelled PRIOR.","def Op = -~<>-=p.

(FULFILL-CONDS s • e') means that event • fulfills the satisfaction conditions, relative to event e', that are imposed by sentence s. 3 For example, ifs is \"wash the floor,\" e would be a floor-washing event. 2.2 Assumptions The model we are developing embodies various assumptions constraining beliefs and choices (goals). First, BEL has a \"weak $5\" semantics, and GOAL has a \"system K\" semantics. 4 Among the remain-ing assumptions, the following will be used in this paper. 5 Beliefs imply choice:","(BEL x p) D (GOAL x p).","2Feel free to substitute your favorite syntactic predicates.","3TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are just placeholders for semantic theories of truth, reference, and the meanings of imperatives, respectively.

Instead, we require that the agent be committed to arriving at a state in which he believes he is about to do the intended action next.","This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment. Next, we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance's features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker's mental state, termed a \"core attitude\" in [3, 8]. Very roughly, a declarative utterance $ will be correlated with the speaker's believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker's wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence.

Hence, he would believe the","6For simplicity, we omit here one condition from the definition of INTEND2 in [2]. 82 speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes p.","This type of reasoning can continue to further levels. In general, if an utterance is produced when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental state [8]. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths.

The analysis of performatives will say that after having uttered such a sentence, or while uttering it, the speaker believes he has just done or is doing the named illocutionary act. Typically, prior to uttering a performative, the speaker has not just performed that speech act, and so he would believe his having just done so is false.

Some verbs cannot be used performatively, such as \"frighten,\" because they require something beyond a mere attempt. Hence, such verbs would name action expressions that required a particular proposition p be true after the utterance event. When the utterance event does not guarantee such a p, the use of the performative verb will not be possible.","On the other hand, certain utterances (performative or not), when performed by the right people in the right circumstances, make certain institutional facts hold. So, when a clergyman, judge, or ship captain says \"I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" the man and woman in question are married. In our framework, there would be a domain axiom whose antecedent characterizes the circumstances, participants, and nature of the utterance event, and whose consequent asserts that an institutional fact is true. The axiom is justified not by the nature of rational action, but by the existence of an institution. Such utterances could be 87 made with a performative prefix provided such attempts are made into successes by the institution.","This paper has shown that treating performative utterances as declarative sentences is a vi-able analysis, in spite of Searle's criticisms. The performative use of an illocutionary verb is selfguaranteeing when the named illocutionary act consists in the speaker's making an attempt to make public his mental state. In such cases, if the speaker thinks he has done so, then he has. However, we do not derive the named illocutionary act from the assertion, nor vice-versa. Instead, both derivations may be made from the utterance event, but the assertive one is in fact harder to obtain as it has extra conditions that need to be satisfied. References","[1] K. Bach and R.
