CDG parsing is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem over a finite domain so that efficient constraint-propagation algorithms can be employed to reduce structural ambiguity without generating individual parse trees. The weak generative capacity and the computational complexity of CDG parsing are also discussed. 1 INTRODUCTION We are interested in an efficient treatment of structural ambiguity in natural language analysis. It is known that \"every-way\" ambiguous constructs, such as prepositional attachment in English, have a Catalan number of ambiguous parses (Church and Patil 1982), which grows at a faster than exponential rate (Knuth 1975). A parser should be provided with a disambiguation mechanism that does not involve generating such a combinatorial number of parse trees explicitly.","We have developed a parsing method in which an intermediate parsing result is represented as a data structure called a constraint network. Every solution that satisfies all the constraints simultaneously corresponds to an individual parse tree. No explicit parse trees are generated until ultimately necessary. Pars-ing and successive disambiguation are performed by adding new constraints to the constraint network. Newly added constraints are efficiently propagated over the network by Constraint Propagation (Waltz 1975, Montanari 1976) to remove inconsistent values.","In this paper, we present the basic ideas of a formal grammatical theory called Constraint Dependency Grammar (CDG for short) that makes this parsing technique possible. CDG has a reasonable time bound in its parsing, while its weak generative capacity is strictly greater than that of Context Free Grammar (CFG).","We give the definition of CDG in the next section. Then, in Section 3, we describe the parsing method based on constraint propagation, using a step-by-step example. Formal properties of CDG are discussed in Section 4. 31 2 CDG: DEFINITION Let a sentence s = wlw2 ... w,, be a finite string on a finite alphabet E. Let R -- {rl,r2,...,rk} be a finite set of role-iris. Suppose that each word i in a sentence s has k-different roles rl(i), r2(i) .... , rk(i). Roles are like variables, and each role can have a pair <a, d> as its value, where the label a is a member of a finite set L = {al,a2,...,at} and the modifiee d is either 1 < d < n or a special symbol nil. An analysis of the sentence s is obtained by assigning appropriate values to the n x k roles (we can regard this situation as one in which each word has a frame with k slots, as shown in Figure 1).","An assignment A of a sentence s is a function that assigns values to the roles. Given an assignment A, the label and the modifiee of a role x are determined. We define the following four functions to represent the various aspect of the role x, assuming that x is an rj-role of the word i: rt-role r=-role W~ W= W."]},{"title":"I I [---] I I l- I r.-ro,e I I 1\" t I I","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Words and their roles. • pos(x)~ f the position i • rid(x)~ r the role id rj • lab(x)d-~ f the label of x • mod(x)d-~ f the modifiee of x","We also define word(i) as the terminal symbol occurring at the position i. 1","An individual grammar G =< ~, R, L, C > in the CDG theory determines a set of possible assignments of a given sentence, where • ~ is a finite set of terminal symbols. • R is a finite set of role-ids. • L is a finite set of labels.","• C is a constraint that an assignment A should satisfy.

In these data structures, a substring that is recognized as a certain phrase is represented as a single edge or node regardless of how many different readings are possible for this phrase. Since the production rules are context free, it is unnecessary to check the internal structure of an edge when combining it with another edge to form a higher edge. However, this property is true only when the grammar is purely context-free.

A syntactic graph is similar to a constraint network in the sense that it is dependency-oriented (nodes are words) and that an exclusion matrix is used to represent the co-occurrence conditions between modification links. A syntactic graph is, however, built after context-free parsing and is therefore used to represent only context-free parse trees. The formal descriptive power of syntactic graphs is not known. As will be discussed in Section 4, the formal descriptive power of CDG is strictly greater than that of CFG and hence, a constraint network can represent non-context-free parse trees as well.","Sugimura et al. (1988) propose the use of a constraint logic program for analyzing modifier-modifiee relationships of Japanese.

The generative capacity and the computational complexity of this formalism are not clear.","The above-mentioned works seem to have concentrated on the efficient representation of the output of a parsing process, and lacked the formalization of a structural disambiguation process, that is, they did not specify what kind of knowledge can be used in what way for structural disambiguation. In CDG parsing, any knowledge is applicable to a constraint network as long as it can be expressed as a constraint between two modifications, and an efficient filtering algorithm effectively uses it to reduce structural ambiguities. 4 FORMAL PROPERTIES Weak Generative Capacity of CDG","Consider the language Lww = {wwlw E (a+b)*}, the language of strings that are obtained by concatenating the same arbitrary string over an alphabet {a,b}. Lww is known to be non-context-free (Hopcroft and Ullman 1979), and is frequently mentioned when discussing the non-context-freeness of the \"respectively\" construct (e.g. \"A, B, and C do D, E, and F, respectively\") of various natural languages (e.g., Savitch et al. 1987).

An assignment given to a sentence \"aabaab\" is shown in Figure 10.","On the other hand, any context-free language can be generated by a degree=2 CDG. This can be proved by constructing a constraint dependency grammar GCDG from an arbitrary context-free grammar GCFG in Greibach Normal Form, and by show-ing that the two grammars generate exactly the same language. Since GcFc is in Greibach Normal Form, it is easy to make one-to-one correspondence between a word in a sentence and a rule application in a phrase-structure tree. The details of the proof are given in Maruyama (1990). This, combined with the fact that Gww generates Lww, means that the weak generative capacity of CDG with degree=2 is strictly greater than that of CFG. Computational complexity of CDG parsing Let us consider a constraint dependency grammar G =< E, R, L, C > with arity=2 and degree=k. Let n be the length of the input sentence. Consider the space complexity of the constraint network first. In CDG parsing, every word has k roles, so there are n × k nodes in total. A role can have n x l possible values, where l is the size of L, so the maximum domain size is n x l.
