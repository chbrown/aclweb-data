The representation of knowledge of language I assume is that specified by Government Binding (GB) Theory introduced in [Chomsky, 1981]. GB, as a competence theory, emphatically does not specify the nature of the language processing mechanism. In fact, \"proofs\" that transformational grammar is inadequate as a linguistic theory due to various performance measures are fundamentally flawed since they suppose a particular connection between the grammar and parser [Berwick and Weinberg, 1984]. Nonetheless, it seems desirable to maintain a fairly direct connection between the linguistic competence and","*I would like to thank the following for their valuable discussion and suggestions: Naoki Fukui, Jarnie Henderson, Aravind Joshi, Tony Kroch, Mitch Marcus, Michael Niv, Yves Schabes, Mark Steedman, Enric Vallduv{.

Otherwise, claims of the psychological reality of this particular conception of competence become essentially vacuous since they cannot be falsified but for the data on which they are founded, i.e. grammaticality judgments. Thus, in building a model of language processing, I would like to posit as direct a link as is possible between linguistic competence and the operations of the parser while still maintaining certain desirable computational properties.","What are the computational properties necessary for psychological plausibility? Since human syntactic processing is an effortless process, we should expect that it take place efficiently, perhaps in linear time since sentences do not become more difficult to process simply as a function of their length. Determinism, as proposed by Marcus [1980], seems desirable as well. In addition, the mechanism should operate in an incremental fashion. Incrementality is evidenced in the human language processor in two ways. As we hear a sentence, we build up semantic representations without waiting until the sentence is complete. Thus, the semantic processor should have access to syntactic representations prior to an utterance's completion. Additionally, we are able to perceive ungrammaticality in sentences almost immediately after the ill fonnedness occurs. Thus, our processing mechanism should mimic this early detection of ungrammatical input.","Unfortunately, a parser with the most transparent relationship to the grammar, a \"parsing as theorem proving\" approach as proposed by [Johnson, 1988] and [Stabler, 1990], does not fare well with respect to our computational desiderata. It suffers from the legacy of the computational properties of first order theorem proving, most notably undecidability, and is thus inadequate for our purposes. The question, then, is how much we must repeat from this direct instantiatiou so that we can maintain the requisite properties. In this paper, I attempt to provide iii an answer. I propose a parsing model which represents the principles of the grammar in a fairly direct manner, yet preserves efficiency and incrementality. The model depends upon two key ideas. First, I utilize the insight of [Abney, 1986] in the use of"]},{"title":"licensing relations as the","paragraphs":["foundation for GB parsing. By generalizing Abney's formulation of licensing, I can directly encode and enforce a particular class of the principles of GB theory and in so doing efficiently build phrase structure. The principles expressible through licensing are not all of those posited by GB. Thus, the others must be enforced using a different mechanism. Unfortunately, the unbounded size of the tree created with licensing makes any such mechanism computationally abhorrent. In order to remedy this, I make use of the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) framework [Joshi, 1985] to limit the working space of the parser. As the parser proceeds, its working slructure is bounded in size. If this bound is exceeded, we reduce this structure by one of the operations provided by the TAG formalism, either substitution or adjunction. This results in two structures, each of which form independent elementary trees. Interestingly, the domain of locality imposed by a TAG elementary tree appears to be sufficient for the expression of the remaining grammatical principles. Thus, we can check for the satisfaction of the remaining grammatical principles in just the excised piece of structure and then send it off for semantic interpretation. Since this domain of constraint checking is bounded in size, this process is done efficiently. This mechanism also works in an incremental fashion."]},{"title":"2 Abney's Licensing","paragraphs":["Since many grammatical constraints are concerned with the licensing of elements, Abney [1986] proposes utiliz-ing licensing structure as a more concrete representation for parsing.

Subjecthood is the relation between a head and its \"subject\". Moditica-tion holds between a head and adjunct. Theta assignment occurs between a head and its subeategnrized elements. Figure 1 gives an example of the licensing relations which might obtain in a simple clause. Parsing with these licensing relations simply consists of determining, for each lexieal item as it is read in a single left to right pass, where it is licensed in the previously constructed structure or whether it licenses the previous structure.","We can now re-examine Abney's claim that these licensing relations allow him to retain \"the spirit of the abstract grammar.\" Since licensing relations talk only of very local relationships, that occurring between sisters, this system cannot enforce the constraints of binding, control, and ECP among others. Abney notes this and suggests that his licensing should be seen as a single module in a parsing system. One would hope, though, that principles which have their roots in licensing, such as those of theta and case theory, could receive natural treatments. Unfortunately, this is not true. Consider the theta criterion. While this licensing system is able to encode the portion of the constraint that requires theta roles to be assigned uniquely, it fails to guarantee that all NPs (arguments) receive a theta role. This is crucially not the case since NPs are some-times licensed not by them but by subject licensing. Thus, the following pair will be indistinguishable: i. It seems that the pigeon is dead ii. * Joe seems that the pigeon is dead Both It and Joe will be appropriately licensed by a subject licensing relation associated with seems. The case filter also cannot be expressed since objects of ECM verbs are \"licensed\" by the lower clause as subject, yet also require case. Thus, the following distinction cannot accounted for: i. Carol asked Ben to swat the fly ii. * Carol tried Ben to swat the fly Here, in order to get the desired syntactic structure (with Ben in the lower clause in both cases), Ben will need to be licensed by the inflectional element to. Since such a licensing relation need be unique, the case assigning properties of the matrix verbs will be irrelevant. What seems to have happened is that we have lost the modularity of the the syntactic relations constrained by grammatical principles. Everything has been conltated onto one homogeneous licensing structure."]},{"title":"3 Generalized Licensing","paragraphs":["In order to remedy these deficiencies, I propose a system of Generalized Licensing. In this system, every node is assigned two sets of licensing relations: gives and needs. Gives are similar to the Abney's licensing relations: they are satisfied locally and determined lexically. Needs specify the ways in which a node must be licensed.1 A need of type them, for example, requires a node to be licensed by a theta relation. In the current formulation, needs differ from gives in that they are always directionaUy unspecified. We can now represent the theta criterion by placing theta gives on a theta assigner for each argument and theta needs on all DPs. This encodes both that all them roles must be assigned and that all arguments must receive theta roles.","In Generalized Licensing, we allow a greater vocabulary of relation types: case, them assignment, modification, functional selection, predication, f-features, etc. We can then explicitly represent many of the relations which are posited in the grammar and preserve the modularity of the theory. As a result, however, certain elements can and must be multiply licensed. DPs, for instance, will have needs for both them and case as a result of the case filter and theta criterion. We therefore relax the requirement that","1These bear some similarity to the anti-relations of Abney, but are used in a rather different fashion. 113 all nodes be uniquely licensed. Rather, we demand that all gives and needs be uniquely \"satisfied.\" The uniqueness requirement in Abney's relations is now pushed down to the level of individual gives and needs. Once a give or need is satisfied, it may not participate in any other licensing relationships.","One further generalization which I make concerns the positioning of gives and needs. In Abney's system, licensing relations are associated with lexical heads and applied to maximal projections of other heads. Phrase structure is thus entirely parasitic upon the reconstruction of licensing structure. I propose to have an independent process of lexical projection. A lexical item projects to the correct number of levels in its maximal projection, as determined by theta structure, f-features, and other lexical properties. 2 Gives and needs are assigned to each of these nodes. As with Abney's system, licensing takes place under a strict notion of government (sisterhood). However, the projection process allows licensing relations determined by a head to take place over a somewhat larger domain than sisterhood to the head. A DP's theta need resulting from the them criterion, for example, is present only at the maximal projection level. This is the node which stands in the appropriate structural relation to a theta give. As a result of this projection process, though, we must explicitly represent structural relations during parsing.","The reader may have noticed that multiple needs on a node might not all be satisfiable in one structural position. Consider the case of a DP subject which possesses both theta and case needs. The S-structure subject of the sentence receives its theta role from the verb, yet it receives its case from the tense/agreement morpheme heading IP. This is impossible, though, since given the structural correlate of the licensing relation, the DP would then be directly dominated both by IP and by VP. Yet, it cannot be in either one of these positions alone, since we will then have unsatisfied needs and hence an ill-formed structure. Thus, our representation of grammatical principles and the constraints on give and need satisfaction force us into adopt-ing a general notion of chain and more specifically the VP internal subject hypothesis. A chain consist of a list of nodes (al .... ,a~) such that they share gives and needs and each ai c-commands each a~+l. The first element in the chain, al, the head, is the only element which can have phonological content. Others must be empty categories.","Now, since the elements of the chain can occupy different structural positions, they may be governed and hence licensed by distinct elements. In the simple sentence: [IP Johns tns/agr [V' ti smile]]","21 assume the relativized X-bar theory proposed in [Fukui and Speas, 1986]. the trace node which is an argument of smile forms a chain with the DP John. In its V' internal position, the theta need is satisfied by the theta give associated with the V. In subject position, the case need is satisfied by the case give on the I' projection of the inflectional morphology.","Now, how might we parse using these licensing relations? Abney's method is not sufficient since a single instance of licensing no longer guarantees that all of a node's licensing constraints are satisfied. I propose a simple mechanism, which generalizes Abney's approach: We proceed left to right, project the current input token to its maximal projection p and add the associated gives and needs to each of the nodes. These are determined by examination of information in the lexical entries (such as using the theta grid to determine theta gives), examination of language specific parameters (using head directionality in order to determined directionality of gives, for exampie), and consultation of UG parameters (for instance as a result of the case filter, every DP maximal projection will have an associated case need). The parser then attempts to combine this projection with previously built structure in one of two ways. We may attach p as the sister of a node n on the right frontier of the developing structure, when p is licensed by n either by a give in n and/or a need in the node p. Another possibility is that the previously built structure is attached as sister to a node, rn, dominated by the maximal projection p, by satisfying a give in rn and/or a need on the root of the previously built structure. In the case of multiple attachment possibilities, we order them according to some metric such as the one proposed by Abney, and choose the most highly ranked option.","As structure is built, nodes in the tree with unsatisfied gives and needs may become closed off from the right frontier of the working structure. In such positions, they will never become satisfied. In the ease of a need in an internal node n which is unsatisfied, we posit the existence of an empty category rn, which will be attached later to the structure such that (n,"]},{"title":"ra)","paragraphs":["form a chain. We posit an element to have been moved into a position exactly when it is licensed at that position yet its needs are not completely satisfied. After positing the empty category, we push it onto the trace stack. When a node has an unsatisfied give and no longer has access to the right frontier, we must posit some element, not phonologically represented in the input, which satisfies that give relation. If there is an element on the top of the trace stack which can satisfy this give, we pop it off the stack and attach it. 3 Of course, if the trace has any remaining needs, it is returned to the Pace stack since its new position is isolated from the right frontier.

On the I' node is a leftward nominative case give, from the f-features, and a leftward subject give, as a result of the Extended Projection Principle. The previously constructed DP is attached as sister to the I' node, thereby satisfying the subject and case gives of the I' as well as the case need of the DP. We are thus left with the structure in figure 2. 5 Next, we see that the them need of the DP is inaccessible from the right frontier, so we push an empty category DP whose need set contains this unsatisfied theta need onto the mace stack. The next input token is the verb laugh. This is projected to a single bar level. Since laugh assigns an external theta role, we insert a leftward theta give to a DP into the V' node. This verbal projection is attached as sister to I °, satisfying the functional selection give of I. However, the theta give in V' remains unsatisfied and since it is leftward, is inaccessible.

Needs are 3-tuples (Type, Val, SatB~/) where these are as in the gives. For purposes of readability, I remove previously satisfied gives and needs from the fgure.

The resulting structure is easily seen to be well-formed since all gives and needs are satisfied.","We have adopted a very particular view of traces: their positions in the structure must be independently motivated by some other licensing relation. Note, then, that we cannot analyze long distance dependencies through successive cyclic movement. There is no licensing relation which will cause the intermediate traces to exist. Ordinarily these traces exist only to allow a well-formed derivation, i.e. not ruled out by subjacency or by a barrier to antecedent government. Thus, we need to account for constraints on long distance movement in another manner. We will return to this in the next section.","The mechanism I have proposed allows a fairly direct encoding for some of the principles of grammar such as case theory, them theory, and the extended projection principle. However, many other constraints of GB, such as the ECP, control theory, binding theory, and bounding the-try, cannot be expressed perspicuously through licensing. Since we want our parser to maintain a fairly direct connection with the grammar, we need some additional mechanism to ensure the satisfaction of these constraints.","Recall, again, the computational properties we wanted to hold of our parsing model: efficiency and incrementality.

To accord with incrementality, they must be checked as soon as possible, and not function as post-processing \"filters.\" Unfortunately, it is not easily determinable when a given constraint can apply such that further input will not change the status of the satisfaction of a constraint.

I propose that this is the projection of a lexical head together with any of the associated functional projections of which it is a complement. For instance, a single elementary tree may contain the projection of a V along with the I and C projections in which it is embedded. 6 Along the frontier of these trees may appear terminal symbols (i.e. lexical items) or non-terminals. The substitution operation is the insertion of one elementary tree at a non-terminal of same type as the root on the frontier of another elementary tree. Adjunction allows the insertion of one elementary tree of a special kind, an auxiliary tree, at a node internal to another (cf. figure 4). In","6This definition of TAG elementary trees is consistent with the Lexicalized TAG framework [Schabes"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1988] in that the lexical head may be seen as the anchor of the elementary trees.

Only adjunctions, and not substitutions, may occur at this node.","TAG has proven useful as a formalism in which one can express linguistic generalizations since it seems to provide a sufficient domain over which grammatical constraints can be stated [Kroch and Joshi, 1985] [Kroch and Santorini, 1987]. Kroch, in two remarkable papers [1986] and [1987], has shown that even constraints on long distance dependencies, which intuitively demand a more \"global\" perspective, can be expressed using an entirely local (i.e. within a single elementary lee) formulation of the ECP and allows for the collapsing of the CED with the ECP. This analysis does not utilize intermediate traces, but in-stead the link between filler and gap is \"stretched\" upon the insertion of intervening structure during adjunctions. Thus, we are relieved of the problem that intermediate traces are not licensed, since we do not require their existence.","Let us suppose a formulation of GB in which all principles not enforced through generalized licensing are stated over the local domain of a TAG elementary tree. Now, we can use the model described above to create structures corresponding to single elementary trees. However, we restrict the working space of the parser to contain only a single structure of this size. If we perform an attachment which violates this \"memory limitation,\" we are forced to reduce the structure in our working space. We will do this in one of two ways, corresponding to the two mechanisms which TAG provides for combining structure. Either we will undo a substitution or undo an adjunction. However, all chains are required to be localized in individual elementary tree. Once an elementary tree is finished, non-licensing constraints are checked and it is sent off for semantic interpretation. This is the basis for my proposed parsing model. For details of the algorithm, see [Frank, 1990]. This mechanism operates in linear time and deterministically, while maintaining coarse grained (i.e. clausal) incrementality for grammaticality determination and semantic interpretation.","Consider this model on the raising sentence \"Harry seemed to kiss Sally.\" We begin as before with \"Harry tns/agr\" yielding the structure in figure 2. Before we receive the next token of input, however, we see that the working structure is larger than the domain of an elementary tree, since the subject DP constitutes an independent predication from the one determined by the projection of I. We therefore unsubstitute the subject DP and send it off to constraint checking and semantic interpretation.
