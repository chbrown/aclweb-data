For further market extension or new market creation for natural language applications, parsing speed-up as well as improving parmng accuracy is required. First, the parsing speed-up directly reduces system response time required in such interactive natural language application systems as those using natural language interface, speech recognition, Kana-to-Kanjl i conversion, which is the most popular Japanese text input method, and so on. Second, it also increases the advantage of such applications as machine translation, document proofreading, automatic indexing, and so on, which are used to treat a large amount of documents. Third, it realizes parsing methods based on larger scale dictionary or knowledge database, which are necessary to improve parsing accuracy.","Until now, in the natural language processing field, the speed-up has depended mainly on performance improvements achieved in sequential processlng computers and the development of sequential algorithms. Recently, because of the further","IKan~ characters are combined consonant and vowel symbols used in written Japanese. Kanjl characters ~re Chinese ideographs. speeded-up requirement, parallel processing computers have been designed and parallel parsing algorithms (Matsumoto, 1986) (Haas, 1987) (Rytter, 1987) -(Fukushima, 1990b) have been proposed. However, there are many difficult problems blocking efficient practical use of parallel processing computers. One of the problems is that access confiicts occur when several processors read or write a common memory simultaneously. An-other is the bottle-neck problem, wherein commtnication between any two processors is restricted, because of hardware scale limitation.","On the other hand, in the pattern processing field, various kinds of accelerator hardware have been developed. They are designed for a special purpose, not for general purposes. A hardware approach hasn't been tried in the natural language processing field yet.","The authors propose developing natural language parsing accelerators, a hardware approach to the parsing speed-up (Fukushima, 1989b) -(Fukushima, 1990a). This paper describes a new hardware algorithm for high speed morpheme extraction and its implementation on a specific machine. This morpheme extraction machine is designed as the first step toward achieving the natura] language parsing accelerators."]},{"title":"2 MACHINE DESIGN STRATEGY 2.1 MORPHEME EXTRACTION","paragraphs":["Morphological analysis methods are generally composed of two processes: (1) a morpheme extraction process and (2) a morpheme determina-tion process. In process (1), all morphemes, which are considered as probably being use<] to construct input text, are extracted by searching a morpheme dictionary. These morphemes are extracted as candidates. Therefore, they are selected mainly by morpheme conjunction constraint. Morphemes which actually construct the text are determined in process (2).","The authors selected morpheme extraction as the first process to be implemented on specific hardware, for the following three reasons. First is that the speed-up requirement for the morphological analysis process is very strong in Japanese 307"]},{"title":"Input Text","paragraphs":["........"]},{"title":"~.p)i~ C. ...... ~ Iverb ! ! i ' ' i I noun ; I i ,1\", ; ~'~,~: I noun ~MorphemeExtraction~l fi~ inoun ~.~ Process ..,) ,ti~ inou n ~ i Morpheme Dictionary !~; postposition i ..... su,,x !~, :verb","paragraphs":["I I I I"]},{"title":": , ~,~ noun","paragraphs":["i ..........","d","'\" ........","\"1"]},{"title":"i ~)f :suffix Extracted","paragraphs":["="]},{"title":"' Morphemes i i~#~. :noun","paragraphs":["= , .........","/","I","I ....."]},{"title":"!vo,","paragraphs":["~)f ! no,,n ; .........","I Figure h Morpheme Extraction Process for Japanese Text 2.2 STRATEGY DISCUSSION","In conventional morpheme extraction methods, which are the software methods used on sequential processing computers, the comparison operation between one key string in the morpheme dictionary and one sub-string of input text is repeated. This is one to one comparison. On the other hand, many to one comparison or one to many comparison is practicable in parallel computing.","Content- addressable memories (.CAMs) (Chlsvln, 1989) (Yamada, 1987) reallze the many to one comparison. One sub-string of input text is simultaneously compared with all key strings stored in a CAM. However, presently available CAMs have only a several tens of kilo-bit memory, which is too small to store data for a more than 50,000 morpheme dictionary.","The above mentioned parallel processing computers realize the one to many comparison. On the parallel processing computers, one processor searches the dictionary at one text position, while another processor searches the same dictionary at the next position at the same time (Nakamura, 1988). However, there is an access conflict problem involved, as already mentioned.","The above discussion has led the authors to the following strategy to design the morpheme extraction machine (Fukushima, 1989a). This strategy is to shorten the one to one comparison cycle. Simple architecture, which will be described in the next section, can realize this strategy. text parsing systems. This process is necessary for natural language parsing, because it is the first step in the parsing. However, it is more laborious for Japanese and several other languages, which have no explicit word boundaries, than for Engllsh and many European languages (Miyazald, 1983) (Ohyama, 1986) (Abe, 1986). English text reading has the advantage of including blanks between words. Figure 1 shows an example of the morpheme extraction process for Japanese text. Because of the disadvantage inherent in reading difficulty involved in all symbols being strung to-gether without any logical break between words, the morpheme dictionary, including more than 50,000 morphemes in Japanese, is searched at almost all positions of Japanese text to extract morphemes. The authors' investigation results, indicating that the morpheme extraction process requires using more than 70 % of the morphological analysis process time in conventional Japanese parsing systems, proves the strong requirement for the speed-up.","The second reason is that the morpheme extraction process is suitable for being implemented on specific hardware, because simple character comparison operation has the heaviest percentage weight in this process. The third reason is that this speed-up will be effective to evade the common memory access conflict problem mentioned in Section 1. 308"]},{"title":"3 A HARDWARE ALGO- RITHM FOR MOR- PHEME EXTRACTION","paragraphs":["3.1 FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE","A new hardware algorithm for the morpheme extraction, which was designed with the strategy mentioned in the previous section, is described in this section.","The fundamental architecture, used to implement the algorithm, is shown in Fig. 2.

The index memory receives a character from the 1st character register. Then, it outputs the top address and the number of morphemes in the dictionary, whose 1st character corresponds to the input character. Because morphemes are arranged in the incremental order of their key string in the dictionary, the pair for the top address and the number expresses the address range in the dictionary. Figure 3 shows the rela-tion between the index memory and the character memories. For example, when the shift register block content is as shown in Fig. 4(a), where '~' is stored in the 1st character register, the index memory's output expresses the address range for the morpheme set {\"~\", \"~\", \"~]~\", \"~]~ ~[~\", \"~]~\", ..., \"~J\"} in Fig. 3.","The address generator sets the same address to all the character memories, and changes their addresses simultaneously within the address range which the index memory expresses. Then, the dictionary block outputs an characters constructing one morpheme (key string with length N ) simultaneously at one address. The comparators are N in number (i.e. 1st comparator, 2nd compara- ,or, ..., N-th comparator). The n-th comparator compares the character in the n-th character register with the one from the -th character memory. When there is correspondence between the two characters, a match signal is output. In this comparison, the remainder symbol operates as a wild card. This means that the comparator also outputs a match signal when the ~-th character memory outputs the remainder symbol.

Such multiple candidates form the multiple text streams. Figure 6(a) shows an example of multiple text streams, expressed by a two dimensional matrix. One dimension corresponds to the position in the text. The other dimension corresponds to the candidate level. Candidates on the same level form one stream. For example, in Fig. 6(a), the character at the 3rd position has three candidates: the 1st candidate is '~', the 2nd one is '~' and the 3rd one is ']~'. The 1st level stream is \"~]:~:.~...\".
