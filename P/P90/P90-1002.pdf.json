However, the notion of \"intonational structure\" as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and others, can be subsumed under a rather different notion of syntactic surface structure that emerges from a theory of grammar based on a \"Combinatory\" extension to Categorial Gram, mar. Interpretations of constituents at this level are in tam directly related to \"information structure\", or discourse-related notions of \"theme\", \"rheme\", \"focus\" and \"presupposition\". Some simplifications appear to follow for the problem of integrating syntax and other high-level modules in spoken language systems. One quite normal prosody (13, below) for an answer to the following question (a) intuitively impotes the intonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress, marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated by capitals):","(1) a. I know that Alice prefers velveL","But what does MAry prefer? b. (MAry prefers) (CORduroy).

We must also show that the major constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under the analyses that are permitted by any given intonation, correspond to the information structure of the context to which the intonation is appropriate, as in (a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins. This demonstration will be quite simple, once we have established the following notation for intonation contours.","I shall use a notation which is based on the theory of Pierrehumbert [10], as modified in more recent work by Selkirk [14], Beckman and Pierrehumbert [1], [11], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [12]. I have tried as far as possible to take my examples and the associated intonational annotations from those authors. The theory proposed below is in principle compatible with any of the standard descriptive accounts of phrasal intonation. However, a crucial feature of Pierrehumberts theory for present purposes is that it distinguishes two subcomponents of the prosodic phrase, the pitch accent and the boundary. 2 The first of these tones or tone-sequences coincides with the perceived major stress or stresses of the prosodic phrase, while the second marks the righthand boundary of the phrase. These two components are essentially invariant, and all other parts of the intonational tune are interlx)lated. Pierrehumberts theory thus captures in a very natural way the intuition that the same tune can be spread over longer or shorter strings, in order to mark the corresponding constituents for the particular distinction of focus and propositional attitude that the melody denotes. It will help the exposi-tion to augment Pierrehumberts notation with explicit prosodic phrase boundaries, using brackets. These do not change her theory in any way: all the information is implicit in the original notation.","Consider for example the prosody of the sentence Fred ate the beans in the following pair of discourse settings, which are adapted from Jackendoff [7, pp. 260]:","(15) Q: I/el1, what about the BEAns?","Who ate THEM? A : FRED ate the BEA-ns. ( H* L )( L+H* LHg ) two tunes are reversed: this time the tune with pitch accent T.+H* and boundary LH% is spread across a prosodic phrase Fred ate, while the other tune with pitch accent H* and boundary LL% is carried by the prosodic phrase the beans (again starting with an interpolated or null tone). 4","The meaning that these tunes convey is intuitively very obvious. As Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg point out, the latter tune seems to be used to mark some or all of that part of the sentence expressing information that the speaker believes to be novel to the hearer. In traditional terms, it marks the \"comment\" - more precisely, what Halliday called the '~rheme'. In contrast, the r.+H* LH% tune seems to be used to mark some or all of that part of the sentence which expresses information which in traditional terms is the \"topic\" - in I-lalliday's terms, the \"theme\". 5 For present purposes, a theme can be thought of as conveying what the speaker assumes to be the subject of mutual interest, and this particular tune marks a theme as novel to the conversation as a whole, and as standing in a contrastive relation to the previous one. (If the theme is not novel in this sense, it receives no tone in Pierrehumbert's terms, and may even be left out altogether.) 6 Thus in (16), the L+H* Lrt% phrase including this accent is spread across the phrase Fred ate. 7 Similarly, in (15), the same tune is confined to the object of the open proposition ate the beans, because the intonation of the original question indicates that eating beans as opposed to some other comestible is the new topic, s"]},{"title":"(16)","paragraphs":["q: I/ell, what about FRED?","What did HE eat7 A: FRED ate the BEAns. ( L+H* LH~ )( H* LL~ ) In these contexts, the main stressed syllables on both Fred and the beans receive a pitch accent, but a different one. In the former example, (15), there is a prosodic phrase on Fred made up of the pitch accent which Pierrehumbert calls H*, immediately followed by an r. boundary. There is another prosodic phrase having the pitch accent called L+H* on beans, preceded by null or interpolated tone on the words ate the, and immediately followed by a boundary which is written LH%. (I base these annotations on Pierrehumber and Hirschberg's [12, ex. 33] discussion of this example.) 3 In the second example (16) above, the","2For the purpose s of this abstract, I am ignoring the distinction between the intonational phrase proper, and what Pierrehumben and her colleagues call the \"intermediate\" phrase, which differ in respect of boundary tone-sequences.","3I continue to gloss over Pierrehumbert's distinction between *'intermediate\" and \"intonational\" phrases."]},{"title":"COMBINATORY PROSODY","paragraphs":["The r,+H* r,H% intonational melody in example (16) belongs to a phrase Fred ate ... which corresponds under the combinatory theory of grammar to a gram-","4The reason for notating the latter boundary as LLg, rather than L is again to do with the distinction between intonational and intermediate phrases.","5The concepts of theme and rheme are closely related to Grosz et al's [5] concepts of \"backward looking center\" and \"forward looking center\".","6Here I depart slightly from Halliday's definition. The present paper also follows Lyons [8] in rejecting Hallidays' claim that the theme must necessarily be sentence-initial.","ran alternative prosody, in which the contrastive tune is confined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and may be the one intended by Jackendoff. I befieve that this altemative is informationally distinct, and arises from an ambiguity as to whether the topic of this discourse is Fred or What Fred ate. It too is accepted by the rules below.","SNore that the position of the pitch accent in the phrase has to do with a further dimension of information structure within both theme and theme, which me might identify as \"focus': I ignore this dimension here. 12 matical constituent, complete with a translation equivalent to the open proposition Az[(ate' z) fred']. The combinatory theory thus offers a way to derive such intonational phrases, using only the independently motivated rules of combinatory grammar, entirely under the control of appropriate intOnation contOurs like L+H* LH%. 9","It is extremely simple tO make the existing combinatory grammar do this. We interpret the two pitch accents as functions over boundaries, of the following types: I0 (17) L+H* := Theme/Bh H* := Rheme/Bl - that is, as functions over boundary tOnes into the two major informational types, the Hallidean \"theme\" and \"rheme\". The reader may wonder at this point why we do not replace the category Theme by a functional category, say Utterance/Rheme, corresponding to its semantic type. The answer is that we do not want this category to combine with any-thing but a complete rheme. In particular, it must not combine with a function into the category Rheme by functional composition. Accordingly we give it a non-functional category, and supply the following special purpose prosodic combinatory rules: (18) Theme Rheme =~ Utterance Rheme Theme =~ Utterance","We next define the various boundary tOnes as arguments to these functions, as follows:","(19) LH% := Bh LL% := B1 L := B1 (As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distinction between intermediate- and intonational- phrase boundaries.) Finally, we accomplish the effect of in-terpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning the following polymorphic category to all elements bearing no tOne specification, which we will represent as the tOne 0: (20) 0 := x/x","9I am grateful to Steven Bird for discussions on the following proposal. 1°An alternative (which would actually be closer to Pierrchumbert and Hirschberg's own proposal to compositionally assemble discourse meanings from more primitive elements of meaning carfled by each individual tone) would be to make the boundary tone the function and the pitch accent an argument. 13 Syntactic combination can then be made subject to the following simple restriction:","(21) The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine. (The prosodic and syntactic combinatory rules need not be the same).","This principle has the sole effect of excluding certain derivations for spoken utterances that would be allowed for the equivalent written sentences. For example, consider the derivations that it permits for example (16) above. The rule of forward composition is allowed tO apply tO the words Fred and ate, because the prosodic categories can combine (by functional application): (22) Fred ate ...

For example, if the reply to the same question What did Fred eat? is FRED must have eaten the BEANS, then the tune will typically be spread over Fred must have eaten .... as in the following (incomplete) derivation, in which much of the syntactic and semantic detail has been omitted in the interests of brevity: (23) Fred must have eaten . ..

Moreover, the theory permits no other derivation for this intonation contour. Of course, repeated application of the composition rule, as in (23), would allow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in (FRED must have eaten)(the BEANS).","In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden by the prosodic constituent condition for the alternative intonation contour on (15). Instead, the following derivation, excluded for the previous example, is now allowed: (25) Fred ate the beans ( II* L ) (","L+II* LI~ ) ......................................... BP:fred' (S\\|P)/llP:ate' IP/|:the' I:beans' P.hme XlX XIX Theme ........ >T .................. > SI(sklP) : IP:the' beans' ~P[P fred'] Theme Rheme","................................ )","SkiP:eat' (the' beans')","Theme","........................................ )","S: ear'(the' beams') ~red' Utterance No other analysis is allowed for (25). Again, the derivation divides the sentence into new and given information consistent with the context given in the example. The effect of the derivation is to annotate the entire predicate as an L+H* LH%. It is emphasised that this does not mean that the tone is spread, but that the whole constituent is marked for the corresponding discourse function -- roughly, as contrastive given, or theme. The finer grain information that it is the object that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides in the tree itself. Similarly, the fact that boundary sequences are associated with words at the lowest level of the derivation does not mean that they are part of the word, or specified in the lexicon, nor that the word is the entity that they are a boundary of. It is 14 prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also are defined by the tree.","All the other possibilities for combining these two contours on this sentence are shown elsewhere [17] to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriate interpretations.","Sentences like the above, including marked theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intonationalAntermediate phrases are by that token unambiguous as to their information structure. However, sentences like the following, which in Pierrehumberts' terms bear a single intonational phrase, are much more ambiguous as to the division that they convey between theme and rheme: (26) I read a book about CORduroy ( H* LL% ) Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to the open proposition it presupposes, for it seems equally apropriate as a response to any of the following questions: (27) a. What did you read a book about? b. What did you read? c. What did you do? Such questions could in suitably contrastive contexts give rise to themes marked by the L+H* LH% tune, bracketing the sentence as follows: (28) a. (1 read a book about)(CORduroy) b. (I read)(a book about CORduroy) c. (I)(read a book about CORduroy) It seems that we shall miss a generalisation concern-ing the relation of intonation to discourse information unless we extend Pierrehumberts theory very slightly, to allow null intermediate phrases, without pitch accents, expressing unmarked themes. Since the boundaries of such intermediate phrases are not explicitly marked, we shall immediately allow all of the above analyses for (26). Such a modification to the theory can be introduced by the following rule, which nondeterministically allows certain constituents bearing the null tone to become a theme: (29) r. r~ X/X ::~ Theme The symbol E is a variable ranging over syntactic categories that are (leftward- or rightward- looking) functions into S. al The rule is nondeterministic, so it correctly continues to allow a further analysis of the entire sentence as a single Intonational Phrase conveying the Rheme. Such an utterance is the appropriate response to yet another open-proposition establishing question, What happened?.)","With this generalisation, we are in a position to make the following claim:","(30) The structures demanded by the theory of intonation and its relation to contextual informarion are the same as the surface syntactic structures permitted by the combinatory grammar. A number of corollaries follow, such as the following:","(31) Anything which can coordinate can be an intonational constituent, and vice versa.

Phonological form maps via the rules of combinatory grammar directly onto a surface structure, whose highest level constituents correspond to intonational constituents, an-notated as to their discourse function. Surface structure therefore subsumes intonational structure. It also subsumes information structure, since the translations of those surface constituents correspond to the entities and open propositions which constitute the topic or theme (if any) and the comment or rheme.

Most obviously, where in the past parsing and phonological processing have tended to deliver conflicting structural analyses, and have had to be pursued independently, they now are seen to be in concert. That is not to say that intonational cues remove all local structural ambiguity. Nor should the problem of recognis-ing cues like boundary tones be underestimated, for the acoustic realisation in the fundamental frequency F0 of the intonational tunes discussed above is entirely dependent upon the rest of the phonology - that is, upon the phonemes and words that bear the tune. It therefore seems most unlikely that intonational contour can be identified in isolation from word recognition. 12","What the isomorphism between syntactic structure and intonational structure does mean is that simply structured modular processors which use both sources of information at once can be more easily devised. Such an architecture may reasonably be expected to simplify the problem of resolving local structural ambiguity in both domains. For example, a syntactic analysis that is so closely related to the structure of the signal should be easier to use to \"filter\" the am-biguities arising from lexical recognition.","However, it is probably more important that the constituents that arise under this analysis are also semantically interpreted. The interpretations are directly related to the concepts, referents and themes that have been established in the context of discourse, say as the result of a question. These discourse entities are in turn directly reducible to the structures involved in knowledge-representation and inference. The direct path from speech to these higher levels of analysis offered by the present theory should therefore make it possible to use more effectively the much more powerful resources of semantics and domainspecific knowledge, including knowledge of the discourse, to filter low-level ambiguities, using larger grammars of a more expressive class than is currently possible. While vast improvements in purely bottom-up word recognition can be expected to conrinue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to successful speech processing by machine, and appears to be characteristic of all levels of human processing, for both spoken and written language. 12This is no bad thing. The converse also applies: intonation contour effects the acoustic rcalisation of words, particularly with respect to timing. It is therefore likely that the benefits of combining intonational recognition and word recognition will be mutual."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["[1] Beckman, Mary and Janet Pierrehumbert: 1986, 'Intonational Structure in Japanese and English',"]},{"title":"Phonology Yearbook,","paragraphs":["3, 255-310.","[2] Chomsky, Noam: 1970, 'Deep Structure, Surface Structure, and Semantic Interpretation', in D.
