To describe both uniformly, we define finite automata (FA) for allomorphy in the same feature description language used for morphotactics. Nonphonologically conditioned allomorphy is problematic in FA models but submits readily to treatment in a uniform formalism. 1 Background and Goals ALLOMORPHY or MORPHOPHONEMICS describes the variation we find among the different forms of a morpheme. For instance, the German second person singular present ending -st has three different allomorphs, -st, -est, -t, determined by the stem it combines with:","'say' 'pray' 'mix'","(1) lsg pres ind 2sg pres ind 3sg pres ind sag+e","sag+st","sag+t bet + e bet+ est bet-/-et mix+e","mix+t","mix+t MORPHOTACTICS describes the arrangement of morphs in words, including, e.g., the properties of -st that it is a suffix (and thus follows the stem it combines with), and that it combines with verbs. While allomorphy is normally described in finite automata (FA), morphotactics is generally described in syntax-oriented models, e.g., CFGs or feature-based grammars.","The present paper describes both allomorphy and morphotactics in a feature-based language like that of Head-Driven Phrase Struc-ture Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987).","*This work was supported by research grant ITW 9002 0 from the German Bundesministerium ffir Forschung und Technologie to the DFKI DISCO project. We are grateful to an anonymous ACL reviewer for helpful comments. The technical kernel of the paper is a feature-based definition of FA. 1 While it is unsurprising that the languages defined by FA may also be defined by feature description languages (FDL), our reduction goes beyond this, showing how the FA themselves may be defined. The significance of specifying the FA and not merely the language it generates is that it allows us to use FA technology in processing allomorphy, even while keeping the interface to other grammar components maximally transparent (i.e., there is NO interface--all linguistic information is specified via FDL).","Our motivation for exploring this application of typed feature logic is the opportunity it provides for integrating in a single descriptive formalism not only (i) allomorphic and morphotactic information but also (ii) coneatenative and non-concatenative allomorphy. The latter is particularly useful when concatenative and non-concatenative allomorphy coexists in a single language, as it does, e.g., in German. 2 Finite Automata as Typed Feature Structures An FA A is defined by a 5-tuple (Q, E, 5, q0, F), where Q is a finite set of STATES, ~ a finite INPUT ALPHABET, (~ : Q x ~ ---y Q is the TRAN-SITION FUNCTION, q0 E Q the INITIAL STATE, and F _C Q the set of FINAL STATES. 2 For reasons of simplicity and space, we only refer to the simplest form of FA, viz., DETERMIN-ISTIC finite automata without e-moves which consume exactly one input symbol at a time. This is of course not a restriction w.r.t, expressivity: given an arbitrary automaton, we can always construct a deterministic, equiva-I See Krieger 1993b for the details and several extensions. 2We assume a familiarity with automata theory (e.g., Hopcroft and Ullman 1979). 140 lent one which recognizes the same language (see Hopcroft and Ullman 1979). Fortunately, our approach is also capable of representing and processing directly non-deterministic FA with e-moves and allows for edges which are multiple-symbol consumers.","Specifying an automaton in our approach means introducing for every state q E Q a possibly recursive feature type with the same name as q. We will call such a type a CONFIGURATION. Exactly the attributes EDGE, NEXT, and INPUT are appropriate for a configuration, where EDGE encodes disjunctively the outgoing edges of q, NEXT the successor states of q, and INPUT the symbols which remain on the input list when reaching q.S Note that a configuration does not model just a state of the automaton, but an entire description at a point in computation."]},{"title":"[","paragraphs":["EDGE input-symb ] (2) proto-confi9 _= | NEXT config |"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["INPUT list(input-symb)J","We now define two natural subtypes of protocon fig.

DSrre and Eisele 1989 and Backofen et al. 1990 introduce distributed disjunctions because they (normally) allow more efficient processing of disjunctions, sometimes obviating the need to expand to disjunctive normal form.

Note that this state-ment can be easily proved when assuming a classical set-theoretical semantics for feature structures (e.g., Smolka 1988). To give the flavor of how this is accomplished, consider the two regular expressions 1 : ab*c and/22 -- a*bc. We model them via six types, one for each state of the automata. The initial state of/21 is A, that of/22 is X. The intersection of£1 and/22 is given by the unification of A and X. Unifying A and X leads to the following structure: (11) : |EDGE a [NEXT BJ [NEXT $1 {XV Y}J [NEXT B A Now, testing whether w belongs to /21 N/22 is equivalent to the satisfiability (consistency) of (12) A A X A [INPUT w], where type expansion yields a decision procedure.

Krieger 1993b provides proofs using auxiliary definitions and apparatus we lack space for here. 3 Allomorphy The focus of this section lies in the illustration of the proposal above and in the demonstration of some benefits that can be drawn from the in-tegration of allomorphy and morphotactics; we eschew here the discussion of alternative the-ories and concentrate on inflectional morphology. We describe inflection using a word-and-paradigm (WP) specification of morphotactics (Matthews 1972) and a two-level treatment of allomorphy (Koskenniemi 1983). We also indicate some potential advantages of mixed models of allomorphy--finite state and other. 6 3.1 WP Morphotactlcs in FDL Several WORD-GRAMMARS use FDL morphotactics (Trost 1991, Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 on derivation); alternative models are also available. Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 propose an FDL-based WP treatment of inflection. The basic idea is to characterize all the elements of a paradigm as alternative specifications of abstract lexemes. Technically, this is realized through the specification of large disjunctions which unify with lexeme specifications. The","SThe choice of two-level allomorphy is justified both by the simplicity of two-level descriptions and by their status as a \"lingua franca\" among computational morphologists.

The various allomorphs of -st in (1) are not distinguished in the FDL, and Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 foresaw an interface to an external module for allomorphy. It would be possible--but scientifically poor--to distinguish all of the variants at the level of morphotactics, providing a brute-force solution and multiplying paradigms greatly. 7 The characterization in Section 2 above allows us to formulate WITHIN FDL the missing allomorphy component. 3.2 Two-Level Allomorphy Two-level morphology has become popular because it is a declarative, bidirectional and efficient means of treating allomorphy (see Sproat 1992 for a comprehensive introduction). In general, two-level descriptions provide constraints on correspondences between underlying (lexical) and surface levels. We shall use it to state constraints between morphemic units and their allomorphic realizations. Because two-level automata characterize relations between two levels, they are often referred to (and often realized as) transducers. The individual rules then represent constraints on the relation being transduced.","The different forms of the suffix in 2nd person singular in (1) are predictable given the phonological shape of the stem, and the alternations can be described by the following (simplified) two-level rules (we have abstracted away from inessential restrictions here, e.g., that (strong) verbs with i/e-umlaut do not show epenthesis):","rTzoukermann and Libermann 1990 show that multiplying paradigms need not degrade performance, however."]},{"title":"143","paragraphs":["(14) e-epenthesis in the bet- case +:e ."]},{"title":"{d,t}_{s,t}","paragraphs":["s-deletion in the mix- case s:O ¢:~ {s,z,z, ch}+:O t The colon ':' indicates a correspondence between lexical and surface levels.

Our proposal follows theirs, improving only on the degree to which morphotactics may be integrated with allomorphy. See Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 for proposals for treating morphotactics in typed feature systems.","We illustrate how the FDL approach overcomes the last two difficulties in a concrete case of nonphonologically motivated allomorphy.

These feature structures are unified with the underlying morphs in order to check the context restrictions, and thus serve as an interface to information provided in the feature-based lexicon. But Trost's two-level rules are a completely different data structure from the feature structures decorating transitions in FA.","We attack the problem head on by restricting allomorphic constraints to specific classes of lexical entries, making use of the inheritance techniques available in structured lexicons• The cases of epenthesis in (22) is handled by defining not only the rule in (19-21) for the verbal cases, but also a second, quite similar rule for the more liberal epenthesis in adjectives) ° This frees the 1°In fact, the rules could be specified so that the T • . ° allomorphy epenth-1 epenth-2 epenth-3 word Adj Verb ...

Second, researchers at Edinburgh (Calder 1988, Bird 1992) first suggested using FDLs in phonological and morphological description, and Bird 1992 suggests describing FA in FDL (without showing how they might be so characterized, however--in particular, providing no FDL definition of what it means for an FA to accept a string).","Third, Cahill 1990 posed the critical question, viz., how is one to link the work in lexical inheritance (on morphotactics) with that in finite-state morphology (on allomorphy). This earlier work retained a separation of formalisms for allomorphy (MOLUSC) and morphotactics (DATR). Cahill 1993 goes on to experiment with assuming all of the allomorphic specification into the lexicon, in just the spirit proposed here. 11 Our work differs from this later work (i) in that we use FDL while she uses DATR, which are similar but not identical (cf. Nerbonne 1992); and (ii) in that we have been concerned with showing how the standard model of allomorphy (FA) may be assumed into the inheritance hierarchy of the lexicon, while Cahill has introduced syllable-based models. 4.2 Future Work At present only the minimal examples in Section 2 above have actually been implemented, and we are interested in attempting more. Second, a compilation into genuine finite state models could be useful. Third, we are concerned that, in restricting ourselves thus far to acceptors over two-level alphabets, we may incur parsing problems, which a more direct approach through finite-state transducers can avoid (Sproat 1992, p.143). See Ritchie et al. 1992, 19-33 for an approach to parsing using finite-state acceptors, however. 4.3 Summary This paper proposes a treatment of allomorphy formulated and processable in typed feature logic. There are several reasons for developing this approach to morphology. First, we prefer the GENERALITY of a system in which linguistic knowledge of all sorts may be expressed--at least as long as we do not sacrifice processing efficiency. This is an overarching goal of HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987)--in which syntax and semantics is described in a feature formalism, and in which strides toward descriptions of morphotactics (Krieger 1993a, Riehemann 1993,","lICf. Reinhard and Gibbon 1991 for another sort of DATR-based allomorphy Gerdemann 1993) and phonology (Bird 1992) have been taken. This work is the first to show how allomorphy may be described here. The proposal here would allow one to describe segments using features, as well, but we have not explored this opportunity for reasons of space.","Second, the uniform formalism allows the exact and more transparent specification of dependencies which span modules of otherwise different formalisms. Obviously interesting cases for the extension of feature-based descriptions to other areas are those involving stress and intonation--where phonological properties can determine the meaning (via focus) and even syntactic well-formedness (e.g., of deviant word or-ders). Similarly, allomorphic variants covary in the style register they belong to: the German dative singular in -e, dera Kinde, belongs to a formal register.","Third, and more specifically, the feature-based treatment of allomorphy overcomes the bifurcation of morphology into lexical aspects-- which have mostly been treated in lexical inheritance schemes--and phonological aspects-- which are normally treated in finite-state morphology. This division has long been recognized as problematic. One symptom of the problem is seen in the treatment of nonphonologically conditioned allomorphy, such as German umlaut, which (Trost 1990) correctly criticizes as ad hoc in finite-state morphology because the latter deals only in phonological (or graphemic) categories. We illustrated the benefits of the uniform formalism above where we showed how a similar nonphonologically motivated alternation (German schwa epenthesis) is treated in a feature-based description, which may deal in several levels of linguistic description simultaneously."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Backofen, R., L.
