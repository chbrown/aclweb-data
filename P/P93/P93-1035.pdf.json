The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction. INTRODUCTION There has been a great deal of interest of late in the automatic induction of natural language grammar. Given the difficulty inherent in manually building a robust parser, along with the availability of large amounts of training material, automatic grammar induction seems like a path worth pursuing. A number of systems have been built that can be trained automatically to bracket text into syntactic constituents. In (MM90) mutual information statistics are extracted from a corpus of text and this information is then used to parse new text. (Sam86) defines a function to score the quality of parse trees, and then uses simulated an-nealing to heuristically explore the entire space of possible parses for a given sentence. In (BM92a), distributional analysis techniques are applied to a large corpus to learn a context-free grammar.","The most promising results to date have been","*The author would like to thank Mark Liberman, Melting Lu, David Magerman, Mitch Marcus, Rich Pito, Giorgio Satta, Yves Schabes and Tom Veatch.

The inside-outside algorithm is an extension of the finite-state based Hidden Markov Model (by (Bak79)), which has been applied successfully in many areas, including speech recognition and part of speech tagging. A number of recent papers have explored the potential of using the inside-outside algorithm to automatically learn a grammar (LY90, SJM90, PS92, BW92, CC92, SRO93).","Below, we describe a new technique for grammar induction. The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of parsing in the current state to the proper phrase structure for each sentence in the training corpus, the system learns a set of ordered transformations which can be applied to reduce parsing error. We believe this technique has advantages over other methods of phrase structure induction. Some of the advantages include: the system is very simple, it requires only a very small set of transformations, a high degree of accuracy is achieved, and only a very small training corpus is necessary. The trained transformational parser is completely symbolic and can bracket text in linear time with respect to sentence length. In addition, since some tokens in a sentence are not even considered in parsing, the method could prove to be considerably more robust than a CFG-based approach when faced with noise or unfamiliar input. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic phrase structure induction. TRANSFORMATION-BASED ERROR-DRIVEN LEARNING The phrase structure learning algorithm is a transformation-based error-driven learner.

In its initial state, the learner is capable of annotating text but is not very good at doing so. The initial state is usually very easy to create. In part of speech tagging, the initial state annotator assigns every word its most likely tag. In prepositional phrase attachment, the initial state annotator always attaches prepositional phrases low. In word classification, all words are initially classified as nouns. The naively annotated text is compared to the true annotation as indicated by a small manually annotated corpus, and transformations are learned that can be applied to the output of the initial state annotator to make it better resemble the truth."]},{"title":"LEARNING PHRASE STRUCTURE","paragraphs":["The phrase structure learning algorithm is trained on a small corpus of partially bracketed text which is also annotated with part of speech information. All of the experiments presented below were done using the Penn Treebank annotated corpus(MSM93). The learner begins in a naive initial state, knowing very little about the phrase structure of the target corpus. In particular, all that is initially known is that English tends to be right branching and that final punctuation is final punctuation. Transformations are then learned automatically which transform the output of the naive parser into output which better resembles the phrase structure found in the training corpus. Once a set of transformations has been learned, the system is capable of taking sentences tagged with parts of speech and return-ing a binary-branching structure with nonterminals unlabelled. 2 The"]},{"title":"Initial State","paragraphs":["Of The"]},{"title":"Parser","paragraphs":["Initially, the parser operates by assigning a right-linear structure to all sentences.

In some experiments below, we begin with an even more naive initial state of knowledge: sentences are parsed by assigning them a random binary-branching structure with final punctuation always attached high."]},{"title":"Structural Transformations","paragraphs":["The next stage involves learning a set of transformations that can be applied to the output of the naive parser to make these sentences better conform to the proper structure specified in the training corpus. The list of possible transformation types is prespecified. Transformations involve making a simple change triggered by a simple environment. In the current implementation, there are twelve allowable transformation types: • (1-8) (AddHelete) a (leftlright) parenthesis to the (leftlright) of part of speech tag X. • (9-12) (Add]delete) a (left]right) parenthesis between tags X and Y.","To carry out a transformation by adding or deleting a parenthesis, a number of additional simple changes must take place to preserve balanced parentheses and binary branching.

Sentences in the training set are first parsed using the naive parser which assigns right linear structure to all sentences, attaching final punctuation high. Next, for each possible instantiation of the twelve transformation templates, that particular transformation is applied to the naively parsed sentences. The resuiting structures are then scored using some measure of success that compares these parses to the correct structural descriptions for the sentences provided in the training corpus. The transformation resulting in the best scoring structures then becomes the first transformation of the ordered set of transformations that are to be learned. That transformation is applied to the right-linear structures, and then learning proceeds on the corpus of improved sentence bracketings. The following procedure is carried out repeatedly on the training corpus until no more transformations can be found whose application reduces the error in parsing the training corpus:","1. The best transformation is found for the structures output by the parser in its current state. 6","2. The transformation is applied to the output resulting from bracketing the corpus using the parser in its current state.","3.

Go to 1.","After a set of transformations has been learned, it can be used to effectively parse fresh text. To parse fresh text, the text is first naively parsed and then every transformation is applied, in order, to the naively parsed text.","One nice feature of this method is that different measures of bracketing success can be used: learning can proceed in such a way as to try to optimize any specified measure of success. The measure we have chosen for our experiments is the same measure described in (PS92), which is one of the measures that arose out of a parser evaluation workshop (ea91). The measure is the percentage of constituents (strings of words between matching parentheses) from sentences output by our system which do not cross any constituents in the Penn Treebank structural description of the sentence. For example, if our system outputs: (((Thebig) (dogate)).) and the Penn Treebank bracketing for this sentence was: (((Thebigdog) ate). ) then the constituent the big would be judged correct whereas the constituent dog ate would not.","Below are the first seven transformations found from one run of training on the Wall Street Journal corpus, which was initially bracketed using the right-linear initial-state parser. 1.

Since small counts are less reliable than large counts, we cannot reliably assume that these transformations will also improve performance in the test corpus.

When parsing free text, we cannot assume that the text will be tagged with the accuracy of a human annotator. Instead, an automatic tagger would have to be used to first tag the text before parsing. To address this issue, we ran one experiment where we randomly induced a 5% tagging error rate beyond the error rate of the human annotator. Errors were induced in such a way as to preserve the unigram part of speech tag probability distribution in the corpus. The experiment was run for sentences of length 2-15, with a training set of 1000 sentences and a test set of 500 sentences. The resulting bracketing accuracy was 90.1%, compared to 91.6% accuracy when using an unadulterated training corpus. Accuracy only degraded by a small amount when training on the corpus with adulterated part of speech tags, suggesting that high parsing accuracy rates could be achieved if tagging of the input were done automatically by a part of speech tagger."]},{"title":"CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have described a new approach for learning a grammar to automatically parse text. The method can be used to obtain high parsing accuracy with a very small training set. Instead of learning a traditional grammar, an ordered set of structural transformations is learned that can be applied to the output of a very naive parser to obtain binary-branching trees with un-labelled nonterminals. Experiments have shown that these parses conform with high accuracy to the structural descriptions specified in a manually annotated corpus. Unlike other recent attempts at automatic grammar induction that rely heavily on statistics both in training and in the resulting grammar, our learner is only very weakly statistical. For training, only integers are needed and the only mathematical operations carried out are integer addition and integer comparison. The resulting grammar is completely symbolic. Unlike learners based on the inside-outside algorithm which attempt to find a grammar to maximize the probability of the training corpus in hope that this grammar will match the grammar that provides the most accurate structural descriptions, the transformation-based learner can readily use any desired success measure in learning.","We have already begun the next step in this project: automatically labelling the nonterminal nodes. The parser will first use the ~ransforma- ~ioual grammar to output a parse tree without nonterminal labels, and then a separate algorithm will be applied to that tree to label the nonterminals.

In addition, we plan to experiment with other types of transformations. Currently, each transformation in the learned list is only applied once in each appropriate environ-ment. For a transformation to be applied more than once in one environment, it must appear in the transformation list more than once. One possible extension to the set of transformation types would be to allow for transformations of the form: add/delete a paren as many times as is possible in a particular environment. We also plan to experiment with other scoring functions and control strategies for finding transformations and to use this system as a postprocessor to other grammar induction systems, learning transformations to improve their performance. We hope these future paths will lead to a trainable and very accurate parser for free text. [Bak79] [BM92a] [BM92b] [BR93] [Bri92] [Bri93] [BW92] References J. Baker.
