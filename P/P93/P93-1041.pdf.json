A text segment is a coherent scene; the words in a segment a~e linked together via lexical cohesion relations. LCP records mutual similarity of words in a sequence of text. The similarity of words, which represents their cohesiveness, is computed using a semantic network. Comparison with the text segments marked by a number of subjects shows that LCP closely correlates with the human judgments. LCP may provide valuable information for resolving anaphora and ellipsis. INTRODUCTION A text is not just a sequence of words, but it has coherent structure. The meaning of each word can not be determined until it is placed in the structure of the text. Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding, especially in resolving anaphora and ellipsis.","One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment. A text segment, whether or not it is explicitly marked, as are sentences and paragraphs, is defined as a sequence of clauses or sentences that display local coherence. It resembles a scene in a movie, which describes the same objects in the same situation.","This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text. LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text. Lexical cohesiveness is defined as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computed by spreading activation on a semantic network. Hills and valleys of LCP closely correlate with changing of segments."]},{"title":"SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE","paragraphs":["Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure. For example, cue phrases play an important role in signaling segment changes. (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) However, such clues are not directly based on coherence which forms the clauses or sentences into a segment.","Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabulary management profile) as an indicator of segment boundaries. VMP is a record of the number of new vocabulary terms introduced in an interval of text. However, VMP does not work well on a high-density text. The reason is that coherence of a segment should be determined not only by reiteration of words but also by lexical cohesion.","Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget's the-saurus to determine whether or not two words have lexical cohesion. Their method can capture ahnost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g. systematic and non-systematic semantic relation. However it does not deal with strength of cohesiveness which suggests the degree of contribution to coherence of the segment."]},{"title":"Computing Lexieal Cohesion","paragraphs":["Kozima and Furugori (1993) defined lexical cohesiveness as semantic similarity between words, and proposed a method for measuring it. Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network which is systematically constructed from an English dictionary (LDOCE).","The similarity cr(w,w') E [0,1] between words w,w ~ is computed in the following way: (1) produce an activated pattern by activating the node w; (2) observe activity of the node w t in the activated pattern.

VERIFICATION OF LCP This section inspects the correlation between LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the human judgments. The curve of Figure 4 shows the LCP of the simplified version of O.Henry's \"Springtime £ la Carte\" (Thornley, 1960). The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the text without paragraph structure.","It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries. For example, the clear valley at i = 110 exactly corresponds to the dominant segment boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary shown as a dotted line).","Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure. For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary.","However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries. For example, the valley near i = 450 disagree with the segment boundary at i = 465. The reason is that lexical cohesion can not cover all aspect of coherence of a segment; an incoherent piece of text can be lexically cohesive. CONCLUSION This paper proposed LCP, an indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text segment. The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments.","Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding:","• Resolving anaphora and ellipsis: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents.","• Analyzing text structure: Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text. The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing. (Consider a list of average meaning of segments.)","In future research, the author needs to examine validity of LCP for other genres -- Hearst (1993) segments expository texts. Incorporating other clues (e.g. cue phrases, tense and aspect, etc.) is also needed to make this segmentation method more robust.
