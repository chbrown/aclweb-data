Vector representations for the part-of-speech of a word are formed from entries of its near lexical neighbors. A dimensionality reduction creates a space represent-ing the syntactic categories of unambiguous words. A neural net trained on these spatial representations classifies individual contexts of occurrence of ambiguous words. The method classifies both ambiguous and unambiguous words correctly with high accuracy. INTRODUCTION Part-of-speech information about individual words is necessary for any kind of syntactic and higher level processing of natural language. While it is easy to obtain lists with part of speech labels for frequent English words, such information is not available for less common languages. Even for English, a categorization of words that is tailored to a particular genre may be desired. Finally, there are rare words that need to be categorized even if frequent words are covered by an available electronic dictionary.","This paper presents a method for inducing the parts of speech of a language and part-of-speech labels for individual words from a large text corpus. Little, if any, language-specific knowledge is used, so that it is applicable to any language in principle. Since the part-of-speech representations are derived from the corpus, the resulting categorization is highly text specific and doesn't contain categories that are inappropriate for the genre in question. The method is efficient enough for vocabularies of tens of thousands of words thus addressing the problem of coverage.","The problem of how syntactic categories can be induced is also of theoretical interest in language acquisition and learnability. Syntactic category information is part of the basic knowledge about language that children must learn before they can acquire more complicated structures. It has been claimed that \"the properties that the child can detect in the input - such as the serial positions and adjacency and co-occurrence relations among words - are in general linguistically irrelevant.\" (Pinker 1984) It will be shown here that relative position of words with respect to each other is sufficient for learning the major syntactic categories.","In the first part of the derivation, two iterations of a massive linear approximation of cooccurrence counts categorize unambiguous words. Then a neural net trained on these words classifies individual contexts of occurrence of ambiguous words. An evaluation suggests that the method classifies both ambiguous and unambiguous words correctly. It differs from previous work in its efficiency and applicability to large vocabularies; and in that linguistic knowledge is only used in the very last step so that theoretical assumptions that don't hold for a language or sublanguage have minimal influence on the classification.","The next two sections describe the linear approximation and a birecurrent neural network for the classification of ambiguous words. The last section discusses the results. CATEGORY SPACE The goal of the first step of the induction is to compute a multidimensional real-valued space, called category space, in which the syntactic category of each word is represented by a vector. Proximity in the space is related to similarity of syntactic category. The vectors in this space will then be used as input and target vectors for the connectionist net.","The vector space is bootstrapped by collecting relevant distributional information about words. The 5,000 most frequent words in five months of the New York Times News Service (June through 251 October 1990) were selected for the experiments. For each pair of these words < wi, w i >, the number of occurrences of wi immediately to the left of wj (hi,j), the number of occurrences of wi immediately to the right ofwj (cij), the number of occurrences of wl at a distance of one word to the left of wj (ai,j), and the number of occurrences ofwi at a distance of one word to the right of wj (d/j) were counted. The four sets of 25,000,000 counts were collected in the 5,000-by-5,000 matrices B, C, A, and D, respectively. Finally these four matrices were combined into one large 5,000-by-20,000 matrix as shown in Figure 1. The figure also shows for two words where their four cooccurrence counts are located in the 5,000-by-20,000 matrix. In the experiments, w3000 was resistance and ~/24250 was theaters. The four marks in the figure, the positions of the counts"]},{"title":"1:13000,4250, b3000,4250, e3000,4250,","paragraphs":["and d3000,4~50, indicate how often resistance occurred at positions -2, -1, 1, and 2 with respect to theaters.","These 20,000-element rows of the matrix could be used directly to compute the syntactic similarity between individual words: The cosine of the angle between the vectors of a pair of words is a measure of their similarity. I However, computa-tions with such large vectors are time-consuming. Therefore a singular value decomposition was performed on the matrix. Fifteen singular values were computed using a sparse matrix algorithm from SVDPACK (Berry 1992). As a result, each of the 5,000 words is represented by a vector of real numbers. Since the original 20,000-component vectors of two words (corresponding to rows in the matrix in Figure 1) are similar if their collocations are similar, the same holds for the reduced vectors because the singular value decomposition finds the best least square approximation for the 5,000 original vectors in a 15-dimensional space that preserves similarity between vectors. See (Deerwester et al. 1990) for a definition of SVD and an application to a similar problem.","Close neighbors in the 15-dimensional space generally have the same syntactic category as can be seen in Table 1. However, the problem with this method is that it will not scale up to a very large number of words. The singular value decomposition has a time complexity quadratic in the rank of the matrix, so that one can only treat a small part of the total vocabulary of a large corpus.","Therefore, an alternative set of features was considered: classes of words in the 15-dimensional space. Instead of counting the number of occurrences of individual words, we would now count","1The cosine between two vectors corresponds to the normalized correlation coefficient: cos(c~(~,ff)) = the number of occurrences of members of word classes. 2 The space was clustered with Buckshot, a linear-time clustering algorithm described in (Cutting et al. 1992). Buckshort applies a high-quality quadratic clustering algorithm to a random sample of size v/k-n, where k is the number of desired cluster centers and n is the number of vectors to be clustered. Each of the remaining n - ~ vectors is assigned to the nearest cluster center. The high-quality quadratic clustering algorithm used was truncated group average agglomeration (Cutting et al. 1992).","Clustering algorithms generally do not construct groups with just one member. But there are many closed-class words such as auxiliaries and prepositions that shouldn't be thrown together with the open classes (verbs, nouns etc.). Therefore, a list of 278 closed-class words, essentially the words with the highest frequency, was set aside. The remaining 4722 words were classified into 222 classes using Buckshot.","The resulting 500 classes (278 high-frequency words, 222 clusters) were used as features in the matrix shown in Figure 2. Since the number of features has been greatly reduced, a larger number of words can be considered. For the second matrix all 22,771 words that occurred at least 100 times in 18 months of the New York Times News Service (May 1989 - October 1990) were selected. Again, there are four submatrices, corresponding to four relative positions. For example, the entries aij in the A part of the matrix count how often a member of class i occurs at a distance of one word to the left of word j. Again, a singular value decomposition was performed on the matrix, this time 10 singular values were computed. (Note that in the first figure the 20,000-element rows of the matrix are reduced to 15 dimensions whereas in the second matrix the 2,000-element columns are reduced to 10 dimensions.)","Table 2 shows 20 randomly selected words and their nearest neighbors in category space (in order of proximity to the head word). As can be seen from the table, proximity in the space is a good predictor of similar syntactic category. The nearest neighbors of athlete, clerk, declaration, and dome are singular nouns, the nearest neighbors of bowers and gibbs are family names, the nearest neighbors of desirable and sole are adjectives, and the nearest neighbors of financings are plural nouns, in each case without exception. The neighborhoods of armaments, cliches and luxuries (nouns), and b'nai and northwestern (NP-initial modifiers) fail to respect finer grained syntactic","2Cf.

This was done with Buckshot. The resulting 200 clusters yielded good results for unambiguous words. However, for the reasons discussed above (linear combination of profiles of different categories) the clustering was not very successful for ambiguous words. Therefore, a different strategy was chosen for assigning category labels. In order to tease apart the different uses of ambiguous words, one has to go back to the individual contexts of use. The connectionist network in Figure 3 was used to analyze individual contexts.","The idea of the network is similar to Elman's recurrent networks (Elman 1990, Elman 1991): The network learns about the syntactic structure of the language bY trying to predict the next word from its own context units in the previous step and the current word. The network in Figure 3 has two novel features: It uses the vectors from the second singular vMue decomposition as input and target. Note that distributed vector representations are ideal for connectionist nets, so that a connectionist model seems most appropriate for the prediction task. The second innovation is that the net is birecurrent. It has recurrency to the left as well as to the right.","In more detail, the network's input consists of the word to the left tn-1, its own left context in the previous time step c-l,,-1, the word to the right"]},{"title":"tn+l","paragraphs":["and its own right context C-rn+l in the next time step.

However, this would give rise to too much variety in category labels. To illustrate, consider the prediction of the category NOUN. If the network categorizes occurrences of nouns correctly as being in the region around declaration, then the slightest variation in the output will change the nearest neighbor of the output vector from declaration to its nearest neighbors sequence or mood (see Table 2). This would be confusing to the human user of the categorization program.","Therefore, the first 5,000 output vectors of the network (from the first day of June 1990), were clustered into 200 output clusters with Buckshot.

It seems naive to believe that all syntactic information of the sequence of words to the left (or to the right) can be expressed in such a small number of units. A larger experiment with more hidden units for each context vector will hopefully yield better results. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Brill and Marcus describe an approach with similar goals in (Brill and Marcus 1992). Their method requires an initial consultation of a native speaker for a couple of hours. The method presented here makes a short consultation of a native speaker necessary, however it occurs at the end, as the last step of category induction. This has the advantage of avoiding bias in an initial a priori classification.","Finch and Chater present an approach to category induction that also starts out with offset counts, proceeds by classifying words on the basis of these counts, and then goes back to the lo-cal context for better results (Finch and Chater 1992). But the mathematical and computational techniques used here seem to be more efficient and more accurate than Finch and Chater's, and hence applicable to vocabularies of a more realistic size.","An important feature of the last step of the procedure, the neural network, is that the lexicographer or linguist can browse the space of output vectors for a given word to get a sense of its syntactic distribution (for instance uses of better as an adverb) or to improve the classification (for instance by splitting an induced category that is too coarse). The algorithm can also be used for categorizing unseen words. This is possible as long as the words surrounding it are known.","The procedure for part-of-speech categorization introduced here may be of interest even for words whose part-of-speech labels are known. The dimensionality reduction makes the global distributional pattern of a word available in a profile consisting of a dozen or so real numbers. Because of its compactness, this profile can be used efficiently as an additional source of information for improving the performance of natural language processing systems. For example, adverbs may be lumped into one category in the lexicon of a processing system. But the category vectors of adverbs that are used in different positions such as completely (mainly pre~adjectival), normally (mainly pre-verbal) and differently (mainly postverbal) are different because of their different distributional properties. This information can be exploited by a parser if the category vectors are available as an additional source of information.","The model has also implications for language acquisition. (Maratsos and Chalkley 1981) propose that the absolute position of words in sentences is important evidence in children's learning of categories. The results presented here show that relative position is sufficient for learning the major syntactic categories. This suggests that relative position could be important information for learning syntactic categories in child language acquisition.","The basic idea of this paper is to collect a 257 large amount of distributional information consisting of word cooccurrence counts and to compute a compact, low-rank approximation. The same approach was applied in (Sch/itze, forthcoming) to the induction of vector representations for semantic information about words (a different source of distributional information was used there). Because of the graded information present in a multi-dimensional space, vector representations are particularly well-suited for integrating different sources of information for disambigua-tion.","In summary, the algorithm introduced here provides a language-independent, largely automatic method for inducing highly text-specific syntactic categories for a large vocabulary. It is to be hoped that the method for distributional analysis presented here will make it easier for computational and traditional lexicographers to build dictionaries that accurately reflect language use."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","paragraphs":["I'm indebted to Mike Berry for SVDPACK and to Marti Hearst, Jan Pedersen and two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments.
