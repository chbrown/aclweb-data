This paper discusses how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that do not occur in the training data. We present a method that makes local analogies between each specific unobserved cooccurrence and other cooccurrences that contain similar words, as determined by an appropriate word similarity metric.

Different types of cooccurrence relations are in use, such as cooccurrence within a consecutive sequence of words (n-grams), within syntactic relations (verb-object, adjective-noun, etc.) or the cooccurrence of two words within a limited distance in the context. Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al., ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al., 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al., 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990).","A major problem for the above applications is how to estimate the probability of cooccurrences that were not observed in the training corpus. Due to data sparseness in unrestricted language, the aggregate probability of such cooccurrences is large and can easily get to 25% or more, even for a very large training corpus (Church and Mercer, 1992). Since applications often have to compare alternative hypothesized cooccurrences, it is important to distinguish between those unobserved cooccurrences that are likely to occur in a new piece of text and those that are not. These distinctions ought to be made using the data that do occur in the corpus. Thus, beyond its own practical importance, the sparse data problem provides an informative touchstone for theories on generalization and analogy in linguistic data.","The literature suggests two major approaches for solving the sparse data problem: smoothing and class based methods. Smoothing methods estimate the probability of unobserved cooccurrences using frequency information (Good, 1953; Katz, 1987; Jelinek and Mercer, 1985; Church and Gale, 1991). Church and Gale (Church and Gale, 1991) show, that for unobserved bigrams, the estimates of several smoothing methods closely agree with the probability that is expected using the frequencies of the two words and assuming that their occurrence is independent ((Church and Gale, 1991), figure 5). Furthermore, using held out data they show that this is the probability that should be estimated by a smoothing method that takes into account the frequencies of the individual words. Relying on this result, we will use frequency based es~imalion (using word frequencies) as representative for smoothing estimates of unobserved cooccurrences, for comparison purposes. As will be shown later, the problem with smoothing estimates is that they ignore the expected degree of association between the specific words of the cooccurrence. For example, we would not like to estimate the same probability for two cooccurrences like 'eat bread' and 'eat cars', despite the fact that both 'bread' and 'cars' may have the same frequency.","Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of \"similar\" words. The probability of a specific cooccurrence is determined using generalized parameters about the probability of class cooccur- ] 64 rence. This approach, which follows long traditions in semantic classification, is very appealing, as it attempts to capture \"typical\" properties of classes of words. However, it is not clear at all that unrestricted language is indeed structured the way it is assumed by class based models. In particular, it is not clear that word cooccurrence patterns can be structured and generalized to class cooccurrence parameters without losing too much information.","This paper suggests an alternative approach which assumes that class based generalizations should be avoided, and therefore eliminates the in-termediate level of word classes. Like some of the class based models, we use a similarity metric to measure the similarity between cooccurrence patterns of words. But then, rather than using this metric to construct a set of word classes, we use it to identify the most specific analogies that can he drawn for each specific estimation. Thus, to estimate the probability of an unobserved cooccurfence of words, we use data about other cooccurfences that were observed in the corpus, and contain words that are similar to the given ones. For example, to estimate the probability of the unobserved cooccurrence 'negative results', we use cooccurrences such as 'positive results' and 'negative numbers', that do occur in our corpus.","The analogies we make are based on the as-sumption that similar word cooccurrences have similar values of mutual information. Accordingly, our similarity metric was developed to capture similarities between vectors of mutual information values. In addition, we use an efficient search heuristic to identify the most similar words for a given word, thus making the method computationally affordable. Figure 1 illustrates a portion of the similarity network induced by the similarity metric (only some of the edges, with relatively high values, are shown). This network may be found useful for other purposes, independently of the estimation method.","The estimation method was implemented using the relation of cooccurrence of two words within a limited distance in a sentence. The proposed method, however, is general and is applicable for anY type of lexical cooccurrence. The method was evaluated in two experiments. In the first one we achieved a complete scenario of the use of the estimation method, by implementing a variant of the d[Sambiguation method in (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense selection in machine translation. The estimation method was then successfully used to increase the coverage of the disambiguation method by 15%, with an increase of the overall precision compared to a naive, frequency based, method. In the second experiment we evaluated the estimation method on a data recovery task. The task simulates a typical scenario in disambiguation, and also relates to theoretical questions about redundancy and idiosyncrasy in cooccurrence data. In this evaluation, which involved 300 examples, the performance of the estimation method was by 27% better than frequency based estimation."]},{"title":"2 Definitions","paragraphs":["We use the term"]},{"title":"cooccurrence pair,","paragraphs":["written as (x, y), to denote a cooccurrence of two words in a sentence within a distance of no more than d words.

As with bigrams, a cooccurrence pair is directional, i.e. (x,y) ¢ (y,x). This captures some information about the asymmetry in the linear order of linguistic relations, such as the fact that verbs tend to precede their objects and follow their subjects.","The mutual information of a cooccurrence pair, which measures the degree of association between the two words (Church and Hanks, 1990), is defined as (Fano, 1961): P(xly)"]},{"title":"I(x,y)","paragraphs":["-- log 2"]},{"title":"P(x,y) _","paragraphs":["log 2 (1)"]},{"title":"P(x)P(y) P(x)","paragraphs":["= log 2"]},{"title":"P(y[x) P(Y)","paragraphs":["where P(x) and"]},{"title":"P(y)","paragraphs":["are the probabilities of the events x and y (occurrences of words, in our case) and"]},{"title":"P(x, y)","paragraphs":["is the probability of the joint event (a","cooccurrence pair).","We estimate mutual information values using","the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE): P(x,y) _log~."]},{"title":"N f(x,y) ]","paragraphs":["I(x, y) = log~"]},{"title":"P~x)P--(y) ( -d f(x)f(y) \" (2)","paragraphs":["where f denotes the frequency of an eyent and N is the length of the corpus.

Also, high and reliable mutual information values are typically associated with relatively high frequencies of the involved cooccurrence pairs. We therefore search first for all the \"strong neighbors\" of w, which are defined as words whose cooccurrence with w has high mutual information and high frequency, and then search for all their \"strong neighbors\". The words found this way (\"the strong neighbors of the strong neighbors of w\") are considered as candidates for being similar words of w, and the similarity value with w is then computed only for these words. We thus get an approximation for the set of words that are most similar to w. For the example given in Table 3, the exhaustive method required 17 minutes of CPU time on a Sun 4 workstation, while the approximation required only 7 seconds. This was done using a data base of 1,377,653 cooccurrence pairs that were extracted from the corpus, along with their counts. 5 Evaluations 5.1 Word sense disambiguation in machine translation The purpose of the first evaluation was to test whether the similarity based estimation method can enhance the performance of a disambiguation technique. Typically in a disambiguation task, different cooccurrences correspond to alternative in-terpretations of the ambiguous construct. It is therefore necessary that the probability estimates for the alternative cooccurrences will reflect the relative order between their true probabilities. However, a consistent bias in the estimate is usually not harmful, as it still preserves the correct relative order between the alternatives.","To carry out the evaluation, we implemented a variant of the disambiguation method of (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense disambiguation in machine translation.
