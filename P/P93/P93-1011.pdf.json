The procedure takes into account lexical semantics and the result of various discourse interpretation procedures such as definite description interpretation, and does not require a complete disambiguation to take place."]},{"title":"THE PROBLEM","paragraphs":["Because new ways of obtaining semantically distinct interpretations for sentences are continuously discovered, com-ing to grips with ambiguity is becoming more and more of a necessity for developers of natural language processing systems, linguists and psychologists alike [9, 31, 7, 2]. In this paper, I am concerned with the scopal ambiguity of operators I [31, 33].","The attention of both psycholinguists and computational linguists interested in ambiguity has concentrated on the problem of combinatorial explosion. If the number of readings of an utterance were to actually grow with the factorial of the number of operators, even a simple sentence like (1), with 4 operators (the modal 'should', tense, an indefinite and a definite), would have 4I = 24 scopally different readings. Two distinct questions thus must be answered: how can listeners (and how should machines) deal with the combinatorial explosion of readings? Do we really use the brute-force strategy of considering all of the available readings, and then choose among them? And, if we do choose among several readings, how is that done? (1) We should hook up an engine to the boxcar. To my knowledge, three positions on the problem of combinatorial explosion have been taken in the literature. Some have argued that there is no problem: our brains contain","1I use here the term operator as it is used by Heim [13], i.e., to mean either quantifier or modal/tense operator. 78 more than enough machinery to process in parallel 4I interpretations. It's unclear, however, whether this strategy is feasible when larger numbers of readings are concerned. A classical demonstration of the number of readings one may have to consider is (2), which has 1 l I interpretations if the standard treatment of quantification and modality is assumed. (2)","You can fool most people on most of the issues most of the time, but you can't fool everybody on every single issue all of the time. [15] Another position is that sentences like (1) are not semantically ambiguous, but vague. Consider for example (3): (3) Every kid climbed a tree. Here, one of the readings (the one in which the indefinite takes narrow scope) is entailed by the other (in which the indefinite takes wide scope). The claim is that (3) is interpreted in the vaguest possible way, and the strongest reading, if at all, is derived by pragmatic 'strengthening' [25]. A difficulty with this approach is that a vaguest reading doesn't always exist. The two readings of (4), for example, are distinct. (4) Few people speak many languages. [27] Finally, it has been proposed that the reason why listeners do not seem to have problems in processing utterances like (1) is because they do not disambiguate. They build a nondisambiguated representation of the sentence and leave the interpretation open. This strategy might be advantageous for some kinds of applications 2 and it has been argued that a complete disambiguation never takes place [7]."]},{"title":"No","paragraphs":["matter what processing strategy is chosen, the question of how listeners choose one particular interpretation cannot be ignored. All experimental work done on the subject of scopal ambiguity [20, 35, 26] indicates that subjects do have preferred interpretations when confronted with tasks which require understanding. In addition, sentences like (1), (5) and (6) clearly have preferred interpretations. However, the only answers to to this question that I have seen are based on heuristics) 2E.g., machine translation [2]. 3See [17] for an example of state-of-the-art techniques (5) A girl took every chemistry course.

The goal of the TRAINS project is to develop a conversationally proficient planning assistant. More details about the project and the work presented here can be found in [29]. SCOPE DISAMBIGUATION FACTORS Most proposals on scope disambiguation were developed to account for the general preference of the leftmost quantified phrase from taking wide scope in simple active sentences like (7): (7) Every kid climbed a tree.

The preferred reading of (8), for example, is the one in which the NP \"each child\" takes wide scope. (8) I saw a picture of each child. [20] According to Ioup, the relative scope of quantifiers is determined by the interaction of two factors. First of all, quantifiers such as \"each\" or \"the\" have the inherent property of taking wide scope over indefinites, which, in turn are lexically marked to take scope over plural quantifiers like \"all.\" This hypothesis is motivated by contrasts such as those in (9), and accounts for cases such as (8). 4 (9) a. I saw a picture of each child.","b. I saw a picture of all the children. Secondly, Ioup proposed that a hierarchy exists among grammatical functions, such that listeners tend to attribute to NPs in subject position wide scope over NPs in indirect object position, which in turn tend to take wide scope over NPs in object position. The hierarchy between grammatical functions accounts for the preferred reading of (7).","Ioup also observed that NPs in topic position tend to take wide scope, This is especially obvious in languages that have a specific grammatical category for topic, like Japanese or Korean.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL"]},{"title":"Scope Disambiguation as Construction of an Event Structure","paragraphs":["It is commonly assumed in the psycholinguistic literature on sentence interpretation that hearers interpret sentences by constructing a model of the situation described by the sentence [10, 22]. I propose that the scope assigned to the operators contained in a sentence is determined by the characteristics of the model construction procedure. The model being constructed, which I call event structure, consists of a set of situation descriptions, one for each operator, together with dependency relations between them. The task of the model construction procedure is to identify these situations and to establish dependency relations. The scope assigned by a hearer to an operator depends on the position of the situation associated with that operator in the event structure.","For example, I propose that the scope assigned to quantitiers depends on how their resource situation [3, 8] is identiffed. It is well-known that a sentence like (13): (13) Everybody is asleep. is not interpreted as meaning that every single human being is asleep, but only that a certain contextually relevant subset is. The process of identifying the set of individuals over which an operator quantifies is usually called domain restriction. In the case of, say, (7) whether \"every kid\" or\"a tree\" takes wide scope depends on how the listener builds a model of the sentence. If she starts by first identifying a situation containing the group of kids that\"every\" is quantifying over, and then proceeds to 'build' for each of these kids a situation which contains a tree the kid is climbing, then \"every kid\" will take wide scope. In other words, I propose that a listener has a preferred reading for a sentence if she's able to identify the resource situation of one or more of the operators in that sentence ('to picture some objects in her mind'), and to hypothesize dependency relations between these situations. If this process cannot take place, the sentence is perceived as 'ambiguous' or 'hard to understand.'","The less context is available, the more the establishment of dependency relations between situations depends on the order in which the model is built, i.e., on the order in which the situations associated with the different operators and events are identified. This order depends in part on which NPs are perceived to be 'in topic,' and in part on general principles for building the conceptual representation of events (see below). In addition, some operators (e.g., definite descriptions) impose constraints on their resource situation. A Model Construction"]},{"title":"Procedure: The DRT","paragraphs":["Algorithm In order to make the intuition more concrete we need the details of the model construction procedure. Ideally, one would want to adopt an existing procedure and show that the desired results fall out automatically. Unfortunately, the model construction procedures presented in the psycholinguistic literature are not very detailed; often it's not even clear what these researchers intend as a model. There is, 80 however, a discourse interpretation procedure that is specified in detail and has some oftbe characteristics of the model construction procedure I have in mind; I'm thinking of the DRS construction algorithm [23, 24].","The DRS construction algorithm consists of a set of rules that map discourses belonging to the language into certain \"interpretive structures\". The output structures are called \"Discourse Representation Structures\" or \"DRSs.\" A DRS is a pair consisting of a set of discourse referents and a set of conditions (= predicates on the discourse referents). The construction algorithm works by first adding the syntactic structure of the sentence to the 'root' DRS representing the discourse up to that point, then applying the rules to the syntactic structure, thus adding discourse referents and conditions to the DRS. Consider how the algorithm is applied to obtain an interpretation for (7): (14) Every kid climbed the tree. The initial interpretation of (14) is the tree shown in (15).

The Scope Constraint, for example, is embedded in the very semantics of DRT; and one can 'build in' the construction rules principles such as the c-command principle. (Kamp and Reyle do just that in [24].) The limitations of this approach are shown by examples in which the choice of an interpretation does not depend on the structure, like (12). Also, the rule for definites as just formulated is too restrictive: in cases like (18), for example, predicts the correct reading for the definite NP''the meeting,\" but the wrong one for \"the principal,\" that, intuitively, takes narrow scope with respect to \"every school:\" (18) Every school sent the principal to the meeting. I propose that the role of lexical semantics, as well as the data accounted for in the literature by introducing principles such as the grammatical function hierarchy, the topic principle, and the quantifier hierarchy, can be accounted for by making the activation of the DRS construction rules depend on factors other than the syntactic structure of the sentence. The factors I propose to incorporate are (i) the semantics of lexical items, (ii) the results of the interpretation of operators in context, and (iii) the way the representation of events is built in memory.","In order to achieve this goal, I propose two main modifications to the standard DRS construction algorithm. First of all, I propose that the input to the algorithm is a logicalform--a structure isomorphic to the s-structure, that carties however information about the semantic interpretation of lexical items. In this way, the role of semantic factors in interpretation can be taken into account; in addition, a semantic value can be assigned to a representation containing unresolved conditions or partial hypotheses. Secondly, I propose to make the application of the DRS construction rules depend on the identification of certain contextually dependent elements of the interpretation. The ingredients of the account thus include: a proposal about the input to the model construction procedure; a notion of what an event structure is; and an account of discourse interpretation. I discuss these issues in turn in the next sections. THE LOGICAL FORM As said above, the first difference between the interpretation procedure proposed here and the DRS construction algorithm illustrated above is that the rules I propose rely on semantical and contextual factors. I propose to do this by adding to standard DRT a new class of conditions, that I call 'logical forms.' Logical forms include semantic information about the lexical items occurring in the sentence. The logical form representation is the interface between the parser and the model construction algorithm, and can be compositionally obtained by a GPSG parser [11, 18] that couples a context-free grammar with rules of semantic interpretation.

The syntax of LFs is as follows. Each internal node of (21) is labeled with a phrase category; the leaves are labeled with expressions of the form 'a, where a is an expression of SEL (and has therefore a 'standard' model the-oretic denotation). I use the phrase structure system largely adopted in the Government and Binding literature, according to which the sentence is the maximal projection of an Infl node and is therefore labeled IP [34]. I also assume the existence of a maximal projection of complementizer CP above IP. Because I don't discuss relatives here, I use the following simplified notation for NPs with determiners, such as \"every school\": [NP '~- Q (V x [Sl ~ SCHOOL(x)] Q(x))] LFs like (21) are usually treated in the natural language processing literature as uninterpreted data structures from which to 'extract' the readings [16, 17]. However, it has been recently proposed [31, 2, 33] that it is possible (and indeed desirable) to assign a denotation to expressions like (21). The reason is that in this way one can define a notion of sound inference --that is, one can specify what can and cannot properly be inferred from an expression like (21) prior to disambiguation; and therefore, a notion of 'monotone disambiguation.' I do not assume disambiguation to work monotonically, but I want to be able to treat expressions like (21) as full-fledged conditions so that a DRS containing a condition of this kind can be interpreted, and I need to be able to characterize a disambiguation step as compatible in the sense that it does not introduce any new readings. To do this I need LFs to have an interpretation.","Were it not for the problem that more than one interpretation can be associated to a single LF, one could easily define a recursive mapping EXT from logical forms to truth-theoretical denotations (functions from situations to lluth values) in temxs of the usual [[ [[ function, as follows: = Ilall EXT([ v, a]) = EXT(a) EXT([vp a]) = EXT(a) EXT([ N, a]) = EXT(a) EXT(tNP a 131) = EXT(a)(EXT(~)) EXT(tIP a ]~l)","= EXT(a)(EXT(~)) if TYPE(EXT(a)) = (t~,t~) and TYPE(EXT(fl)) = tl; EXT(/~)(EXT(a)) otherwise.

Different ways for assigning a denotation to expressions with more than one interpretation have been proposed [2, 31]; my proposal derives from [31]. I use a Cooper storage mechanism [5] to define EXT in such a way as to allow for an LF to have more than one 'indirect interpretation.' Briefly, Cooper's idea is to have a syntactic tree denote a set of sequences, each sequence representing a distinct 'order of application' in computing the interpretation of the sentence. For example, because in interpreting (22) one can either apply the translation of tense immediately or walt, EXT maps (22) in a set of two sequences, shown in (23). (22) [V\" 'P [NP '~.

The separation between the situations that are the topic of different sentences is achieved by translating sentences as situation descriptions. A situation description is a condition of the form:","[-\"\"--'3 s :l~ [ (25) i -- I 83 whose intuitive interpretation is that • provides a partial characterization of the situation s. The semantics of situation descriptions is defined as follows, using a semantics of DRSs in terms of situation extensions, as discussed in the previous section, and interpreting discourse markers as constituents of situations: The condition s:K is satisfied wrt the situation s' iffK is satisfied wrt the value assigned to s in s '.

The activation of the model construction rules for universal quantification and definite descriptions results in the partial model in (34), in which ~1 and s'2 have been identified: (34) $ $1 $1:"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":[": ~_emaNG(,v) ANCHOR(y, X) $2 s2: ~:z E S s2 _C THIS_SITUATION S3 IP NP VP s3: VP PP 'SENT \"the principal\" 'TO y S 2 E S 3 Th, model construction role applied to the universal \"every school\" introduces a complex condition K1 ---> I(2 as usual, but both the restriction and the nuclear scope include situation descriptions. The situation description in the restriction, s2, is a subsituation of the situation at which the restriction is evaluated (denoted by the indexical constant THIS_SITUATION). The situation description in the nuclear scope, s3, is an extension of s2. 85","Now that a situation description for the resource situation of the universal and a discourse marker for the school have been introduced (s2 and z, respectively), the roles for resolv-ing the parametric component Jc of the interpretation of\"the principal\" can apply. The result is that z is chosen as an-tecedent of ±, and s2 is chosen as the resource situation for \"the principal.\" The model construction role updates s3 accordingly; the resulting event structure is equivalent to the interpretation of (21) specified by (20). ACCOUNTING","FOR THE DISAMBIGUATION DATA I briefly retum here the disambiguation principles, to show how the proposal just presented accounts for them. First of all, I'll note that, under simple assumptions about the mapping between grammatical functions and theta-roles, there is a striking resemblance between the grammatical function hierarchy proposed by Ioup and the thematic hierarchy proposed by Jackendoff to account for facts about passives and reflexives. The facts accounted for by the grammatical function hierarchy principle can also be explained if we assurm that the description of an event is constructed by identifying the filler of each thematic role in the order specified by Jackendoff's thematic hierarchy.","Consider now the case of the other disambiguation factor proposed by Ioup, the lexically encoded preference for certain operators to take wide scope. Definite descriptions are the paradigmatic case of an operator that tends to take wide scope. This preference can be explained in terms of the model construction hypothesis as follows. The choice of a resource situation for definite descriptions is restricted by the constraint that this resource situation be either shared among the conversational participants, or related to shared knowledge by shared relations [12, 4]. In our dialogues, for example, definite descriptions are usually interpreted with respect to the 'situation' corresponding to the current visual scene, which is independent from other situations. It follows that a definite description will be assigned narrow scope relative to another operator only if (i) the resource situation of the definite is perceived to depend on this other resource situation, and (ii) this dependency relation is known to be shared.","As for the tendency for NPs in topic to take wide scope, an element of a sentence is said to be in topic if it is considered to be part of the background information on which the new information in the sentence depends. As the interpretation of the 'new' infonnation in the sentence depends on the background information, it is plausible to assume that, in constructing a model for the sentence, the listener begins by applying the model construction roles for the operators perceived to be in topic (or explicitly marked as being in topic, in the case of Japanese). The interpretation of the operators not in topic, when determined at all, will depend on the interpretation of the operators in topic, resulting in the dependency relations between the related situations that I have assumed to be the way scope is represented.","Finally, I'll note that, in the absence of contextual clues, whether a completely disambiguated event structure is actually constructed depends on how strong the model construction roles are supposed to be; it's perfectly possible that the activation of these rules is controlled by additional factors, such as the specific needs of a task to be performed."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","paragraphs":["I wish to thank my advisor Len Schubert and James Allen, Howard Kurtzman, Peter Lasersohn, and Uwe Reyle for several suggestions, technical help, and constructive criticism.
