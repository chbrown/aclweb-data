While it has drawbacks, including the inability to express some linguistic constructions, it has the virtue of being computationally efficient, O(n3)-time in the worst case.","Recently there has been a gain in interest in the so-called 'mildly' context-sensitive formalisms (Vijay-Shanker, 1987; Weir, 1988; Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1991; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993a) that generate only a small superset of context-free languages. One such formalism is lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Schabes, Abeill~, and Joshi, 1988; Abeillfi et al., 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992), which provides a number of attractive properties at the cost of decreased efficiency, O(n6)-time in the worst case (Vijay-Shanker, 1987; Schabes, 1991; Lang, 1990; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993b).","An LTAG lexicon consists of a set of trees each of which contains one or more lexical items. These elementary trees can be viewed as the elementary clauses (including their transformational variants) in which the lexical items participate. The trees are combined by substitution and adjunction.","LTAC supports context-sensitive features that can capture some language constructs not captured by CFG. However, the greatest virtue of LTAG is that it is lexicalized and supports extended domains of locality. The lexical nature of LTAC is of linguistic interest, since it is believed that the descriptions of many linguistic phenomena are dependent upon lexical data. The extended domains allow for the localization of most syntactic and semantic dependencies (e.g., filler-gap and predicate-argument relationships).","A fllrther interesting aspect of LTAG is its ability to lexicalize CFCs. One can convert a CFC into an LTAG that preserves the original trees (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).","Lexicalized context-free grammar (LCFG) is an attractive compromise between LTAG and CFG, that combines many of the virtues of LTAG with the efficiency of CFG. LCFC is a restricted form of LTAG that places further limits on the elementary trees that are possible and on the way adjunction can be performed. These restrictions limit LCFG to producing only context-free languages and allow LCFC to be parsed in O(n3) - time in the worst ease. However, LCFC retains most of the key features of LTAG enumerated above.","In particular, most of the current LTAG grammar for English (Abeilld et al., 1990) follows the restrictions of LCFG. This is of significant practical interest because it means that the processing of these analyses does not require more computational resources than CFGs.","In addition, any CFG can be transformed into an equivalent LCFC that generates the same trees (and therefore the same strings). This result breaks new ground, because heretofore every method of lexicalizing CFCs required context-sensitive operations (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).","The following sections briefly, define LCFG, discuss its relationship to the current LTAG grammar for English, prove that LC, FC can be used to lexicalize CFC, and present a simple cubic-time parser for LCFC.

It is of interest from a linguistic perspective, because most current linguistic theories give lexical accounts of a number of phenomena that used to be considered purely syntactic. It is of interest from a computational perspective, because lexicalized grammars can be parsed significantly more efficiently than non-lexicalized ones (Schabes and Joshi, 1990).","Formally, a grammar is said 'lexicalized' (Schabes, Abeill~., and Joshi, 1988) if it consists of:",",, a finite set of elementary structures of finite size, each of which c, ontains an overt (i.e., non-empty) lexical item.","• a finite set of operations for creating derived structures.","The overt lexical item in an elementary structure is referred to as its anchor. A lexicalized grammar can be organized as a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the anchor.","In general, CFGs are not lexicalized since rules such as ,5' --* NP VP that do not locally introduce lexical items are allowed. In contrast, the wellknown Creibach Normal Form (CNF) for CFCs is lexicalized, because every production rule is required to be of the form A --+ ac~ (where a is a terminal symbol, A a non-terminal symbol and a a possibly empty string of non-terminal symbols) and therefore locally introduces a lexical item a.","It can be shown that for any CFG (.7 (that does not derive the empty string), there is a CNF grammar (.7 ~ that derives the same language. However, it may be impossible for the set of trees produced by (7 ~ to be the same as the set of trees produced by G.","Therefore, CNF achieves a kind of lexicalization of CFGs. However, it is only a weak lexicalization, because the set of trees is not necessarily preserved. As discussed in the motivation section, strong lexicalization that preserves tree sets is possible using LTAG. However, this is achieved at the cost of significant additional parsing complexity.","Heretofore, several attempts have been made to lexicalize CFC with formalisms weaker than LTAG, but without success. In particular, it is not sufficient to merely extend substitution so that it applies to trees. Neither is it sutficient to rely solely on the kind restricted adjunction used by Theorem","If G = (~,NT, P,S) is a finitely ambiguous CFG which does not generate the empty .string (¢), then there is an LCFG (7 ~ = (~, NT, I, A, S) generating the same language and tree set as (7. Furthermore (7' can be chosen .so that it utilizes only lefl-recursive auxiliary trees.","As usual in the above, a CFG (.7 is a fourtuple, (E, NT, P, S), where N is a set of terminal symbols, NT is a set of non-terminal symbols, P is a set of production rules that rewrite non-terminal symbols to strings of terminal and non-terminal symbols, and S is a distinguished non-terminal symbol that is the start symbol of any derivation.","To prove the theorem we first prove a some-what weaker theorem and then extend the proof to the flfll theorem. In particular, we assume for the moment that the set of rules for (.7 does not contain any empty rules of the form A ~ e. Step 1 We begin the construction of (7 ~ by constructing a directed graph LCG that we call the left corner derivation graph. Paths in LCG correspond to leftmost paths from root to frontier in (partial) derivation trees rooted at non-terminal symbols in (1. L(TG contains a node for every symbol in E U NT and an arc for every rule in P as follows. For each terminal and non-terminal symbol X in G create a node in LCG labeled with X. For each rule X --+ Ya in G create a directed arc labeled with X ~ Ya from the node labeled with X to the node labeled Y.","As an example, consider the example CFG in Figure 7 and the corresponding L(TG shown in Figure 8.","The significance of L(;G is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between paths in LCG ending on a non-terminal and left corner derivations in G. A left corner derivation in a CFG is a partial derivation starting from any non-terminal where every expanded node (other than the root) is the leftmost child of its parent and the left corner is a non-terminal. A left corner derivation is uniquely identified by the list of rules applied. Since G does not have any empty rules, every rule in (7 is represented in L(;'G. Therefore, every path in LCG ending on a terminal corresponds to a left corner derivation in (7 and vice versa. 124 S---+A A ,5' --+ B A A--+B B B--+ A S B ----+ b Figure 7: An example grammar. S ---~ B A S -~.A A S ~- A B B--+ A S B--+b b Figure 8: The LC(; created by Step 1. Step 2 The set of initial trees I for G' is constructed with reference to L(TG. In particular, an initial tree is created corresponding to each non-cyclic path in L(/G that starts at a non-terminal symbol X and ends on a terminal symbol y. (A non-cyclic path is a path that does not touch any node twice.) For each non-cyclic path in LCG from X to y, construct an initial tree T as follows. Start with a root labeled X. Apply the rules in the path one after another, always expanding the left corner node of T. While doing this, leave all the non-left corner non-terminal symbols in T unexpanded, and label them as substitution nodes.","Given the previous example grammar, this step produces the initial trees shown in Figure 9.","Each initial tree created is lexicalized, because each one has a non-terminal symbol as the left corner element of its frontier. There are a finite number of initial trees, because the number of non-cyclic paths in LCG must be finite. Each initial tree is finite in size, because each non-cyclic path in LCG is finite in length.","Most importantly, The set of initial trees is the set of non-recursive left corner derivations in (,'.

Step 3 This step constructs a set of left-recursive auxiliary trees corresponding to the cyclic path segments in L(TG that were ignored in the previous step. In particular, an attxiliary tree is created corresponding to each minimM cyclic path in LCG that starts at a non-terminM symbol. For each minimal cycle in LCG from X to it-self, construct an auxiliary tree T by starting with a root labeled X and repeatedly expanding left, corner frontier nodes using the rules in the path as in Step 2. When all the rules in the path have been used, the left corner frontier node in T will be labeled X. Mark this as the foot node of T. While doing the above, leave all the other non-terminal symbols in T unexpanded, and label them all substitution nodes.","The LC(; in Figure 8 has two minimal cyclic paths (one from A to A via B and one from B to B via A). This leads to the the two auxiliary trees shown in Figure 10, one for A and one for B.","The attxiliary trees generated in this step are not, necessarily lexicalized. There are a finite number of auxiliary trees, since the number of minimal cyclic paths in G must be finite. Each auxiliary tree is finite in size, because each minimal-cycle in LCG is finite in length.","The set of trees that can he created by cornbiding the initial trees from Step 2 with the auxiliary trees from Step 3 by adjoining auxiliary trees along the left edge is the set of every left corner derivation in (,'.

Step 4 This step lexicalizes the set of auxiliary trees built in step 3, without altering the trees that can be derived. For each auxiliary tree T built in step 3, consider the frontier node A just to the right of the foot. If this node is a terminal do nothing. Otherwise, remove T from the set of auxiliary trees replace it with every tree that can be constructed by substituting one of the initial trees created in Step 2 for the node A in T.","In the case of our continuing example, Step 4 results in the set of auxiliary trees in Figure 11.","Note that since G is finitely ambiguous, there must be a frontier node to the right of the foot of an attxiliary tree T.

Derivations in H' result in elements of the tree set of H. By means of the table recording the relationship between (; and H, these trees can be converted to derivations in G.","[] Additional issues There are several places in the algorithm where greater freedom of choice is possible. For instance, when lexicalizing the auxiliary trees created in Step 3, you need not do anything if there is any frontier node that is a terminal and you can choose to expand any frontier node you want. For in-stance you might want to choose the node that corresponds to the smallest number of initial trees.","Alternatively, everywhere in the procedure, the word 'left' can be replaced by 'right' and vice versa. This results in the creation of a set of right anchored initial trees and right recursive auxiliary trees. This can be of interest when the right corner derivation graph has less cycles than the left corner one.","The number of trees in G' is related to the number of non-cyclic and minimal cycle paths in LCG.

In 128 particular, one could consider stochastic extensions, LP~ parsing, and non-deterministic LR parsing."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank John Coleman who, by question-ing whether the context-sensitivity of stochastic LTAG was actually being used for English, triggered this work.
