One expects such uses will refer more or less strictly to a closed, explicit, and precise chunk of world knowledge. Such an attitude Is expressed in the following statement: \"Given descriptions of the shape of two objects, given their location (for example, by means ox coordinates in Some system of reference), and, In some cases, the location of an observer, one can select an appropriate preposition.\" This paper shows the fallacy of this claim. It addresses the problem of interpreting and generating \"locative predications\" (expressions made up of two noun-phrases governed by a preposition used spatially). It identifies and describes a number of object characteristics beyond shape (section I) and contextual factors (section 2) which bear on these processes. Drawing on these descriptions, the third section proposes core meanings for two categories of prepositions, and describes some of the transfor~ttons these core meanings are subject to in context. The last section outlines the main directions of Inquiry suggested by the examples and observations in the paper. 1. ~BJECT CHARACTERISTIC~ Throughout the paper, I use the term \"object ~, meaning, strictly speaking, the object together with some lextcal label. In effect, the choice of preposition depends on the lexical category associated with the object by the noun-phrase used to refer to It. And such a category is not uniquely defined. There are different levels In the categorization hierarchy (e.g. \"end table\", \"table\", \"piece of furniture'), but also different perspectives on the object.

RELATIVE MOBILITY The mobility of the reference object relative to the located object influences the order of the nominals around the preposition: the more mobile object normally precedes the preposition.

Following"]},{"title":"Tally","paragraphs":["(1978a], I will call the located object the \"Figure\", and the reference object the \"Ground\", when discussing the order of the nominals. Human beings tend to play havoc with the relative mobility rule, either because they are the preferred topic (flee man i~ a Nu~ coat), or -- as center of the universe -- preferred reference object (tke EmpOe 3t~e building i~ in front of me). Typicality plays an ilportant role in deterllnlng an appropriate locative predication (and no doubt other types of expressions). The choice of expression tends to depend not on particular (non prototypicaI) attributes of the objects considered, but rather on typical attributes of the category to which they are assigned by the linguistic expression. If typical conditions do not obtain, they tend to be ignored, unless one has sole special reason to bring attention to the atypical conditions. If for Instance the cap of a bottle were glued to the wall, one would still say tk~ bo~tit wLtk a cap on it. Even If a tray has very high sides, one will say on the tr¢ 7. Consider also the table pictured above. Imagine the space under it progressively more solidly enclosed; there Is s point at which one might be struck by this and say in tat t<d~le. But this point is rather far along; even with a table with a solid sheZt at floor level, people consistently describe objects on that shelf as unde~tkt ta~e. 2. ~QHTEXTUAL FACTORS The choice of an appropriate locative predication 41st depends on various aspects of the context. Some o~ these contextual characteristics are discussed In this section as. if they were neatly separable; in fact, all are interdependent in complex ways, and these lnterrrelations must become clear before we can design models of comprehension and production. 2. I. CONTEXT DEPENDENT PARAMETERS. These Include the location of an observer, for the deictic uses of some preposltlons ~n fro~t oJ'lkt try), and an implicit (fuzzy) distance threshold for the prepositions indicating proximity (Denofsgy 1975]. ]n the gas-sfat~ ~s at fat freta~rJ, an implicit cross-path is assumed. To say that \"freeway\" occurs as a letonylic substitute for \"at the intersection of a cross-rood with the freeway\" is not very useful, since no general rule of metonymy will predict this one (as natural as such a substitution may sound to English speakers, it is not acceptable in French: see ~t poste ~es~tct ~t ~ la route). 2.2. F}GURE/GROUND AS 1GNM~T The assignment of the roles of Figure and Ground depends pri~rily on which of the two objects' location Is at issue. The object whose location is at issue precedes the preposition: compare the tenue nt~zr tam cku~k and fA, ¢kurcA n~r tat kouJt. BUt the assigment must also respect the relative mobility.rule. TAt kouJe n~r far ~urck is reversible because both house and church are equally immobile; but tam ~cycle near tam ¢ku~h Is not. When one wishes to locate a less mobile object with respect to a more mobile one, : there are a number of periphrastic devices -- one\" being the use of \"with ~ as in the earlier example (tat bottlt with ¢ ~p on ~t); \"with\", not being basically locative, Is not subject to this relative mobility rule. See also t/~ /~se is n~r wk~t tat ~¢~t Is (but *tat ko~e is ne¢r the ~¢')cie ~almy 1978aj); this turns b~jc/e Into an immovable entity, namely a piece. The mobility rule Is In fact a consequence of the principle that the object whose location is at Issue should precede the preposition. The Ground is typically bigger and less mobile than the Figure, since those objects whose location is most commonly at issue are those which move around, and a good reference object is one whose location can be Inferred from Its name, and thus had better be the sase over some time. What Is at issue in turn depends on the speaker's purpose in constructing the locative predication, and how It fits Into his/her overall discourse plan. 2. 3. VARYING V|EWPO[NT ON THE OBJECT Mainly this Involves the contrast between a close-up and a remote view of the objects. Most often, this is not a Batter of actual distance, but s way of viewing an object for a given purpose: one Jay choose to ignore one or more dimensions, or lnternal characteristics of the object. For example, a road uy be seen as a strip (a truck On tke ro¢d), or a line (a oUlateon Mr ro~L~don). Normally beMnd tar kouJt viii be based on the house's own axes. But when looking from some distance, one My use one's line of sight as axis. Another aspect of viewpoint, is the bounded/unbounded distinction. Compare w~ng f~rougk versus across the ~at~ [Talmy 1978b]: in the former the boundaries of the body of water are Ignored, but in the latter, the extension of the body of water from one end to another is involved. 2.4. RELEVANCE Give= the pictures below, one will say t/~ ~,~d un~r tat bomt, but rht bulb in Mt s~k~. The socket is still functioning as a socget when facing down, the bowl not as a bowl. If function is the relevant aspect, it Is of no Interest to distinguish between situations where bulb and socket are as above, and their upside down versions. With the bowl, this distinction matters. Similarly, the pear in 6 is m tke ~I. It is not normally useful to distinguish between situation A and A E For the two examples Just described, one could contrive Contexts in which the distinctions norsally ignored would be important. And certainly adequate lOdels of language should account for this possibility. A locative expression may describe the general intention of a per}on over some time, rather than his precise location at the tlme of speaking. I could say L~nn is.at.t~e store even if l knew .Lynn might still be on her way. But this may not be appropriate (e.g. if I know the addressee is at the store). Relevance is important for Grlcean inferences. For instance, from /on is near his desk, one can generally infer ion t~ not at his desk. If however I asked a friend on the phone \"are you near your desk? could you look up the address...\", an appropriate answer is \"yes\", even if my friend is at his/her desk. In ~hls context proximity is the relevant aspect, and \"near\" becomes appropriate. 2.5. SALIENCE The book below left is on the table, the lid (right) is not, because the intervening relation between the lid and the jar is salient. Such salience Is not primarily a umtter of the size of some intervening object. ~#.book ~5'l~lid One generally says that X is"]},{"title":"tn","paragraphs":["eke field and"]},{"title":"in","paragraphs":["the"]},{"title":"~mi,","paragraphs":["whenever field or bowl contain X.

INDETERMINACY Most spatial relations are true given a certain tolerance.

Thus, the angular precision with which ~r~tly to the ~gM is defined varies with silverware on the table, chess pieces on a board, or houses on a block. 2.8.

Even If one grants some usefulness to the semantic/pragmatic distinction, it does not neatly apply here.) A similar use of contrast can be seen with the ch.,~r is In the corner in the figure below. It is not appropriate unless the armchair be removed. ,@.-.cha i r The concept of a \"corner\" has built In that In the corner becomes less appropriate as one gets further from the vertex itself, 2. 9. (~THERS Many uses of the prepositions cannot be explained in terms of any of the above factors. One then needs a description of the context of use at a rather specific level. Consider for example the contexts in which one will say Suzy is at the playground versus in the playp'ound. In would be (i) preferred if the speaker can see Suzy, (il) required If the addressee expects Suzy to be Just outside the playground, (tit) required if the speaker her/himself Is in the playground (an analogous contrast exists between at the be~k and on the beach). These conditions \"suggest\" a close-up view, and that the speaker's knowledge is precise; by contrast, \"at\" suggests a remote view, and imprecise knowledge. But \"to suggest\" is not to imply: one cannot infer these conditions of use from the ideas of a remote versus a close-up view. 3. COR~ MEANIN~ With most of the examples given, the explanation suggested for the choice of a preposition assumes the existence of a \"core meaning\". This core meaning is basically a geometrical relationship between geometrical entities. Thus, in a given context, \"geometrical descriptions\" (say a point, line, surface, volume, lamina, etc.) are mapped onto the subject and object of the preposition. Strictly speaking, the core meanings are -- at best -- true only of these geometric descriptions. In fact, they may not even hold for any such geometric description -- see the"]},{"title":"pear in ¢ ~ml","paragraphs":["example above, assuming the natural core meaning for \"lne, i.e. \"inclusion\". Yet, the core meaning is then present as \"prototype\". Here are informal definitions of the core meanings for two categories of prepositions, designated as \"topological\" (at. on. in), and \"projective\" (to the right, be~nd, etc.).","Topological prepositions: in: partial inclusion of a geometrical construct in a volume, an area, or a line. on: contiguity, adjacency of a geometrical construct with a surface, or a line. ~: coincidence of a point with a point in space. In actual context, inclusion, contiguity, and coincidence need not be true. Thus the book on top of a pile of books on the table can be said on tie ta~e, and Mar~ ts eJ the gate when very close to It. But the relations represent the \"ideal\" around which particular instances gravl'tate. Thus at Implies the closest reasonable relationship between two objects, and coincidence where sensible (tie cent~oftke drclems attkeint~s~t~onoftke axe). Of course, the core meanings are not sufficient to determine the conditions of use of a given preposition: one must also know precisely which deviations from the ideal are permitted. One principal process Jedlattng between core meanings and actual conditions of use Is the mapping of objects onto points, surfaces, and volumes. I am not saying that the core meanings presented here are the only possible ones. Only when core meanings are Incorporated in a global explanatory system will It be possible to make rigorous arguments for alternate choices. Those proposed here represent a good starting point.","Projective prepositions: Each of these prepositions involves -- through fact, supposition, or metaphor -- a \"point of observation', k point of observation consists of two vectors, one Indicating the intrinsic vertical of the observer (it will not be the gravitational vertical If the observer Is lying down, or not In the gravitational field), and the other orthogonal to the first along the line of sight. These two vectors completely specify four coplanar ortho$onal half-line axes associated with the point of observation: the \"front\", \"right\", \"back\", and \"left\" axes, in clockwise order. In the core meaning definition of these prepositions, reference and located objects are points. Given a point of observation, one can specify axes aSSOCiated with the reference object -- the \"base axes\" (right, left, front, and back) by reference to which to the"]},{"title":"ri~w,kt,","paragraphs":["be~nd, etc., will be defined. These axes originate at the reference object. If the point of observation (PObs) coincides with the reference object (PRef) (figure A below), the base axes are Identical to those of the point of observation.

Analogous d~finitions for the other prepositions are easy to formulate. A few examples will help understand how these co're meanings are manifest in the actual uses of the prepositions.

It Is an hypothetical locatlon and direction for vlewlng: the location is coincident with the stone,, and the direction Is the direction of movement. One must of course assume -- as with the objects In tit= examples that follow -- that the stone Is aslmilated to a point. In to tie ~gkt of tle char, the base axes may be specified as those intrinsic to the chair -o I.e. by reference to a typical user. The point of observation is then coincident with the reference object o- namely the chair. Coincidence may be the case when the base axes are not Intrinsic to the reference object: for Instance on the ri[M of the sto0/ lay be defined with respect to somebody sitting on it, given a round stool with no intrinsic front axis. Reference object and point of observation are separated In the moon ~kind the clou~[. They can also be separated when the base axes are intrinsic to the reference object: wlth on t~ ri[kt side of tle closet, the point of observation Is defined by a typical user facing the closet. Again, one might define the core meanings differently. In .particular one could define the core meaning of \"to the right\" say, as implying location In the whole right-hand half-space instead of on the axis. The choice adopted here reflects the fact noted In earlier examples that the \"ideal\" realization of to the ngkt is with the located object on the right base axis. Processes other than the mapping of objects onto points may mediate between core meanings and actual conditions of use.

The line of sight Is a favored axis, as compared to right, left, and hack axes). 4. SOME CONCLUS|( .'S Here are the main problels and directions of inquiry suggested by the examples in this paper. One cannot fully explain the use of a locative predication in a given situation in terms of the core meanings together with some inferences from general principles involving object knowledge, salience, relevance, the precision desired, etc. There w111 always remain uses involving some degree of arbitrariness (most uses are \"motivated\", If not \"compositional\" [Flllmore Ig?9] -- i.e. the morphemes composing the appropriate expression are normally selected from \"reasonable\" candidates). Even where such principles are at play, they may operate not at the comprehension/production level, but rather at the phylogenetic level. To sort principled aspects of use from arbitrary ones, and to understand exactly where such principles operate, one must of course first establish their existence and nature. In terms of knowledge of the physical world, I believe one importan~ step. toward adequate representations is to put the experiencer back into the picture. That is, It is not enough -- or even always necessary -- to know where what objects are; one must also consider how much fits into one field of view, how things \"appear\" as opposed, to how they \"are\", how this changes with viewing distance, visibility, obstruction, etc. General principles of salience should ue studied: how some object parts or relations are selected as most important -- either in all imaginable contexts, or in some contexts. Salience underlies many Instances of metonymy (in"]},{"title":"at t~e front of tAe t~atre,","paragraphs":["\"theatre\" actually refers to the part occupied by the audience). Many'questions revolve around the issue of \"relevance\" -- of \"what matters, to whom, in what circumstances\" rather than the traditional concern with what is true. All existing artificial Intelligence programs have ignored this problem by using a limited vocabulary In a limited domain, so that the question of selecting relevant utterances never arises. Relevance is linked to the speaker's purpose, as uny of the contextual factors described in this paper -- indeterminacy, Gricean inferences, highlighting of background elements, determination of the Figure/Ground relationship, etc. The set of \"expressible\" 8oals is constrained by the \"potential\" of the language, i.e. by a semantic system with finitely many options. One can only want to say what can be said, and said in a reasonable amount of time. Clearly, \"planning\" for natural language processing is a very Important problem. Purpose however, will not explain everything one says. Simple associative mechanisms must sometimes be responsible for what one says. For instance, some background element may be highlighted -- provided Some linguistic means to do so exists -- only because some passive associative link has brought it to attention. Once general principles are better understood, It Is an open question whether they are used by speakers, or whether their explanatory power Is at the phyiogenettc level (and will thus be only Implicit in the structure of the knowledge representation). For instance, although there is a general princiole that the located object should be more mobile than the reference object, production may not proceed by inferences from this general principle together with scenarios Involving the two objects. The linguistic expression (or pattern for expressions) may be attached to some representation of a \"situation type\" involving the two objects (or two superordinate objects). And although \"at\" generally implies the closest reasonable relationship between two objects, such a definition may never be used by a speaker -- or used only In the creation or understanding of novel types of expressions, metaphors, witticisms, etc. What speakers do, and what conputer models of comprehension and production processes should be made to do, are two different things: the latter depends on the constructer's goals, which should be subjected to some scrutiny. A computational treatment of the use of prepositions will require much greater sophistication than naive representation theory would lead us to expect.","REFERENCES Boggess, Lois C. 1979.
