The Importance of Flexible Parsing","paragraphs":["When people use natural language in natural conversation, they often do not respect grammatical niceties. Instead of speaking sequences of grammatically well-formed and complete sentences, people Often miss out or repeal words or phrases, break off what they are saying and rephrase or replace it, speak in fragmentS, or use otherwise incorrect grammar. The Iollowing example colwersation involves a number of these grammatical deviations:","A: I wmlt., can you send a memo a message to to Smith","El: Is Ihal John or John Smith or Jim Smith","A: Jim Instead of being unable or refusing to parse such ungrammaticality, human listeners are generally unperturbed by it.

A decision on wllether to jump to a conclusion about wllat the user intended, to present him with a set of alternative interpretations, or to profess total confusion, can only be made with information about the Itistory of the conversation, beliefs about the user's goals, and measures of plausibility for any given action by the user. See [7~ for more discusSion o| Ihis broader view of graceful interaction in man-machine communication. Suffice it to say that we assume a flexible parser is iust one component of a larger system, and Ihal any incomprehensions or ambiguities that it finds are passed on to another component of the system with access to higtler-level information, putting it in a better Position to decide what to do next.","Finally, we assume that, as usual for such systems, input is typed, rather than spoken as is normal in human conversations. This simplifies low.level processing tremendously because key-strokes unlike speech wave-farms are unambiguous. On the other hand, problems like misSpelling arise, and a flexible parser cannot assume thut segmentation into words by spaces :Slid carriage returns will always be corr~:t. However, such input is stilt one side of a conversation, rather than a polished text in the manner of most written material. As such, it is likely to contain many of the same type of errors normally found in spoken conversations. 2.2. Misspelling","Misspelling is perhaps the most common form of grammatical deviation in written language.

Given an appropriate context, either sentential or discourse, it is relatively straightforward to parse unknown words into tile names of people, places, etc. Thus in \"send copies to Moledes.ki Chiselov\" it is reasonable to conclude Iron} the local context that \"Moledeski\" is a first name. \"Chiselov\" =s a suman~e, and together they identily a person (the intended roe:pit'.hi of the copm~5). Strnt~gles like this were used in the POLITICS [St. FRUMP 16J. and PARRY 11 I I systems.","Since novel words are by definition not in the known voc=bulary, how can a parsing system distiogt,sh them from misspellings?

Erroneous segmenting markers","Wntten text is segmented into words by spaces and new lines, and into higher level units by commas, periods and olher punctuation marks.

Spoken laf~gtJago s a so segmented, but by the Clt,te different markers of stress, interaction and noise words and phrases: we will not cons=der those further here.","IncorreCt segmentation ;ll the lexical level results in two or more words being run togetl)er, as in \"runtogether\". or a single word being split up into two or more segments, ns in \"tog ether\" or (inconveniently) \"to get her\". or combinations of these effects as in \"runlo geth el\". In all cases, it seems natural to deal with such errors by extending the spelling correction mechanism to be able to recognize target words as initial se(jments of unknown words, and vice-versa. AS far as we know. no current systems deal with incorrect segmentation into words.","The other type of segmenting error, incorrect punctuation, has a much broader impact on parsing methodology. Current parsers typ;catty work one sentence at a time. and assume that each sentence is terminated by an explicit end of sentence marker. A flexible parser must be able to deal with Ihe potenliai absence of such a marker, and recognize the sentence boundary regardless. It sllould also be able to make use of such punctuation if il is used correctly, and to ignore it if it is used incorrectly.","Instead of punCtuation, many interactive systems use carriage-return to il~'Jicale sentence termination. Missing sentence terminators in this case correspond to two sentences on one line. or to the typing of a sentence without the terminating return, while specious terminators correspond tO typing a sentence on more than one line. 2.5. Btokon-OflandRestaHodUtferallcas In spoken language, it is very common to break off and restart all or part of an utterance:","I want to -- Could you lell me the name?","Was tile man --er-- tile ofliciol here yesterday? Usually. such restarts are sKjnall~l in some way. by \"urn\" or \"er\". or more explicitly by \"lers back tip\" or some si,,Ior phrase.","In written language, such restarts do not normnlly occur because they are erase(l by lhe writer bolore the reatler sees Ihenl. interactive COmputer sysle--n~ typically prpvide facilitios for Iheir users tO delete the last cllorocler, word. or ctlrletlI hno as Ihotlgh ii had never been typed, for the very purpose of allowing such restalts.

A flexible parser should be able to make sense out. of \"obvious\" restarts that are not signalled, as in:","delete the show me aU the messages from Smith 2.6. Fragmentary and Otherwise Elliptical Input Naturally occurmg language often involves utterances that are not","complete sentences. Often the appropriateness of such fragmentary","utterances depends oil conversational or physical context as in:","A: Do you mean Jim Smith or Fred Smith?","B: Jim A: Send a message to Smith B: OK A: with copies to Jones","A flexible parser must be able to parse such fragments given the","appropriate context.","There is a question here of what such fragments should be parsed into. Parsing systems which have dealt with the problem have typically assumed tl it such inputs are ellipses of complete sentences, and that their parsing involves finding that complete sentence, and pursing it. Thus the sentence corresponding to \"Jim\" in the example above would be \"I moon Jim\". Essenhally this view has been taken by the LIFER [81 and GUS [2l systems. An alternative view =s that such fragments are not ellipses of more complete sentences, but are themselves complete 98 utterances given tile context in which they occur, and sholdd be parsc<l as such. We have taken this view in our approach to flexihto parsing, as we will explain more fully below. Carbonoll (personal communication) suggests a third view appropriale for some fragments: that of an extended case frame, hi tile second examt.lle above, for instance. A's 'with copies fo Jones\" forms a natural pint ul the c=ts~.'

Other cam;non forms of ellipses are associated with conjunction as in: John got up and [John] brushed his teeth. Mary saw Bill and BIll {sawl Mary. Fred recognized [Ihe buildingl and [Fred[ walked towards the building. Since conjunctions can support such a wide range of ellipsis, it is generally impractical to recognize such utterances by appropriate grammar exlensions. Efforts to deal with conhlnctJon have Iherefore depended on general mecllanisms which supplement the basic parsing strategy, as in fhe LUNAR system [fSl, or wilich modify the grammar temporarily, as ill the work el Kwasny and Sondheimer I IOI. We have not attempted 1o deal wilh tills type of ellipsis in our parsing system, and will not discuss further the type at flexibility it requires. 2.7. InierjectedPhrases, Omission, and Substitution","Sometimes people inlorject noise or other qualifying phrases into what is otherwise a normal grmnmatical flow as in:","I want the message dated I think June 17 Such interjections can be inserted at ahnost any point in an utterance, and so must be dealt with as they arise by flexible techniques.","It is retahvely straightforward for a system of limited comprehension to screen out and igfloro standard noise phrases such as \"1 think\" or \"as lar as I can tell\". More troublesome are interjections that cannel be recogni,~ed by the system, as might for instance be the case in Display [ju.'~I to relre:;h my memory I the message dated June 17. I want to see tile message {as I forgot what it saidJ dated June 17. where the unrecognized intefiections are bracketed. A flexible parser should be able to ignore such interjections. There is always tile chance that the unrecognizc~t part was an important part of what tile user was Iryillg In say, bl.fl clearly, the problems that arise from tills c;.tnllot be handlml by a parser. Omissions of words (or phrases) from the input are closely related to cryptic input aS discussed above, and one way of dealing with cryptic IflpLll in to treat il as a set of omi.~,~ions. However, Jn Cryptic input only iness~.*fdi~d ifdormaliOll is missed oul. while it is cooceivable thai one could also onlit essential ifllormation as ill:","Display Ihe men,age June t 7 Herr~ it is unclear whether tile Si)e[lker illeans a ines.,Ja(le dated ell ,hlne t f or b*:lore Juno 17 or ;liter June 17 (we assume that the system addfessc~t Calf di.~;t)lay lhilt~ts illlfn(.~lJately, or i1ol at all).

Often such substitutions are spelling errors and should be caught by Ihe spelling correction mechanism, but sometinles they are inadvertent substitutions or uses of equivalent vocabulary not known tO the system. This type of substitution is just like an omission except that there is an unrecognized word or phrase in the place where tile omitted input should have been. For instance, in \"the message over June 17\", \"over\" takes the place of \"dated\" or \"sent after\" or whatever elst: is appropriate at that point. If the substifution is of vocabulary which is appropriate but unknown to the syslem, parsing o| substihlted words can provide tl~e basis of vocabulary extension. 2.8. Agreement Failure","It is not uncommon for people to fail to make the appropriate agreement between the various parts of a noun or verb phrase as in :","I wants to send a messages to Jim Smith. ]'he appropriate action is to ignore the lack of agreement, and Weischedel and Black [13J describe a melhod for relaxing the predicates in an ATN which typically check for soch agreements. However, it is generally not possible to conclude locally which value of the marker (number or person) for whicll the clash occurs is actually intended. We considered examples in which the disagreement involves more than inflections (as in \"tile message over Jr,he 17\") in the section on substitutions. 2.9. Idioms","Idioms are phrases whose interpretation is not what would be obtained by parsing and interpreting them constructively in the normal way, They may also not adllere to the standard syntactic rules. Idioms must thus be parsed as a whole in a pattern matching kind of mode. Parsers based purely oil patlern matching, like thai el PARRY I I t J, titus are able to parse idioms naturally, while others must eifher add a preprocessing phrase of pattern matchimj as in tile LUNAR system [15~. or mix specific patterns in will1 more general rules, as in Ihe work of Kwnsny and Sondheimer [10]. Semantic grammars [3, 81 provide a relatively natural way of mixing idiomatic and more general patterns. 2.10.

An Approach to Flexible Parsing","paragraphs":["Most current parsing systems are unable to code with most of the kinds of grammatical deviation outlined above. This is because typical parsing systems attempt to apply their grammar to Illeir input in a rigid way, and since deviant input, by defimtion, does not conform to the grammar, they are unable to produce any kind of parse for it at all. Attempts to parse more flexibly have typically involved parsing strategies to be used after a tog-down parse using an ATN It4J or similar tran~lion net has failed. Such efforts include the ellipsis and garapllrase mechanisms of LIFER [81, tile predicate relaxation techniques of Weischedel and Black [13J, and several of the devices for extending ATN's proposed by Kwasny and Sondheimer [ 101. thus alter a word that the system has already processed. A flexible parser must be able to take advantage of such user provided corrections to unknown words, and to prefer them over its own corrections. It must also be DreDared to change its parse if the user changes a valid word to another different but equally valid word. 99","We have constructed a parser, FlexP. which can apply its grammar tO its input flexibly, and thus deal wdh the grammatical deviations discussed in the previotls sechon We shotdd empllas~;~e, however, that FlexP is designed to be used in thu lltturluce to a restncted-domain system AG such. it is intended to work Irom a domuilt-sDecific semantic grammar. rather titan one st.tuble Ior broader classes of input. FlexP thus does not embody a solutloll for Ilexible parsing of natural language in general. In describing FlexP. we will note those of its techoiques that seem unlikely to scale up to use with more complex grammars with wider coverage.","We have adopted in FlexP an approach to flexible parsing based not on ATN's. but closer to the pattern-matching purser OI tile PARRY system [11J. possibly tim most robust parser yet constructed. Our approacl~ is based on several design decisions: • bottom up rather than top-down por~ing: This aids io the • Parsing el fragmentary utterances, un(I in the r~rxll.li¢,l nf interjechonR alld restarts. • pattern matching: 1 Ilis is essential Inr idioms, and also aids in tile ilelection n! omissions and sobsMutions in non-i(limontic phrases. • parse suspension and conli,luoiion: Thu ;tt)ilily to F.uspelld it I);Irse and letter re.~Lin|e il.'; I)rocnRsilU,| i~ illtllortant for intorlections, restarts, and non-explicit terntinolions. In the remain(ler of this section we examine and juslify these design decisions in more detail. 3.1. Bottom-Up Parsing","Our choice of a bottom-up strategy is based o, our need to rocu~jnize isolated sentence Iragments. If an utterance which would normally be considered only a fragment of a complete sentence is to be recognized top-down, there are lwo approaches to take. First. the grammar can be altered so that Ihe fragment is recognized as a complete ulteraoce in its own right. This is undesirable bee;ruse it can cause enormous exp;msion of the grmnmar, and because it becomes difficult to decide whether s fragmeot appears in isolali~ or as port OIa larger utterance, especiully if the possibility of missing end of sentence markers also exists. The second option is for the purser to infer from the convers;ttidnal context what grammatical sub-category (or sequence of sub-cate(jories) the fragment might fit Dnto. and thee to do a top-down parse tram that sub-category. This essentially is tile tzlctic used in the GUS [21 and LIFER lot systems. This strutegy =s clearly better than the first one. but has two Problems; first of predicting all no.ss~ble sub-categories which might come next. and secondly, of inefficiency if a large number are predicted. Kwosr.y and Sondheimer I10] use :. combination of the two strategies by temporarily modifying an ATN grammar to accept fragment categories as complete ulterances at the braes they are contextually predicted.","Pattern-uP Doming avoids the problem of predicting what sub-categories may occur. If a fragment filling a given sub-category does occur, it is ~3rsed as such whatever the context. However. if n given input can be p.'~rsed as more thon one sub-category, the bottom-up approach would llave to produce them all. even if only one would be predicted top-down. In a syslem of limited comprehension, fragmentary recognition is sometunes necessary because not all of an input con be recognized, rather tilan because el intentional ellipsis. Here. it is probably in)possible to make pte(tictloos altCI bottom-up pursing is tile ()lily toothed that is likely to work. As described below, boltom-up stnltegms, coupled with suspended purses, are also helphrl in recognizing mteqections and restarts. 3.2.

In the case of substitutions, such o technique cnn actually help locus the st~011ing correction, proper name reco(jnition, or vocabulary learning techniques, whichever is appropriate, by tsolahng the substituted input and the pattern constituent which it should have matched. In effect. this allows the normally bottom-up parsing strategy to go top-down to resolve such substitutions.","In normal left to right processing, it is not necessary to activate all the patterns io(lexed by every new word as it is COnSidered.

Le. the failure o! tile nex! input tO extend a parse. • The input could be an implicit terminal=on, i.e. the start of a new top-level utterance, and the previous utterance should be assumed complete. • t he: Inp¢ll ¢util~.i b~J a reslart, m whlcll case li.e active Parse should be abandoned and a new parse starte(I Item that point. • The input could be the start of an interjection, io which case lhe actwe parse should be temporarily suspended, and a new mtrse started for the intorlection.","It is not possible, in general, tO dL~tmguish between these cases at the time tim mismatch occurs. II the active parse is not at a possible termination Point. then input mismatch cannot indicate implicit 100 termioation, but may indicate either restart or interjection. It is necessary to suspend the active parse and wuit to see if it is continued at the next input mismotclt. On the other hand. if the active parse is at a possible termination point, input mismutch does not rule out interjection or even restart. In this situation, our algorithm tentatively ussumes that there has been an implicit termination, but suspends the active parse anyway for subsequent potential continuation.","Note also that tl~e possibility el implicit termination provides justification for the strategy of interpreting each input immediately it is received. If the input signals an implicit termination, then the user =nay well expect the system to respond immediately to the input thus terminated."]},{"title":"4. Details of FlexP","paragraphs":["This section describes how FlexP achieves the Sex=bit=ties discussed earlier, The implementation described is being used as the parser for an intelli(jent interface Io ;i multi-mediu message system [ 1 ], The intelligence in this interface is cnncentrated in u tl.ser A(lent whictl =ned=sites between the user and the underlying tool System. The Agent ensures that the interaction goes smootlfly by, amoog other things, checking Ihat tile user specifies the operations he wants performed and their parameters correctly and uuumbiguously, conducting a dialogue wilh the user if prohlems arise. Th(: role el FlexP\" us tile Agent's parser is to transform the user's input into the internal ropresenlutions employed by tile Agent. Us.idly this inl)ut is a re(Itlest for aclio, hy the to(ll or a description of obiects known to the tool. Our exzmq=les are drawn from that context. 4.1. Prolimi.aryExample Suppose tile user types display new messages Interpretation begins as soon as any input is available, The first word is used us an index into the store of rewrite rides. Each rule gives a pattern and u structure to be pr=xlu(:od when lira pattern is matcherf. The components el the structure ure built from the structures or words which match the elements of the pattern. The word \"display\" indexes the rule:","(pat.=.or.: (I)isplay Message Descript. i.on)","result,: J SLrucLureiype: OperaL ionReques IL","OperaLion: Display","Message: (Fit let Messagel)escr'ipLion)] Using this rule Ihe parser constructs the partial parse tree (Display MessageOescr ipt io.)"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["display We call the partially-instantiated pattern which labels the zipper node a hWJothesis.

By doing so it makes tile current hypothesis and its parent pattern potemia/ly complete. When the parser finds a potentially complete phrase whose result is of interest to the Agent (and the parent phrase in this example is in that category), the result is constructed and sent. However. since the p;irs~,r has not seen a lomlination signal, this purse is kepl u(.,hvu.

In this case \"ubout ADA'\" would be recognized as a match for MsgCase (a prepositional phrase that can be part of a message description), the purse would be extended, and a revision of the previous slructul'e sent to the Agent. 4.2. Unrecognized Words","When an input word cannot be found in the dictionary, spelling correction is attempted in a background process which runs at lower priority than the parser, 1\"he input word and a list at possibilities derived front the current hypothesis are passed as arguments.

The one for MsgHead inclu(les tl~e word \"nt~.~os,ages ''. and the spelling correcter passes this back to the purser as the most likely interpretation.","In some cases the spelling correcter produces several likely alternatives.

Ambiguous Input","In the first example there was only one I~ypothesis about the structure Of the input. More generally, there may be several hypotheses which I)rovide competing interprelutions uboul what has already been seen and whal will appear =text.
