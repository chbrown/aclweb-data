The ATN is proposed as a tool for assistin~ the linguist to develop systsmatic descriptions of ~e data. It is assumed that the typical user will interface with the system at a point where an AEN and lexicon have bem~ developed. The ATN is developed from the theoretical model chosen by the linguist.","Once the ~ is imp lememtad as a cooputational procedure, the user enters test data, displays structures,","the lexicon, and edits the grammr to produce a refined A~] grarmar description. The displayed structures provide a labeled structural inremyretation of the input string based on the lin=~uistic model used. Tracing'of the parse may be used to follow the process of building the structural interpretation. Computational implemm~tation requires giving attention to the details of the interrelationships of gr~.matical rules and the interaction between the grammar rule system and the lexical representation. Testing the grammr against data forces a level of systemization that is significantly more rigorous than discussion oriented evaluation of gra~er sys ~m,. The model provides a meens of organizing strutrural descriptions at any level, from surface syntax to deep propositional inrerpreta=icms.","2. A nemmrk m~el may be used Co re~resent different theoretical approaches Co grammr definition. The graphical representation of a gramrar permitted by the neuaork model is a relati~ly clear and precise way to express notions about struct~/re. 3. Computational simulation of the gramsr enables systematic tracing of subc~xx~nts and testing against text data. 4. Grimes (2), in a series of linguistics workshops, d~ strafed the utility of the network model ~ in envi- ~u~nts wh~e computational testir~ of grammrs was r~t possible. Grimes, along with other c~ntributors to the referenced work, illustrated the flexibility of the ATN in talc analysis of gr~ratical structures. A~ implerentations have nmsCly focused on effective natural language understanding systems, assuming a computationally sophisticated research envir~t. Inplementatiorm are ofte~ in an envirormm~t which requires some in-depth ~mderstanding and support of LISP systems. Recently much of the infornmtion on the ATN formalism, applications and techniques for impler~ntation was summarized by Bates (3).

Desi=~ Consideratiors","The gm~ral dasi~ goal for the grammr rasing sys~ described here is to provide a tool for developing experimentally drive~, systematic representation models of language data.

Ideally, one would Like Co provide a tool which would attract applied linguists to use such a syst~n as a simulation environmen= for model developmen=. design goals for the systems described are:","i. Ease of use for both novice and expert modes of .operation, 2. Perspi cuity of gr~m~r representation, 3. Support for a variety of linguistic theories, 4. Trarmportability to a variety of systems.","The p~totype grammr design sys~ consists of a gram~r gemerator, a~ editor, and a monitor. The f~mction of U%e gr;~.~ editor is to provide a means of defining and mm%iv~lating gr~mar descriptions w~thouc requiring the user to work in a specific programing langu~e env~uL~,=L~. ~e editor is also used to edic lexicons.

The monitor can also be used to provide facilities for studying gram~r efficiemcy.
