SELECTION FOR AN ATN STNTACT~C PARSER Giacomo Ferrari and Oliviero Stock Istituto dl tingulstica Computazionale - C~TR, Plsa","Performance evaluation in the field of natural language processing is generally recognised as being extremely complex. There are, so far, no pre-established criteria to deal x~th this problem.","I. It is impossible to measure the merits of a grammar, seen as the component of an analyser, in absolute terms. An \"ad hoc\" grammar, constructed for a limited set of sentences is, without doubt, more efficient in dealing with those particular sentences than a zrammer constructed for a larger set. Therefore, the first rudimentary criterion, when evaluating the relation~hlp between a grammar and a set of sentences, should be to establish whether this grammar is capable of analysing these sentences. This is the determination of linguistic coverage, and necessitates the definition of the linguistic phenomena, independently of the linguistic theory which has been adopted to recognise these phenomena.","2. In addition to its ability to recognise and coherently describe linguistic phenomena, a grammar should be Judged by its capacity to resolve ambiguity, to bypass irrelevant errors in the text being analysed, and so on. This aspect of a grammar could be regarded as its \"robustness\" [P.Nayes, R.Reddy 1979].","3. Examining other aspects of the problem, in the analysis chat we propose we will assume a grammar which is capable of dealing with the texts which we will submit to it. Let an ATN grammar tl, vlth n nodes, be of this type. N will be maintained constant for the following discussion.","BY text we intend a series of sentences, or of utterances by one of the speakers in a dialogue. When analysing such a text, once a constant N has been assumed, it is likely that, in addition to the content (the arglm~ent of the discourse) indications will appear on the grammatical choices made by the author of the text (or the speaker) when expressing himself on that argument (how the argument is expressed).","When these indications have been adequately quantified, they can be used to correctly select the perceptive strategies (as defined in [Kaplan 72]) to be adopted in order to achieve greater efficiency in the analysis of the following part of the text.","4. For our experiments we have used ATNSYS [Stock 76], and an Italian grammar with n - 50 (127 arcs) [Cappelli st at.77]. In this system, search is depth-first and the parser Interacts with a heuristic mechanism which orders the arcs according to a probability evaluation. This probability evaluation is dependent on the path which led to the current node and is also a function of the statistical data accumulated during previous analyses of a \"coherent\" text. The mechanism can be divided into two stages. The first stage consists of the acquisition of statistical data; i.e, the frequency, for each arc exiting from a node, of the passages across that arc, in relation to the arc of arrival: for each arriving arc there are as many counters as there are exiting arcs."]},{"title":"f {e)-*x. f (b}:y ~f{,):w. f(b),*","paragraphs":["Fig. 1 In this way, in Fig. I arc 1 has been crossed x times coming from a and y times coming from b. In the second stage, during parsing, in state S, if coming from a and w > x, arc 2 is cried first."]},{"title":"113","paragraphs":["4.1 Thus, a first evaluation of the linguistic choices made is provided by the set of probability values assocla~ed to each arc. These figures can to some extent describe the \"style\" of any \"coherent\" text analysed. (For this one should also take into account the different lin~uistlc significance of each arc. In fact a CAT or PUSH arc directly corresponds to a certain linguistic component, while a JUMP or VIRT arc occurs in relation to the technique by which the network has been built, the linguistic theory adopted, and other variables.) 4.2 The second part of the mechanism, ~he dynamic reordering of the arcs, coincides with a reordering of the co~prehension strategies. In this way, a matrix can be associated to each node, giving the order of the strategies for each arc in arrival.","For each text T, there is a set of strategies ~ ordered as describod above.

The results of our experiments so far confirm this. This ir~roved efficiency can be measured in three ways: a) locally, in terms of the computational load, due to non-determinism, ~ich is","saved in each node. In fact, by some experiments, it is possible to","quantify the computational load of each type of arc. The computational load","of a node is then a linear combination of these values and one can comgare it","with the actual load determined by the sequence of arcs attempted in that","point after the reordering. b) in terms of an overall reduction in computing time; C) in terms of penetrance, i.e. the ratio between the number of choices which","actually lead to a solution and the total number of choices wade. 5.2 If T is a text containing r sentences, the average penetrance will be:"]},{"title":"o .=..',","paragraphs":["where ~ stands for each of the sentences in T.

In addition to the definition of a heuristic mechanism which is capable of in~rovinE the efficiency of natural language processing, and which can be evaluated as described above, our research aims at providing a means to chsracterise a text by evaluating the ~ramr~atical choices made by the author while expressing his argument.","We are also attemptin~ to tako into account the expectations of the listener.
