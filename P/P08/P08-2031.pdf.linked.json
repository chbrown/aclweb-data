Our method requires automatically transcribed (with ASR) dialog corpora, plus a model of transcription errors, but does not otherwise need any manual transcription effort. We tested our method on a voice-controlled telephone directory application, and show that our learned models better replicate the true distribution of user actions than those trained by simpler methods and are very similar to user models estimated from manually transcribed dialogs."]},{"title":"1 Introduction and Background","paragraphs":["When designing a dialog manager for a spoken dialog system, we would ideally like to try different dialog management strategies on the actual user population that will be using the system, and select the one that works best. However, users are typically unwilling to endure this kind of experimentation. The next-best approach is to build a model of user behavior. That way we can experiment with the model as much as we like without troubling actual users.","Of course, for these experiments to be useful, a high-quality user model is needed. The usual method of building a user model is to estimate it from transcribed corpora of human-computer dialogs. However, manually transcribing dialogs is expensive, and consequently these corpora are usually small and sparse. In this work, we propose a method of building user models that does not operate on manually transcribed dialogs, but instead uses dialogs that have been transcribed by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine. Since this process is error-prone, we cannot assume that the transcripts will accurately reect the users’ true actions and internal states. To handle this uncertainty, we employ an EM algorithm that treats this information as unobserved data. Although this approach does not directly employ manually transcribed dialogs, it does require a confusion model for the ASR engine, which is estimated from manually transcribed dialogs. The key benet is that the number of manually transcribed dialogs required to estimate an ASR confusion model is much smaller, and is xed with respect to the complexity of the user model.","Many works have estimated user models from transcribed data (Georgila et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2000; Pietquin, 2004; Schatzmann et al., 2007). Our work is novel in that we do not assume we have access to the correct transcriptions at all, but rather have a model of how errors are made. EM has previously been applied to estimation of user models: (Schatzmann et al., 2007) cast the user’s internal state as a complex hidden variable and estimate its transitions using the true user actions with EM. Our work employs EM to infer the model of user actions, not the model of user goal evolution."]},{"title":"2 Method","paragraphs":["Before we can estimate a user model, we must dene a larger model of human-computer dialogs, of which the user model is just one component. In this section we give a general description of our dialog model; in Section 3 we instantiate the model for a voice-controlled telephone directory.","We adopt a probabilistic dialog model (similar 121 to (Williams and Young, 2007)), depicted schematically as a graphical model in Figure 1. Follow-ing the convention for graphical models, we use directed edges to denote conditional dependencies among the variables. In our dialog model, a dialog transcript x consists of an alternating sequence of system actions and observed user actions: x = (S0, Ã0, S1, Ã1, . . .). Here St denotes the system action, and Ãt the output of the ASR engine when applied to the true user action At.","A dialog transcript x is generated by our model as follows: At each time t, the system action is St and the unobserved user state is Ut. The user state indicates the user’s hidden goal and relevant dialog history which, due to ASR confusions, is known with certainty only to the user. Conditioned on (St, Ut), the user draws an unobserved action At from a distribution Pr(At | St, Ut; θ) parameterized by an unknown parameter θ. For each user action At, the ASR engine produces a hypothesis Ãt of what the user said, drawn from a distribution Pr( Ãt | At), which is the ASR confusion model. The user state Ut is updated to Ut+1 according to a deterministic distribution Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, Ãt). The system outputs the next system action St+1 according to its dialog management policy. Concretely, the values of St, Ut, At and Ãt are all assumed to belong to nite sets, and so all the conditional distributions in our model are multinomials. Hence θ is a vector that parameterizes the user model according to Pr(At = a | St = s, Ut = u; θ) = θasu.","The problem we are interested in is estimating θ given the set of dialog transcripts X , Pr( Ãt | At) and Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, Ãt). Here, we assume that Pr( Ãt | At) is relatively straightforward to estimate: for example, ASR models that rely a simple confusion rate and uniform substitutions (which can be estimated from small number of transcriptions) have been used to train dialog systems which out-perform traditional systems (Thomson et al., 2007). Further, Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, Ãt) is often deterministic and tracks dialog history relevant to action selection for example, whether the system correctly or incorrectly conrms a slot value. Here we assume that it can be easily hand-crafted. Formally, given a set of dialog transcripts X , our","goal is nd a set of parameters θ∗","that maximizes the Ãt"]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["At"]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["Ut"]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["Ut+1 St St+1                                              Figure 1: A probabilistic graphical model of a human-computer dialog.

This system is currently in use in a large company with many thousands of employees. Users call the directory system and provide the name of a callee they wish to be connected to. The system then requests additional 122 information from the user, such as the callee’s location and type of phone (ofce, cell). Here is a small fragment of a typical dialog with the system: S0 = First and last name? A0 = John Doe [ Ã0 = Jane Roe ] S1 = Jane Roe. Office or cell? A1 = No, no, John Doe [ Ã1 = No ] S2 = First and last name?",". . .","Because the telephone directory has many names, the number of possible values for At, Ãt, and St is potentially very large. To control the size of the model, we rst assumed that the user’s intended callee does not change during the call, which allows us to group many user actions together into generic placeholders e.g. At = FirstNameLastName. After doing this, there were a total of 13 possible values for At and Ãt, and 14 values for St.","The user state consists of three bits: one bit indicating whether the system has correctly recognized the callee’s name, one bit indicating whether the system has correctly recognized the callee’s phone type (ofce or cell), and one bit indicating whether the user has said the callee’s geographic location (needed for disambiguation when several different people share the same name). The deterministic distribution Pr(Ut+1 | St+1, Ut, At, Ãt) simply updates the user state after each dialog turn in the obvious way. For example, the name is correct bit of Ut+1 is set to 0 when St+1 is a conrmation of a name which doesn’t match At.","Recall that the user model is a multinomial distribution Pr(At | St, Ut; θ) parameterized by a vector θ. Based on the number user actions, system actions, and user states, θ is a vector of (13 − 1) × 14 × 8 = 1344 unknown parameters for our target application."]},{"title":"4 Experiments","paragraphs":["We conducted two sets of experiments on the telephone directory application, one using simulated data, and the other using dialogs collected from actual users. Both sets of experiments assumed that all the distributions in Figure 1, except the user model, are known. The ASR confusion model was estimated by transcribing 50 randomly chosen dialogs from the training set in Section 4.2 and calculating the frequency with which the ASR engine recognized Ãt such that Ãt ̸= At. The probabilities Pr( Ãt | At) were then constructed by assuming that, when the ASR engine makes an error recognizing a user action, it substitutes another randomly chosen action. 4.1 Simulated Data Recall that, in our parameterization, the user model is Pr(At = a | St = s, Ut = u; θ) = θasu. So in this set of experiments, we chose a reasonable, hand-crafted value for θ, and then generated synthetic dialogs by following the probabilistic process depicted in Figure 1. In this way, we were able to create synthetic training sets of varying sizes, as well as a test set of 1000 dialogs. Each generated dialog d in each training/test set consisted of a sequence of values for all the observed and unobserved variables: d = (S0, U0, A0, Ã0, . . .).","For a training/test set D, let KD","asu be the number of times t, in all the dialogs in D, that At = a, St = s, and Ut = u. Similarly, let K̃D","as be the number of times t that Ãt = a and St = s.","For each training set D, we estimated θ using the following three methods:","1. Manual: Let θ be the maximum likelihood","estimate using manually transcribed data, i.e.,","θasu = KD","asu P","a KD","asu .","2. Automatic: Let θ be the maximum likelihood estimate using automatically transcribed data, i.e., θasu = eKD as","P a eKD","as . This approach ignores","transcription errors and assumes that user be-","havior depends only on the observed data.","3. EM: Let θ be the estimate produced by the EM algorithm described in Section 2, which uses the automatically transcribed data and the ASR confusion model.","Now let D be the test set. We evaluated each user model by calculating the normalized log-likelihood of the model with respect to the true user actions in D: l(θ) =","∑ a,s,u KD","asu log θasu |D | l(θ) is essentially a measure of how well the user model parameterized by θ replicates the distribution 123 of user actions in the test set. The normalization is to allow for easier comparison across data sets of differing sizes.","We repeated this entire process (generating training and test sets, estimating and evaluating user models) 50 times. The results presented in Figure 2 are the average of those 50 runs. They are also compared to the normalized log-likelihood of the Truth, which is the actual parameter θ used to generated the data.","The EM method has to estimate a larger number of parameters than the Automatic method (1344 vs. 168). But as Figure 2 shows, after observing enough dialogs, the EM method is able to leverage the hidden user state to learn a better model of user behavior, with an average normalized log-likelihood that falls about halfway between that of the models produced by the Automatic and Manual methods. 0 500 1000 1500 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 Number of dialogs in training set Normalized log-likelihood   Truth Manual EM Automatic Figure 2: Normalized log-likelihood of each model type with respect to the test set vs. size of training set.

All the dialogs were both manually and automatically transcribed, so that each of the three methods was applicable.
