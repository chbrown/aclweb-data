First, although names are important to human readers, automatic MT scoring metrics (such as BLEU) do not encourage researchers to improve name translation in the context of MT. Names are vastly outnumbered by prepositions, articles, adjectives, common nouns, etc. Second, name translation is a hard problem — even professional human translators have trouble with names. Here are four reference translations taken from the same corpus, with mistakes underlined:","Ref1 composers such as Bach, missing name Chopin, Beethoven, Shumann, Rakmaninov, Ravel and Prokoviev","Ref2 musicians such as Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Bethoven, Shuman, Rachmaninoff, Rafael and Brokoviev","Ref3 composers including Bach, Mozart, Schopen, Beethoven, missing name Raphael,Rahmaniev and Brokofien","Ref4 composers such as Bach, Mozart, missing name Beethoven, Schumann, Rachmaninov, Raphael and Prokofiev","The task of transliterating names (independent of end-to-end MT) has received a significant amount of research, e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Al-Onaizan, 2002). One approach is to “sound out” words and create new, plausible target-language spellings that preserve the sounds of the source-language name as much as possible. Another approach is to phonetically match source-language names against a large list of target-language words 389 and phrases. Most of this work has been disconnected from end-to-end MT, a problem which we address head-on in this paper.","The simplest way to integrate name handling into SMT is: (1) run a named-entity identification system on the source sentence, (2) transliterate identified entities with a special-purpose transliteration component, and (3) run the SMT system on the source sentence, as usual, but when looking up phrasal translations for the words identified in step 1, instead use the transliterations from step 2.","Many researchers have attempted this, and it does not work. Typically, translation quality is degraded rather than improved, for the following reasons:"," Automatic named-entity identification makes errors. Some words and phrases that should not be transliterated are nonetheless sent to the transliteration component, which returns a bad translation.","","Not all named entities should be transliterated.","Many named entities require a mix of translit-","eration and translation. For example, in the pair","A","J","","K","P  J  A","","H","","","","J","k","","/jnub kalyfurnya/Southern","California, the first Arabic word is translated,","and the second word is transliterated."," Transliteration components make errors. The base SMT system may translate a commonlyoccurring name just fine, due to the bitext it was trained on, while the transliteration component can easily supply a worse answer."," Integration hobbles SMT’s use of longer phrases. Even if the named-entity identification and transliteration components operate perfectly, adopting their translations means that the SMT system may no longer have access to longer phrases that include the name. For example, our base SMT system translates","J","  K P","","","J","K",""," ","Z","P","","P","","(as a whole phrase) to “Pre-","mier Li Peng”, based on its bitext knowledge.","However, if we force","","J","K","","","","to translate as","a separate phrase to “Li Peng”, then the term","Z","P","","P"," ","J"," ","K","P","becomes ambiguous (with trans-","lations including “Prime Minister”, “Premier”,","etc.), and we observe incorrect choices being","subsequently made.","To spur better work in name handling, an ACE entity-translation pilot evaluation was recently developed (Day, 2007). This evaluation involves a mixture of entity identification and translation concerns—for example, the scoring system asks for coreference determination, which may or may not be of interest for improving machine translation output.","In this paper, we adopt a simpler metric. We ask: what percentage of source-language named entities are translated correctly? This is a precision metric. We can readily apply it to any base SMT system, and to human translations as well. Our goal in augment-ing a base SMT system is to increase this percentage. A secondary goal is to make sure that our overall translation quality (as measured by BLEU) does not degrade as a result of the name-handling techniques we introduce. We make all our measurements on an Arabic/English newswire translation task.","Our overall technical approach is summarized here, along with references to sections of this paper:"," We build a component for transliterating between Arabic and English (Section 3)."," We automatically learn to tag those words and phrases in Arabic text, which we believe the transliteration component will translate correctly (Section 4)."," We integrate suggested transliterations into the base SMT search space, with their use controlled by a feature function (Section 5)."," We evaluate both the base SMT system and the augmented system in terms of entity translation accuracy and BLEU (Sections 2 and 6)."]},{"title":"2 Evaluation","paragraphs":["In this section we present the evaluation method that we use to measure our system and also discuss challenges in name transliteration evaluation. 2.1 NEWA Evaluation Metric General MT metrics such as BLEU,TER,METEOR are not suitable for evaluating named entity translation and transliteration, because they are not focused on named entities (NEs). Dropping a comma or a the is penalized as much as dropping a name. We there-fore use another metric, jointly developed with BBN and LanguageWeaver. 390","The general idea of the Named Entity Weak Accuracy (NEWA) metric is to"," Count number of NEs in source text: N"," Count number of correctly translated NEs: C"," Divide C/N to get an accuracy figure In NEWA, an NE is counted as correctly translated if the target reference NE is found in the MT output. The metric has the advantage that it is easy to compute, has no special requirements on an MT system (such as depending on source-target word alignment) and is tokenization independent.","In the result section of this paper, we will use the NEWA metric to measure and compare the accuracy of NE translations in our end-to-end SMT translations and four human reference translations. 2.2 Annotated Corpus BBN kindly provided us with an annotated Arabic text corpus, in which named entities were marked up with their type (e.g. GPE for Geopolitical Entity) and one or more English translations. Example:"," ","","","GPE alt=”Termoli” ","","QJ"," ","K","","/GPE","","PER alt=”Abdullah II j","Abdallah II”  ","","Y","J","","   KA  J  ","/PER The BBN annotations exhibit a number of issues. For the English translations of the NEs, BBN annotators looked at human reference translations, which may introduce a bias towards those human translations. Specifically, the BBN annotations are some-times wrong, because the reference translations were wrong. Consider for example the Arabic phrase   ","","Q","J"," ","K      Q ","K","P K "," ","J","","","(mSn‘ burtran fY tyrmulY), which means Powertrain plant in Termoli. The mapping from tyrmulY to Ter m o l i is not obvious, and even less the one from burtran to Powertrain. The human reference translations for this phrase are 1. Portran site in Tremolo 2. Termoli plant (one name dropped) 3. Portran in Tirnoli 4. Portran assembly plant, in Tirmoli The BBN annotators adopted the correct translation Ter m o l i , but also the incorrect Portran.In other cases the BBN annotators adopted both a correct (Khatami) and an incorrect translation (Khatimi) when referring to the former Iranian president, which would reward a translation with such an incorrect spelling.","","","PER alt=”Khatamij","Khatimi”","  KA"," k","","/PER"," ","GPE alt=”the American” ","","J","","","QJ","","A","","","/GPE In other cases, all translations are correct, but additional correct translations are missing, as for “the American” above, for which “the US” is an equally valid alternative in the specific sentence it was annotated in.","All this raises the question of what is a correct answer. For most Western names, there is normally only one correct spelling. We follow the same conventions as standard media, paying attention to how an organization or individual spells its own name, e.g. Senator Jon Kyl, not Senator John Kyle. For Arabic names, variation is generally acceptable if there is no one clearly dominant spelling in English, e.g. Gaddafij","Gadhafij","Qaddafij","Qadhafi, as long as a given variant is not radically rarer than the most conventional or popular form. 2.3 Re-Annotation Based on the issues we found with the BBN annotations, we re-annotated a sub-corpus of 637 sentences of the BBN gold standard.","We based this re-annotation on detailed annotation guidelines and sample annotations that had previously been developed in cooperation with LanguageWeaver, building on three iterations of test annotations with three annotators.","We checked each NE in every sentence, using human reference translations, automatic transliterator output, performing substantial Web research for many rare names, and checked Google ngrams and counts for the general Web and news archives to determine whether a variant form met our threshold of occurring at least 20% as often as the most dominant form."]},{"title":"3 Transliterator","paragraphs":["This section describes how we transliterate Arabic words or phrases.

Unlike various generative approaches (Knight and Graehl, 1997; Stalls and Knight, 1998; Li et al., 2004; Matthews, 2007; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007; Kashani et al., 2007), we do not synthesize an English spelling from scratch, but rather find a translation in very large lists of English words (3.4 million) and phrases (47 million).","We develop a similarity metric for Arabic and English words. Since matching against millions of candidates is computationally prohibitive, we store the English words and phrases in an index, such that given an Arabic word or phrase, we quickly retrieve a much smaller set of likely candidates and apply our similarity metric to that smaller list.","We divide the task of transliteration into two steps: given an Arabic word or phrase to transliterate, we (1) identify a list of English transliteration candidates from indexed lists of English words and phrases with counts (section 3.1) and (2) compute for each English name candidate the cost for the Arabic/English name pair (transliteration scoring model, section 3.2).","We then combine the count information with the transliteration cost according to the formula:","score(e) = log(count(e))/20 - translit cost(e,f) 3.1 Indexing with consonant skeletons We identify a list of English transliteration candidates through what we call a consonant skeleton index. Arabic consonants are divided into 11 classes, represented by letters b,f,g,j,k,l,m,n,r,s,t. In a one-time pre-processing step, all 3,420,339 (unique) English words from our English unigram language model (based on Google’s Web terabyte ngram collection) that might be names or part of names (mostly based on capitalization) are mapped to one or more skeletons, e.g.","Rachmaninoff rkmnnf, rmnnf, rsmnnf, rtsmnnf This yields 10,381,377 skeletons (average of 3.0 per word) for which a reverse index is created (with counts). At run time, an Arabic word to be transliterated is mapped to its skeleton, e.g. ","   JJ  ","K","Ak P ","rmnnf This skeleton serves as a key for the previously built reverse index, which then yields the list of English candidates with counts: rmnnf","Rachmaninov (186,216), Rachmaninoff (179,666), Armenonville (3,445), Rachmaninow (1,636), plus 8 others. Shorter words tend to produce more candidates, resulting in slower transliteration, but since there are relatively few unique short words, this can be addressed by caching transliteration results.","The same consonant skeleton indexing process is applied to name bigrams (47,700,548 unique with 167,398,054 skeletons) and trigrams (46,543,712 unique with 165,536,451 skeletons). 3.2 Transliteration scoring model The cost of an Arabic/English name pair is computed based on 732 rules that assign a cost to a pair of Arabic and English substrings, allowing for one or more context restrictions. 1.   ::q == ::0 2.   ","::ough == ::0","3. h ::ch == :[aou],::0.1","4.   ::k == ,$:,$::0.1 ; ::0.2","5. Z :: == :,EC::0.1","The first example rule above assigns to the straightforward pair ","","/q a cost of 0. The second rule includes 2 letters on the Arabic and 4 on the English side. The third rule restricts application to substring pairs where the English side is preceded by the letters a, o, or u. The fourth rule specifies a cost of 0.1 if the substrings occur at the end of (both) names, 0.2 otherwise. According to the fifth rule, the Arabic letter Z","may match an empty string on the English side, if there is an English consonant (EC) in the right context of the English side.","The total cost is computed by always applying the longest applicable rule, without branching, result-ing in a linear complexity with respect to word-pair length. Rules may include left and/or right context for both Arabic and English. The match fails if no rule applies or the accumulated cost exceeds a preset limit.","Names may have n words on the English and m on the Arabic side. For example, New York is one word in Arabic and Abdullah is two words in Arabic. The 392 rules handle spaces (as well as digits, apostrophes and other non-alphabetic material) just like regular alphabetic characters, so that our system can handle cases like where words in English and Arabic names do not match one to one.","The French name Beaujolais ( J","","","k","","K","","/bujulyh) deviates from standard English spelling conventions in several places. The accumulative cost from the rules handling these deviations could become prohibitive, with each cost element penalizing the same underlying offense — being French. We solve this problem by allowing for additional context in the form of style flags. The rule for matching eau/ specifies, in addition to a cost, an (output) style flag +fr (as in French), which in turn serves as an additional context for the rule that matches ais/ K","","at a much reduced cost. Style flags are also used for some Arabic dialects. Extended characters such as é, ö, and şand spelling idiosyncrasies in names on the English side of the bitext that come from various third languages account for a significant portion of theruleset.","Casting the transliteration model as a scoring problem thus allows for very powerful rules with strong contexts. The current set of rules has been built by hand based on a bitext development corpus; future work might include deriving such rules automatically from a training set of transliterated names.","This transliteration scoring model described in this section is used in two ways: (1) to transliterate names at SMT decoding time, and (2) to identify transliteration pairs in a bitext."]},{"title":"4 Learning what to transliterate","paragraphs":["As already mentioned in the introduction, named entity (NE) identification followed by MT is a bad idea. We don’t want to identify NEs per se anyway — we want to identify things that our transliterator will be good at handling, i.e., things that should be transliterated. This might even include loanwords like bnk (bank) and brlman (parliament), but would exclude names such as National Basketball Association that are often translated rather transliterated.","Our method follows these steps: 1. Take a bitext. 2. Mark the Arabic words and phrases that have a","recognizable transliteration on the English side.","3. Remove the English side of the bitext.","4. Divide the annotated Arabic corpus into a training and test corpus.","5. Train a monolingual Arabic tagger to identify which words and phrases (in running Arabic) are good candidates for transliteration (section 4.2)","6. Apply the tagger to test data and evaluate its accuracy. 4.1 Mark-up of bitext Given a tokenized (but unaligned and mixed-case) bitext, we mark up that bitext with links between Arabic and English words that appear to be transliterations. In the following example, linked words are underlined, with numbers indicating what is linked.","English The meeting was attended by Omani (1) Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Yusif (2) bin (3) Alawi (6) bin (8) Abdallah (10) and Special Advisor to Sultan (12) Qabus (13) for Foreign Affairs Umar (14) bin (17) Abdul Munim (19) al-Zawawi (21).","Arabic (translit.) uHDr allqa’ uzyr aldule al‘manY (1) llsh’uun alkharjye yusf (2) bn (3) ‘luY (6) bn (8) ‘bd allh (10) ualmstshar alkhaS llslTan (12) qabus (13) ll‘laqat alkharjye ‘mr (14) bn (17) ‘bd almn‘m (19) alzuauY (21) .","For each Arabic word, the linking algorithm tries to find a matching word on the English side, using the transliteration scoring model described in section 3. If the matcher reaches the end of an Arabic or English word before reaching the end of the other, it continues to “consume” additional words until a word-boundary observing match is found or the cost threshold exceeded.","When there are several viable linking alternatives, the algorithm considers the cost provided by the transliteration scoring model, as well as context to eliminate inferior alternatives, so that for example the different occurrences of the name particle bin in the example above are linked to the proper Arabic words, based on the names next to them. The number of links depends, of course, on the specific corpus, but we typically identify about 3.0 links per sentence.","The algorithm is enhanced by a number of heuristics: 393"," English match candidates are restricted to capitalized words (with a few exceptions)."," We use a list of about 200 Arabic and English stopwords and stopword pairs."," We use lists of countries and their adjective forms to bridge cross-POS translations such as Italy’s president on the English and","J","  K P","","A  K  A ","(”Italian president”) on the Arabic side."," Arabic prefixes such as","/l- (”to”) are treated in a special way, because they are translated, not transliterated like the rest of the word. Link (12) above is an example.","In this bitext mark-up process, we achieve 99.5% precision and 95% recall based on a manual visualization-tool based evaluation. Of the 5% recall error, 3% are due to noisy data in the bitext such as typos, incorrect translations, or names missing on one side of the bitext. 4.2 Training of Arabic name tagger The task of the Arabic name tagger (or more precisely, “transliterate-me” tagger) is to predict whether or not a word in an Arabic text should be transliterated, and if so, whether it includes a prefix. Prefixes such as","/u- (“and”) have to be translated rather than transliterated, so it is important to split off any prefix from a name before transliterating that name. This monolingual tagging task is not trivial, as many Arabic words can be both a name and a non-name. For example,   QK ","Qj","","","(aljzyre) can mean both Al-Jazeera and the island (or peninsula).","Features include the word itself plus two words to the left and right, along with various prefixes, suffixes and other characteristics of all of them, to-talling about 250 features.","Some of our features depend on large corpus statistics. For this, we divide the tagged Arabic side of our training corpus into a stat section and a core training section. From the stat section we collect statistics as to how often every word, bigram or trigram occurs, and what distribution of name/non-name patterns these ngrams have. The name distribution bigram","  K  P","","   Q K  Q","j  ","3327 00:133 01:3193 11:1 (aljzyre alkurye/“peninsula Korean”) for example tells us that in 3193 out of 3327 occurrences in the stat corpus bitext, the first word is a marked up as a non-name (”0”) and the second as a name (”1”), which strongly suggests that in such a bigram context, aljzyre better be translated as island or peninsula, and not be transliterated as Al-Jazeera.","We train our system on a corpus of","million stat sentences, and","","","core training sentences.

We tag the Arabic source text using the tagger described in the previous section.","2. We apply the transliterator described in section 3 to the tagged items. We limit this transliteration to words that occur up to 50 times in the training corpus for single token names (or up to 100 and 150 times for two and three-word names). We do this because the general SMT mechanism tends to do well on more common names, but does poorly on rare names (and will 2 Freely available at http://hal3.name/megam 394 always drop names it has never seen in the training bitext).","3. On the fly, we add transliterations to SMT phrase table. Instead of a phrasal probability, the transliterations have a special binary feature set to 1. In a tuning step, the Minimim Error Rate Training component of our SMT system iteratively adjusts the set of rule weights, including the weight associated with the transliteration feature, such that the English translations are optimized with respect to a set of known reference translations according to the BLEU translation metric.","4. At run-time, the transliterations then compete with the translations generated by the general SMT system. This means that the MT system will not always use the transliterator suggestions, depending on the combination of language model, translation model, and other component scores. 5.1 Multi-token names We try to transliterate names as much as possible in context.
