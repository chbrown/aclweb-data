Typically, this method first generates a list of top-n candidates from a baseline system, and then reranks this n-best list with arbitrary features that are not computable or intractable to compute within the baseline system. But despite its apparent success, there remains a major drawback: this method suffers from the limited scope of the n-best list, which rules out many potentially good alternatives. For example 41% of the correct parses were not in the candidates of ∼30-best parses in (Collins, 2000). This situation becomes worse with longer sentences because the number of possible in-terpretations usually grows exponentially with the","∗","Part of this work was done while I was visiting Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, and I thank Prof. Qun Liu and his lab for hosting me.

As a result, we often see very few variations among the n-best trees, for example, 50-best trees typically just represent a combination of 5 to 6 binary ambiguities (since 25","< 50 < 26",").","Alternatively, discriminative parsing is tractable with exact and efficient search based on dynamic programming (DP) if all features are restricted to be local, that is, only looking at a local window within the factored search space (Taskar et al., 2004; Mc-Donald et al., 2005). However, we miss the benefits of non-local features that are not representable here.","Ideally, we would wish to combine the merits of both approaches, where an efficient inference algorithm could integrate both local and non-local features. Unfortunately, exact search is intractable (at least in theory) for features with unbounded scope. So we propose forest reranking, a technique inspired by forest rescoring (Huang and Chiang, 2007) that approximately reranks the packed forest of exponentially many parses. The key idea is to compute non-local features incrementally from bottom up, so that we can rerank the n-best subtrees at all internal nodes, instead of only at the root node as in conventional reranking (see Table 1). This method can thus be viewed as a step towards the integration of discriminative reranking with traditional chart parsing.","Although previous work on discriminative parsing has mainly focused on short sentences (≤ 15 words) (Taskar et al., 2004; Turian and Melamed, 2007), our work scales to the whole Treebank, where 586 VP1,6 VBD1,2 blah NP2,6 NP2,3 blah PP3,6 be2 e1 Figure 1: A partial forest of the example sentence. we achieved an F-score of 91.7, which is a 19% error reduction from the 1-best baseline, and outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking. This result is also better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank."]},{"title":"2 Packed Forests as Hypergraphs","paragraphs":["Informally, a packed parse forest, or forest in short, is a compact representation of all the derivations (i.e., parse trees) for a given sentence under a context-free grammar (Billot and Lang, 1989). For example, consider the following sentence 0 I 1 saw 2 him 3 with 4 a 5 mirror 6 where the numbers between words denote string positions. Shown in Figure 1, this sentence has (at least) two derivations depending on the attachment of the prep. phrase PP3,6 “with a mirror”: it can either be attached to the verb “saw”,","VBD1,2 NP2,3 PP3,6 VP1,6 , (*) or be attached to “him”, which will be further combined with the verb to form the same VP as above. These two derivations can be represented as a single forest by sharing common sub-derivations. Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang and Chiang, 2005), where items like PP3,6 are called nodes, and deductive steps like (*) correspond to hyperedges.","More formally, a forest is a pair ⟨V, E⟩, where V is the set of nodes, and E the set of hyperedges. For a given sentence w1:l = w1 . . . wl, each node v ∈ V is in the form of Xi,j, which denotes the recogni-tion of nonterminal X spanning the substring from positions i through j (that is, wi+1 . . . wj). Each hyperedge e ∈ E is a pair ⟨tails(e), head (e)⟩, where head (e) ∈ V is the consequent node in the deductive step, and tails(e) ∈ V ∗","is the list of antecedent nodes. For example, the hyperedge for deduction (*) is notated: e1 = ⟨(VBD1,2, NP2,3, PP3,6), VP1,6⟩","We also denote IN (v) to be the set of incoming hyperedges of node v, which represent the different ways of deriving v. For example, in the forest in Figure 1, IN (VP1,6) is {e1, e2}, with e2 = ⟨(VBD1,2, NP2,6), VP1,6⟩. We call |e| the arity of hyperedge e, which counts the number of tail nodes in e. The arity of a hypergraph is the maximum arity over all hyperedges. A CKY forest has an arity of 2, since the input grammar is required to be binary branching (cf. Chomsky Normal Form) to ensure cubic time parsing complexity. However, in this work, we use forests from a Treebank parser (Charniak, 2000) whose grammar is often flat in many productions. For example, the arity of the forest in Figure 1 is 3. Such a Treebank-style forest is easier to work with for reranking, since many features can be directly expressed in it. There is also a distinguished root node TOP in each forest, denoting the goal item in parsing, which is simply S0,l where S is the start symbol and l is the sentence length."]},{"title":"3 Forest Reranking 3.1 Generic Reranking with the Perceptron","paragraphs":["We first establish a unified framework for parse reranking with both n-best lists and packed forests.","For a given sentence s, a generic reranker selects the best parse ŷ among the set of candidates cand (s) according to some scoring function:","ŷ = argmax y∈cand(s) score(y) (1) In n-best reranking, cand (s) is simply a set of n-best parses from the baseline parser, that is, cand (s) = {y1, y2, . . . , yn}. Whereas in forest reranking, cand (s) is a forest implicitly represent-ing the set of exponentially many parses.","As usual, we define the score of a parse y to be the dot product between a high dimensional feature representation and a weight vector w: score(y) = w · f (y) (2) 587 where the feature extractor f is a vector of d functions f = (f1, . . . , fd), and each feature fj maps a parse y to a real number fj(y). Following (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), the first feature f1(y) = log Pr(y) is the log probability of a parse from the baseline generative parser, while the remaining features are all integer valued, and each of them counts the number of times that a particular configuration occurs in parse y. For example, one such feature f2000 might be a question “how many times is a VP of length 5 surrounded by the word ‘has’ and the period? ” which is an instance of the WordEdges feature (see Figure 2(c) and Section 3.2 for details).","Using a machine learning algorithm, the weight vector w can be estimated from the training data where each sentence si is labelled with its correct (“gold-standard”) parse y∗","i . As for the learner, Collins (2000) uses the boosting algorithm and Charniak and Johnson (2005) use the maximum entropy estimator. In this work we use the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) since it is an online algorithm much simpler and orders of magnitude faster than Boosting and MaxEnt methods.","Shown in Pseudocode 1, the perceptron algorithm makes several passes over the whole training data, and in each iteration, for each sentence si, it tries to predict a best parse ŷi among the candidates cand (si) using the current weight setting. In-tuitively, we want the gold parse y∗","i to be picked, but in general it is not guaranteed to be within cand (si), because the grammar may fail to cover the gold parse, and because the gold parse may be pruned away due to the limited scope of cand (si). So we define an oracle parse y+","i to be the candidate that has the highest Parseval F-score with respect to the gold tree y∗","i :1","y+","i ≜ argmax","y∈cand(si)","F (y, y∗ i ) (3) where function F returns the F-score. Now we train the reranker to pick the oracle parses as often as possible, and in case an error is made (line 6), perform an update on the weight vector (line 7), by adding the difference between two feature representations.","1","If one uses the gold y∗","i for oracle y+","i , the perceptron will continue to make updates towards something unreachable even when the decoder has picked the best possible candidate.","Pseudocode 1 Perceptron for Generic Reranking","1: Input: Training examples {cand(si), y+ i }N","i=1 ▷ y+","i is the","oracle tree for si among cand(si) 2: w ← 0 ▷ initial weights 3: for t ← 1 . . .

We will present a dynamic programming algorithm for this problem in Sec. 4.1.","We also use a refinement called “averaged parameters” where the final weight vector is the average of weight vectors after each sentence in each iteration over the training data. This averaging effect has been shown to reduce overfitting and produce much more stable results (Collins, 2002). 3.2 Factorizing Local and Non-Local Features A key difference between n-best and forest reranking is the handling of features. In n-best reranking, all features are treated equivalently by the decoder, which simply computes the value of each one on each candidate parse. However, for forest reranking, since the trees are not explicitly enumerated, many features can not be directly computed. So we first classify features into local and non-local, which the decoder will process in very different fashions.","We define a feature f to be local if and only if it can be factored among the local productions in a tree, and non-local if otherwise. For example, the Rule feature in Fig. 2(a) is local, while the ParentRule feature in Fig. 2(b) is non-local. It is worth noting that some features which seem complicated at the first sight are indeed local. For example, the WordEdges feature in Fig. 2(c), which classifies a node by its label, span length, and surrounding words, is still local since all these information are encoded either in the node itself or in the input sentence. In contrast, it would become non-local if we replace the surrounding words by surrounding POS 2","In case multiple candidates get the same highest F-score, we choose the parse with the highest log probability from the baseline parser to be the oracle parse (Collins, 2000). 588 VP VBD NP PP S VP VBD NP PP VP VBZ has NP |← 5 words →| . .

Shaded nodes denote information included in the feature. tags, which are generated dynamically.","More formally, we split the feature extractor f = (f1, . . . , fd) into f = (fL; fN ) where fL and fN are the local and non-local features, respectively. For the former, we extend their domains from parses to hyperedges, where f (e) returns the value of a local feature f ∈ fL on hyperedge e, and its value on a parsey factors across the hyperedges (local productions), fL(y) = ∑ e∈y fL(e) (4) and we can pre-compute fL(e) for each e in a forest.","Non-local features, however, can not be pre-computed, but we still prefer to compute them as early as possible, which we call “on-the-fly” computation, so that our decoder can be sensitive to them at internal nodes. For instance, the NGramTree feature in Fig. 2 (d) returns the minimum tree fragement spanning a bigram, in this case “saw” and “the”, and should thus be computed at the smallest common ancestor of the two, which is the VP node in this example. Similarly, the ParentRule feature in Fig. 2 (b) can be computed when the S subtree is formed. In doing so, we essentially factor non-local features across subtrees, where for each subtree y′","in a parse y, we define a unit feature f̊ (y′",") to be the part of f (y) that are computable within y′",", but not computable in any (proper) subtree of y′",". Then we have: fN (y) = ∑ y′ ∈y","f̊N (y′ ) (5)","Intuitively, we compute the unit non-local features at each subtree from bottom-up. For example, for the binary-branching node Ai,k in Fig. 3, the Ai,k Bi,j wi . . . wj−1 Cj,k wj . . . wk−1 Figure 3: Example of the unit NGramTree feature at node Ai,k: ⟨ A (B . . . wj−1) (C . . . wj) ⟩. unit NGramTree instance is for the pair ⟨wj−1, wj⟩ on the boundary between the two subtrees, whose smallest common ancestor is the current node. Other unit NGramTree instances within this span have already been computed in the subtrees, except those for the boundary words of the whole node, wi and wk−1, which will be computed when this node is further combined with other nodes in the future. 3.3 Approximate Decoding via Cube Pruning Before moving on to approximate decoding with non-local features, we first describe the algorithm for exact decoding when only local features are present, where many concepts and notations will be re-used later. We will use D(v) to denote the top derivations of node v, where D1(v) is its 1-best derivation. We also use the notation ⟨e, j⟩ to denote the derivation along hyperedge e, using the jith sub-derivation for tail ui, so ⟨e, 1⟩ is the best derivation along e. The exact decoding algorithm, shown in Pseudocode 2, is an instance of the bottom-up Viterbi algorithm, which traverses the hypergraph in a topological order, and at each node v, calculates its 1-best derivation using each incoming hyperedge e ∈ IN (v). The cost of e, c(e), is the score of its 589 Pseudocode 2 Exact Decoding with Local Features 1: function VITERBI(⟨V, E⟩) 2: for v ∈ V in topological order do 3: for e ∈ IN (v) do 4: c(e) ← w · fL(e) + P","u","i∈tails(e) c(D1(ui)) 5: if c(e) > c(D1(v)) then ▷ better derivation? 6: D1(v) ← ⟨e, 1⟩ 7: c(D1(v)) ← c(e) 8: return D1(TOP) Pseudocode 3 Cube Pruning for Non-local Features 1: function CUBE(⟨V, E⟩) 2: for v ∈ V in topological order do 3: KBEST(v) 4: return D1(TOP) 5: procedure KBEST(v) 6: heap ← ∅; buf ← ∅ 7: for e ∈ IN (v) do 8: c(⟨e, 1⟩) ← EVAL(e, 1) ▷ extract unit features 9: append ⟨e, 1⟩ to heap 10: HEAPIFY(heap) ▷ prioritized frontier 11: while |heap| > 0 and |buf | < k do 12: item ← POP-MAX(heap) ▷ extract next-best 13: append item to buf 14: PUSHSUCC(item, heap) 15: sort buf to D(v) 16: procedure PUSHSUCC(⟨e, j⟩, heap) 17: e is v → u1 . . . u|e| 18: for i in 1 . . . |e| do 19: j′","← j + bi","▷ bi","is 1 only on the ith dim. 20: if |D(ui)| ≥ j′","i then ▷ enough sub-derivations? 21: c(⟨e, j′","⟩) ← EVAL(e, j′",") ▷ unit features 22: PUSH(⟨e, j′","⟩, heap) 23: function EVAL(e, j) 24: e is v → u1 . . . u|e| 25: return w · fL(e) + w ·f̊N (⟨e, j⟩) + P","i c(Dj i(ui)) (pre-computed) local features w · fL(e). This algorithm has a time complexity of O(E), and is almost identical to traditional chart parsing, except that the forest might be more than binary-branching.","For non-local features, we adapt cube pruning from forest rescoring (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007), since the situation here is analogous to machine translation decoding with integrated language models: we can view the scores of unit non-local features as the language model cost, computed on-the-fly when combining sub-constituents.","Shown in Pseudocode 3, cube pruning works bottom-up on the forest, keeping a beam of at most k derivations at each node, and uses the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005) to speed up the computation. When combining the sub-derivations along a hyperedge e to form a new subtree y′","= ⟨e, j⟩, we also compute its unit non-local feature values f̊N (⟨e, j⟩) (line 25). A priority queue (heap in Pseudocode 3) is used to hold the candidates for the next-best derivation, which is initial-ized to the set of best derivations along each hyperedge (lines 7 to 9). Then at each iteration, we pop the best derivation (lines 12), and push its successors back into the priority queue (line 14). Analogous to the language model cost in forest rescoring, the unit feature cost here is a non-monotonic score in the dynamic programming backbone, and the derivations may thus be extracted out-of-order. So a buffer buf is used to hold extracted derivations, which is sorted at the end (line 15) to form the list of top-k derivations D(v) of node v. The complexity of this algorithm is O(E + V k log kN ) (Huang and Chiang, 2005), where O(N ) is the time for on-the-fly feature extraction for each subtree, which becomes the bottleneck in practice."]},{"title":"4 Supporting Forest Algorithms 4.1 Forest Oracle","paragraphs":["Recall that the Parseval F-score is the harmonic mean of labelled precision P and labelled recall R:","F (y, y∗ ) ≜ 2P R","P + R =","2|y ∩ y∗","|","|y| + |y∗","| (6) where |y| and |y∗","| are the numbers of brackets in the test parse and gold parse, respectively, and |y ∩ y∗","| is the number of matched brackets. Since the harmonic mean is a non-linear combination, we can not optimize the F-scores on sub-forests independently with a greedy algorithm. In other words, the optimal F-score tree in a forest is not guaranteed to be composed of two optimal F-score subtrees.","We instead propose a dynamic programming algorithm which optimizes the number of matched brackets for a given number of test brackets. For example, our algorithm will ask questions like, “when a test parse has 5 brackets, what is the maximum number of matched brackets?” More formally, at each node v, we compute an oracle function ora[v] : N ↦→ N, which maps an integer t to ora[v](t), the max. number of matched brackets 590 Pseudocode 4 Forest Oracle Algorithm 1: function ORACLE(⟨V, E⟩, y∗",") 2: for v ∈ V in topological order do 3: for e ∈ BS(v) do 4: e is v → u1u2 . . . u|e| 5: ora[v] ← ora[v] ⊕ (⊗iora[ui]) 6: ora[v] ← ora[v] ⇑ (1, 1v∈y∗",") 7: return F (y+",", y∗",") = maxt 2·ora[TOP](t)","t+|y∗","| ▷ oracle F1 for all parses yv of node v with exactly t brackets:","ora[v](t) ≜ max yv:|yv|=t","|yv ∩ y∗ | (7)","When node v is combined with another node u along a hyperedge e = ⟨(v, u), w⟩, we need to combine the two oracle functions ora[v] and ora[u] by distributing the test brackets of w between v and u, and optimize the number of matched bracktes. To do this we define a convolution operator ⊗ between two functions f and g:","(f ⊗ g)(t) ≜ max t1+t2=t f (t1) + g(t2) (8) For instance: t f(t) 2 1 3 2 ⊗ t g(t) 4 4 5 4 = t (f ⊗ g)(t) 6 5 7 6 8 6 The oracle function for the head node w is then ora[w](t) = (ora[v] ⊗ ora[u])(t − 1) + 1w∈y∗ (9) where 1 is the indicator function, returning 1 if node w is found in the gold tree y∗",", in which case we increment the number of matched brackets. We can also express Eq. 9 in a purely functional form ora[w] = (ora[v] ⊗ ora[u]) ⇑ (1, 1w∈y∗) (10) where ⇑ is a translation operator which shifts a function along the axes: (f ⇑ (a, b))(t) ≜ f (t − a) + b (11)","Above we discussed the case of one hyperedge.

For a CKY forest, this amounts to O(l3","· l2",") = O(l5","), but for general forests like those in our experiments the complexities are much higher. In practice it takes on average 0.05 seconds for forests pruned by p = 10 (see Section 4.2), but we can pre-compute and store the oracle for each forest before training starts. 4.2 Forest Pruning Our forest pruning algorithm (Jonathan Graehl, p.c.) is very similar to the method based on marginal probability (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), except that ours prunes hyperedges as well as nodes. Basically, we use an Inside-Outside algorithm to compute the Viterbi inside cost β(v) and the Viterbi out-side cost α(v) for each node v, and then compute the merit αβ(e) for each hyperedge: αβ(e) = α(head (e)) + ∑ ui∈tails(e) β(ui) (13) Intuitively, this merit is the cost of the best derivation that traverses e, and the difference δ(e) = αβ(e) − β(TOP) can be seen as the distance away from the globally best derivation. We prune away all hyperedges that have δ(e) > p for a threshold p. Nodes with all incoming hyperedges pruned are also pruned. The key difference from (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) is that in this algorithm, a node can “partially” survive the beam, with a subset of its hyperedges pruned. In practice, this method prunes on average 15% more hyperedges than their method."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["We compare the performance of our forest reranker against n-best reranking on the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

For example, even if we double the size of the n-best list to 100, the performance only goes up by 0.06% (Table 3). In fact, the 100-best oracle is only 0.5% higher than the 50-best one (see Fig. 4). In addition, the feature extraction step in 100-best reranking produces huge data files and takes 44 hours in total, though this part can be parallelized.8","On two CPUs, 100-best reranking takes 25 hours, while our forest-reranker can also finish in 26 hours, with a much smaller disk space. Indeed, this demonstrates the severe redundancies as another disadvantage of n-best lists, where many subtrees are repeated across different parses, while the packed forest reduces space dramatically by sharing common sub-derivations (see Fig. 4).","To put our results in perspective, we also compare them with other best-performing systems in Table 4. Our final result (91.7) is better than any previously reported system trained on the Treebank, although","7","It is surprising that 50-best reranking with local features achieves an even higher F-score of 91.28, and we suspect this is due to the aggressive updates and instability of the perceptron, as we do observe the learning curves to be non-monotonic. We leave the use of more stable learning algorithms to future work.","8","The n-best feature extraction already uses relative counts (Johnson, 2006), which reduced file sizes by at least a factor 4. type system F1% D Collins (2000) 89.7 Henderson (2004) 90.1 Charniak and Johnson (2005) 91.0","updated (Johnson, 2006) 91.4 this work 91.7 G Bod (2003) 90.7 Petrov and Klein (2007) 90.1","S McClosky et al.

Types D, G, and S denote discriminative, generative, and semi-supervised approaches, respectively. McClosky et al. (2006) achieved an even higher accuarcy (92.1) by leveraging on much larger unlabelled data. Moreover, their technique is orthogonal to ours, and we suspect that replacing their n-best reranker by our forest reranker might get an even better performance. Plus, except for n-best reranking, most discriminative methods require repeated parsing of the training set, which is generally impratical (Petrov and Klein, 2008). Therefore, previous work often resorts to extremely short sentences (≤ 15 words) or only looked at local features (Taskar et al., 2004; Henderson, 2004; Turian and Melamed, 2007). In comparison, thanks to the efficient decoding, our work not only scaled to the whole Treebank, but also successfully incorporated non-local features, which showed an absolute improvement of 0.44% over that of local features alone."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a framework for reranking on packed forests which compactly encodes many more candidates than n-best lists. With efficient approximate decoding, perceptron training on the whole Treebank becomes practical, which can be done in about a day even with a Python implementation. Our final result outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking baselines, and is better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank. We also devised a dynamic programming algorithm for forest oracles, an interesting problem by itself. We believe this general framework could also be applied to other problems involving forests or lattices, such as sequence labeling and machine translation. 593"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Sylvie Billot and Bernard Lang. 1989.
