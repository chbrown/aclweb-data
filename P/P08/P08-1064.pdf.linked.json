However, it cannot handle long-distance reorderings properly and does not exploit discontinuous phrases and linguistically syntactic structure features (Quirk and Menezes, 2006). Recently, many syntax-based models have been proposed to address the above deficiencies (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Bod, 2007; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Gildea, 2003; Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003). Although good progress has been reported, the fundamental issues in applying linguistic syntax to SMT, such as non-isomorphic tree alignment, structure reordering and non-syntactic phrase modeling, are still worth well studying.","In this paper, we propose a tree-to-tree translation model that is based on tree sequence alignment. It is designed to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods. The proposed model adopts tree sequence 1","as the basic translation unit and utilizes tree sequence alignments to model the translation process. Therefore, it not only describes non-syntactic phrases with syntactic structure information, but also supports multi-level tree structure reordering in larger span. These give our model much more expressive power and flexibility than those previous models. Experiment results on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation task show that our method significantly outperforms Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system, and other linguistically syntax-based methods, such as SCFG-based and STSG-based methods (Zhang et al., 2007). In addition, our study further demonstrates that 1) structure reordering rules in our model are very useful for performance improvement while discontinuous phrase rules have less contribution and 2) tree sequence rules are able to model non-syntactic phrases with syntactic structure information, and thus contribute much to the performance improvement, but those rules consisting of more than three sub-trees have almost no contribution.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous work. Section 3 elabo-  1 A tree sequence refers to an ordered sub-tree sequence that covers a phrase or a consecutive tree fragment in a parse tree. It is the same as the concept “forest” used in Liu et al (2007). 559 rates the modelling process while Sections 4 and 5 discuss the training and decoding algorithms. The experimental results are reported in Section 6. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["Many techniques on linguistically syntax-based SMT have been proposed in literature. Yamada and Knight (2001) use noisy-channel model to transfer a target parse tree into a source sentence. Eisner (2003) studies how to learn non-isomorphic tree-to-tree/string mappings using a STSG. Ding and Palmer (2005) propose a syntax-based translation model based on a probabilistic synchronous dependency insertion grammar. Quirk et al. (2005) propose a dependency treelet-based translation model. Cowan et al. (2006) propose a feature-based discriminative model for target language syntactic structures prediction, given a source parse tree. Huang et al. (2006) study a TSG-based tree-to-string alignment model. Liu et al. (2006) propose a tree-to-string model. Zhang et al. (2007b) present a STSG-based tree-to-tree translation model. Bod (2007) reports that the unsupervised STSG-based translation model performs much better than the supervised one. The motiva-tion behind all these work is to exploit linguistically syntactic structure features to model the translation process. However, most of them fail to utilize non-syntactic phrases well that are proven useful in the phrase-based methods (Koehn et al., 2003).","The formally syntax-based model for SMT was first advocated by Wu (1997). Xiong et al. (2006) propose a MaxEnt-based reordering model for BTG (Wu, 1997) while Setiawan et al. (2007) propose a function word-based reordering model for BTG. Chiang (2005)’s hierarchal phrase-based model achieves significant performance improvement. However, no further significant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature (Chiang, 2005).","In the last two years, many research efforts were devoted to integrating the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods. In the following, we review four representatives of them.","1) Hassan et al. (2007) integrate supertags (a kind of lexicalized syntactic description) into the target side of translation model and language model under the phrase-based translation framework, resulting in good performance improvement. However, neither source side syntactic knowledge nor reordering model is further explored.","2) Galley et al. (2006) handle non-syntactic phrasal translations by traversing the tree upwards until a node that subsumes the phrase is reached. This solution requires larger applicability contexts (Marcu et al., 2006). However, phrases are utilized independently in the phrase-based method without depending on any contexts.","3) Addressing the issues in Galley et al. (2006), Marcu et al. (2006) create an xRS rule headed by a pseudo, non-syntactic non-terminal symbol that subsumes the phrase and its corresponding multiheaded syntactic structure; and one sibling xRS rule that explains how the pseudo symbol can be combined with other genuine non-terminals for acquiring the genuine parse trees. The name of the pseudo non-terminal is designed to reflect the full realization of the corresponding rule. The problem in this method is that it neglects alignment consistency in creating sibling rules and the naming mechanism faces challenges in describing more complicated phenomena (Liu et al., 2007).","4) Liu et al. (2006) treat all bilingual phrases as lexicalized tree-to-string rules, including those non-syntactic phrases in training corpus. Although the solution shows effective empirically, it only utilizes the source side syntactic phrases of the input parse tree during decoding. Furthermore, the translation probabilities of the bilingual phrases and other tree-to-string rules are not compatible since they are estimated independently, thus having different parameter spaces. To address the above problems, Liu et al. (2007) propose to use forest-to-string rules to enhance the expressive power of their tree-to-string model. As is inherent in a tree-to-string framework, Liu et al.’s method defines a kind of auxiliary rules to integrate forest-to-string rules into tree-to-string models. One problem of this method is that the auxiliary rules are not described by probabilities since they are constructed during decoding, rather than learned from the training corpus. So, to balance the usage of different kinds of rules, they use a very simple feature counting the number of auxiliary rules used in a derivation for penalizing the use of forest-to-string and auxiliary rules.","In this paper, an alternative solution is presented to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syn-560","1()I Te","1()J Tf A","","Figure 1: A word-aligned parse tree pairs of a Chinese sentence and its English translation "," Figure 2: Two Examples of tree sequences ","  Figure 3: Two examples of translation rules tax-based methods. Unlike previous work, our solution neither requires larger applicability contexts (Galley et al., 2006), nor depends on pseudo nodes (Marcu et al., 2006) or auxiliary rules (Liu et al., 2007). We go beyond the single sub-tree mapping model to propose a tree sequence alignment-based translation model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically explore the tree sequence alignment based model in SMT."]},{"title":"3 Tree Sequence Alignment Model 3.1 Tree Sequence Translation Rule","paragraphs":["The leaf nodes of a sub-tree in a tree sequence can be either non-terminal symbols (grammar tags) or terminal symbols (lexical words).

However, formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005). This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005). As a result, it is more robust to the issue of non-syntactic phrase usage and non-isomorphic structure alignment. 24.71 26.07 23.86 22.72 21.522.523.524.525.526.5 SCFG Moses STSG Ours BL E U (% )  Figure 4: Performance comparison of different methods  Rule Type","TR (STSG)","TR +TSR_L","TR+TSR_L +TSR_P TR +TSR BLEU(%) 24.71 25.72 25.93 26.07  Table 2: Contributions of TSRs (see Table 1 for the definitions of the abbreviations used in this table)  Table 2 measures the contributions of different","kinds of tree sequence rules.

(2006) reports that discontinuities are very useful for translational equivalence analysis using binarybranching structures under word alignment and parse tree constraints while they are almost of no use if under word alignment constraints only. Bod (2007) finds that discontinues phrase rules make significant performance improvement in linguistically STSG-based SMT models. 565 es (Wellington et al., 2006). Our additional experiments also verify that discontinuous phrase rules are complementary to syntactic phrase rules (Bod, 2007) while non-syntactic phrase rules may compromise the contribution of discontinuous phrase rules. Table 4 reports the numbers of these two kinds of rules. It shows that around 30% rules are shared by the two kinds of rule sets. These overlapped rules contain at least two non-terminal leaf nodes plus two terminal leaf nodes, which implies that longer rules do not affect performance too much."," 22.07 25.28 26.1425.94 26.02 26.07 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5 26.5 123456 BL E U (% )  Figure 5: Accuracy changing with different maximal tree depths ( h = 1 to 6 when"]},{"title":"4d =","paragraphs":[")  22.72 24.71 26.0526.03 26.07 25.74 25.2925.2825.26 24.78 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5 26.5 12345 BLEU ( % )"," Figure 6: Accuracy changing with the different maximal number of trees in a tree sequence ("]},{"title":"d","paragraphs":["=1 to 5), the upper","line is for 6h = while the lower line is for 2h = . ","Fig. 5 studies the impact when setting different maximal tree depth ( h ) in a rule on the performance. It demonstrates that:","1) Significant performance improvement is achieved when the value of h is increased from 1 to 2. This can be easily explained by the fact that when h = 1, only monotonic search is conducted, while h = 2 allows non-terminals to be leaf nodes, thus introducing preliminary structure features to the search and allowing non-monotonic search.","2) Internal structures and large span (due to h increasing) are also useful as attested by the gain of 0.86 (26.14-25.28) Blue score when the value of h increases from 2 to 4.","Fig. 6 studies the impact on performance by setting different maximal tree number (d) in a rule. It further indicates that:","1) Tree sequence rules (d >1) are useful and even more helpful if we limit the tree depth to no more than two (lower line, h=2). However, tree sequence rules consisting of more than three sub-trees have almost no contribution to the performance improvement. This is mainly due to data sparseness issue when d >3.","2) Even if only two-layer sub-trees (lower line) are allowed, our method still outperforms STSG and Moses when d>1. This further validates the effectiveness of our design philosophy of using multi-sub-trees as basic translation unit in SMT."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a tree sequence alignment-based translation model to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods. The experimental results on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our study also finds that in our model the tree sequence rules are very useful since they can model non-syntactic phrases and reorderings with rich linguistic structure features while discontinuous phrases and tree sequence rules with more than three sub-trees have less impact on performance.","There are many interesting research topics on the tree sequence-based translation model worth exploring in the future. The current method extracts large amount of rules. Many of them are redundant, which make decoding very slow. Thus, effective rule optimization and pruning algorithms are highly desirable. Ideally, a linguistically and empirically motivated theory can be worked out, suggesting what kinds of rules should be extracted given an input phrase pair. For example, most function words and headwords can be kept in abstract rules as features. In addition, word alignment is a hard constraint in our rule extraction. We will study direct structure alignments to reduce the impact of word alignment errors. We are also in-terested in comparing our method with the forest-to-string model (Liu et al., 2007). Finally, we would also like to study unsupervised learning-based bilingual parsing for SMT. 566 "]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Rens Bod. 2007.
