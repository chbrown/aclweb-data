The Student Research Workshop is now an established tradition at ACL conferences and provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their work and receive feedback. New this year was encouraging researchers in Information Retrieval to be involved, both reviewers and authors. We received a total of 27 submissions coming from 11 different countries, and accepted 12 of them. 5 will be presented orally, and 7 as posters, during a common poster session with the main conference. A total of 61 students and senior researchers agreed to serve on the program committee, which allowed us to assign 5 reviewers per paper. We would like to thank the reviewers for understanding the spirit of the Student Research Workshop and giving careful and constructive reviews. We hope their comments will be helpful to all the students who submitted their work. All presenters received financial support from the U.S. National Science Foundation to assist them in their travel to Columbus. We are very grateful to Jan Wiebe, our faculty advisor, for her advice, constant support, and obtaining funding. Finally, we would like to thank the general chair of ACL-08: HLT, Kathleen McKeown, the program chairs, Johanna Moore, Simone Teufel, James Allan, and Sadaoki Furui, the publications chairs Joakim Nivre and Noah Smith, Chris Brew and the local organization committee, and Priscilla Rasmussen.
