We extract the surrounding textual context of the pronoun and gather, from a large corpus, the distribution of words that occur within that context. We learn to reliably classify these distributions as representing either referential or non-referential pronoun instances. Despite its simplicity, experimental results on classifying the English pronoun it show the system achieves the highest performance yet attained on this important task."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The goal of coreference resolution is to determine which noun phrases in a document refer to the same real-world entity. As part of this task, coreference resolution systems must decide which pronouns refer to preceding noun phrases (called antecedents) and which do not. In particular, a long-standing challenge has been to correctly classify instances of the English pronoun it. Consider the sentences: (1) You can make it in advance. (2) You can make it in Hollywood.","In sentence (1), it is an anaphoric pronoun referring to some previous noun phrase, like the sauce or an appointment. In sentence (2), it is part of the idiomatic expression make it meaning succeed. A coreference resolution system should nd an antecedent for the rst it but not the second. Pronouns that do not refer to preceding noun phrases are called non-anaphoric or non-referential pronouns.","The word it is one of the most frequent words in the English language, accounting for about 1% of tokens in text and over a quarter of all third-person pronouns.1","Usually between a quarter and a half of it instances are non-referential (e.g. Section 4, Table 3). As with other pronouns, the preceding discourse can affect it’s interpretation. For example, sentence (2) can be interpreted as referential if the preceding sentence is You want to make a movie? We show, however, that we can reliably classify a pronoun as being referential or non-referential based solely on the local context surrounding the pronoun.","We do this by turning the context into patterns and enumerating all the words that can take the place of it in these patterns. For sentence (1), we can extract the context pattern make * in advance and for sentence (2) make * in Hollywood, where * is a wildcard that can be lled by any token. Non-referential distributions tend to have the word it ll-ing the wildcard position. Referential distributions occur with many other noun phrase llers. For example, in our n-gram collection (Section 3.4), make it in advance and make them in advance occur roughly the same number of times (442 vs. 449), in-dicating a referential pattern. In contrast, make it in Hollywood occurs 3421 times while make them in Hollywood does not occur at all.","These simple counts strongly indicate whether another noun can replace the pronoun. Thus we can computationally distinguish between a) pronouns that refer to nouns, and b) all other instances: including those that have no antecedent, like sentence (2),","1","e.g. http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bncfreq/ists.html 10 and those that refer to sentences, clauses, or implied topics of discourse. Beyond the practical value of this distinction, Section 3 provides some theoretical justication for our binary classication.","Section 3 also shows how to automatically extract and collect counts for context patterns, and how to combine the information using a machine learned classier. Section 4 describes our data for learning and evaluation, It-Bank: a set of over three thousand labelled instances of the pronoun it from a variety of text sources. Section 4 also explains our comparison approaches and experimental methodology. Section 5 presents our results, including an interest-ing comparison of our system to human classication given equivalent segments of context."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The difculty of non-referential pronouns has been acknowledged since the beginning of computational resolution of anaphora. Hobbs (1978) notes his algorithm does not handle pronominal references to sentences nor cases where it occurs in time or weather expressions. Hirst (1981, page 17) emphasizes the importance of detecting non-referential pronouns, lest precious hours be lost in bootless searches for textual referents. M ¤uller (2006) summarizes the evolution of computational approaches to non-referential it detection. In particular, note the pioneering work of Paice and Husk (1987), the inclusion of non-referential it detection in a full anaphora resolution system by Lappin and Leass (1994), and the machine learning approach of Evans (2001).","There has recently been renewed interest in non-referential pronouns, driven by three primary sources. First of all, research in coreference resolution has shown the benets of modules for general noun anaphoricity determination (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Denis and Baldridge, 2007). Unfortunately, these studies handle pronouns inadequately; judg-ing from the decision trees and performance gures, Ng and Cardie (2002)’s system treats all pronouns as anaphoric by default. Secondly, while most pronoun resolution evaluations simply exclude non-referential pronouns, recent unsupervised approaches (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2007) must deal with all pronouns in unrestricted text, and therefore need robust modules to automatically handle non-referential instances. Finally, reference resolution has moved beyond written text into in spoken dialog. Here, non-referential pronouns are pervasive. Eckert and Strube (2000) report that in the Switchboard corpus, only 45% of demonstratives and third-person pronouns have a noun phrase antecedent. Handling the common non-referential instances is thus especially vital.","One issue with systems for non-referential detection is the amount of language-specic knowledge that must be encoded. Consider a system that jointly performs anaphora resolution and word alignment in parallel corpora for machine translation. For this task, we need to identify non-referential anaphora in multiple languages. It is not always clear to what extent the features and modules developed for English systems apply to other languages. For example, the detector of Lappin and Leass (1994) labels a pronoun as non-referential if it matches one of several syntactic patterns, including: It is Cogv-ed that Sentence, where Cogv is a cognitive verb such as recommend, think, believe, know, anticipate, etc. Porting this approach to a new language would require not only access to a syntactic parser and a list of cognitive verbs in that language, but the development of new patterns to catch non-referential pronoun uses that do not exist in English.","Moreover, writing a set of rules to capture this phenomenon is likely to miss many less-common uses. Alternatively, recent machine-learning approaches leverage a more general representation of a pronoun instance. For example, M ¤uller (2006) has a feature for distance to next complementizer (that, if, whether) and features for the tokens and part-of-speech tags of the context words. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of implicit and explicit English-specic knowledge needed to develop these features, including, for example, lists of seem verbs such as appear, look, mean, happen. Similarly, the machine-learned system of Boyd et al. (2005) uses a set of idiom patterns like on the face of it that trigger binary features if detected in the pronoun context. Although machine learned systems can exibly balance the various indicators and contra-indicators of non-referentiality, a particular feature is only useful if it is relevant to an example in limited labelled training data.","Our approach avoids hand-crafting a set of spe-11 cic indicator features; we simply use the distribution of the pronoun’s context. Our method is thus related to previous work based on Harris (1985)’s distributional hypothesis.2","It has been used to determine both word and syntactic path similarity (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998a; Lin and Pantel, 2001). Our work is part of a trend of extracting other important information from statistical distributions. Dagan and Itai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun’s context to determine which candidate antecedents can t the context. Bergsma and Lin (2006) determine the likelihood of coreference along the syntactic path connecting a pronoun to a possible antecedent, by looking at the distribution of the path in text. These approaches, like ours, are ways to inject sophisticated world knowledge into anaphora resolution."]},{"title":"3 Methodology3.1 Definition","paragraphs":["Our approach distinguishes contexts where pronouns cannot be replaced by a preceding noun phrase (non-noun-referential) from those where nouns can occur (noun-referential). Although coreference evaluations, such as the MUC (1997) tasks, also make this distinction, it is not necessarily used by all researchers. Evans (2001), for example, distinguishes between clause anaphoric and pleonastic as in the following two instances:","(3) The paper reported that it had snowed. It was obvious. (clause anaphoric) (4) It was obvious that it had snowed. (pleonastic) The word It in sentence (3) is considered referential, while the word It in sentence (4) is considered non-referential.3","From our perspective, this interpretation is somewhat arbitrary. One could also say that the It in both cases refers to the clause that it had snowed. Indeed, annotation experiments using very ne-grained categories show low annotation reliability (M¤uller, 2006). On the other hand, there is no debate over the importance nor the denition of distinguishing pronouns that refer to nouns from those that do not. We adopt this distinction for our 2 Words occurring in similar contexts have similar meanings 3 The it in it had snowed is, of course, non-referential. work, and show it has good inter-annotator reliability (Section 4.1). We henceforth refer to non-noun-referential simply as non-referential, and thus consider the word It in both sentences (3) and (4) as non-referential.","Non-referential pronouns are widespread in natural language. The es in the German Wie geht es Ihnen and the il in the French S’il vous platare both non-referential. In pro-drop languages that may omit subject pronouns, there remains the question of whether an omitted pronoun is referential (Zhao and Ng, 2007). Although we focus on the English pronoun it, our approach should differentiate any words that have both a structural and a referential role in language, e.g. words like this, there and that (M¤uller, 2007). We believe a distributional approach could also help in related tasks like identifying the generic use of you (Gupta et al., 2007). 3.2 Context Distribution Our method extracts the context surrounding a pronoun and determines which other words can take the place of the pronoun in the context. The extracted segments of context are called context patterns. The words that take the place of the pronoun are called pattern fillers. We gather pattern llers from a large collection of n-gram frequencies. The maximum size of a context pattern depends on the size of n-grams available in the data. In our n-gram collection (Section 3.4), the lengths of the n-grams range from unigrams to 5-grams, so our maximum pattern size is ve. For a particular pronoun in text, there are ve possible 5-grams that span the pronoun. For example, in the following instance of it: ... said here Thursday that it is unnecessary to continue ... We can extract the following 5-gram patterns:","said here Thursday that *","here Thursday that * is","Thursday that * is unnecessary","that * is unnecessary to","* is unnecessary to continue Similarly, we extract the four 4-gram patterns. Shorter n-grams were not found to improve performance on development data and hence are not extracted. We only use context within the current sentence (including the beginning-of-sentence and end-of-sentence tokens) so if a pronoun occurs near a sentence boundary, some patterns may be missing. 12 Pattern Filler Type String #1: 3rd-person pron. sing. it/its #2: 3rd-person pron. plur. they/them/their #3: any other pronoun he/him/his/, I/me/my, etc. #4: infrequent word token ⟨UNK⟩ #5: any other token * Table 1: Pattern ller types","We take a few steps to improve generality. We change the patterns to lower-case, convert sequences of digits to the # symbol, and run the Porter stemmer4","(Porter, 1980). To generalize rare names, we convert capitalized words longer than ve characters to a special NE tag. We also added a few simple rules to stem the irregular verbs be, have, do, and said, and convert the common contractions ’nt, ’s, ’m, ’re, ’ve, ’d, and ’ll to their most likely stem.","We do the same processing to our n-gram corpus. We then nd all n-grams matching our patterns, allowing any token to match the wildcard in place of it. Also, other pronouns in the pattern are allowed to match a corresponding pronoun in an n-gram, regardless of differences in inection and class.","We now discuss how to use the distribution of pattern llers. For identifying non-referential it in English, we are interested in how often it occurs as a pattern ller versus other nouns. However, determining part-of-speech in a large n-gram corpus is not simple, nor would it easily extend to other languages. Instead, we gather counts for ve different classes of words that ll the wildcard position, easily determined by string match (Table 1). The third-person plural they (#2) reliably occurs in patterns where referential it also resides. The occurrence of any other pronoun (#3) guarantees that at the very least the pattern ller is a noun. A match with the infrequent word token ⟨UNK⟩ (#4) (explained in Section 3.4) will likely be a noun because nouns account for a large proportion of rare words in a corpus. Gathering any other token (#5) also mostly nds nouns; inserting another part-of-speech usually","4","Adapted from the Bow-toolkit (McCallum, 1996). Our method also works without the stemmer; we simply truncate the words in the pattern at a given maximum length (see Section 5.1). With simple truncation, all the pattern processing can be easily applied to other languages. Pattern","Filler Counts #1 #2 #3 #5 sai here NE that * 84 0 291 3985 here NE that * be 0 0 0 93 NE that * be unnecessari 0 0 0 0 that * be unnecessari to 16726 56 0 228 * be unnecessari to continu 258 0 0 0 Table 2: 5-gram context patterns and pattern-ller counts for the Section 3.2 example. results in an unlikely, ungrammatical pattern.","Table 2 gives the stemmed context patterns for our running example. It also gives the n-gram counts of pattern llers matching the rst four ller types (there were no matches of the ⟨UNK⟩ type, #4). 3.3 Feature Vector Representation There are many possible ways to use the above counts. Intuitively, our method should identify as non-referential those instances that have a high proportion of llers of type #1 (i.e., the word it), while labelling as referential those with high counts for other types of llers. We would also like to leverage the possibility that some of the patterns may be more predictive than others, depending on where the wildcard lies in the pattern. For example, in Table 2, the cases where the it-position is near the beginning of the pattern best reect the non-referential nature of this instance. We can achieve these aims by or-dering the counts in a feature vector, and using a labelled set of training examples to learn a classier that optimally weights the counts.","For classication, we dene non-referential as positive and referential as negative. Our feature representation very much resembles Table 2. For each of the ve 5-gram patterns, ordered by the position of the wildcard, we have features for the logarithm of counts for ller types #1, #2, ... #5. Similarly, for each of the four 4-gram patterns, we provide the log-counts corresponding to types #1, #2, ... #5 as well. Before taking the logarithm, we smooth the counts by adding a xed number to all observed values. We also provide, for each pattern, a feature that indicates if the pattern is not available because the it-position would cause the pattern to span beyond the current sentence. There are twenty-ve 5-gram, twenty 4-gram, and nine indicator features in total. 13","Our classier should learn positive weights on the type #1 counts and negative weights on the other types, with higher absolute weights on the more predictive ller types and pattern positions. Note that leaving the pattern counts unnormalized automatically allows patterns with higher counts to contribute more to the prediction of their associated instances. 3.4 N-Gram Data We now describe the collection of n-grams and their counts used in our implementation. We use, to our knowledge, the largest publicly available collection: the Google Web 1T 5-gram Corpus Version 1.1.5 This collection was generated from approximately 1 trillion tokens of online text. In this data, tokens appearing less than 200 times have been mapped to the ⟨UNK⟩ symbol. Also, only n-grams appearing more than 40 times are included. For languages where such an extensive n-gram resource is not available, the n-gram counts could also be taken from the page-counts returned by an Internet search engine."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation4.1 Labelled It Data","paragraphs":["We need labelled data for training and evaluation of our system. This data indicates, for every occurrence of the pronoun it, whether it refers to a preceding noun phrase or not. Standard coreference resolution data sets annotate all noun phrases that have an antecedent noun phrase in the text. Therefore, we can extract labelled instances of it from these sets. We do this for the dry-run and formal sets from MUC-7 (1997), and merge them into a single data set.","Of course, full coreference-annotated data is a precious resource, with the pronoun it making up only a small portion of the marked-up noun phrases. We thus created annotated data specically for the pronoun it. We annotated 1020 instances in a collection of Science News articles (from 1995-2000), downloaded from the Science News website. We also annotated 709 instances in the WSJ portion of the DARPA TIPSTER Project (Harman, 1992), and 279 instances in the English portion of the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005).","A single annotator (A1) labelled all three data sets, while two additional annotators not connected","5","Available from the LDC as LDC2006T13 Data Set Number of It % Non-Referential Europarl 279 50.9 Sci-News 1020 32.6 WSJ 709 25.1 MUC 129 31.8 Train 1069 33.2 Test 1067 31.7 Test-200 200 30.0 Table 3: Data sets used in experiments. with the project (A2 and A3) were asked to separately re-annotate a portion of each, so that inter-annotator agreement could be calculated. A1 and A2 agreed on 96% of annotation decisions, while A1-A3, and A2-A3, agreed on 91% and 93% of decisions, respectively. The Kappa statistic (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000, page 315), with P(E) computed from the confusion matrices, was a high 0.90 for A1-A2, and 0.79 and 0.81 for the other pairs, around the 0.80 considered to be good reliability. These are, perhaps surprisingly, the only known it-annotation-agreement statistics available for written text. They contrast favourably with the low agreement seen on categorizing it in spoken dialog (M ¤uller, 2006).","We make all the annotations available in It-Bank, an online repository for annotated it-instances.6 It-Bank also allows other researchers to distribute their it annotations. Often, the full text of articles containing annotations cannot be shared because of copyright. However, sharing just the sentences containing the word it, randomly-ordered, is permissible under fair-use guidelines. The original annotators retain their copyright on the annotations.","We use our annotated data in two ways. First of all, we perform cross-validation experiments on each of the data sets individually, to help gauge the difculty of resolution on particular domains and volumes of training data. Secondly, we randomly distribute all instances into two main sets, a training set and a test set. We also construct a smaller test set, Test-200, containing only the rst 200 instances in the Test set. We use Test-200 for human experiments and error analysis (Section 5.2). Table 3 summarizes all the sets used in the experiments. 6 www.cs.ualberta.ca/bergsma/ItBank/. It-Bank also con-","tains an additional 1,077 examples used as development data. 14 4.2 Comparison Approaches We represent feature vectors exactly as described in Section 3.3. We smooth by adding 40 to all counts, equal to the minimum count in the n-gram data. For classication, we use a maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996), from the logistic regression package in Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005), with all default parameter settings. Results with our distributional approach are labelled as DISTRIB. Note that our maximum entropy classier actually produces a probability of non-referentiality, which is thresholded at 50% to make a classication.","As a baseline, we implemented the non-referential it detector of Lappin and Leass (1994), labelled as LL in the results. This is a syntactic detector, a point missed by Evans (2001) in his criticism: the patterns are robust to intervening words and modiers (e.g. it was never thought by the committee that...) provided the sentence is parsed correctly.7 We automatically parse sentences with Minipar, a broad-coverage dependency parser (Lin, 1998b).","We also use a separate, extended version of the LL detector, implemented for large-scale non-referential detection by Cherry and Bergsma (2005). This system, also for Minipar, additionally detects instances of it labelled with Minipar’s pleonastic category Subj. It uses Minipar’s named-entity recognition to identify time expressions, such as it was midnight, and provides a number of other patterns to match common non-referential it uses, such as in expressions like darn it, don’t overdo it, etc. This extended detector is labelled as MINIPL (for Minipar pleonasticity) in our results.","Finally, we tested a system that combines the above three approaches. We simply add the LL and MINIPL decisions as binary features in the DISTRIB system. This system is called COMBO in our results. 4.3 Evaluation Criteria We follow M¤uller (2006)’s evaluation criteria. Precision (P) is the proportion of instances that we label as non-referential that are indeed non-referential. Recall (R) is the proportion of true non-referentials that we detect, and is thus a measure of the coverage 7","Our approach, on the other hand, would seem to be susceptible to such intervening material, if it pushes indicative context tokens out of the 5-token window.

Note that while the LL system has high detection precision, it has very low recall, sharply reducing F-score. The MINIPL approach sacrices some precision for much higher recall, but again has fairly low F-score. To our knowledge, our COMBO system, with an F-Score of 77.1%, achieves the highest performance of any non-referential system yet implemented. Even more importantly, DISTRIB, which requires only minimal linguistic processing and no encoding of specic indicator patterns, achieves 75.8% F-Score. The difference between COMBO and DISTRIB is not statistically signicant, while both are signicantly better than the rule-based approaches.8","This provides strong motivation for a light-weight approach to non-referential it detection one that does not require parsing or hand-crafted rules and is easily ported to new languages and text domains.","Since applying an English stemmer to the context words (Section 3.2) reduces the portability of the distributional technique, we investigated the use of more portable pattern abstraction. Figure 1 compares the use of the stemmer to simply truncating the words in the patterns at a certain maximum length. Using no truncation (Unaltered) drops the F-Score by 4.3%, while truncating the patterns to a length of four only drops the F-Score by 1.4%, a difference which is not statistically signicant.

For real-world application of our approach, truncation also reduces the table sizes (and thus storage and look-up costs) of any pre-compiled it-pattern database.","Table 5 compares the 10-fold cross-validation F-score of our systems on the four data sets. The performance of COMBO on Europarl and MUC is affected by the small number of instances in these sets (Section 4, Table 3). We can reduce data fragmentation by removing features. For example, if we only use the length-4 patterns in COMBO (labelled as COMBO4), performance increases dramatically on Europarl and MUC, while dipping slightly for the larger Sci-News and WSJ sets. Furthermore, select-ing just the three most useful ller type counts as features (#1,#2,#5), boosts F-Score on Europarl to 86.5%, 10% above the full COMBO system. 5.2 Analysis and Discussion In light of these strong results, it is worth considering where further gains in performance might yet be found. One key question is to what extent a limited context restricts identication performance. We rst tested the importance of the pattern length by System P R F Acc DISTRIB 80.0 73.3 76.5 86.5 COMBO 80.7 76.7 78.6 87.5 Human-1 92.7 63.3 75.2 87.5 Human-2 84.0 70.0 76.4 87.0 Human-3 72.2 86.7 78.8 86.0 Table 6: Evaluation on Test-200 (%). using only the length-4 counts in the DISTRIB system (Train/Test split). Surprisingly, the drop in F-Score was only one percent, to 74.8%. Using only the length-5 counts drops F-Score to 71.4%. Neither are statistically signicant; however there seems to be diminishing returns from longer context patterns.","Another way to view the limited context is to ask, given the amount of context we have, are we making optimum use of it? We answer this by seeing how well humans can do with the same information. As explained in Section 3.2, our system uses 5-gram context patterns that together span from four-to-the-left to four-to-the-right of the pronoun. We thus provide these same nine-token windows to our human subjects, and ask them to decide whether the pronouns refer to previous noun phrases or not, based on these contexts. Subjects rst performed a dry-run experiment on separate development data. They were shown their errors and sources of confusion were claried. They then made the judgments unassisted on the nal Test-200 data. Three humans performed the experiment. Their results show a range of preferences for precision versus recall, with both F-Score and Accuracy on average below the performance of COMBO (Table 6). Foremost, these results show that our distributional approach is already getting good leverage from the limited context information, around that achieved by our best human.","It is instructive to inspect the twenty-ve Test-200 instances that the COMBO system classied incorrectly, given human performance on this same set. Seventeen of the twenty-ve COMBO errors were also made by one or more human subjects, suggest-ing system errors are also mostly due to limited context. For example, one of these errors was for the context: it takes an astounding amount... Here, the non-referential nature of the instance is not apparent without the innitive clause that ends the sentence: ... of time to compare very long DNA sequences 16 with each other.","Six of the eight errors unique to the COMBO system were cases where the system falsely said the pronoun was non-referential. Four of these could have referred to entire sentences or clauses rather than nouns. These confusing cases, for both humans and our system, result from our denition of a referential pronoun: pronouns with verbal or clause antecedents are considered non-referential (Section 3.1). If an antecedent verb or clause is replaced by a nominalization (Smith researched... to Smith’s research), a referring pronoun, in the same context, becomes referential. When we inspect the probabilities produced by the maximum entropy classier (Section 4.2), we see only a weak bias for the non-referential class on these examples, reect-ing our classier’s uncertainty. It would likely be possible to improve accuracy on these cases by encoding the presence or absence of preceding nominalizations as a feature of our classier.","Another false non-referential decision is for the phrase ... machine he had installed it on. The it is actually referential, but the extracted patterns (e.g. he had install * on) are nevertheless usually lled with it.9","Again, it might be possible to x such examples by leveraging the preceding discourse. Notably, the rst noun-phrase before the context is the word software. There is strong compatibility between the pronoun-parent installand the candidate antecedent software. In a full coreference resolution system, when the anaphora resolution module has a strong preference to link it to an antecedent (which it should when the pronoun is indeed referential), we can override a weak non-referential probability. Non-referential it detection should not be a pre-processing step, but rather part of a globallyoptimal conguration, as was done for general noun phrase anaphoricity by Denis and Baldridge (2007).","The suitability of this kind of approach to correct-ing some of our system’s errors is especially obvious when we inspect the probabilities of the maximum entropy model’s output decisions on the Test-200 set. Where the maximum entropy classier makes mistakes, it does so with less condence than when it classies correct examples. The average predicted 9 This example also suggests using ller counts for the word","the as a feature when it is the last word in the pattern. probability of the incorrect classications is 76.0% while the average probability of the correct classications is 90.3%. Many incorrect decisions are ready to switch sides; our next step will be to use features of the preceding discourse and the candidate antecedents to help give them a push."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented an approach to detecting non-referential pronouns in text based on the distribution of the pronoun’s context. The approach is simple to implement, attains state-of-the-art results, and should be easily ported to other languages. Our technique demonstrates how large volumes of data can be used to gather world knowledge for natural language processing. A consequence of this research was the creation of It-Bank, a collection of thousands of labelled examples of the pronoun it, which will benet other coreference resolution researchers.","Error analysis reveals that our system is getting good leverage out of the pronoun context, achiev-ing results comparable to human performance given equivalent information. To boost performance further, we will need to incorporate information from preceding discourse. Future research will also test the distributional classication of other ambiguous pronouns, like this, you, there, and that. Another avenue of study will look at the interaction between coreference resolution and machine translation. For example, if a single form in English (e.g. that) is separated into different meanings in another language (e.g., Spanish demonstrative ese, nominal reference ése, abstract or statement reference eso, and complementizer que), then aligned examples provide automatically-disambiguated English data. We could extract context patterns and collect statistics from these examples like in our current approach. In general, jointly optimizing translation and coreference is an exciting and largely unexplored research area, now partly enabled by our portable non-referential detection methodology.
