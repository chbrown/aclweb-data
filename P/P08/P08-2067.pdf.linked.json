This paper considers a large class of similarity functions that can be expressed as an inner product of term weight vectors.","For document collections that fit into random-access memory, the solution is straightforward.

Although tailored implementations can be designed for specific parallel processing architectures, the MapReduce framework (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) offers an attractive solution to these challenges. In this paper, we describe how pairwise similarity computation for large collections can be efficiently implemented with MapReduce. We empirically demonstrate that removing high frequency (and therefore low entropy) terms results in approximately linear growth in required disk space and running time with increasing collection size for collections containing several hundred thousand documents."]},{"title":"2 MapReduce Framework","paragraphs":["MapReduce builds on the observation that many tasks have the same structure: a computation is applied over a large number of records (e.g., documents) to generate partial results, which are then aggregated in some fashion. Naturally, the per-record computation and aggregation vary by task, but the basic structure remains fixed. Taking inspiration from higher-order functions in functional programming, MapReduce provides an abstraction that in-volves the programmer defining a “mapper” and a “reducer”, with the following signatures: map: (k1, v1) → [(k2, v2)] reduce: (k2, [v2]) → [(k3, v3)]","Key/value pairs form the basic data structure in MapReduce. The “mapper” is applied to every input 265      Figure 1: Illustration of the MapReduce framework: the “mapper” is applied to all input records, which generates results that are aggregated by the “reducer”. key/value pair to generate an arbitrary number of intermediate key/value pairs. The “reducer” is applied to all values associated with the same intermediate key to generate output key/value pairs (see Figure 1).","On top of a distributed file system (Ghemawat et al., 2003), the runtime transparently handles all other aspects of execution (e.g., scheduling and fault tolerance), on clusters ranging from a few to a few thousand nodes. MapReduce is an attractive framework because it shields the programmer from distributed processing issues such as synchronization, data exchange, and load balancing."]},{"title":"3 Pairwise Document Similarity","paragraphs":["Our work focuses on a large class of document similarity metrics that can be expressed as an inner product of term weights. A document d is represented as a vector Wd of term weights wt,d, which indicate the importance of each term t in the document, ignoring the relative ordering of terms (“bag of words” model). We consider symmetric similarity measures defined as follows: sim(di, dj) = ∑ t∈V wt,di · wt,dj (1) where sim(di, dj) is the similarity between documents di and dj and V is the vocabulary set. In this type of similarity measure, a term will contribute to the similarity between two documents only if it has non-zero weights in both. Therefore, t ∈ V can be replaced with t ∈ di ∩ dj in equation 1.","Generalizing this to the problem of computing similarity between all pairs of documents, we note Algorithm 1 Compute Pairwise Similarity Matrix 1: ∀i, j : sim[i, j] ⇐ 0 2: for all t ∈ V do 3: pt ⇐ postings(t) 4: for all di, dj ∈ pt do 5: sim[i, j] ⇐ sim[i, j] + wt,di · wt,dj that a term contributes to each pair that contains it.2 For example, if a term appears in documents x, y, and z, it contributes only to the similarity scores between (x, y), (x, z), and (y, z). The list of documents that contain a particular term is exactly what is contained in the postings of an inverted index. Thus, by processing all postings, we can compute the entire pairwise similarity matrix by summing term contributions.","Algorithm 1 formalizes this idea: postings(t) denotes the list of documents that contain term t. For simplicity, we assume that term weights are also stored in the postings. For small collections, this algorithm can be run efficiently to compute the entire similarity matrix in memory. For larger collections, disk access optimization is needed—which is provided by the MapReduce runtime, without requiring explicit coordination.","We propose an efficient solution to the pairwise document similarity problem, expressed as two separate MapReduce jobs (illustrated in Figure 2):","1) Indexing: We build a standard inverted in-dex (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), where each term is associated with a list of docid’s for documents that contain it and the associated term weight. Mapping over all documents, the mapper, for each term in the document, emits the term as the key, and a tuple consisting of the docid and term weight as the value. The MapReduce runtime automatically handles the grouping of these tuples, which the reducer then writes out to disk, thus generating the postings.","2) Pairwise Similarity: Mapping over each posting, the mapper generates key tuples corresponding to pairs of docids in the postings: in total, 1","2 m(m−1) pairs where m is the posting length.

We used the AQUAINT-2 collection of newswire text, containing 906k documents, totaling approximately 2.5 gigabytes. Terms were stemmed.

Empirically, we find that running time increases linearly with collection size, which is an extremely desirable property. To get a sense of the space complexity, we compute the number of intermediate document pairs that are emitted by the mappers. The space savings are large (3.7 billion rather than 8.1 trillion intermediate pairs for the entire collection), and space requirements grow linearly with collection size over this region (R2","= 0.9975). 5 The entire collection was indexed in about 3.5 minutes. 267 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000","0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Corpus Size (%) I n t e r m e d i a t e  P a i r s  ( b i l l i o n s ) df-cut at 99% df-cut at 99.9% df-cut at 99.99% df-cut at 99.999% no df-cut Figure 4: Effect of changing df -cut thresholds on the number of intermediate document-pairs emitted, for subsets of AQUAINT-2."]},{"title":"5 Discussion and Future Work","paragraphs":["In addition to empirical results, it would be desirable to derive an analytical model of our algorithm’s complexity. Here we present a preliminary sketch of such an analysis and discuss its implications. The complexity of our pairwise similarity algorithm is tied to the number of document pairs that are emitted by the mapper, which equals the total number of products required in O(N 2",") inner products, where N is the collection size. This is equal to: 1 2 ∑ t∈V dft(dft − 1) (2) where dft is the document frequency, or equivalently the length of the postings for term t. Given that to-kens in natural language generally obey Zipf’s Law, and vocabulary size and collection size can be related via Heap’s Law, it may be possible to develop a closed form approximation to the above series.","Given the necessity of computing O(N 2",") inner products, it may come as a surprise that empirically our algorithm scales linearly (at least for the collection sizes we explored). We believe that the key to this behavior is our df-cut technique, which eliminates the head of the df distribution. In our case, eliminating the top 1% of terms reduces the number of document pairs by several orders of magnitude. However, the impact of this technique on effectiveness (e.g., in a query-by-example experiment) has not yet been characterized. Indeed, a df-cut threshold of 99% might seem rather aggressive, removing meaning-bearing terms such as “arthritis” and “Cornell” in addition to perhaps less problematic terms such as “sleek” and “frail.” But redundant use of related terms is common in news stories, which we would expect to reduce the adverse effect on many applications of removing these low entropy terms.","Moreover, as Figure 4 illustrates, relaxing the df-cut to a 99.9% threshold still results in approximately linear growth in the requirement for intermediate storage (at least over this region).6","In essence, optimizing the df-cut is an efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff that is best made in the context of a specific application. Finally, we note that alternative approaches to similar problems based on localitysensitive hashing (Andoni and Indyk, 2008) face similar tradeoffs in tuning for a particular false positive rate; cf. (Bayardo et al., 2007)."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We present a MapReduce algorithm for efficiently computing pairwise document similarity in large document collections.
