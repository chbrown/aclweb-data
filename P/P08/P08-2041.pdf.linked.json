Due to lack of generalization ability, the full matching strategy has some limitations. On one hand, the data sparseness problem is serious, especially when the amount of the bilingual data is limited. On the other hand, for a certain source text, the phrase table is redundant since most of the bilingual phrases cannot be fully matched.","In this paper, we address the problem of translation of unseen phrases, the source phrases that are not observed in the training corpus. The alignment template model (Och and Ney, 2004) enhanced phrasal generalizations by using words classes rather than the words themselves. But the phrases are overly generalized. The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005) used hierarchical phrase pairs to strengthen the generalization ability of phrases and allow long distance reorderings. However, the huge grammar table greatly increases computational complexity. Callison-Burch et al. (2006) used paraphrases of the trainig corpus for translating unseen phrases. But they only found and used the semantically similar phrases. Another method is to use multi-parallel corpora (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) to improve phrase coverage and translation quality.","This paper presents a partial matching strategy for translating unseen phrases. When encountering unseen phrases in a source sentence, we search partially matched phrase pairs from the phrase table. Then we keep the translations of the matched part and translate the unmatched part by word substitution. The advantage of our approach is that we alleviate the data sparseness problem without increasing the amount of bilingual corpus. Moreover, the partially matched phrases are not necessarily synonymous. We incorporate the partial matching method into the state-of-the-art PBSMT system, Moses. Experiments show that, our approach achieves statistically significant improvements not only on small corpus, but also on large corpus."]},{"title":"2 Partial Matching for PBSMT 2.1 Partial Matching","paragraphs":["We use matching similarity to measure how well the source phrases match each other. Given two source phrases f̃ J","1 and f̃ ′J","1 , the matching similarity is computed as: 161","","/P","","/N  /N","","/V","","/N issued warning to the American people","","/P","","/N  /N","","/V","","/N bring advantage to the Taiwan people Figure 1: An example of partially matched phrases with the same POS sequence and word alignment.","SIM ( f̃ J 1 , f̃ ′J","1 ) =","∑J j=1 δ(fj, f ′ j) J (1) where,","δ(f, f ′ ) = { 1 if f = f ′ 0 otherwise (2)","Therefore, partial matching takes full matching (SIM ( f̃ , f̄ ) = 1.0) as a special case. Note that in order to improve search efficiency, we only consider the partially matched phrases with the same length.","In our experiments, we use a matching threshold α to tune the precision of partial matching. Low threshold indicates high coverage of unseen phrases, but will suffer from much noise. In order to alleviate this problem, we search partially matched phrases under the constraint that they must have the same parts-of-speech (POS) sequence. See Figure 1 for illustration. Although the matching similarity of the two phrases is only 0.2, as they have the same POS sequence, the word alignments are the same. Therefore, the lower source phrase can be translated according to the upper phrase pair with correct word reordering. Furthermore, this constraint can sharply decrease the computational complexity since there is no need to search the whole phrase table.","2.2 Translating Unseen Phrases","We translate an unseen phrase f J","1 according to the","partially matched phrase pair (f ′J","1 , e′I","1, ã) as follows:","1. Compare each word between f J","1 and f ′J","1 to get the position set of the different words: P = {j|fj ̸= f ′ j, j = 1, 2, . . . , J };","2. Remove f ′ j from f ′J","1 and e′","aj from e′I 1, where j ∈ P ;","3. Find the translation e for fj(j ∈ P ) from the phrase table and put it into the position aj in e′I 1 according to the word alignment ã.","","","  ","","","","","  ","",""," arrived in Prague last evening","   arrived in arrived in Thailand yesterday Figure 2: An example of phrase translation.","Figure 2 shows an example. In fact, we create a translation template dynamically in step 2:","⟨","X1","","X2, arrived in X2 X1⟩ (3)","Here, on the source side, each of the non-terminal X corresponds to a single source word. In addition, the removed sub-phrase pairs should be consistent with the word alignment matrix.","Following conventional PBSMT models, we use 4 features to measure phrase translation quality: the translation weights p( f̃ |ẽ) and p(ẽ| f̃ ), the lexical weights pw( f̃ |ẽ) and pw(ẽ| f̃ ). The new constructed phrase pairs keep the translation weights of their “parent” phrase pair. The lexical weights are computed by word substitution. Suppose S{(f ′",", e′",")} is the pair set in ( f̃ ′",", ẽ′",",ã) which replaced by S{(f, e)} to create the new phrase pair ( f̃ ,ẽ,ã), the lexical weight is computed as: pw( f̃ |ẽ, ã) =","pw( f̃ ′ | ẽ′",", ã) × ∏ (f,e)∈S{(f,e)} pw(f |e) ∏","(f′",",e′",")∈S{(f′ ,e′",")} pw(f ′","|e′",") (4) Therefore, the newly constructed phrase pairs can be used for decoding as they have already existed in the phrase table.","2.3 Incorporating Partial Matching into the PBSMT Model In this paper, we incorporate the partial matching strategy into the state-of-the-art PBSMT system, Moses1",". Given a source sentence, Moses firstly uses the full matching strategy to search all possible translation options from the phrase table, and then uses a beam-search algorithm for decoding. 1 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 162 Therefore, we do incorporation by performing partial matching for phrase translation before decoding. The advantage is that the main search algorithm need not be changed.","For a source phrase f̃ , we search partially matched phrase pair ( f̃ ′",", ẽ′",", ã) from the phrase table. If SIM ( f̃ , f̃ ′",")=1.0, which means f̃ is observed in the training corpus, thus ẽ′","can be directly stored as a translation option. However, if α ≤ SIM ( f̃ , f̃ ′",") < 1.0, we construct translations for f̃ according to Sec-tion 2.2. Then the newly constructed translations are stored as translation options.","Moses uses translation weights and lexical weights to measure the quality of a phrase translation pair. For partial matching, besides these features, we add matching similarity SIM ( f̃ , f̃ ′",") as a new feature. For a source phrase, we select top N translations for decoding. In Moses, N is set by the pruning parameter ttable-limit."]},{"title":"3 Experiments","paragraphs":["We carry out experiments on Chinese-to-English translation on two tasks: Small-scale task, the training corpus consists of 30k sentence pairs (840K + 950K words); Large-scale task, the training corpus consists of 2.54M sentence pairs (68M + 74M words). The 2002 NIST MT evaluation test data is used as the development set and the 2005 NIST MT test data is the test set. The baseline system we used for comparison is the state-of-the-art PBSMT system, Moses.","We use the ICTCLAS toolkit2","to perform Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. The training script of Moses is used to train the bilingual corpus. We set the maximum length of the source phrase to 7, and record word alignment information in the phrase table. For the language model, we use the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 4-gram model on the Xinhua portion of the Gigaword corpus.","To run the decoder, we set ttable-limit=20, distortion-limit=6, stack=100. The translation quality is evaluated by BLEU-4 (case-sensitive). We perform minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) to tune the feature weights of the translation model to maximize the BLEU score on development set. 2 http://www.nlp.org.cn/project/project.php?proj id=6","α 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.3 0.1 BLEU 24.44 24.43 24.86 25.31 25.13 Table 1: Effect of matching threshold on BLEU score. 3.1 Small-scale Task Table 1 shows the effect of matching threshold on translation quality. The baseline uses full matching (α=1.0) for phrase translation and achieves a BLEU score of 24.44. With the decrease of the matching threshold, the BLEU scores increase. when α=0.3, the system obtains the highest BLEU score of 25.31, which achieves an absolute improvement of 0.87 over the baseline. However, if the threshold continue decreasing, the BLEU score decreases. The reason is that low threshold increases noise for partial matching.","The effect of matching threshold on the coverage of n-gram phrases is shown in Figure 3. When using full matching (α=1.0), long phrases (length≥3) face a serious data sparseness problem.

When α=1.0, the long phrases (length≥3) only account for 2.9% of the total phrases. When α=0.3, the number increases to 10.7%. Moreover, the total phrase of α=0.3 is less than that of α=1.0, since source text is segmented into more long phrases under partial matching, and most of the long phrases are translated from partially matched phrases (the row 0.3≤ SIM <1.0). 3.2 Large-scale Task For this task, the BLEU score of the baseline is 30.45.
