As well as being the most commonly used probabilistic models of parse trees, probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are the best understood. As shown in (Klein and Manning, 2003), the ability of PCFG models to disambiguate phrases crucially depends on the expressiveness of the symbolic backbone they use.","Treebank-specific heuristics have commonly been used both to alleviate inadequate independence assumptions stipulated by naive PCFGs (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000). Such methods stand in sharp contrast to partially supervised techniques that have recently been proposed to induce hidden grammatical representations that are finer-grained than those that can be read off the parsed sentences in tree-banks (Henderson, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Prescher, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).","∗","Part of this work was done when Gabriele Musillo was visiting the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, funded by a grant from the Swiss NSF (PBGE2-117146). Many thanks to Michael Collins and Xavier Carreras for their insightful comments on the work presented here.","This paper presents extensions of such grammar induction techniques to dependency grammars. Our extensions rely on transformations of dependency grammars into efficiently parsable context-free grammars (CFG) annotated with hidden symbols. Because dependency grammars are reduced to CFGs, any learning algorithm developed for PCFGs can be applied to them. Specifically, we use the Inside-Outside algorithm defined in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) to learn transformed dependency grammars annotated with hidden symbols. What distinguishes our work from most previous work on dependency parsing is that our models are not lexicalised. Our models are instead decorated with hidden symbols that are designed to capture both lexical and structural information relevant to accurate dependency parsing without having to rely on any explicit supervision."]},{"title":"2 Transforms of Dependency Grammars","paragraphs":["Contrary to phrase-structure grammars that stipulate the existence of phrasal nodes, dependency grammars assume that syntactic structures are connected acyclic graphs consisting of vertices representing terminal tokens related by directed edges representing dependency relations. Such terminal symbols are most commonly assumed to be words. In our unlexicalised models reported below, they are instead assumed to be part-of-speech (PoS) tags. A typical dependency graph is illustrated in Figure 1 below.","Various projective dependency grammars exemplify the concept of split bilexical dependency grammar (SBG) defined in (Eisner, 2000). 1","SBGs are 1 An SBG is a tuple ⟨V, W, L, R⟩ such that: 213 R1","root"," ","R1","root/R1 V BD","B"," R1 V BD","B  ","1r","V BD","B","R1 V BD","B /R1","IN","D"," R1 IN","D ","L1","V BD","B","0V BD","B Rp","V BD","B /R1","NNP","C","","1r","IN","D R1 IN D /R1","NN","F","","L1","V BD B \\L1","NNP","A ","1r","NNP","C 0IN","D 1r","NN","F  ","1l","NNP","A 0NNP","C L1 NN F","0NN","F","0NNP","A L1","NN","F \\L1","DT","E  1l DT","E","0DT E Nica hit Miles with the trumpet Figure 1: A projective dependency graph for the sentence Nica hit Miles with the trumpet paired with its second-order unlexicalised derivation tree annotated with hidden variables.","closely related to CFGs as they both define struc-","tures that are rooted ordered projective trees.

Let D =","⟨V, W, L, R⟩ be a SBG and G = ⟨N, W, P, S⟩ a","CFG.

The head index v decorating non-","terminals such as 1l","v, 1r","v, 0v, Lp","v and Rq","v can be com-","puted in O(1) given the left and right indices of the","sub-string wi,j they cover. 3","Observe, however, that","if 2l v or 2r","v derives wi,j, then v does not functionally","depend on either i or j. Because it is possible for the","head index v of 2l","v or 2r","v to vary from i to j, v has","to be tracked by the parser, resulting in an overall","O(n4",") time complexity.

We only detail the elimination of the symbols 2r","v.","The elimination of the 2l","v symbols can be derived","symmetrically. By construction, a 2r","v symbol is the","right successor of a non-terminal Rp u. Consequently,","2r","v can only occur in a derivation such as","α Rp","u β ⊢ α Rq u 2r","v β ⊢ α Rq","u 1r","v R1","v β.","To substitute for the problematic 2r","v non-terminal in","the above derivation, we derive the form Rq","u 1r","v R1","v","from Rp","u/R1","v R1 v where Rp","u/R1","v is a new non-","terminal whose right-hand side is Rq","u 1r","v.

The grammars described above can be further","transformed to capture linear second-order depen-","dencies involving three distinct head indices. A","second-order dependency structure is illustrated in","Figure 1 that involves two adjacent dependents,","Miles and with, of a single head, hit. To see how linear second-order dependencies can","be captured, consider the following derivation of a","sequence of right dependents of a head u:","α Rp","u/R1","v β ⊢ α Rq","u 1r","v β ⊢ α Rq","u/R1","w R1","w 1r","v β.","The form Rq","u/R1","w R1","w 1v mentions three heads: u","is the the head that governs both v and w, and w","precedes v. To encode the linear relationship be-","tween w and v, we redefine the right-hand side of","Rp","u/R1","v as Rq","u/R1","w ⟨R1","w, 1r","v⟩ and include the pro-","duction ⟨R1","w, 1r v⟩ → R1","w 1r","v in the productions.","The relationship between the dependents w and v of","the head u is captured, because Rp","u/R1","v jointly gen-","erates R1","w and 1r","v. 5","Any second-order grammar resulting from trans-","forming the derivations of right and left dependents","4","Symmetrically, the derivation α Lp","u β ⊢ α 2l","v Lq","u β ⊢","α L1","v 1l v Lq","u β involving the 2l","v symbol is transformed into","α Lp","u β ⊢ α L1","v Lp u\\L1","v β ⊢ α L1","v 1l","v Lq","u β.","5","Symmetrically, to transform the derivation of a sequence of","left dependents of u, we redefine the right-hand side of Lp","u\\L1","v","as ⟨1l","v, L1","w⟩ Lq u\\L1","w and include the production ⟨1l","v, L1","w⟩ → 1l v L1","w in the set of rules. in the way described above can be parsed in O(n3","), because the head indices decorating its symbols can be computed in O(1).","In the following section, we show how to enrich both our first-order and second-order grammars with hidden variables."]},{"title":"3 Hidden Variable Models","paragraphs":["Because they do not stipulate the existence of phrasal nodes, commonly used unlabelled dependency models are not sufficiently expressive to discriminate between distinct projections of a given head. Both our first-order and second-order grammars conflate distributionally distinct projections if they are projected from the same head. 6","To capture various distinct projections of a head, we annotate each of the symbols that refers to it with a unique hidden variable. We thus constrain the distribution of the possible values of the hidden variables in a linguistically meaningful way. Figure 1 illustrates such constraints: the same hidden variable B decorates each occurrence of the PoS tag VBD of the head hit.","Enforcing such agreement constraints between hidden variables provides a principled way to capture not only phrasal information but also lexical information. Lexical pieces of information conveyed by a minimal projection such as 0V BDB in Figure 1 will consistently be propagated through the derivation tree and will condition the generation of the right and left dependents of hit.","In addition, states such as p and q that decorate non-terminal symbols such as Rp","u or Lq","u can also capture structural information, because they can encode the most recent steps in the derivation history. In the models reported in the next section, these states are assumed to be hidden and a distribution over their possible values is automatically induced."]},{"title":"4 Empirical Work and Discussion","paragraphs":["The models reported below were trained, validated, and tested on the commonly used sections from the Penn Treebank.

CFGs extracted from such structures were then annotated with hidden variables encoding the constraints described in the previous section and trained until convergence by means of the Inside-Outside algorithm defined in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) and applied in (Matsuzaki et al., 2005). To efficiently decode our hidden variable models, we pruned the search space as in (Petrov et al., 2006). To evaluate the performance of our models, we report two of the standard measures: the per word and per sentence accuracy (McDonald, 2006).","Figures reported in the upper section of Table 1 measure the effect on accuracy of the transforms we designed. Our baseline first-order model (q = 1, h = 1) reaches a poor per word accuracy that suggests that information conveyed by bare PoS tags is not fine-grained enough to accurately predict dependencies. Results reported in the second line shows that modelling adjacency relations between dependents as second-order models do is relevant to accuracy. The third line indicates that annotating both the states and the PoS tags of a first-order model with two hidden values is sufficient to reach a performance comparable to the one achieved by a naive second-order model. However, comparing the results obtained by our best first-order models to the accuracy achieved by our best second-order model conclusively shows that first-order models exploit such dependencies to a much lesser extent. Overall, such results provide a first solution to the problem left open in (Johnson, 2007) as to whether second-order transforms are relevant to parsing accuracy or not.","The lower section of Table 1 reports the results achieved by our best model on the test data set and compare them both to those obtained by the only unlexicalised dependency model we know of (Eisner and Smith, 2005) and to those achieved by the state-of-the-art dependency parser in (McDonald, 2006). While clearly not state-of-the-art, the performance achieved by our best model suggests that massive lexicalisation of dependency models might not be necessary to achieve competitive performance. Future work will lie in investigating the issue of lexicalisation in the context of dependency parsing by weakly lexicalising our hidden variable models."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Eugene Charniak. 2000.
