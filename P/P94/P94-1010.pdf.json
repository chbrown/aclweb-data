We also evaluate the system's performance, taking into account the fact that people often do not agree on a single segmentation."]},{"title":"THE PROBLEM","paragraphs":["The initial step of any text analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words. For many writing systems, using whitespace as a delimiter for words yields reasonable results. However, for Chinese and other systems where whitespace is not used to delimit words, such trivial schemes will not work. Chinese writing is morphosyllabic (DeFrancis, 1984), meaning that each hanzi- 'Chinese character' - (nearly always) represents a single syllable that is (usually) also a single morpheme. Since in Chinese, as in English, words may be polysyllabic, and since hanzi are written with no intervening spaces, it is not trivial to reconstruct which hanzi to group into words.","While for some applications it may be possible to bypass the word-segmentation problem and work straight from hanzi, there are several reasons why this approach will not work in a text-to-speech (TI'S) system for Mandarin Chinese -- the primary intended application of our segmenter. These reasons include:","1. Many hanzi are homographs whose pronunciation depends upon word affiliation. So, ~ is pronounced deO ~ when it is a prenominal modification marker, but di4 in the word [] ~ mu4di4 'goal'; ~ is normally ganl 'dry',but qian2 in a person's given name.","2. Some phonological rules depend upon correct word-segmentation, including Third Tone Sandhi (Shih, 1986), which changes a 3 tone into a 2 tone be-fore another 3 tone: ,J~]~ xiao3 [lao3 shu3] 'lit-","t We use pinyin transliteration with numbers representing tones. 66 tie rat', becomes xiao3 [ lao2-shu3 ], rather than xiao2 [ lao2-shu3 ], because the rule first applies within the word lao3-shu3, blocking its phrasal application.","While a minimal requirement for building a Chinese word-segmenter is a dictionary, a dictionary is in-sufficient since there are several classes of words that are not generally found in dictionaries. Among these: I. Morphologically Derived Words: PJ~l~f{l xiao3jiang4-menO (little general-plural) 'little generals'. 2. Personal Names: ~,~ zhoul enl-lai2 'Zhou Enlai'. 3. Transliterated Foreign Names: ~i~::,,~ bu4lang 3-shi4-wei2-ke4 'Brunswick'.","We present a stochastic finite-state model for segmenting Chinese text into dictionary entries and words derived via the above-mentioned productive processes; as part of the treatment of personal names, we discuss a class-based model which uses the Good-Turing method to estimate costs of previously unseen personal names. The segmenter handles the grouping of hanzi into words and outputs word pronunciations, with default pronunciations for hanzi it cannot group; we focus here primarily on the system's ability to segment text appropriately (rather than on its pronunciation abilities). We evaluate various specific aspects of the segmentation, and provide an evaluation of the overall segmentation performance: this latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges, since even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text,"]},{"title":"PREVIOUS WORK","paragraphs":["There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation: recent reviews include (Wang et al., 1990; Wu and Tseng, 1993). Roughly, previous work can be classified into purely statistical approaches (Sproat and Shih, 1990), statistical approaches which incorporate lexical knowledge (Fan and Tsai, 1988; Lin et al., 1993), and approaches that include lexical knowledge combined with heuristics (Chen and Liu, 1992).","Chert and Liu's (1992) algorithm matches words of an input sentence against a dictionary; in cases where various parses are possible, a set of heuristics is applied to disambiguate the analyses. Various morphological rules are then applied to allow for morphologically complex words that are not in the dictionary.

To this end, we picked 100 sentences at random containing 4372 total"]},{"title":"hanzi","paragraphs":["from a test corpus. We asked six native speakers -- three from Taiwan (T1-T3), and three from the Mainland (M1-M3) -- to segment the corpus. Since we could not bias the subjects towards a particular segmentation and did not presume linguistic sophistication on their part, the instructions were simple: subjects were to mark all places they might plausibly pause if they were reading the text aloud. An examination of the subjects' bracketings confirmed that these instructions were satisfactory in yielding plausible word-sized units.","Various segmentation approaches were then compared with human performance: 1. A greedy algorithm, GR: proceed through the sentence, taking the longest match with a dictionary entry at each point. 2. An 'anti-greedy' algorithm, AG: instead of the longest match, take the shortest match at each point. 3. The method being described -- henceforth ST. Two measures that can be used to compare judgments are:","1. Precision. For each pair of judges consider one judge as the standard, computing the precision of the other's judgments relative to this standard.","2. Recall. For each pair of judges, consider one judge as the standard, computing the recall of the other's judgments relative to this standard. Obviously, for judges J1 and J2, taking ,/1 as standard and computing the precision and recall for J2 yields the same results as taking J2 as the standard, and computing for Jr, respectively, the recall and precision. We therefore used the arithmetic mean of each interjudge precision-recall pair as a single measure of interjudge similarity. Table 2 shows these similarity measures. The average agreement among the human judges is .76, and the average agreement between ST and the humans is .75, or about 99% of the inter-human agreement. (GR is .73 or 96%.) One can better visualize the precision-recall similarity matrix by produc-ing from that matrix a distance matrix, computing a multidimensional scaling on that distance matrix, and plotting the first two most significant dimensions. The result of this is shown in Figure 4. In addition to the automatic methods, AG, GR and ST, just discussed, we also added to the plot the values for the current algorithm"]},{"title":"using only dictionary entries","paragraphs":["(i.e., no productively derived words, or names). This is to allow for fair comparison between the statistical method, and GR, which is also purely dictionary-based. As can be seen, GR and this 'pared-down' statistical method perform quite similarly, though the statistical method is still slightly better. AG clearly performs much less like humans than these methods, whereas the full statistical algorithm, including morphological derivatives and names, performs most closely to humans among the automatic methods. It can be also seen clearly in this plot, two of the Taiwan speakers cluster very closely together, and the third Taiwan speaker is also close in the most significant dimension (the z axis). Two of the Mainlanders also cluster close together but, interestingly, not particularly close to the Taiwan speakers; the third Mainlander is much more similar to the Taiwan speakers.

However, we have reason to doubt Chang et al.'s performance claims. Without using the same test corpus, direct comparison is obviously difficult; fortunately Chang et al. included a list of about 60 example sentence fragments that exemplified various categories of performance for their system. The performance of our system on those sentences appeared rather better than theirs. Now, on a set of 11 sentence fragments where they reported 100% recall and precision for name identification, we had 80% precision and 73% recall. However, they listed two sets, one consisting of 28 fragments and the other of 22 fragments in which they had 0% precision and recall. On the first of these our system had 86% precision and 64% recall; on the second it had 19% precision and 33% recall.
