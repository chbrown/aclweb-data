The method operates via the computation of substring expectations, which in turn is accomplished by solving systems of linear equations derived from the grammar. The procedure is fully implemented and has proved viable and useful in practice."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Probabilistic language modeling with n-gram grammars (particularly bigram and trigram) has proven extremely useful for such tasks as automated speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and word-sense disambiguation, and lead to simple, efficient algorithms. Unfortunately, working with these grammars can be problematic for several reasons: they have large numbers of parameters, so reliable estimation requires a very large training corpus and/or sophisticated smoothing techniques (Church and Gale, 1991); it is very hard to directly model linguistic knowledge (and thus these grammars are practically incomprehensible to human inspec-tion); and the models are not easily extensible, i.e., if a new word is added to the vocabulary, none of the information contained in an existing n-gram will tell anything about the n-grams containing the new item. Stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), on the other hand, are not as susceptible to these problems: they have many fewer parameters (so can be reasonably trained with smaller corpora); they capture linguistic generalizations, and are easily understood and written, by linguists; and they can be extended straightforwardly based on the underlying linguistic knowledge.","In this paper, we present a technique for computing an n-gram grammar from an existing SCFG--an attempt to get the best of both worlds. Besides developing the mathematics involved in the computation, we also discuss efficiency and implementation issues, and briefly report on our experience confirming its practical feasibility and utility.","The technique of compiling higher-level grammatical models into lower-level ones has precedents: Zue et al. (1991) report building a word-pair grammar from more elaborate language models to achieve good coverage, by random generation of sentences. In our own group, the current approach was predated by an alternative one that essentially relied on approximating bigram probabilities through Monte-Carlo sampling from SCFGs."]},{"title":"PRELIMINARIES","paragraphs":["An n-gram grammar is a set of probabilities P(w,~lWlW2...wn_a), giving the probability that wn follows a word string Wl w2... wn-1, for each possible combination of the w's in the vocabulary of the language. So for a 5000 word vocabulary, a bigram grammar would have approximately 5000 x 5000 = 25,000,000 free parameters, and a trigram grammar would have ~ 125,000,000,000. This is what we mean when we say n-gram grammars have many parameters.","A SCFG is a set of phrase-structure rules, annotated with probabilities of choosing a certain production given the lefthand side nonterminal. For example, if we have a simple CFG, we can augment it with the probabilities specified: S --+ NPVP [1.0] NP --+ N [0.4] N P -+ Det N [0.6] VP --+ V [0.8] V P --+ V UP [0.2] Det --~ the [0.4] Det --+ a [0.6] N ~ book [1.0] V --+ close [0.3] V ~ open [0.7]","The language this grammar generates contains 5 words.

A trigram grammar would come with (5 x 6 + 1) x 5 = 155 parameters. Yet, the above SCFG has only 10 probabilities, only 4 of which are free parameters. The divergence between these two types of models generally grows as the vocabulary size increases, although this depends on the productions in the SCFG.","The reason for this discrepancy, of course, is that the"]},{"title":"struc- ture","paragraphs":["of the SCFG itself is a discrete (hyper-)parameter with a lot of potential variation, but one that has been fixed beforehand. The point is that such a structure is comprehensible by humans, and can in many cases be constrained using prior knowledge, thereby reducing the estimation problem for the remaining probabilities. The problem of estimating SCFG parameters from data is solved with standard techniques, usually by way of likelihood maximization and a variant of the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm (Baker, 1979). A tutorial introduction to SCFGs and standard algorithms can be found in Jelinek et al. (1992). MOTIVATION There are good arguments that SCFGs are in principle not adequate probabilistic models for natural languages, due to the conditional independence assumptions they embody (Magerman and Marcus, 1991; Jones and Eisner, 1992; Briscoe and Carroll, 1993). Such shortcomings can be partly remedied by using SCFGs with very specific, semantically oriented categories and rules (Jurafsky et al., 1994). If the goal is to use n-grams nevertheless, then their their computation from a more constrained SCFG is still useful since the results can be interpolated with raw n-gram estimates for smoothing. An experiment illustrating this approach is reported later in the paper.","On the other hand, even if vastly more sophisticated language models give better results, r~-grams will most likely still be important in applications such as speech recognition. The standard speech decoding technique of framesynchronous dynamic programming (Ney, 1984) is based on a first-order Markov assumption, which is satisfied by bigrams models (as well as by Hidden Markov Models), but not by more complex models incorporating non-local or higher-order constraints (including SCFGs). A standard approach is therefore to use simple language models to generate a preliminary set of candidate hypotheses. These hypotheses, e.g., represented as word lattices or N-best lists (Schwartz and Chow, 1990), are re-evaluated later using additional criteria that can afford to be more costly due to the more constrained outcomes. In this type of setting, the techniques developed in this paper can be used to compile probabilistic knowledge present in the more elaborate language models into n-gram estimates that improve the quality of the hypotheses generated by the decoder.","Finally, comparing directly estimated, reliable n-grams with those compiled from other language models is a potentially useful method for evaluating the models in question.","For the purpose of this paper, then, we assume that computing n-grams from SCFGs is of either practical or theoretical interest and concentrate on the computational aspects of the problem.","It should be noted that there are alternative, unrelated methods for addressing the problem of the large parameter space in n-gram models. For example, Brown et al. (1992) describe an approach based on grouping words into classes, thereby reducing the number of conditional probabilities in the model.

Any CFG or SCFG can be converted into one in CNF which generates exactly the same language, each of the sentences with exactly the same probability, and for which any parse in the original grammar would be reconstructible from a parse in the CNF grammar. In short, we can, without loss of generality, assume that the SCFGs we are dealing with are in CNF. In fact, our algorithm generalizes straightforwardly to the more general Canonical Two-Form (Graham et al., 1980) format, and in the case of bigrams (n =- 2) it can even be modified to work directly for arbitrary SCFGs.

An early prototype of BeRP was used in an experiment to assess the benefit of using bigram probabilities obtained through SCFGs versus estimating them directly from the available training corpus. 4 The system's domain are inquiries about restaurants in the city of Berkeley. The training corpus used had only 2500 sentences, with an average length of about 4.8 words/sentence.","Our experiments made use of a context-free grammar hand-written for the BeRP domain. With 1200 rules and a vocabulary of 1 I00 words, this grammar was able to parse 60% of the training corpus. Computing the bigram probabilities from this SCFG takes about 24 hours on a SPARCstation 2-class machine. 5","In experiment 1, the recognizer used bigrams that were estimated directly from the training corpus, without any smoothing, resulting in a word error rate of 35.1%. In experiment 2, a different set of bigram probabilities was used, computed from the context-free grammar, whose probabilities had previously been estimated from the same training corpus, using standard EM techniques. This resulted in a word error rate of 35.3%. This may seem surprisingly good given the low coverage of the underlying CFGs, but notice that the conversion into bigrams is bound to result in a less constraining language model, effectively increasing coverage.","Finally, in experiment 3, the bigrams generated from the SCFG were augmented by those from the raw training data, in a proportion of 200,000 : 2500. We have not attempted to optimize this mixture proportion, e.g., by deleted interpola-tion (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980). 6 With the bigram estimates thus obtained, the word error rate dropped to 33.5%. (All error rates were measured on a separate test corpus.)","The experiment therefore supports our earlier argument that more sophisticated language models, even if far from perfect, can improve n-gram estimates obtained directly from sample data.","4Corpus and grammar sizes, as well as the recognition performance figures reported here are not up-to-date with respect to the latest version of BeRP. For ACL-94 we expect to have revised results available that reflect the current performance of the system.","5Unlike the rest of BeRP, this computation is implemented in Lisp/CLOS and could be speeded up considerably if necessary.","6This proportion comes about because in the original system, predating the method described in this paper, bigrams had to be estimated from the SCFG by random sampling. Generating 200,000 sentence samples was found to give good converging estimates for the bigrams. The bigrams from the raw training sentences were then simply added to the randomly generated ones. We later verified that the bigrams estimated from the SCFG were indeed identical to the ones computed directly using the method described here."]},{"title":"CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["We. have described an algorithm to compute in closed form the distribution of n-grams for a probabilistic language given by a stochastic context-free grammar. Our method is based on computing substring expectations, which can be expressed as systems of linear equations derived from the grammar. The algorithm was used successfully and found to be practical in dealing with context-free grammars and bigram models for a medium-scale speech recognition task, where it helped to improve bigram estimates obtained from relatively small amounts of data.","Deriving n-gram probabilities from more sophisticated language models appears to be a generally useful technique which can both improve upon direct estimation of n-grams, and allow available higher-level linguistic knowledge to be effectively integrated into the speech decoding task."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","paragraphs":["Dan Jurafsky wrote the BeRP grammar, carried out the recognition experiments, and was generally indispensable.

This is a rather striking manifestation of the failure of this grammar, for p < 0.5, to be consistent. A grammar is said to be inconsistent if the underlying stochastic derivation process has non-zero probability of not terminating (Booth and Thompson, 1973). The expected length of the generated strings should therefore be infinite in this case.","Fortunately, Booth and Thompson derive a criterion for checking the consistency of a SCFG: Find the first-order expectancy matrix E = (exy), where exy is the expected number of occurrences of nonterminal Y in a one-step expansion of nonterminal X, and make sure its powers E k 78 converge to 0 as k ~ oe.
