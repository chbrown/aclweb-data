Grover©ed. ac. uk Abstract We describe an implementation in Carpenter's typed feature formalism, ALE, of a discourse grammar of the kind proposed by Scha, Polanyi, et al. We examine their method for resolving parallelism-dependent anaphora and show that there is a coherent feature-structural rendition of this type of grammar which uses the operations of prwrity union and generalization. We describe an augmentation of the ALE system to encompass these operations and we show that an appropriate choice of definition for priority union gives the desired multiple output for examples of vP-ellipsis which exhibit a strict/sloppy ambiguity. 1 Discourse Grammar Working broadly within the sign-based paradigm exemplified by HPSG (Pollard and Sag in press) we have been exploring computational issues for a discourse level grammar by using the ALE system (Carpenter 1993) to implement a discourse grammar. Our central model of a discourse grammar is the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) most often associated with Scha, Polanyi, and their coworkers (Polanyi and Scha 1984, Scha and Polanyi 1988, Priist 1992, and most recently in Priist, Scha and van den Berg 1994). In LDM rules are defined which are, in a broad sense, unification grammar rules and which combine discourse constituent units (DCUS). These are simple clauses whose syntax and underresolved semantics have been determined by a sentence grammar but whose fully resolved final form can only be calculated by their integration into the current discourse and its context. The rules of the discourse grammar act to establish the rhetorical relations between constituents and to perform resolution of those anaphors whose interpretation can be seen as a function of discourse coherence (as opposed to those whose interpretation relies on general knowledge). For illustrative purposes, we focus here on Prfist's rules for building one particular type of rhetorical relation, labelled \"list\" (Priist 1992). His central thesis is that for DCUs to be combined into a list they must exhibit a degree of syntactic-semantic parallelism and that this parallelism will strongly determine the way in which some kinds of anaphor are resolved. The clearest example of this is vP-ellipsis as in (la) but Priist also claims that the subject and object pronouns in (lb) and (lc) are parallelism-dependent anaphors when they occur in list structures and must therefore be resolved to the corresponding fully referential subject/object in the first member of the list. (1) a. Hannah likes beetles. So does Thomas. b. Hannah likes beetles. She also likes","caterpillars. c. Hannah likes beetles. Thomas hates","them. (2) is Priist's list construction rule. It is intended to capture the idea that a list can be constructed out of two DCUs, combined by means of connectives such as and and or. The categories in Priist's rules have features associated with them. In (2) these features are sere (the unresolved semantic interpretation of the category), consem (the contextually resolved semantic interpretation), and schema (the semantic information that is common between the daughter categories).","(2) list [sere: el T~ ((Cl ¢'$2) RS2),","schema : C1 ¢ $2] ----4 DCUI [ sem : Sl,consem : C1] + DCU2 [sere : ~S2,consem : ((Cl ~'$2) ~$2)]","Conditions:","C1 $2 is a characteristic generalization of C1","and S~; R E {and, or .... }. Priist calls the operation used to calculate the value for schema the most specific common denominator (MSCD, indicated by the symbol ¢). The MSCD of C1 and $2 is defined as the most specific generalization of C1 that can unify with 5'2. It is essential that the result should be contentful to a degree that confirms that the list structure is an appropriate analysis, and to this end Pr/ist imposes the condition that the value of schema should 17 be a"]},{"title":"characteristic generalization","paragraphs":["of the information contributed by the two daughters. There is no formal definition of this notion; it would require knowledge from many sources to determine whether sufficient informativeness had been achieved. However, assuming that this condition is met, Priist uses the common information as a source for resolution of underspecified elements in the second daughter by encoding as the value of the second daughter's consem the unification of the result of MSCD with its pre-resolved semantics (the formula ((Ca / $2) Iq $2)). So in Priist's rule the MSCD operation plays two distinct roles, first as a test for parallelism (as the value of the mother's schema) and second as a basis for resolution (in the composite operation which is the value of the second daughter's consem). There are certain problems with MSCD which we claim stem from this attempt to use one operation for two purposes, and our primary concern is to find alternative means of achieving Prfist's intended analysis."]},{"title":"2 An ALE Discourse","paragraphs":["Grammar For our initial exploration into using ALE for discourse grammars we have developed a small discourse grammar whose lexical items are complete sentences (to circumvent the need for a sentence grammar) and which represents the semantic content of sentences using feature structures of type"]},{"title":"event","paragraphs":["whose sub-types are indicated in the following part of the type hierarchy: event"]},{"title":"(3) agentive","paragraphs":["plus_patient prop-art emot-att action believe assume like hate kick catch In addition we have a very simplified semantics of noun phrases where we encode them as of type"]},{"title":"entity","paragraphs":["with the subtypes indicated below: (4) entity animate human animal female male insect"]},{"title":"..4\"-.,","paragraphs":["hannah jessy thomas sam brother beetle bee caterpillar Specifications of which features are appropriate for which type give us the following representations of the semantic content of the discourse units in (1): (5) a."]},{"title":"Hannah likes beetles [ AGENT hannah ]","paragraphs":["PATIENT"]},{"title":"beetle like b.

We use a definition of priority union provided by Carpenter (1994) (although note that his name for the operation is \"credulous default unification\"). It is discussed in more detail in Section 3. The priority union of a target T and a source S is defined as a two step process: first calculate a maximal feature structure S' such that S' E S, and then unify the new feature structure with T. This is very similar to PriJst's composite operation but there is a significant difference, however. For Priist there is a requirement that there should always be a unique MSCD since he also uses MSCD to calculate the common ground as a test for parallelism and there must only be one result for that purpose. By contrast, we have taken Carpenter's definition of credulous default unification and this can return more than one result. We have strong reasons for choosing this definition even though Carpenter does define a \"skeptical default unification\" operation which returns only one result. Our reasons for preferring the credulous version arise from examples of vP-ellipsis which exhibit an ambiguity whereby both a \"strict\" and a \"sloppy\" reading are possible. For example, the second sentence in (14) has two possible readings which can be glossed as \"Hannah likes Jessy's brother\" (the strict reading) and \"Hannah likes her own brother\" (the sloppy reading). (14) Jessy likes her brother. So does Hannah. The situations where the credulous version of the operation will return more than one result arise from structure sharing in the defeasible feature structure and it turns out that these are exactly the places where we would need to get more than one result in order to get the strict/sloppy ambiguities.

DSP gives an equational characterization of the problem of vp-ellipsis where the interpretation of the target phrase follows from an initial step of solving an equation with respect to the source phrase. If a function can be found such that applying that function to the source subject results in the source interpretation, then an application of that function to the target subject will yield the resolved interpretation for the target. The method for solving such equations is \"higher order unification\". (16) shows all the components of the interpretation of the example in (11). 20 (16) Hannah likes beetles. So does Thomas. Source: Target (T): Equation: Solution: Apply to T: like(hannah, beetle)","P ( thomas )","P ( hannah ) = like(hannah, beetle)","P = ~x.like(x, beetle)","like(thomas, beetle) A prerequisite to the DSP procedure is the establishment of parallelism between source and target and the identification of parallel subparts. For example, for (16) it is necessary both that the two clauses Hannah likes beetles and So does Thomas should be parallel and that the element hannah should be identified as a parallel element. DSP indicate parallel elements in the source by means of underlines as shown in (16). An underlined element in the source is termed a 'primary occurrence' and DSP place a constraint on solutions to equations requiring that primary occurrences be abstracted. Without the identification of hannah as a primary occurrence in (16), other equations deriving from the source might be possible, for example (17) : (17) a. P(beetle) = like(hannah, beetle) b. P(like) = like(hannah, beetle) The DSP analysis of our strict/sloppy example in (14) is shown in (18). The ambiguity follows from the fact that there are two possible solutions to the equation on the source: the first solution involves abstraction of just the primary occurrence ofjessy, while the second solution involves abstraction of both the primary and the secondary occurrences. When applied to the target these solutions yield the two different interpretations: (18) Jessy Source: Target: Equation: Sol.1 ($1): Sol.2 (S2): Apply SI: Apply $2: likes her brother. So does Hannah. like(jessy, brother-of (jessy) ) P( hannah ) P(jessy) = like(jessy, brother-of (jessy) ) P = ~x.like(x, brother-of(jessy)) e = Ax.like(x, brother-of(x)) like(hannah, brother-of (jessy) ) like(hannah, brother-of(hannah)) DSP claim that a significant attribute of their account is that they can provide the two readings in strict/sloppy ambiguities without having to postulate ambiguity in the source. They claim this as a virtue which is matched by few other accounts of vP-ellipsis. We have shown here, however, that an account which uses priority union also has no need to treat the source as ambiguous. Our results and DSP's also converge where the treatment of cascaded ellipsis is concerned. For the example in (19) both accounts find six readings although two of these are either extremely implausible or even impossible. (19) John revised his paper before the teacher did, and Bill did too. DSP consider ways of reducing the number of readings and, similarly, we are currently exploring a potential solution whereby some of the reentrancies in the source are required to be transmitted to the result of priority union. There are also similarities between our account and the DSP account with respect to the establishment of parallelism. In the DSP analysis the determination of parallelism is separate from and a prerequisite to the resolution of ellipsis. However, they do not actually formulate how parallelism is to be determined. In our modification of Prfist's account we have taken the same step as DSP in that we separate out the part of the feature structure used to determine parallelism from the part used to resolve ellipsis. In the general spirit of Priist's analysis, however, we have taken one step further down the line towards determining parallelism by postulating that calculating the generalization of the source and target is a first step towards showing that parallelism exists. The further condition that Prfist imposes, that the common ground should be a characteristic generalization, would conclude the establishment of parallelism. We are currently not able to define the notion of characteristic generalization, so like DSP we do not have enough in our theory to fully implement the parallelism requirement. In contrast to the DSP account, however, our feature structural approach does not involve us having to explicitly pair up the component parts of source and target, nor does it require us to distinguish primary from secondary occurrences. 2.4 Parallelism In the DSP approach to vP-ellipsis and in our approach too, the emphasis has been on semantic parallelism. It has often been pointed out, however, that there can be an additional requirement of syntactic parallelism (see for example, Kehler 1993 and Asher 1993). Kehler (1993) provides a useful discussion of the issue and argues convincingly that whether syntactic parallelism is required depends on the coherence relation involved. As the examples in (20) and (21) demonstrate, semantic parallelism is sufficient to establish a relation like contrast but it is not sufficient for building a coherent list. (20) The problem was looked into by John, but no-one else did. (21) *This problem was looked into by John, and Bill did too. For a list to be well-formed both syntactic and semantic parallelism are required: 21 (22) John looked into this problem, and Bill did too. In the light of Kehler's claims, it would seem that a more far-reaching implementation of our priority union account would need to specify how the constraint of syntactic parallelism might be implemented for those constructions which require it. An nPSG-style sign, containing as it does all types of linguistic information within the same feature structure, would lend itself well to an account of syntactic parallelism. If we consider that the DTRS feature in the sign for the source clause contains the entire parse tree including the node for the vP which is the syntactic antecedent, then ways to bring together the source vP and the target begin to suggest themselves. We have at our disposal both unification to achieve re-entrancy and the op-tion to use priority union over syntactic subparts of the sign. In the light of this, we are confident that it would be possible to articulate a more elaborate account of vp-ellipis within our framework and that priority union would remain the operation of choice to achieve the resolution. 3 Extensions to ALE In the previous sections we showed that Prfist's MSCD operation would more appropriately be replaced by the related operations of generalization and priority union. We have added generalization and priority union to the ALE system and in this section we discuss our implementation. We have provided the new operations as a complement to the definite clause component of ALE. We chose this route because we wanted to give the grammar writer explicit control of the point at which the operations were invoked. ALE adopts a simple eROLOG-like execution strategy rather than the more sophisticated control schemes of systems like CUF and TFS (Manandhar 1993). In principle it might be preferable to allow the very general deduction strategies which these other systems support, since they have the potential to support a more declarative style of grammar-writing. Unfortunately, priority union is a non-monotonic operation, and the consequences of embedding such operations in a system providing for flexible execution strategies are largely unexplored. At least at the outset it seems preferable to work within a framework in which the grammar writer is required to take some of the responsibility for the order in which operations are carried out. Ultimately we would hope that much of this load could be taken by the system, but as a tool for exploration ALE certainly suffices."]},{"title":"3.1 Priority Union in","paragraphs":["ALE We use the following definition of priority union, based on Carpenter's definition of credulous default unification: (23) punion(T,S) = {unify(T,S') IS' K S is maximal such that unify(T,S') is defined} punion(T,S) computes the priority union oft (target; the strict feature structure) with S (source; the defeasible feature structure).

We collect answers in the order in which the search comes upon them and carry out subsumption checks to ensure that all the answers which will be returned are maximal. These checks reduce to checks on subset inclusion, which can be reasonably efficient with suitable set representations. Consistency checking is straightforward because the ALE system manages type information in a manner which is largely transparent to the user. Unification of ALE terms is defined in such a way that if adding a feature to a term results in a term of a new type, then the representation of the structure is specialized to reflect this. Since priority union is non-deterministic we will finish with a set of maximal consistent subsets. Each of these subsets can be converted directly into ALE terms using ALE's built-in predicate add_to/5. The resulting set of ALE terms is the (disjunctive) result of priority union. In general we expect priority union to be a computationally expensive operation, since we cannot exclude pathological cases in which the system has to search an exponential number of subsets in the search for the maximal consistent elements which are required. In the light of this it is fortunate that our current discourse grammars do not require frequent use of priority union.

We also reported on a resolution mechanism for verb phrase ellipsis which yields sloppy and strict readings through priority union, and we claimed some advantages of this approach over the use of higher-order unification. The outstanding unsolved problem is that of establishing parallelism. While we believe that generalization is an appropriate formal operation to assist in this, we still stand in dire need of a convincing criterion for judging whether the generalization of two categories is sufficiently informative to successfully establish parMlelism."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported by the EC-funded project LRE-61-062 \"Towards a Declarative Theory of Discourse\" and a longer version of the paper is available in Brew et al (1994).
