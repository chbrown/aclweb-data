In particular, the introduction of relational constraints allows one to capture the effects of (recursive) lexical rules in a computationally attractive manner. We illustrate the linguistic merits of the new approach by showing how it accounts for the syntax of Dutch cross-serial dependencies and the position and scope of adjuncts in such constructions. Delayed evaluation is used to process grammars containing recursive constraints. 1 Introduction Combinations of Categorial Grammar (co) and unification naturally lead to the introduction of polymorphic categories.

For intransitive verbs one needs the constraint that (arg agr) = Agr (where Agr is some agreement value), for transitive verbs that (val arg agr) = Agr, and for ditransitive verbs that (val val arg agr) = Agr. The generalization is captured using the recursive constraint sv_agreement (2). In (2) and below, we use definite clauses to define lexical entries and constraints. Note that lexical entries relate words to feature structures that are defined indirectly as a combination of simple constraints (evaluated by means of unification) and recursive constraints. 1","(2) lex(walks, X) :-","iv(X),","sv_agreement( sg3 , X).","lex(kisses, X) :-"]},{"title":"tv(X),","paragraphs":["sv_agreement( sg3 , X). sv-agreement(Agr' [ cat np ] agr Agr \\S).","sv_agreement( Agr , Y\\X ) :- sv_agreement( Agr , X).","Relational constraints can also be used to capture the effect of lexical rules. In a lexicalist theory such as cG, in which syntactic rules are considered to be universally valid scheme's of functor-argument combination, lexical rules are an essential tool for capturing language-specific generalizations. As Carpenter (1991) observes, some of the rules that have been proposed must be able to operate recursively. Predicative forma-tion in English, for instance, uses a lexical rule turning a category reducible to vP into a category reducing to a vP-modifier (vP\\vP). As a vP-modifier is reducible to vP, the rule can (and sometimes must) be applied recursively. 2.2 Adjuncts as arguments Miller (1992) proposes a lexical rule for French nouns which adds an (modifying) adjective to the list of arguments that the noun subcategorizes for. Since a noun 1We use X/Y and Y\\X as shorthand for dir '/' arg Y and dir ' , respectively and S, NP, and Adj as 'typed","arg Y variables' of type [ cats ], [ cat np ], and [ cat adj ], respectively. can be modified by any number of adjectives, the rule must be optional as well as recursive. The advantages of using a lexical rule in this case is that it simplifies accounting for agreement between nouns and adjectives and that it enables an account of word order constraints between arguments and modifiers of a noun in terms of obliqueness.","The idea that modifiers are introduced by means of a lexical rule can be extended to verbs. That is, adjuncts could be introduced by means of a recursive rule that optionally adds these elements to verbal categories. Such a rule would be an alternative for the standard categorial analysis of adjuncts as (endocentric) functors. There is reason to consider this alternative.","In Dutch, for instance, the position of verb modifiers is not fixed. Adjuncts can in principle occur anywhere to the left of the verb: 2 (3) a. dat Johan opzettelijk een ongeluk that J.","deliberately an accident veroorzaakt causes"]},{"title":"that","paragraphs":["J. deliberately causes an accident","b. dat Johan Marie opzettelijk that J. M. deliberately geen cadeau geeft no present gives"]},{"title":"that","paragraphs":["J. deliberately gave M. no present","There are several ways to account for this fact. One can assign multiple categories to adjuncts or one can assign a polymorphic category x/x to adjuncts, with x restricted to 'verbal projections' (Bouma, 1988).","Alternatively, one can assume that adjuncts are not functors, but arguments of the verb. Since adjuncts are optional, can be iterated, and can occur in several positions, this implies that verbs must be polymorphic. The constraint add_adjuncts has this effect, as it optionally adds one or more adjuncts as arguments to the 'initial' category of a verb:","(4) iex(veroorzaken, X):-","add_adjuncts(X, NP\\(NP \\S)).","lex(geven, X) :-","add_adjuncts(X, NP\\(NP\\(NP\\S))). add_adjuncts(S, S). add_adjuncts(Adj \\X, Y) :-","add_adjuncts(X, Y). add_adjuncts( dir D , dir D ) :- arg A arg A add_adjuncts(X, Y).","2As we want to abstract away from the effects of 'verb-second', we present only examples of subordinate clauses. 148","This constraint captures the effect of applying the following (schematic) lexical rule recursively:"]},{"title":"(5) xl\\...\\xi\\x,+l\\...\\s/Y1...Y, #","paragraphs":["XI \\ . . . \\XikAdjkXi+l \\. . . \\S/Y1. . .

This has been proposed by Barry and Pickering (1990), but they are forced to assign a category containing Kleene-star operators to verbal elements. The semantic counterpart of such category-assignments is unclear. The present proposal is an alternative for such assignments which avoids introducing new categorial operators and which does not lead to semantic complications (the semantics of"]},{"title":"add_adjuncts","paragraphs":["is presented in section 3.3). Below we argue that this analysis also allows for a straightforward explanation of the distribution and scope of adjuncts in verb phrases headed by a verbal complex. 3 Cross-Serial Dependencies In Dutch, verbs selecting an infinitival complement (e.g. modals and perception verbs) give rise to so called cross-serial dependencies. The arguments of the verbs in-volved appear in the same order as the verbs in the 'verb cluster': (7) a. b. dat An1 Bea2 will kussen~. dat An Bea wants to kiss that An wants to kiss Bea dat An1 Bea2 Cor3 Will dat An Bea Cor wants zien2 kussen3. to see kiss that An wants to see Bea kiss Cor","The property of forming cross-serial dependencies is a lexical property of the matrix verb.

Recognizing the lexical nature of the process, more recent proposals have used either a lexical rule of composition (Moortgat, 1988) or a lexical rule of 'division' (Hoeksema, 1991). Division is a rule which enables a functor to inherit the arguments of its argument :3 X/Y ::¢, (X/Z, . . . IZ,,)I(Y/Z. . . IZ,)","To generate cross-serial dependencies, a 'disharmonic' version of this rule is needed:"]},{"title":"(9) x/v (zA... z.\\x)/(zA.., z.\\Y)","paragraphs":["Hoeksema proposes that verbs which trigger cross-serial word order are subject to (9): (10) ...An Bea wil kussen NP NP IV/IV NP\\IV"]},{"title":"#","paragraphs":["(NP\\IV)/(NP\\IV)","NP\\IV IV","In a framework using recursive constraints, generalized disharmonic division can be implemented as a recursive constraint connecting the initial category of such verbs with a derived category:","(11) lez(willen,X) :-","cross_serial(X, (NP\\S)/(NP\\S)). lez(zien, X) :-","cross_serial(X, (NP\\(NPkS))/(NP\\S)). lez(voornemen, (NPre fl \\(NP\\S))/(NP \\S)).","aArgument inheritance is used in HPSG to account for verb clustering in German (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1989).

This accounts immediately for the fact that cross-serial orders do not arise with all verbs selecting infinitival complements. 3.2 Verb Clusters The verb_cluster constraint ensures that cross-serial word order is obligatory for verbs subject to cross_serial. To rule out the ungrammatical (8a), for instance, we assume that Bea kussen is not a verb cluster. The verb kussen by itself, however, is unspecified for vc, and thus (7a) is not excluded.","We do not assume that cross-serial verbs take lexical arguments (as has sometimes been suggested), as that would rule out the possibility of complex constituents to the right of cross-serial verbs altogether. If one assumes that a possible bracketing of the verb cluster in (7b) is [wil [zien kussen]] (coordination and fronting data have been used as arguments that this is indeed the case), a cross-serial verb must be able to combine with non-lexical verb clusters. Furthermore, if a verb selects a particle, the particle can optionally be included in the verb cluster, and thus can appear either to the right or to the left of a governing cross-serial verb. For a verb cluster containing two cross-serial verbs, for instance, we have the following possibilities: (13) a. dat","An Bea heeft durven aan","that An Bea has dared part.","te spreken","to speak","that An has dared to speak to Bea. b. dat An Bea heeft aan durven te spreken. c. dat An Bea aan heeft durven te spreken.","A final piece of evidence for the the fact that cross-","serial verbs may take complex phrases as argument","stems from the observation that certain adjectival and","prepositional arguments can also appear as part of the","verb cluster: (14) dat An dit aan Bea had duidelijk that An this to Bea has clear gemaakt made thai An had made this clear to Bea","Cross-serial verbs select a +vc argument. Therefore, all phrases that are not verb clusters must be marked - vc. In general, in combining a (verbal) functor with its argument, it is the argument that determines whether the resulting phrase is -vc. For instance, NP-arguments always give rise to -VC phrases, whereas particles and verbal arguments do not give rise to -vc phrases. This suggests that NP's must be marked -vc, that particles and verbs can remain unspecified for this feature, and that in the syntactic rule for application the value of the feature vc must be reentrant between argument and resultant. 3.3 The distribution and scope of adjuncts The analysis of cross-serial dependencies in terms of argument inheritance interacts with the analysis of adjuncts presented in section 2.2. If a matrix verb inherits the arguments of the verb it governs, it should be possible to find modifiers of the matrix verb between this verb and one of its inherited arguments. This prediction is borne out (15a). However, we also find structurally similar examples in which the adjunct modifies the governed verb (15b). Finally, there are examples that are ambiguous between a wide and narrow scope reading (15c). We take it that the latter case is actually what needs to be accounted for, i.e. examples such as (15a) and (15b) are cases in which there is a strong preference for a wide and narrow scope reading, respectively, but we will remain silent about the (semantic) factors determining such preferences.

It seems as if F. avoids M. lately","On the assumption that the lexical entries for lijken en ontwijken are as in (16), example (15c) has two possible derivations ((17) and (18)). Procedurally speaking, the rule that adds adjuncts can be applied either to the matrix verb (after division has taken place) or to the 150 governed verb. In the latter case, the adjunct is 'inherited' by the matrix verb. Assuming that adjuncts take scope over the verbs introducing them, this accounts for the ambiguity observed above.

For the grammars that we have worked with, a simple bottom-up (shift-reduce) parser combined with delayed evaluation guarantees termination of the parsing process.","To obtain an efficient parser more complicated search strategies are required. However, chart-based search techniques are not easily generalized for grammars which make use of complex constraints. Even if the the-oretical problems can be solved (Johnson, 1993; DSrre, 1993) severe practical problems might surface, if the constraints are as complex as the ones proposed here.","As an alternative we have implemented chart-based parsers using the 'non-interleaved pruning' strategy (terminology from (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1994)). 152 Using this strategy the parser first builds a parse-forest for a sentence on the basis of the context-free backbone of the grammar. In a second processing phase parses are recovered on the basis of the parse forest and the corresponding constraints are applied. This may be advantageous if the context-free backbone of the grammar is 'informative' enough to filter many unsuccessful partial derivations that the parser otherwise would have to check.","As clearly a CUG grammar does not contain such an informative context-free backbone a further step is to use 'selective feature movement' (cf. again (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1994)). In this approach the base grammar is compiled into an equivalent modified grammar in which certain constraints from the base grammar are converted to a more complex context-free backbone in the modified grammar.","Again, this technique does not easily give good results for grammars of the type described. It is not clear at all where we should begin extracting appropriate features for such a modified grammar, because most information passing is simply too 'indirect' to be easily compiled into a context-free backbone.","We achieved the best results by using a 'handfabricated' context-free grammar as the first phase of parsing. This context-free grammar builds a parse forest that is then used by the 'real' grammar to obtain appropriate representation(s) for the input sentence. This turned out to reduce parsing times considerably.","Clearly such a strategy raises questions on the rela-tion between this context-free grammar and the CUG grammar. The context-free grammar is required to produce a superset of the derivations allowed by the CUG. Given the problems mentioned above it is difficult to show that this is indeed the case (if it were easy, then it probably would also be easy to obtain such a context-free grammar automatically).","The strategy can be described in somewhat more detail as follows.

There is a tendency in both CG and HPSG to rely more and more on mechanisms (such as inheritance and lexical rules or recursive constraints) that operate in the lexicon.

In the examples above we have stressed this by giving an account for the syntax of cross-serial dependencies (a construction that is, given some additional assumptions, not context-free) using application only.
