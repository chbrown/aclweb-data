We augment a theory of discourse interpretation with a theory of distinct mental attitudes and reasoning about them, in order to provide an account of how the attitudes interact with reasoning about discourse structure. INTRODUCTION The flow of inference between communicative intentions and domain information is often essential to discourse processing. It is well reflected in this discourse from Moore and Pollack (1992): (1)a. George Bush supports big business.","b. He's sure to veto House Bill 1711. There are at least three different interpretations. Consider Context 1: in this context the interpreter I believes that the author A wants to convince him that (lb) is true. For example, the context is one in which I has already uttered Bush won't veto any more bills. I reasons that A's linguistic behavior was intentional, and therefore that A believes that by saying (la) he will convince I that Bush will veto the bill. Even if I believed nothing about the bill, he now infers it's bad for big business. So we have witnessed an inference from premises that involve the desires and beliefs of A (Moore and Pollack's \"intentional structure\"), as well as his linguistic behavior, to a conclusion about domain information (Moore and Pollack's \"informational structure\").","Now consider Context 2: in this context I knows that A wants to convince him of (la). As in Context 1, I may infer that the bill is bad for big business. But now, (lb) is used to support (la).","Finally, consider Context 3: in this context I knows that House Bill 1711 is bad for big business, but doesn't know A's communicative desires prior to witnessing his linguistic behaviour. From his beliefs about tile domain, he infers that supporting big business would cause Bush to veto this bill. So, A must. have uttered (la) to support (lb). Hence I realises that A wan~ed him to believe (lb). So in contrast to Contexts 1 and 2, we have a flow of inference from informational structure to intentional structure.","This story makes two main points. First, we agree with Moore and Pollack that we must represent both the intentional import and the informational import of a discourse. As they show, this is a problem for current formulations of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Thompson and Mann, 1987). Second, we go further than Moore and Pollack, and argue that reasoning about beliefs and desires exploits different rules and axioms from those used to infer rhetorical relations. Thus, we should represent intentional structure and discourse structure separately. But we postulate rhetorical relations that express the discourse function of the constituents in the communicative plan of the author, and we permit interaction between reasoning about rhetorical relations and reasoning about beliefs and desires.","This paper provides the first steps towards a formal analysis of the interaction between intentional structure and informational structure. Our framework for discourse structure analysis is SDRT (Asher 1993). The basic representational structures of that theory may be used to characterise cognitive states. We will extend the logical engine used to infer rhetorical relations--DiCE (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993a, 1993b, Lascarides and Oberlander 1993)--to model inferences about intentional structure and its interaction with informational structure."]},{"title":"BUSH'S","paragraphs":["REQUIREMENTS We must represent both the intentional import and the informational import of a discourse simultaneously. So we need a theory of discourse structure where discourse relations central to intentional import and to informational import can hold simultaneously between the same constituents. A logical framework in which all those plausible relations between constituents that are consistent with each other are inferred, such as a nonmonotonic logic like that in DICE (Lascarides and Asher, 1993a), would achieve this. So conceivably, a similar nonmonotonic logic for RST might solve the problem of keeping track of the intentional and informational 34 structure simultaneously.","But this would work only if the various discourse relations about intentions and information could simultaneously hold in a consistent knowledge base (KB). Moore and Pollack (1992) show via discourse (2) that the current commitment to the nucleus-satellite distinction in RST precludes this. (2)a. Let's go home by 5.","b. Then we can get to the hardware store","before it closes.","c. That way we can finish the bookshelves tonight. From an intentional perspective, (2b) is a satellite to (2a) via Motivation. From an informational perspective, (2a) is a satellite to (2b) via Condition. These two structures are incompatible. So augmenting rtsT with a nonmonotonic logic for inferring rhetorical relations would not yield a representation of (2) on multiple levels in which both intentional and informational relations are represented. In SDRT, on the other hand, not all discourse relations induce subordination, and so there is more scope for different discourse relations holding simultaneously in a consistent KB.","Grosz and Sidner's (1986) model of discourse interpretation is one where the same discourse elements are related simultaneously on the informational and intentional levels. But using their framework to model (1) is not straightforward. As Grosz and Sidner (1990) point out: \"any model (or theory) of the communication situation must distinguish among beliefs and intentions of different agents,\" but theirs does not. They represent intentional structure as a stack of propositions, and different attitudes aren't distinguished. The informal analysis of (1) above demands such distinctions, how-ever. For example, analysing (1) under Context 3 requires a representation of the following statement: since A has provided a reason why (lb) is true, he must want I to believe that (lb) is true. It's unclear how Grosz and Sidner would represent this. SDRT (hsher, 1993) is in a good position to be integrated with a theory of cognitive states, because it uses the same basic structures (discourse representation structures or DRSs) that have been used in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) to represent different attitudes like beliefs and desires (Kamp 1981, Asher 1986, 1987, Kamp 1991, Asher and Singh, 1993). A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO SDRT AND DICE In SDRT (Asher, 1993), an NL text is represented by a segmented DRS (SDRS), which is a pair of sets contain-ing: the DRSS or SDRSs representing respectively sentences and text segments, and discourse relations between them. Discourse relations, modelled after those proposed by Hobbs (1985), Polanyi (1985) and Thompson and Mann (1987), link together the constituents of an SDRS. We will mention three: Narration, Result and Evidence. • SDRSS have a hierarchical configuration, and SDRT predicts points of attachment in a discourse structure for new information. Using DICE we infer from the reader's knowledge resources which discourse relation should be used to do attachment.","Lascarides and Asher (1991) introduce default rules representing the role of Gricean pragmatic maxims and domain knowledge in calculating the value of the update function (r, a, fl), which means \"the representation fl of the current sentence is to be attached to a with a discourse relation, where a is an open node in the representation r of the text so far\". Defaults are represented by a conditional--¢ > ¢ means 'if ¢, then normally ¢. For example, Narration says that by default Narration relates elements in a text. • Narration: (v, c~,/3) > garration(c~,/3) Associated axioms show how Narration affects the temporal order of the events described: Narration and the corresponding temporal axioms on Narration predict that normally the textual order of events matches their temporal order.","The logic on which DICE rests is Asher and Morreau's (1991) Commonsense Entailment (CE). Two patterns of nonmonotonic inference are particularly relevant here. The first is Defeasible Modus PontEs: if one default rule has its antecedent verified, then the consequent is nonmonotonically inferred. The second is the Penguin Principle: if there are conflicting default rules that apply, and their antecedents are in logical entailment relations, then the consequent of the rule with the most specific antecedent is inferred. Lascarides and Asher (1991) use DICE to yield the discourse structures and temporal structures for simple discourses. But the theory has so far ignored how A's intentional structure--or more accurately, I's model of A's intentional structure--influences I's inferences about the domain and the discourse structure. ADDING INTENTIONS To discuss intentional structure, we develop a language which can express beliefs, intentions and desires. Fob lowing Bratman (forthcoming) and Asher and Singh (1993), we think of the objects of attitudes either as plans or as propositions. For example, the colloquial intention to do something--like wash the dishes--will be expressed as an intention toward a plan, whereas the intention that Sue be happy is an intention toward a proposition. Plans will just consist of sequences of basic actions al; a2;... ;an. Two operators--7~ for about to do or doing, and 7:) for having done--will convert actions into propositions. The attitudes we assume in our model are believes (BA¢ means 'A believes ¢'), wants (WA¢ means 'A wants ¢'), and intends (ZA¢ means 'A intends ¢'). All of this takes place in a modal, dynamic logic, where the propositional attitudes are supplied with a modal semantics. To this we add the modal conditional operator >, upon Which the logic of DICE is 35 based.","Let's take a closer look at (1) in Context 1. Let the logical forms of the sentences (la) and (lb) be respectively a and/3. In Context 1, I believes that A wants to convince him of/3 and thinks that he doesn't believe","already. Following the DRT analysis of attitudes, we assume I's cognitive state has embedded in it a model of A's cognitive state, which in turn has a representation of I's cognitive state.

I is attempting to be helpful to A; he is trying to help realize A's goal. We need axioms to model this. Some key tools for doing this have been developed in the past couple of decades--belief revision, intention and plan revision--and the long term aim would be to enable formM theories of discourse structure to interact with these formal theories of attitudes and attitude revision. But since a clear understand-ing of how intentions are revised is yet to emerge, any speculation on the revision of intentions in a particular discourse context seems premature. 39"]},{"title":"CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK","paragraphs":["We have argued that it is important to separate reasoning about mental states from reasoning about discourse structure, and we have suggested how to integrate a formal theory of discourse attachment with commonsense reasoning about the discourse participants' cognitive states and actions.","We exploited a classic principle of commonsense reasoning about action, the Practical Syllogism, to model I's inferences about A's cognitive state during discourse processing. We also showed how axioms could be defined, so as to enable information to mediate between the domain, discourse structure and communicative intentions.","Reasoning about intentional structure took a different form from reasoning about discourse attachment, in that explanatory reasoning or abduction was permitted for the former but not the latter (but cf. Hobbs"]},{"title":"et al,","paragraphs":["1990). This, we argued, was a principled reason for maintaining separate representations of intentional structure and discourse structure, but preserving close links between them via axioms like Cooperation. Cooperation enabled I to use A's communicative intentions to reason about discourse relations.","This paper provides an analysis of only very simple discourses, and we realise that although we have in-troduced distinctions among the attitudes, which we have exploited during discourse processing, this is only a small part of the story.","Though DICE has used domain specific information to infer discourse relations, the rules relate domain structure to discourse structure in at best an indirect way. Implicitly, the use of the discourse update fimction (v, c~, ~) in the DICE rules reflects the intuitively obvious fact that domain information is filtered through the cognitive state of A. To make this explicit, the discourse community should integrate work on speech acts and attitudes (Perrault 1990, Cohen and Levesque 1990a, 1990b) with theories of discourse structure. In future work, we will investigate discourses where other axioms linking the different attitudes and discourse structure are important."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["Asher, Nicholas (1986) Belief in Discourse Representation Theory,"]},{"title":"Journal of Philosophical Logic,","paragraphs":["15, 127-189.
