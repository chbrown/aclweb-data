In contrast to fixed-length Markov models, which predict based on fixed-length histories, variable memory Markov models dynamically adapt their history length based on the training data, and hence may use fewer parameters. In a test of a VMM based tagger on the Brown corpus, 95.81% of tokens are correctly classified."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Many words in English have several parts of speech (POS). For example \"book\" is used as a noun in \"She read a book.\" and as a verb in \"She didn't book a trip.\" Part-of-speech tagging is the problem of determining the syntactic part of speech of an occurrence of a word in context. In any given English text, most tokens are syntactically ambiguous since most of the high-frequency English words have several parts of speech. Therefore, a correct syntactic classification of words in context is important for most syntactic and other higher-level processing of natural language text.","Two stochastic methods have been widely used for POS tagging: fixed order Markov models and Bidden Markov models. Fixed order Markov models are used in (Church, 1989) and (Charniak et al., 1993). Since the order of the model is assumed to be fixed, a short memory (small order) is typically used, since the number of possible combinations grows exponentially. For example, assuming there are 184 different tags, as in the Brown corpus, there are 1843 = 6,229,504 different order 3 combinations of tags (of course not all of these will actually occur, see (Weischedel et al., 1993)). Because of the large number of parameters higher-order fixed length models are hard to estimate. (See (Brill, 1993) for a rule-based approach to incorporating higher-order information.) In a Hidden iarkov Model (HMM) (Jelinek, 1985; Kupiec, 1992), a different state is defined for each POS tag and the transition probabilities and the output probabilities are estimated using the EM (Dempster et al., 1977) algorithm, which guarantees convergence to.a local minimum (Wu, 1983). The advantage of an HMM is that it can be trained using untagged text. On the other hand, the training procedure is time consuming, and a fixed model (topology) is assumed. Another disadvantage is due to the local convergence properties of the EM algorithm. The solution obtained depends on the initial setting of the model's parameters, and different solutions are obtained for different parameter initialization schemes. This phenomenon discourages linguistic analysis based on the output of the model.","We present a new method based on variable memory Markov models (VMM) (Ron et al., 1993; Ron et al., 1994). The VMM is an approximation of an unlimited order Markov source. It can incorporate both the static (order 0) and dynamic (higher-order) information systematically, while keeping the ability to change the model due to future observations. This approach is easy to implement, the learning algorithm and classification of new tags are computationally efficient, and the results achieved, using simplified assumptions for the static tag probabilities, are encouraging."]},{"title":"VARIABLE MEMORY MARKOV MODELS","paragraphs":["Markov models are a natural candidate for language modeling and temporal pattern recognition, mostly due to their mathematical simplicity.

Frequent symbols such as \"ABN\" (\"half\", \"all\", \"many\" used as prequantifiers, e.g. in \"many a younger man\") and \"DTI\" (determiners that can be singular or plural, \"any\" and \"some\") were not included because they occur in a variety of diverse contexts or often precede unambiguous words.

Since in the above sentences an adjective is syntactically more likely, this was the tagging chosen by the VMM. The noun \"homerun\" didn't occur in the training set, therefore the priors for unknown words biased the tagging towards adjectives, again because the position is more typical of an adjective than of a noun.","Two examples of the second most common error (tagging past tense forms (\"VBD\") as past participles (\"VBN\")) are \"called\" and \"elected\" in the following sentences:","• the party called for government operation of all utilities","• When I come back here after the November elec-tion you'll think, you're my man - elected. Most of the VBD/VBN errors were caused by words that have a higher prior for \"VBN\" so that in a situation in which both forms are possible according to local syntactic context, \"VBN\" is chosen. More global syntactic context is necessary to find the right tag \"VBD\" in the first sentence. The second sentence is an example for one of the tagging mistakes in the Brown corpus, \"elected\" is clearly used as a past participle, not as a past tense form. Comparison with other Results Charniak et al.'s result of 95.97% (Charniak et al., 1993) is slightly better than ours. This difference is probably due to the omission of rare tags that permit reliable prediction of the following tag (the case of \"HVZ.\" for \"hasn't\").","Kupiec achieves up to 96.36% correctness (Kupiec, 1992), without using a tagged corpus for training as we do. But the results are not easily comparable with ours since a lexicon is used that lists only possible tags. This can result in in-creasing the error rate when tags are listed in the lexicon that do not occur in the corpus. But it can also decrease the error rate when errors due to bad tags for rare words are avoided by looking them up in the lexicon. Our error rate on words that do not occur in the training text is 57%, since only the general priors are used for these words in decod-ing. This error rate could probably be reduced substantially by incorporating outside lexical information. DISCUSSION While the learning algorithm of a VMM is efficient and the resulting tagging algorithm is very simple, the accuracy achieved is rather moderate. This is due to several reasons. As mentioned in the introductory sections, any finite memory Markov model cannot capture the recursive nature of natural language. The VMM can accommodate longer statistical dependencies than a traditional full-order Markov model, but due to its Markovian nature long-distance statistical correlations are neglected. Therefore, a VMM based tagger can be used for pruning many of the tagging alternatives using its prediction probability, but not as a complete tagging system. Furthermore, the VMM power can be better utilized in low level language processing tasks such as cleaning up corrupted text as demonstrated in (Ron et al., 1993).","We currently investigate other stochastic models that can accommodate long distance statistical correlation (see (Singer and Tishby, 1994) for preliminary results). However, there are theoretical clues that those models are much harder to learn (Kearns et al., 1993), including HMM based models (Abe and Warmuth, 1992)."]},{"title":"186","paragraphs":["Another drawback of the current tagging scheme is the independence assumption of the underlying tags and the observed words, and the adhoc estimation of the static probabilities. We are pursuing a systematic scheme to estimate those probabilities based on Bayesian statistics, by as-signing a discrete probability distribution, such as the Dirichlet distribution (Berger, 1985), to each tag class. The a-posteriori probability estimation of the individual words can be estimated from the word counts and the tag class priors. Those priors can be modeled as a mixture of Dirichlet distributions (Antoniak, 1974), where each mixture component would correspond to a different tag class. Currently we estimate the state transition probabilities from the conditional counts assuming a uniform prior. The same technique can be used to estimate those parameters as well.
