In this paper, we apply a probabilistic chunker to deciding the implicit boundaries of constituents and utilize the linguistic knowledge to extract the noun phrases by a finite state mechanism. The test texts are SUSANNE Corpus and the results are evaluated by comparing the parse field of SUSANNE Corpus automatically. The results of this preliminary experiment are encouraging."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["From the cognitive point of view, human being must recognize, learn and understand the entities or concepts (concrete or abstract) in the texts for natural language comprehension. These entities or concepts are usually described by noun phrases. The evidences from the language learning of children also show the belief (Snow and Ferguson, 1977). Therefore, if we can grasp the noun phases of the texts, we will understand the texts to some extent. This consideration is also captured by theories of discourse analysis, such as Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp, 1981).","Traditionally, to make out the noun phrases in a text means to parse the text and to resolve the attachment relations among the constituents. However, parsing the text completely is very difficult, since various ambiguities cannot be resolved solely by syntactic or semantic information. Do we really need to fully parse the texts in every application? Some researchers apply shallow or partial parsers (Smadja, 1991; Hindle, 1990) to acquiring specific patterns from texts. These tell us that it is not necessary to completely parse the texts for some applications.","This paper will propose a probabilistic partial parser and incorporate linguistic knowledge to extract noun phrases. The partial parser is motivated by an intuition (Abney, 1991):","(1) When we read a sentence, we read it chunk by chunk. Abney uses two level grammar rules to implement the parser through pure LR parsing technique. The first level grammar rule takes care of the chunking process. The second level grammar rule tackles the attachment problems among chunks. Historically, our statistics-based partial parser is called chunker. The chunker receives tagged texts and outputs a linear chunk sequences. We assign a syntactic head and a semantic head to each chunk. Then, we extract the plausible maximal noun phrases according to the information of syntactic head and semantic head, and a finite state mechanism with only 8 states.","Section 2 will give a brief review of the works for the acquisition of noun phrases. Section 3 will describe the language model for chunker. Section 4 will specify how to apply linguistic knowledge to assigning heads to each chunk. Section 5 will list the experimental results of chunker. Following Section 5, Section 6 will give the performance of our work on the retrieval of noun phrases. The possible extensions of the proposed work will be discussed in Section 7. Section 8 will conclude the remarks."]},{"title":"2. Previous Works","paragraphs":["Church (1988) proposes a part of speech tagger and a simple noun phrase extractor. His noun phrase extractor brackets the noun phrases of input tagged texts according to two probability matrices: one is starting noun phrase matrix; the other is ending noun phrase matrix. The methodology is a simple version of Garside and Leech's probabilistic parser (1985). Church lists a sample text in the Appendix of his paper to show the performance of his work. It demonstrates only 5 out of 248 noun phrases are omitted. Because the tested text is too small to assess the results, the experiment for large volume of texts is needed."]},{"title":"234","paragraphs":["Bourigault (1992) reports a tool, LEXTER, for extracting terminologies from texts. LEXTER triggers two-stage processing: 1) analysis (by identification of frontiers), which extracts the maximal-length noun phrase: 2) parsing (the maximal-length noun phrases), which, furthermore, acquires the terminology embedded in the noun phrases. Bourigault declares the LEXTER extracts 95°/'0 maximal-length noun phrases, that is, 43500 out of 46000 from test corpus. The result is validated by an expert. However, the precision is not reported in the Boruigault's paper.","Voutilainen (1993) announces NPtool for acquisition of maximal-length noun phrases. NPtool applies two finite state mechanisms (one is NP-hostile; the other is NP-friendly) to the task. The two mechanisms produce two NP sets and any NP candidate with at least one occurrence in both sets will be labeled as the \"ok\" NP. The reported recall is 98.5-100% and the precision is 95-98% validated manually by some 20000 words. But from the sample text listed in Appendix of his paper, the recall is about 85%, and we can find some inconsistencies among these extracted noun phrases."]},{"title":"3.

Suppose an n-word sentencc, w j, w 2 ..... w (including punctuation marks), the parsing task is to find a parsing tree T, such that P(7]w l, w e ..... w n) has the maximal probability. We define T here to be a sequence of chunks, cp c 2 ..... c m, and each c (0 < i <_ m) contains one or more words wj (0 < j _< n). For example, the sentence \"parsing can be viewed as optimization.\" consists of 7 words.

Linguistic Knowledge In order to assign a head to each chunk, we first define priorities of POSes. X'-theory (Sells, 1985) has defined the X'-equivalences shown as Table 1. Table 1. X'-Equivalences R t, ~ X\" NP V V' VP A A' AP p p' pp INFL S (I') S' (IP) Table 1 defines five different phrasal structures and the hierarchical structures. The heads of these phrasal structures are the first level of X'-Equivalences, that is, X. The other grammatical constituents function as the specifiers or modifiers, that is, they are accompanying words not core words. Following this line, we define the primary priority of POS listed in Table 1. (10) Primary POS priority 1 : V > N > A > P In order to extract the exact head, we further define Secondary POS priority among the 134 POSes defined in LOB corpus (Johansson, 1986). (11) Secondary POS priority is a linear precedence relationship within the primary priorities for coarse POSes I We do not consider the INFL. since our model will not touch on this structure. For example, LOB corpus defines four kinds of verbial words under the coarse POS V: VB*, DO*, BE* and HV* 2. The secondary priority within the coarse POS V is:","(12) VB* > I-iV* > DO* > BE* Furthermore, we define the semantic head and the syntactic head (Abney, 1991).","(13) Semantic head is the head of a phrase according to the semantic usage; but syntactic head is the head based on the grammatical relations. Both the syntactic head and the semantic head are useful in extracting noun phrases. For example, if the semantic head of a chunk is the noun and the syntactic one is the preposition, it would be a prepositional phrase. Therefore, it can be connected to the previous noun chunk to form a new noun phrase. In some case, we will find some chunks contain only one word, called one-word chunks. They maybe contain a conjunction, e.g., that. Therefore. the syntactic head and the semantic head of one-word chunks are the word itself.","Following these definitions, we extract the noun phrases by procedure (14):"]},{"title":"(14) (a) Co) (c) (d)","paragraphs":["Tag the input sentences.

Applications Identification of noun phrases in texts is useful for many applications. Anaphora resolution (Hirst, 1981) is to resolve the relationship of the noun phrases, namely, what the antecedent of a noun phrase is. The extracted noun phrases can form the set of possible candidates (or universal in the terminology of discourse representation theory). For acquisition of verb subcategorization frames, to bracket the noun phrases in the texts is indispensable. It can help us to find the boundary of the subject, the object and the prepositional phrase. We would use the acquired noun phrases for an application of adjective grouping. The extracted noun phrases may contain adjectives which pre-modify the head noun. We then utilize the similarity of head nouns to group the adjectives. In addition, we may give the head noun a semantic tag, such as Roget's Thesaurus provides, and then analyze the adjectives. To automatically produce the index of a book,"]},{"title":"239","paragraphs":["we would extract the noun phrases contained in the book, calculate the inverse document frequency (IDF) and their term frequency (TF) (Salton, 1991), and screen out the implausible terms.","These applications also have impacts on identifying noun phrases.

For applications like grouping adjectives and automatic book indexing, some kinds of maximal noun phrases, such as noun phrases postmodified by \"of\" prepositional phrases, are suitable: but some are not, e.g., noun phrases modified by relative clauses."]},{"title":"8. Concluding Remarks","paragraphs":["The difficulty of this work is how to extract the real maximal noun phrases. If we cannot decide the prepositional phrase \"over a husband eyes\" is licensed by the verb \"pull\", we will not know \"the wool\" and \"a husband eyes\" are two noun phrases or form a noun pharse combined by the preposition \"over\".","(18) to pull the wool over a husband eyes to sell the books of my uncle In contrast, the noun phrase \"the books of my uncle\" is so called maximal noun phrase in current context. As the result, we conclude that if we do not resolve PP-attachment problem (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to the expected extent, we will not extract the maximal noun phrases. In our work, the probabilistic chunker decides the implicit boundaries between words and the NP-TRACTOR connects the adjacent noun chunks. When a noun chunk is followed by a preposition chunk, we do not connect the two chunks except the preposition chunk is led by \"of' preposition.","Comparing with other works, our results are evaluated by a parsed corpus automatically and show the high precision. Although we do not point out the exact recall, we provide estimated values. The testing scale is large enough (about 150,000 words). In contrast, Church (1988) tests a text and extracts the simple noun phrases only. Bourigault's work (1992) is evaluated manually, and dose not report the precision. Hence, the real performance is not known. The work executed by Voutilainen (1993) is more complex than our work. The input text first is morphologizied, then parsed by constraint grammar, analyzed by two different noun phrases grammar and finally extracted by the occurrences. Like other works, Voutilainen's work is also evaluated manually.","In this paper, we propose a language model to chunk texts. The simple but effective chunker could be seen as a linear structure parser, and could be applied to many applications. A method is presented to extract the noun phrases. Most importantly, the relations of maximal noun phrases, minimal noun phrases, ordinary noun phrases and applicable noun phrases are distinguished in this work. Their impacts on the subsequent applications are also addressed. In addition, automatic evaluation provides a fair basis and does not involve human costs. The experimental results show that this parser is a useful tool for further research on large volume of real texts."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["We are grateful to Dr. Geoffrey Sampson for his kindly providing SUSANNE Corpus and the details of tag set to US."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abney, Steven (1991), \"Parsing by Chunks,\" in"]},{"title":"Principle-Based Parsing,","paragraphs":["Berwick, Abney and Tenny (Eds.), Khiwer Academic Publishers, pp. 257-278.","Bourigault, Didier (1992), \"Surface Grammatical Analysis for the Extraction of Terminological Noun Phrases,\""]},{"title":"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING-92,","paragraphs":["Vol. III, Nantes, France, pp. 977-98 I.","Church, Kenneth (1988), \"A Stochastic Parts Program and Noun Phrase Parser for Unrestricted Text,\""]},{"title":"Proceedings of ,Second Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing,","paragraphs":["pp. 136-143.
