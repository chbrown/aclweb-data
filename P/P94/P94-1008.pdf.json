It is proposed that these features interact with one of two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference. The differing ways in which these types of inference utilize syntactic and semantic representations predicts phenomena for which it is otherwise difficult to account. Introduction Ellipsis is pervasive in natural language, and hence has received much attention within both computational and theoretical linguistics. However, the conditions under which a representation of an utterance may serve as a suitable basis for interpreting subsequent elliptical forms remain poorly understood; specifically, past at-tempts to characterize these processes within a single traditional module of language processing (e.g., considering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation) have failed to account for all of the data. In this paper, we claim that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis resolution, event reference, and interclausal coherence can be explained by the interaction between the syntactic and semantic properties of the form in question and the type of discourse inference operative in establishing the coherence of the antecedent and elided clauses.","In the next section, we introduce the facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis, and non-elliptical event reference that we seek to explain. In Section 3, we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features: (1) whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics. In Section 4 we describe two types of discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference, and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize. In Section 5, we show how this proposal accounts for the data presented in Section 2. We contrast the account with relevant past work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7. Ellipsis and Interclausal Coherence It has been noted in previous work that the felicity of certain forms of ellipsis is dependent on the type of coherence relationship extant between the antecedent and elided clauses (Levin and Prince, 1982; Kehler, 1993b). In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference.","Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence (henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances, more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent target sentences, as exemplified in sentence (1): (1) Bill became upset, and Hillary angry. We are concerned here with a particular fact about gapping noticed by Levin and Prince (1982), namely that gapping is acceptable only with the purely conjunctive symmetric meaning of and conjoining the clauses, and not with its causal asymmetric meaning (paraphraseable by \"and as a result\"). That is, while either of sentences (1) or (2) can have the purely conjunctive reading, only sentence (2) can be understood to mean that Hillary's becoming angry was caused by or came as a result of Bill's becoming upset. (2) Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry. This can be seen by embedding each of these examples in a context that reinforces one of the meanings. For instance, gapping is felicitous in passage (3), where context supports the symmetric reading, but is infelicitous in passage (4) under the intended causal meaning of and. 1","1This behavior is not limited to the conjunction and; a similar distinction holds between symmetric and asymmetric uses of or and but. See Kehler (1994) for further discussion. 50","(3) The Clintons want to get the national debate focussed on health care, and are getting annoyed because the media is preoccupied with Whitewater.

The common stipulation within the literature stating that gapping applies to coordinate structures and not to subordinate ones does not account for why any coordinated cases are unacceptable.","VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sentence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase: (5) Bill became upset, and Hillary did too.","The distribution of VP-ellipsis has also been shown to be sensitive to the coherence relationship extant between the source and target clauses, but in a different respect. In a previous paper (Kehler, 1993b), five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic in nature. Evidence was given that VP-ellipsis copies syntactic representations in what was termed parallelconstructions (predicting the unacceptability of the voice mismatch in example (6) and nominalized source in example (8)), but copies semantic representations in non-parallel constructions (predicting the acceptability of the voice mismatch in example (7) and the nominalized source in example (9)): 2","(6) # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did too.

[ respond ] These examples are analogous with the gapping cases in that constraints against mismatches of syntactic form hold for the symmetric (i.e., parallel) use of and in examples (6) and (8), but not the asymmetric (i.e., non-parallel) meaning in examples (7) and (9). In","2These examples have been taken or adapted from Kehler (1993b). The phrases shown in brackets indicate the elided material under the intended interpretation. fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent. Past approaches to VP-ellipsis that operate within a single module of language processing fail to make the distinctions necessary to account for these differences.","Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that while elliptical sentences such as (6) are unacceptable because of a voice mismatch, similar examples with non-elided event referential forms such as do it are much more acceptable:","(10) The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did it too. [ reverse the decision ] An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference must account for this distinction.","In sum, the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsis appears to be dependent on the type of coherence relation extant between the source and target clauses. Pronominal event reference, on the other hand, appears not to display this dependence. We seek to account for these facts in the sections that follow.","Syntax and Semantics of Ellipsis and","Event Reference In this section we characterize the forms being addressed in terms of two features: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics. In subsequent sections, we show how the distinct mechanisms for recovering these types of missing information interact with two types of discourse inference to predict the phenomena noted in the previous section.","We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms using the version of Categorial Semantics described in Pereira (1990). In the Montagovian tradition, semantic representations are compositionaUy generated in correspondence with the constituent modification relationships manifest in the syntax; predicates are curried. Traces are associated with assumptions which are subsequently discharged by a suitable construction. Figure 1 shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow. 3","For our analysis of gapping, we follow Sag (1976) in hypothesizing that a post-surface-structure level of syntactic representation is used as the basis for interpretation. In source clauses of gapping constructions, constituents in the source that are parallel to the overt constituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause representation. 4 For simplicity, we will assume that 3We will ignore the tense of the predicates for ease of exposition. 4It has been noted that in gapping constructions, contrastive accent is generally placed on parallel elements in"]},{"title":"51 S: become '(upset ')(Bill')","paragraphs":["NP: Bill' VP: beeome'(upset') Bill: Bill' V: become' AP: upset'"]},{"title":"I I","paragraphs":["bec~ame: becx~me' upset: upset' Figure 1: Syntactic and Semantic Representations for Bill became upset. this abstraction is achieved by fronting the constituents in the post-surface-structure, although nothing much hinges on this; our analysis is compatible with several possible mechanisms. The syntactic and semantic representations for the source clause of example (1) after fronting are shown in Figure 2; the fronting leaves trace assumptions behind that are discharged when combined with their antecedents.

This proposition needs to be presupposed (or accommodated) for the gapping to be felicitous, for instance, it would be infelicitous to open a conversation with sentence such as (1), whereas it is perfectly felicitous in response to the question How did the Clintons react?.

The syntactic VP could be copied down with its corresponding semantics, from which the semantics for the complete sentence can be derived. In this case, the anaphoric expression is constrained to have the same semantics as the copied constituent. Alternatively, the anaphoric expression could be resolved purely semantically, resulting in the discharge of the anaphoric assumption P. The higher-order unification method developed by Dalrymple et al. (1991) could be used for this purpose; in this case the sentence-level semantics is recovered without copying any syntactic representations.","Event referential forms such as do it, do tha~, and do so constitute full verb phrases in the syntax. It has been often noted (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, inter alia) that it is the main verb do that is operative in these forms of anaphora, in contrast to the auxiliary do operative in VP-ellipsis/ It is the pronoun in event referential forms that is anaphoric; the fact that the pronouns refer to events results from the type constraints imposed by the main verb do. Therefore, such forms are anaphoric in the semantics, but do not leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax.","To summarize this section, we have characterized the forms being addressed according to two features, a summary of which appears in Table 1.

Here we describe two types of inference used to enforce the constraints that are imposed by coherence relations. In each case, arguments to coherence relations take the form of semantic representations retrieved by way of their corresponding node(s) in the syntax; the operations performed on these representations are dictated by the nature of the constraints imposed. The two types of inference are distinguished by the level in the syntax from which these arguments are retrieved, s Common Topic Inference Understanding segments of utterances standing in a Common Topic relation requires the determination of points of commonality (parallelism) and departure (contrast) between sets of corresponding entities and properties within the utterances. This process is reliant on performing comparison and generalization operations on the corresponding representations (Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993). Table 2 sketches definitions for some Common Topic relations, some taken from and others adapted from Hobbs (1990). In each case, the hearer is to understand the relation by inferring po(al,..., a,) from sentence So and inferring p1(bl, ..., bn) from sentence $1 under the listed constraints. 9 In order to meet these constraints, the identification of p0 and Pl may require arbitrary levels of generalization from the relations explicitly stated in the utterances.","Examples of these relations are given in sentences (13a-d).","(13) a.

Passage (13c) is likewise coherent by virtue of the inferences resulting from identifying parallel elements and properties, including that John is a young aspiring politician and that he's a Democrat (since Clinton is identified with his party's candidate). The characteristic that Common Topic relations share is that they require the identification of parallel entities (i.e., the al and bi) and relations (P0 and Px) as arguments to the constraints. We posit that the syntactic representation is used both to guide the identification of parallel elements and to retrieve their semantic representations. Coherent Situation Inference Understanding utterances standing in a Coherent Situation relation requires that hearers convince themselves that the utterances describe a coherent situation given their knowledge of the world. This process requires that a path of inference be established between the situations (i.e., events or states) described in the participating utterances as a whole, without regard to any constraints on parMlelism between sub-sententiM constituents. Four such relations are summarized in Table 3. l° In all four cases, the hearer is to infer A from sentence $1 and B from sentence $2 under the constraint that the presuppositions listed be abduced (ttobbs et al., 1993): 11 Relation Presuppose Conjunctions Result","Explanation Violated Expectation Denial of Preventer A-.

(Denial of Preventer) Beyond what is asserted by the two clauses individually, understanding each of these sentences requires the presupposition that being a politician implies being dishonest. Inferring this is only reliant on the sentential-level semantics for the clauses as a whole; there are no p, ai, or bi to be independently identified. The same is true for what Hume called Contiguity relations (perhaps in-eluding Hobbs' Occasion and Figure-ground relations); for the purpose of this paper we will consider these as weaker cases of Cause or Effect.","To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic inference utilizes the syntactic structure in identifying the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to serve as arguments to the coherence constraints. In contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the sentential-level semantic forms as is required for abducing a coherent situation. The question then arises as to what happens when constituents in the syntax for an utterance are empty. Given that the discourse inference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through nodes in the syntax, this syntax will have to be recovered when a node being accessed is missing. Therefore, we posit that missing constituents are recovered as a by-product of Common Topic inference, to allow the parallel properties and entities serving as arguments to the coherence relation to be accessed from within the reconstructed structure. On the other hand, such copying is not triggered in Coherent Situation inference, since the arguments are retrieved only from the top-level sentence node, which is always present. In the next section, we show how this difference accounts for the data given in Section 2. Applying the Analysis In previous sections, we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax and whether they are anaphoric in the semantics. Empty. constituents in the syntax are not in themselves referential, but are recovered during Common Topic infer-54 ence. Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are independently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse inference. In this section we show how the phenomena presented in Section 2 follow from these properties. Local Ellipsis Recall from Section 2 that gapping constructions such as (15) are only felicitous with the symmetric (i.e., Common Topic) meaning of and: (15) Bill became upset, and Hillary angry. This fact is predicted by our account in the following way. In the case of Common Topic constructions, the missing sentence in the target will be copied from the source, the sentential semantics may be derived, and the arguments to the coherence relations can be identified and reasoning carried out, predicting felicity. In the case of Coherent Situation relations, no such recovery of the syntax takes place. Since a gapped clause in and of itself has no sentence-level semantics, the gapping fails to be felicitous in these cases.","This account also explains similar differences in felicity for other coordinating conjunctions as discussed in Kehler (1994), as well as why gapping is infelicitous in constructions with subordinating conjunctions indicating Coherent Situation relations, as exemplified in (16).","(16) # Bill became upset, { because } even though Hillary angry. despite the fact that","The stripping construction is similar to gapping except that there is only one bare constituent in the target (also generally receiving contrastive accent); unlike VP-ellipsis there is no stranded auxiliary. We therefore might predict that stripping is also acceptable in Common Topic constructions but not in Coherent Situation constructions, which appears to be the case: 12 (17) Bill became upset, but not # and (as a result) # because Hillary. # even though # despite the fact that","In summary, gapping and related constructions are infelicitous in those cases where Coherent Situation inference is employed, as there is no mechanism for recovering the sentential semantics of the elided clause.","12Stripping is also possible in comparative deletion constructions. A comprehensive analysis of stripping, pseudo-gapping, and VP-ellipsis in such cases requires an articula-tion of a syntax and semantics for these constructions, which will be carried out in future work. VP-Ellipsis Recall from Section 2 that only in Coherent Situation constructions can VP-ellipsis obtain purely semantic antecedents without regard to constraints on structural parallelism, as exemplified by the voice mismatches in sentences (18) and (19).","(18) # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did too. [ reverse the decision ]","(19) In March, four fireworks manufacturers asked that the decision be reversed, and on Monday the ICC did. [ reverse the decision ] These facts are also predicted by our account. In the case of Common Topic constructions, a suitable syntactic antecedent must be reconstructed at the site of the empty VP node, with the result that the anaphoric expression takes on its accompanying semantics. Therefore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syntactic antecedent in these scenarios. In Coherent Situation constructions, the empty VP node is not reconstructed. In these cases the anaphoric expression is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-ellipsis is only constrained to having a suitable semantic antecedent.","The analysis accounts for the range of data given in Kehler (1993b), although one point of departure exists between that account and the current one with respect to clauses conjoined with but. In the previous account these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resulting in the prediction that they only require semantic source representations. In our analysis, we expect cases of pure contrast to pattern with the parallel class since these are Common Topic constructions; this is opposed to the violated expectation use of but which indicates a Coherent Situation relation. The current account makes the correct predictions; examples (20) and (21), where but has the contrast meaning, appear to be markedly less acceptable than examples (22) and (23), where but has the violated expectation meaning: 13","(20) ??

First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse model; 15 instead, syntactic and semantic representations co-exist.

Third, there is no longer a dichotomy with respect to the level of representation from which VP-ellipsis locates and copies antecedents. Instead, two distinct factors have been separated out: the resolution of missing constituents under Common Topic inference is purely syntactic whereas the resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases is purely semantic; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsis data arises out of the interaction between these different phenomena.
