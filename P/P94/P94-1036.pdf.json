The former models certain uses of multiset-valued feature structures in unification-based formalisms, while the latter is motivated by word order variation and by \"quasi-trees\", a generalization of trees. The two formalisms are weakly equivalent, and an important subset is at most context-sensitive and polynomially parsable. Introduction Early attempts to use context-free grammars (CFGs) as a mathematical model for natural language syntax have largely been abandoned; it has been shown that (under standard assumptions concerning the recursive nature of clausal embedding) the cross-serial dependencies found in Swiss German cannot be generated by a CFG (Shieber, 1985). Several mathematical models have been proposed which extend the formal power of CFGs, while still maintaining the formal properties that make CFGs attractive formalisms for formal and computational linguists, in particular, polynomial parsability and restricted weak generative capacity. These mathematical models include tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985), head grammar (Pollard, 1984), combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1985), and linear index grammar (LIG) (Gazdar, 1988). These formalisms have been shown to be weakly equivalent to each other (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994); we will refer to them as \"LIG-equivalent formalisms\". LIG is a variant of index grammar (IG) (Aho, 1968). Like CFG, IG is a context-free string rewriting system, except that the nonterminal symbols in a CFG are augmented with stacks of index symbols. The rewrite rules push or pop indices from the index stack. In an IG, the index stack is copied to all nonterminal symbols on the right-hand side of a rule. In a LIG, the stack is copied to exactly one right-hand side nonterminal. 1","1Note that a LIG is not an IG that is linear (i.e., whose productions have at most one nonterminal on the right-hand","Owen Rambow","Univesit@ Paris 7 UFR Linguistique, TALANA Case 7003, 2, Place Jussieu","F-75251 Paris Cedex 05, France"]},{"title":"rambow©linguist, j ussieu, fr","paragraphs":["While LIG-equivalent formalisms have been shown to provide adequate formal power for a wide range of linguistic phenomena (including the aforementioned Swiss German construction), the need for other mathematical formalisms has arisen in several unrelated areas. In this paper, we discuss three such cases. First, captur-ing several semantic and syntactic issues in unification-based formalisms leads to the use of multiset-valued feature structures. Second, word order facts from languages such as German, Russian, or Turkish cannot be derived by LIG-equivalent formalisms. Third, a generalization of trees to \"quasi-trees\" (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads to the definition of a new formal system. In this paper, we introduce two new equivalent mathematical formalisms which provide adequate descriptions for these three phenomena.","The paper is structured as follows. First, we present the three phenomena in more detail. We then introduce multiset-valued LIG and present some formal properties. Thereafter, we introduce a second rewriting system and show that it is weakly equivalent to the LIG variant. We then briefly mention some related formalisms. We conclude with a brief summary. Three Problems","for LIG-Equivalent Formalisms The three problems we present are of a rather different nature. The first arises from the way a linguistic problem is treated in a specific type of framework (unification-based formalisms). The second problem derives directly from linguistic data. The third problem is a formalism which has been motivated on in-dependent, methodological grounds, but whose formal properties are unknown."]},{"title":"Multiset-Valued Feature Structures","paragraphs":["HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1994) uses typed feature structures as its formal basis, which are Turing-equivalent.

HPSG analyses include information about constituent structure which can be represented as a context-free phrase-structure tree. In addition, various mechanisms have been proposed to handle certain linguistic phenomena that relate two nodes within this tree. One of these is a multiset-valued feature that is passed along the phrase-structure tree from daughter node to mother node. Multiset-valued features have been proposed for the SLASH feature which handles wh-dependencies (Pollard and Sag, 1994, Chapter 4), and for certain semantic purposes, including the representation of stored quantifiers in a mechanism similar to Cooper-storage. An-other use may be the representation of anti-coreference constraints arising from Principle C of Binding Theory (be it that of (Chomsky, 1981) or of Pollard and Sag (1992)).","It is desirable to be able to assess the formal power of such a system, for both theoretical and practical reasons. Theoretically, it would be interesting if it turned out that the linguistic principles formulated in HPSG naturally lead to certain restricted uses of the unification-based formalism. Clearly this would represent an important insight into the nature of grammatical competence. On the practical side, formal equivalences can guide the building of applications such as parsers for existing HPSG grammars. For example, it has been proposed that HPSG grammars can be \"compiled\" into TAGs in order to obtain a computationally more tractable system (Kasper, 1992), thus sidestepping the issue of building parsers for HPSG directly. However, LIG-equivalent formalisms cannot serve as targets for compilations in cases in which HPSG uses multiset-valued feature structures. Word Order Variation Becket et al. (1991) discuss scrambling, which is the permutation of verbal arguments in languages such as German, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Russian, and Turkish. If there are embedded clauses, scrambling in many languages can affect arguments of more than one verb (\"long-distance\" scrambling).","(1) ... dab [den Kiihlschrank]i bisher noch","... that the refrigeratorAcc so far yet niemand [ti zu reparieren] versprochen hat no-onesoM to repair promised has ... that so far, no-one has promised to repair the refrigerator Scrambling in German is \"doubly unbounded\" in the sense that there is no bound on the number of clause boundaries over which an element can scramble, and an element scrambled (long-distance or not) from one clause does not preclude the scrambling of an element from another clause:","(2) ... dab [dem Kunden]i [den Kfihlschrank]j","... that the clientDAW the refrigeratorAcc bisher noch niemand ti"]},{"title":"[[tj ZU","paragraphs":["reparieren] so far yet no-oneNoM to repair zu versuchen] versprochen hat to try promised has ... that so-far, no-one yet has promised the client to repair the refrigerator Similar data has been observed in the literature for other languages, for example for Finnish by Karttunen (1989). Becker et al. (1991) argue that a simple TAG (and the other LIG-equivalent formalisms) cannot derive the full range of scrambled sentences.

In order to arrive at a definition that is compatible with a unification-based approach, he makes three minimal assumptions about the nature of the objects used for the representation of natural language syntax. The first assumption (left implicit) is that these objects represent phrase-structure. The second assumption is that they \"give a sufficiently enlarged domain of locality that allows localization of dependencies such as subcategorization, and filler-gap\" (Vijay-Shanker, 1992, p.486). The third assumption is that dominance relations can be stated between different parts of the representation. These assumptions lead Vijay-Shanker to define quasi-trees, which are partial descriptions of trees in which \"quasi-nodes\" (partial descriptions of nodes) are related by dominance constraints. Each node in a traditional tree (as used in TAG) corresponds to two quasi-nodes, a top and a bottom version, such that the top dominates the bottom.","There are two ways of interpreting quasi-trees: either quasi-trees can be seen as data structures in their own right; or quasi-trees can be seen as descriptions of trees whose denotations are sets of (regular) trees. If quasi-trees are defined as data structures, we can define operations such as adjunction and substitution and notions such as \"derived structure\". More precisely, we define quasi-trees to be structures consisting of pairs of nodes, called quasi-nodes, such that one is the \"top\" quasi-node and the other is the \"bottom\" quasi-node. The top and bottom quasi-node of a pair are linked by a dominance constraint. Bottom quasi-nodes immediately dominate top quasi-nodes of other quasi-node pairs, and each top quasi-node is immediately dominated by exactly one bottom quasi-node. For simplicity, we will assume that there is only a bottom root quasi-node (i.e., no top root quasi-node), and that bottom frontier quasi-nodes are omitted (i.e., frontier nodes just consist of top quasi-nodes). Furthermore, we will assume that each quasi-node has a label, and is equipped with a finite feature structure. A sample quasi-tree is shown in Figure 1 (quasi-tree a5 of Vijay-Shanker (1992, p.488)).","We follow Vijay-Shanker (1992, Section 2.5) in defin-ing substitution as the operation of forming a quasi-node pair from a frontier node of one tree (which becomes the top node) and the root node of another tree (which becomes the bottom node). As always, a dominance link relates the two quasi-nodes of the newly formed pair. Adjunction is not defined separately: it suffices to say that a pair of quasi-nodes is \"broken up\", thus forming two quasi-trees. We then perform two substitutions. Observe that nothing keeps us from breaking up more than one pair of quasi-nodes in either of two quasi-trees, and then performing more than two substitutions (as $ NP S I s NP VP 1 I vP V e Figure 1: Sample quasi-tree long as dominance constraints are respected); there are no operations in regular TAG that correspond to such operations. We will say that a quasi-tree is derived if in all quasi-node pairs, the two quasi-nodes are equated, meaning that they have the same label and the two feature structures are unified, and furthermore, if all frontier quasi-nodes have terminal labels. The string associated with this quasi-tree is defined in the usual way.","We have now fully defined a formalism (if informally): its data structures (quasi-trees), its combination operation (substitution), and the notion of derived structure. We will call this formalism Quasi-Tree Substitu-tion Grammar (QTSG). It can easily be seen that all examples discussed by Vijay-Shanker (1992) are derivations in QTSG. The question arises as to the formal and computational properties of QTSG. Multiset-Valued LIG In order to find a mathematical model for certain uses of multiset-valued feature structures, discussed above, we now introduce a multiset-valued variant of LIG. We denote by .A4(A) the set of multisets over the elements of A, and we use the standard set notation to refer to the corresponding multiset operations. Definition 1 A multlset-valued Linear Index Grammar ({}-LIG) is a 5-tuple (tiN, VT, ~, P, S), where VN, VT, and VI are disjoint sets of terminals, non-terminals, and indices, respectively; S E VN is the start symbol; and P is a set of productions of the following form: p : As ) voBlslvl ...v~-lB, snvn for some n > O, A, B1,...,Bn E VN, s, sl,...,sn multisets of members of VI, and vo, . . ., vn E V~.","The derivation relation ~ for a {}-LIG is defined as follows.

We can also define {}-LIG as a pure string-rewriting system which does not require the definition of additional data structures (the multisets) for the notion of \"derivation\" (see (Rambow, 1994)). However, the definition provided here (using an explicit representation of multisets) has the advantage of corresponding more directly to the intuition underlying {}-LIG and is much easier to understand and use in proofs. The issue is purely notational.","We now introduce a restriction on derivations, which will be useful later.

It must be the case that this unbounded multiset is crucial in restricting the second half of the generated string in such a way that it copies the first half (again, since a pure CFG cannot derive such strings). However, it is impossible for a data structure like a (multi-)set (over a finite index alphabet) to record the required sequential information.

It can easily be seen from the construction employed in the proof of Theorem 7 that a lexicalized UVG-DL maps to a linearly restricted {}-LIG. For linguistic purposes we are only interested in lexicalized grammars, and therefore the linear restriction is quite natural. We obtain the following corollaries thanks to Theorem 7. Corollary 8 L:(UVG-DLLex) C_ LI(CSG). Corollary 9 L:(UVG-DL) is a substitution-closed full AFL. Corollary 10 Each language in /:(UVG-DLLex) can be recognized in polynomial deterministic time."]},{"title":"Related Formalisms","paragraphs":["Based on word-order facts from Turkish, Hoffman (1992) proposes an extension to CCG called {}-CCG, in which arguments of functors form sets, rather than be-ing represented in a curried notation. Under function composition, these sets are unioned. Thus the move from CCG to {}-CCG corresponds very much to the move from LIG to {}-LIG. We conjecture that (a version of) {}-CCG is weakly equivalent to {}-LIG.","Staudacher (1993) defines a related system called distributed index grammar or DIG. DIG is like LIG, except that the stack of index symbols can be split into chunks and distributed among the daughter nodes. However, the formalism is not convincingly motivated by the linguistic data given (which can also be handled by a simple LIG) or by other considerations.","Several extensions to {}-LIG and UVG-DL are defined in (Rambow, 1994). First, we can introduce the \"integrity\" constraint suggested by Becker et al. (1991) which restricts long-distance relations through nodes. This is necessary to implement the linguistic notion of \"barrier\" or \"island\". Second, we can define the tree-rewriting version of UVG-DL, called V-TAG. This is motivated by Conjecture 4, which (if true) means that UVG-DL cannot derive Swiss German. Under either extension, the weak generative power is extended, but the formal and computational results obtained for {}-LIG and UVG-DL still hold."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has presented two equivalent formalisms, {}-LIG and UVG-DL, which provide formal models for the three different phenomena that we identified in the beginning of the paper. We have shown that both formalisms, under certain restrictions that are compatible with the motivating phenomena, are restricted ill their generative capacity and polynomially parsable, thus making them attractive candidates for modeling natural language. Furthermore, the formalisms are substitution-closed AFLs, suggesting that the defini-tions we have given are \"natural\" from the point of view of formal language theory.
