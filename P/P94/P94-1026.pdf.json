This allows very much faster parsing and gives a lower error rate, at the price of a small loss in coverage. Previously, it has been necessary to specify the tree-cutting criteria (or operationality criteria) manually; here they are derived automatically from the training set and the desired coverage of the specialized grammar. This is done by assigning an entropy value to each node in the parse trees and cutting in the nodes with sufficiently high entropy values. BACKGROUND Previous work by Manny Rayner and the author, see [Samuelsson &~ Rayner 1991] attempts to tailor an existing natural-language system to a specific application domain by extracting a specialized grammar from the original one using a large set of training examples. The training set is a treebank consisting of implicit parse trees that each specify a verified analysis of an input sentence. The parse trees are implicit in the sense that each node in the tree is the (mnemonic) name of the grammar rule resolved on at that point, rather than the syntactic category of the LHS of the grammar rule as is the case in an ordinary parse tree. Figure 1 shows five examples of implicit parse trees. The analyses are verified in the sense that each analysis has been judged to be the preferred one for that input sentence by a human evaluator using a semi-automatic evaluation method.","A new grammar is created by cutting up each implicit parse tree in the treebank at appropriate points, creat-ing a set of new rules that consist of chunks of original grammar rules. The LHS of each new rule will be the LHS phrase of the original grammar rule at the root of the tree chunk and the RHS will be the RHS phrases of the rules in the leaves of the tree chunk. For example, cutting up the first parse tree of Figure 1 at the NP of the rule vp_v_np yields rules 2 and 3 of Figure 3.","The idea behind this is to create a specialized grammar that retains a high coverage but allows very much faster parsing. This has turned out to be possible -- speedups compared to using the original grammar of in median 60 times were achieved at a cost in coverage of about ten percent, see [Samuelsson 1994a].1 An-other benefit from the method is a decreased error rate when the system is required to select a preferred analysis. In these experiments the scheme was applied to the grammar of a version of the SRI Core Language Engine [Alshawi ed. 1992] adapted to the Atis domain for a speech-translation task [Rayner el al 1993] and large corpora of real user data collected using Wizard-of-Oz simulation. The resulting specialized grammar was compiled into LR parsing tables, and a special LR parser exploited their special properties, see [Samuelsson 1994b].","The technical vehicle previously used to extract the specialized grammar is explanation-based generalization (EBG), see e.g. [Mitchell et al 1986]. Very briefly, this consists of redoing the derivation of each training example top-down by letting the implicit parse tree drive a rule expansion process, and aborting the expansion of the specialized rule currently being extracted if the current node of the implicit parse tree meets a set of tree-cutting criteria 2. In this case the extraction process is invoked recursively to extract subrules rooted in the current node. The tree-cutting criteria can be local (\"The LHS of the original grammar rule is an NP,\") or dependent on the rest of the parse tree (\"that doesn't dominate the empty string only,\") and previous choices of nodes to cut at (\"and there is no cut above the current node that is also labelled NP.\").","A problem not fully explored yet is how to arrive at an optimal choice of tree-cutting criteria. In the previous scheme, these must be specified manually, and the choice is left to the designer's intuitions. This article addresses the problem of automating this process and presents a method where the nodes to cut at are selected automatically using the information-theoretical concept of entropy. Entropy is well-known from physics, but the concept of perplexity is perhaps better known in the speech-recognition and natural-language communities. 1Other more easily obtainable publications about this are in preparation. 2These are usually referred to as \"operationality criteria\" in the EBG literature."]},{"title":"188","paragraphs":["For this reason, we will review the concept of entropy at this point, and discuss its relation to perplexity.

Thus, the entropy is the logarithm of the local perplexity at a given point in the word string. If all words are equally probable, then the local perplexity is simply the branching factor at this point. If the probabilities differ, the local perplexity can be viewed as a generalized branching factor that takes this into account.","Tree entropy","We now turn to the task of calculating the entropy of a","node in a parse tree.

SCHEME OVERVIEW In the following scheme, the desired coverage of the specialized grammar is prescribed, and the parse trees are cut up at appropriate places without having to specify the tree-cutting criteria manually:","1. Index the treebank in an and-or tree where the or-nodes correspond to alternative choices of grammar rules to expand with and the and-nodes correspond to the RHS phrases of each grammar rule. Cutting up the parse trees will involve selecting a set of or-nodes in the and-or tree. Let us call these nodes \"cutnodes\".","2. Calculate the entropy of each or-node. We will cut at each node whose entropy exceeds a threshold value. The rationale for this is that we wish to cut up the parse trees where we can expect a lot of variation i.e. where it is difficult to predict which rule will be resolved on next. This corresponds exactly to the nodes in the and-or tree that exhibit high entropy values.","3. The nodes of the and-or tree must be partitioned into equivalence classes dependent on the choice of cutnodes in order to avoid redundant derivations at parse time. 4 Thus, selecting some particular node as a cutnode may cause other nodes to also become cutnodes, even though their entropies are not above the threshold.","4. Determine a threshold entropy that yields the desired coverage. This can be done using for example interval bisection.","5. Cut up the training examples by matching them against the and-or tree and cutting at the determined cutnodes.","It is interesting to note that a textbook method for"]},{"title":"conslructing","paragraphs":["decision trees for classification from attribute-value pairs is to minimize the (weighted average of the) remaining entropy 5 over all possible choices of root attribute, see [Quinlan 1986].","4This can most easily be seen as follows: Imagine two identical, but different portions of the and-or tree. If the roots and leaves of these portions are all selected as cutnodes, but the distribution of cutnodes within them differ, then we will introduce multiple ways of deriving the portions of the parse trees that match any of these two portions of the and-or tree.","5Defined slightly differently, as described below. 190 DETAILED SCHEME First, the treebank is partitioned into a training set and a test set. The training set will be indexed in an and-or tree and used to extract the specialized rules. The test set will be used to check the coverage of the set of extracted rules. Indexing the treebank Then, the set of implicit parse trees is stored in an and-or tree. The parse trees have the general form of a rule identifier Id dominating a list of subtrees or a word of the training sentence. From the current or-node of the and-or tree there will be arcs labelled with rule identifiers corresponding to previously stored parse trees. From this or-node we follow an arc labelled Id, or add a new one if there is none. We then reach (or add) an and-node indicating the RHS phrases of the grammar rule named Id. Here we follow each arc leading out from this and-node in turn to accommodate all the subtrees in the list. Each such arc leads to an or-node. We have now reached a point of recursion and can index the corresponding subtree. The recursion terminates if Id is the special rule identifier lex and thus dominates a word of the training sentence, rather than a list of subtrees.","Indexing the four training examples of Figure 1 will result in the and-or tree of Figure 2. Finding the cutnodes Next, we find the set of nodes whose entropies exceed a threshold value. First we need to calculate the entropy of each or-node. We will here describe three different ways of doing this, but there are many others. Before doing this, though, we will discuss the question of redundancy in the resulting set of specialized rules.","We must equate the cutnodes that correspond to the same type of phrase. This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g. an"]},{"title":"NP,","paragraphs":["i.e. where the arcs incident from it are labelled with grammar rules whose left-hand-sides are"]},{"title":"NPs,","paragraphs":["we must allow"]},{"title":"all","paragraphs":["specialized"]},{"title":"NP","paragraphs":["rules to be potentially applicable at this point, not just the ones that are rooted in this node.

Now if nl is a cutnode, then n2 must also be a cutnode even if it has a low entropy value. The following iterative scheme accomplishes this: Function N* (N °) 1. i:=0; 2.

If this latter strategy is used in our example, this will give us the two extra rules of Figure 4. Note that they not correspond to any training example. ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS As mentioned at the beginning, the specialized grammar is compiled into LR parsing tables. Just finding any set of cutnodes that yields the desired coverage will not necessarily result in a grammar that is well suited for LP~ parsing. In particular, LR parsers, like any other parsers employing a bottom-up parsing strategy, do not blend well with empty productions. This is because without top-down filtering, any empty produc-tion is applicable at any point in the input string, and a naive bottom-up parser will loop indefinitely. The LR parsing tables constitute a type of top-down filtering, but this may not be sufficient to guarantee termination, and in any case, a lot of spurious applications of empty productions will most likely take place, degrading performance. For these reasons we will not allow learned rules whose RHSs are empty, but simply refrain from cutting in nodes of the parse trees that do not dominate at least one lexical lookup.","Even so, the scheme described this far is not totally successful, the performance is not as good as using hand-coded tree-cutting criteria. This is conjectured to be an effect of the reduction lengths being far too short. The first reason for this is that for any spurious rule reduction to take place, the corresponding RHS phrases must be on the stack. The likelihood for this to happen by chance decreases drastically with increased rule length. A second reason for this is that the number of states visited will decrease with increasing reduction length. This can most easily be seen by noting that the number of states visited by a deterministic LR parser equals the number of shift actions plus the number of reductions, and equals the number of nodes in the cot-"]},{"title":"193","paragraphs":["responding parse tree, and the longer the reductions, the more shallow the parse tree.","The hand-coded operationality criteria result in an average rule length of four, and a distribution of reduction lengths that is such that only 17 percent are of length one and 11 percent are of length two. This is in sharp contrast to what the above scheme accomplishes; the corresponding figures are about 20 or 30 percent each for lengths one and two.","An attempted solution to this problem is to impose restrictions on neighbouring cutnodes. This can be done in several ways; one that has been tested is to select for each rule the RHS phrase with the least entropy, and prescribe that if a node corresponding to the LHS of the rule is chosen as a cutnode, then no node corresponding to this RHS phrase may be chosen as a cutnode, and vice versa. In case of such a conflict, the node (class) with the lowest entropy is removed from the set of cutnodes.","We modify the function N* to handle this: 2.

This means that even if the induced criteria produce grammars that are a factor two or three slower than this, they are still approximately one and a half order of magnitude faster than the original setup. Also, this is by no means a closed research issue, but merely a first attempt to realize the scheme, and there is no doubt in my mind that it can be improved on most substantially."]},{"title":"SUMMARY","paragraphs":["This article proposes a method for automatically finding the appropriate tree-cutting criteria in the EBG scheme, rather than having to hand-code them.

Although these instruments are currently slightly too blunt to enable producing grammars with the same high performance as the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria, they can most probably be sharpened by future research, and in particular refined to achieve the delicate balance between high coverage and a distribution of reduction lengths that is sufficiently biased towards long reductions. Also, banning recursion by category specialization, i.e. by for example distinguishing NPs that dominate other NPs from those that do not, will he investigated, since this is believed to be an important ingredient in the version of the scheme employing hand-coded tree-cutting criteria."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["This research was made possible by the basic research programme at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS). I wish to thank Manny Rayner of SRI International, Cambridge, for help and support in matters pertaining to the treebank, and for enlightening discussions of the scheme as a whole.
