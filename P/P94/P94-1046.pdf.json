Several researchers (Partee, 1984; Hinrichs, 1986; Nerbonne, 1986; Webber, 1988) have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric, drawing on Reichenbach's separation between event, speech, and reference times (Reichenbach, 1947). Specifically, to account for the forward progression of time induced by successive simple past tenses in a narrative, they treat the simple past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past tense. For instance, in Hinrichs's (1986) proposal, accomplishments and achievements x introduce a new reference point that is temporally ordered after the time of the event itself, \"ensuring that two consecutive accomplishments or achievements in a discourse are always ordered in a temporal sequence.\" On the other hand, Lascarides and Asher (1993) take the view that temporal relations are resolved purely as a by-product of reasoning about coherence relations holding between utterances, and in doing so, argue that treating simple and complex tenses as anaphoric is unnecessary. This approach parallels the treatment of pronoun resolution espoused by Hobbs (1979), in which pronouns are modeled as free variables that are bound as a by-product of coherence resolution. The Temporal Centering framework (Kameyama et"]},{"title":"al.,","paragraphs":["1993) integrates","lWe will limit the scope of this paper by restricting the discussion to accomplishments and achievements. aspects of both approaches, but patterns with the first in treating tense as anaphoric.","We argue that aspects of both analyses are necessary to account for the recovery of temporal relations.

That is, one would predict a clash of temporal relations for sentence (lc), since the simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering.

We hypothesize that hearers assume that speakers are engaging in Narration in absence of a specific cue to the contrary. The use of the past perfect (as in passage (4b)) is one such cue since it implies reversed temporal ordering; the use of an explicit conjunction indicating a coherence relation other than Narration (as in passages (4c-d)) is another such cue. While passage (4a) could be understood as an Explanation on semantic grounds, the hearer assumes Narration since no other relation is cued."]},{"title":"320","paragraphs":["We see several advantages of this approach over that of Lascarides and Asher (1993, henceforth L&A). First, L&A note the incoherence of example (5)","(5) ? Max poured a cup of coffee. He had entered the room. in arguing that the past perfect should not be treated as anaphoric:","(6) Theories that analyse the distinction between the simple past and pluperfect purely in terms of different relations between reference times and event times, rather than in terms of event-connections, fail to explain why [(4b)] is acceptable but [(5)] is awkward. (Lascarides and Asher, 1993, pg. 470) Example (5) indeed shows that coherence relations need to be utilized to account for temporal relations, but it does not bear on the issue of whether the past perfect is anaphoric. The incoherence of example (5) is predicted by both their and our accounts by virtue of the fact that there is no coherence relation that corresponds to Narration with reverse temporal ordering. ~ In addressing this example, L&A specify a special rule (the"]},{"title":"Connections When Changing Tense (CCT) Law)","paragraphs":["that stipulates that a sentence containing the simple past followed by a sentence containing the past perfect can be related only by a subset of the otherwise possible coherence relations. However, this subset contains just those relations that are predicted to be possible by accounts treating the past perfect as anaphoric; they are the ones that do not constrain the temporal order of the events against displaying backward progression of time. Therefore, we see no advantages to adopting their rule; furthermore, they do not comment on what other laws have to be stipulated to account for the facts concerning other possible tense combinations.","Second, to explain why the Explanation relation can be inferred for passage (4b) but not for passage (4a), L&A stipulate that their causal"]},{"title":"Slipping Law","paragraphs":["(stating that spilling can cause slipping) requires that the CCT Law be satisfied. This constraint is imposed only to require that the second clause contain the past perfect instead of the simple past. However, this does not explain why the use of the simple past is perfectly coherent when the Explanation relationship is indicated overtly as it is in sentence (4c), nor do they adequately explain why CCT must be satisfied for this causal law and not for those supporting similar examples for which they successfully infer an unsignaled Explanation relation (see discussion of example (2), pg. 463).","Third, the L&A account does not explain why the past perfect cannot stand alone nor discourses generally be opened with it; consider stating sentence (7) in isolation: (7) Max had spilt a bucket of water.","5For instance, in the same way that Explanation corresponds to Cause-Effect with reverse temporal ordering. Intuitively, such usage is infelicitous because of a dependency on a contextually salient time which has not been previously introduced. This is not captured by the L&A account because sentences containing the past perfect are treated as sententially equivalent to those containing the simple past. On the other hand, sentences in the simple past are perfectly felicitous in standing alone or opening a discourse, introducing an asymmetry in accounts treating the simple past as anaphoric to a previously evoked time. All Of these facts are explained by the account given here. Conclusion We have given an account of temporal relations whereby (1) tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possibly anaphorieally-resolved discourse reference time, and (2) the resultant temporal relations may be further refined by constraints that coherence relations impose. This work is being expanded to address issues pertain-ing to discourse structure and inter-segment coherence.
