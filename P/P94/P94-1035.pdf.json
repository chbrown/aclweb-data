We provide constraints to specify HPSG style set descriptions, fixed cardinality set descriptions, set-membership constraints, restricted universal role quantifications, set union, intersection, subset and disjointness. A sound, complete and terminating consistency checking procedure is provided to determine the consistency of any given term in the logic. It is shown that determining consistency of terms is a NP-complete problem. Subject Areas: feature logic, constraint-based grammars, HPSG 1 Introduction Grammatical formalisms such as HPSG [Pollard and Sag, 1987] [Pollard and Sag, 1992] and LFG [Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982] employ feature descriptions [Kasper and Rounds, 1986] [Smolka, 1992] as the primary means for stating linguistic theories. However the descriptive machinery employed by these formalisms easily exceed the descriptive machinery available in feature logic [Smolka, 1992]. Furthermore the descriptive machinery employed by both HPSG and LFG is difficult (if not impossible) to state in feature based formalisms such as ALE [Carpenter, 1993], TFS [Zajac, 1992] and CUF [D6rre and Dorna, 1993] which augment feature logic with a type system. One such expressive device employed both within LFG [Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982] and HPSG but is unavailable in feature logic is that of set descriptions. Although various researchers have studied set descriptions (with different semantics) [Rounds, 1988] [Pollard and Moshier, 1990] two issues remain unaddressed. Firstly there has not been any work on consistency checking techniques for feature terms augmented with set descriptions. Secondly, for applications within grammatical theories such as the HPSG formalism, set descriptions alone are not enough since descriptions involving set union are also needed. Thus to adequately address the knowledge representation needs of current linguistic theories one needs to provide set descriptions as well as mechanisms to manipulate these. In the HPSG grammar formalism [Pollard and Sag, 1987], set descriptions are employed for the modelling of so called"]},{"title":"semantic indices","paragraphs":["([Pollard and Sag, 1987]"]},{"title":"pp.","paragraphs":["104).

Alternatively, we can assume that N is the only multi-valued relation symbol while both SUBCAT and C-DTRS are single-valued and then employ the intuitively appealing subcategorisation principle given in (4). (4) Subcategorisation Principle TRS [H-DTRISYNILOCISUBCATIN N(X) ~ N(Y) C-DTRS X With the availability of set operations, multi-valued structures can be incrementally built. For instance, by employing union operations, semantic indices can be incrementally constructed and by employing membership constraints on the set of semantic indices pronoun resolution may be carried out. The set difference operation f : g(y) - h(z) is not available from the constructs described so far. However, assume that we are given the term x R f : g(y) - h(z) and it is known that hZ(~(z)) C_ gZ(a(y)) for every interpretation 27, (~ such that [x R f : g(y)- h(z)~ z,~ ¢ 0. Then the term x N f : g(y) - h(z) (assuming the obvious interpretation for the set difference operation) is consistent iff the term y [] g : f(x) t~ h(z) is consistent. This is so since for setsG, F,H:G-F=HAFCG i]:f G = F W H. See figure 1 for verification. 3 Consistency checking To employ a term language for knowledge representation tasks or in constraint programming languages the minimal operation that needs to be supported is that of consistency checking of terms. A term T is consistent if there exists an interpretation 2: and an/:-assignment (~ such that [T] z'a ~ 0. In order to develop constraint solving algorithms for consistency testing of terms we follow the approaches in [Smolka, 1992] [Hollunder and Nutt, 1990]. A containment constraint is a constraint of the form x = T where x is a variable and T is an term.","Constraint simplification rules - I","x=yACs","(SEquals) x = y A [x/y]Cs if x ~ y and x occurs in Cs","(SConst) x=~Ay=~ACs","x=yAx=~ACs where ~ ranges over a, c.","(SFeat) x= f :yAx= F :zZACs","x=/:yAy= ACs where F ranges over f, 3f, Vf","(SExists) x=gf:yAx=Vf:zAC~","x= f :yAy=zACs (SForallE) x = V__] : C A x = 9f : y A C~_","x =V/: CAx = 3/: yAy = CAC~ if C ranges over C, -~C, -~a, --c, -~z and Cs Vy =C.

The first phase of consistency checking of a term T consists of exhaustively applying the decomposition rules to an initial constraint of the form x = T (where x does not occur in T) until no rules are applicable. This transforms any given constraint system into basic form. The constraint simplification rules (see figures 3, 4 and 5 ) either eliminate variable equalities of the form x = y or generate them from existing constraints. However, they do not introduce new variables. The constraint simplification rules given in figure 3 are the analog of the feature simplification rules provided in [Smolka, 1991]. The main difference being that our simplification rules have been modified to deal with relation symbols as opposed to just feature symbols. The constraint simplification rules given in figure 4 simplify constraints involving set descriptions when they interact with other constraints such as feature constraints - rule (SSetF), singleton sets - rule (SSet), duplicate elements in a set - rule (SDup), universally quantified constraint - rule (SForall), another set description - rule (SSetSet). Rule (SDis) on the other hand simplifies disjunctive constraints. Amongst all simplification rules - II the constraint simplification rules in figures 3 and 4 only rule (SDis) is non-deterministic and creates a n-ary choice point. Rules (SSet) and (SDup) are redundant as completeness (see section below) is not affected by these rules. However these rules result in a simpler normal form. The following syntactic notion of entailment is employed to render a slightly compact presentation of the constraint solving rules for dealing with set operations given in figure 5. A constraint system Cs syntactically entails the (conjunction of) constraint(s) ¢ if Cs F ¢ is derivable from the following deduction rules: 1. ¢AC8 F¢ 2. C~Fx=x 3. CsFx=y >CsFy=x 4.

Also in the presence of x = f : g(y) U h(z) rule (UDown) non-deterministically propagates an I-value of x to either an g-value of y or an h-value of z (if neither already holds). The notation y = 3g : xi ] z = 3h : xi denotes a non-deterministic choice between y = 3g : x~ and z = 3h : xi. Rule (nDown) propagates an f-value of x both as a g-value of y and h-value of z in the presence of the constraint x = f : g(y) n h(z). Finally, rule (nUp) propagates a common g-value of y and h-value of z as an f-value of x in the presence of the constraint x = f : g(y) n h(z). 4 Invariance, Completeness and Termination In this section we establish the main results of this paper - namely that our consistency checking procedure for set descriptions and set operations is invariant, complete and terminating. In other words, we have a decision procedure for determining the consistency of terms in our extended feature logic. For the purpose of showing invariance of our rules we distinguish between deterministic and non-deterministic rules. Amongst all our rules only rule (SDis) given in figure 4 and rule (UDown) are non-deterministic while all the other rules are deterministic. Theorem 2 (Invariance) 1.

Hence, we conclude that determining consistency of terms is NP-complete. 6 Translation","to Sch6nfinkel-Bernays class The Schhnfinkel-Bernays class (see [Lewis, 1980]) consists of function-free first-order formulae which have 260 the form:","3xt ... xnVyl • .. ym6 In this section we show that the attributive logic developed in this paper can be encoded within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays subclass of first-order formulae by extending the approach developed in [Johnson, 1991]. However formulae such as V f : (3 f : (Vf : T)) which involve an embedded existential quantification cannot be translated into the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class. This means that an unrestricted variant of our logic which does not restrict the universal role quantification cannot be expressed within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class. In order to put things more concretely, we provide a translation of every construct in our logic into the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class. Let T be any extended feature term. Let x be a variable free in T. Then T is consistent iff the formula (x = T) 6 is consistent where 6 is a translation function from our extended feature logic into the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class. Here we provide only the essential definitions of 6: • • =x#a","• (x = f : T) ~ =","f(x, y) & (y = T) ~ ~ Vy'(f(x, y') -+ y = y') where y is a new variable","• (x=qf:T) ~=f(x,y) & (y=T) '~ where y is a new variable","• (x = V f: a) ~ = Vy(f(x,y) --+ y = a)","• (x = V f: ~a) ~ = Vy(f(x,y) .-+ y # a)","• (x = f: {T1,...,Tn}) ~ --","f(X, Xl) & ... ~ f(X, Xn),~","Vy(f(x,y) --~ y = Xl V ... V y = xn)&","(xl = T1) & ... & (zl = where Xl ,..., Xn are new variables","• (x = f: g(y) U h(z)) ~ ="]},{"title":"Vxi(f(x,","paragraphs":["xi) -'+ g(y, xi) V h(z, xi)) ~:","Vy,(g(y, Yi) -4 f(x, Yi)) &","Vzi(h(z, zi) -+ f(x, zi)) • (x = f: (y) # g(z)) ~ =","Vyizj(f(y, yi) & g(z, zi) --+ Yi # zi) • (x=SlqT) '~=(x=S) ~ & (x=T) ~ These translation rules essentially mimic the decomposition rules given in figure 2. Furthermore for every atom a and every feature f in T we need the following axiom: • Vax(-~f(a,"]},{"title":"x))","paragraphs":["For every distinct atoms a, b in T we need the axiom: •a#b Taking into account the NP-completeness result established earlier this translation identifies a NP-complete subclass of formulae within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class which is suited for NL applications. 7 Related Work Feature logics and concept languages suchas KL-ONE are closely related family of languages [Nebel and Smolka, 1991]. The principal difference being that feature logics interpret attributive labels as functional binary relations while concept languages interpret them as just binary relations. However the integration of concept languages with feature logics has been problematic due to the fact the while path equations do not lead to increased computational complexity in feature logic the addition of role-value-maps (which are the relational analog of path equations) in concept languages causes undecidability [Schmidt-Schant3, 1989]. This blocks a straightforward integration of a variable-free concept language such as ALC [Schmidt-SchanB and Smolka, 1991] with a variable-free feature logic [Smolka, 1991]. In [Manandhax, 1993] the addition of variables, feature symbols and set descriptions to ALC is investigated providing an alternative method for integrating concept languages and feature logics. It is shown that set descriptions can be translated into the so called \"number restrictions\" available within concept languages such as BACK [yon Luck et al., 1987]. However, the propositionally complete languages ALV and ALS investigated in [Manandhar, 1993] are PSPACE-hard languages which do not support set operations. The work described in this paper describes yet another unexplored dimension for concept languages - that of a restricted concept language with variables, feature symbols, set descriptions and set operations for which the consistency checking problem is within the complexity class NP. 8 Summary and Conclusions In this paper we have provided an extended feature logic (excluding disjunctions and negations) with a range of constraints involving set descriptions. These constraints are set descriptions, fixed cardinality \"set descriptions, set-membership constraints, restricted universal role quantifications, set union, set intersection, subset and disjointness. We have given a model theoretic semantics to our extended logic which shows that a simple and elegant formalisation of set descriptions is possible if we add relational attributes to our logic as opposed to just functional attributes available in feature logic. For realistic implementation of the logic described in this paper, further investigation is needed to develop concrete algorithms that are reasonably efficient in the average case. The consistency checking procedure described in this paper abstracts away from algorithmic considerations and clearly modest improvements to the basic algorithm suggested in this paper are feasible. However, a report on such improvements is beyond the scope of this paper. For applications within constraint based grammar formalisms such as HPSG, minimally a type system [Carpenter, 1992] and/or a Horn-like extension [HShfeld and Smolka, 1988] will be necessary. We believe that the logic described in this paper provides both a better picture of the formal aspects of"]},{"title":"261","paragraphs":["current constraint based grammar formalisms which employ set descriptions and at the same time gives a basis for building knowledge representation tools in order to support grammar development within these formalisms."]},{"title":"9","paragraphs":["Acknowledgments The work described here has been carried out as part of the EC-funded project LRE-61-061 RGR (Reusability of Grammatical Resources).
