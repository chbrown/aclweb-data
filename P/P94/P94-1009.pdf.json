Its main features are 1) a discourse-plan-based approach to implicature, 2) a reversible architecture for generation and interpretation, 3) a hybrid reasoning model that employs both plan inference and logical inference, and 4) use of stimulus conditions to model a speaker's motivation for providing appropriate, unrequested information. The model handles a wider range of types of indirect answers than previous computational models and has several significant advantages. 1. INTRODUCTION Imagine a discourse context for (1) in which R's use of just (ld) is intended to convey a No, i.e., that R is not going shopping tonight. (By convention, square brackets indicate that the enclosed text was not explicitly stated.) The part of R's response consisting of (ld) - (le) is what we call an indirect answer to a Yes-No question, and if (lc) had been uttered, (lc) would have been called a direct answer.","l.a. Q: I need a ride to the mall. b. Are you going shopping tonight? c. R: [no] d. My car's not running. e. The rear axle is broken.","According to one study of spoken English [Stenstrhm, 1984], 13 percent of responses to Yes-No questions were indirect answers. Thus, the ability to interpret indirect answers is required for robust dialogue systems. Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating indirect answers in-stead of just yes, no, or I don't know. First, they may provide information which is needed to avoid misleading the questioner [Hirschberg, 1985]. Second, they contribute to an efficient dialogue by anticipating follow-up questions. Third, they may be used for social reasons, as in (1).","This paper provides a computational model for the interpretation and generation of indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English. More precisely, by a Yes-No question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q (the questioner) that R (the responder) convey R's evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. An indirect answer implicitly conveys via one or more utterances R's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition p, i.e. that p is true, that p is false, that there is some truth to p, that p may be true, or that p may be false. Our model presupposes that Q's question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q's request was appropriate, and that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative goal-directed dialogue. The interpretation and generation components of the model have been implemented in Common Lisp on a Sun SPARCstation.","The model employs an agent's pragmatic knowledge of how language typically is used to answer Yes-No questions in English to constrain the process of generating and interpreting indirect answers. This knowledge is encoded as a set of domain-independent discourse plan operators and a set of coherence rules, described in section 2.1 Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system. It is reversible in that the same pragmatic knowledge is used by the interpretation and generation modules. The interpretation algorithm, described in section 3, is a hybrid approach employing both plan inference and logical inference to infer R's discourse plan. The generation algorithm, described in section 4, constructs R's discourse plan in two phases. During the first phase, stimulus conditions are used to trigger goals to include appropriate, extra information in the response plan. In the second phase, the response plan is pruned to eliminate parts which can be inferred by Q.","hOur main sources of data were previous studies [Hirschberg, 1985, Stenstrhm, 1984], transcripts of naturally occurring two-person dialogue [American Express transcripts, 1992], and constructed examples."]},{"title":"58","paragraphs":["discourse plan operators discourse expectation response --I INTERPRETATION I I G:NERATION I coherence rules discourse expectation R's beliefs Figure 1: Architecture of system"]},{"title":"2.

Furthermore, Q's assumption that R's response is relevant triggers Q's at-tempt to interpret R's response as providing the requested information.

Second, as the number of non-hypothesized propositions accounted for by the plan increases, its plausibility increases.","To summarize the interpretation algorithm, it is primarily expectation-driven in the sense that the answer interpreter attempts to interpret R's response as an answer generated by some answer discourse plan operator. Whenever the answer interpreter is unable to relate an utterance to the plan which it is currently attempting to recognize, the answer interpreter attempts to find a connec-tion by hypothesis generation. Logical inference plays a supplementary role, namely, in consistency checking (including inferring the plausibility of coherence relations) and in hypothesis generation. 4. GENERATION The inputs to generation consist of 1) the same sets of discourse plan operators and coherence rules used in interpretation, 2) R's beliefs, and 3) the same discourse expectation. The output is a","9Note that, in general, any nodes on the path between p0 and Ph, where Ph is the hypothesis returned, will be used as additional hypotheses (later) to connect what was said to ph.","1°Another possible criterion is whether the actual ordering reflects the default ordering specified in the discourse plan operators. We plan to test the usefulness of this criterion. discourse plan for an answer (indirect, if possible). Generation of an indirect reply has two phases: 1) content planning, in which the generator creates a discourse plan for a full answer, and 2) plan prun-ing, in which the generator determines which parts of the planned full answer do not need to be explicitly stated. For example, given an appropriate set of R's beliefs, our system generates a plan for asserting only the proposition conveyed in (le) as an answer to (lb). 11","Content-planning is performed by top-down expansion of an answer discourse plan operator. Note that applicability conditions prevent inappropriate use of an operator, but they do not model a speaker's motivation for providing extra information. Further, a full answer might provide too much information if every satellite whose operator's applicability conditions held were included in a full answer. On the other hand, at the time R is asked the question, R may not yet have the primary goals of a potential satellite. To overcome these limitations, we have incorporated stimulus conditions into the discourse plan operators in our model. As mentioned in section 2, stimulus conditions can be thought of as triggers or motivating conditions which give rise to new speaker goals. By analyzing the speaker's possible motivation for providing extra information in the examples in our corpus, we have identified a small set of stimulus conditions which reflect general concerns of accuracy, efficiency, and politeness. In order for a satellite to be included in a full answer, all of its applicability conditions and at least one of its stimulus conditions must hold. (A theorem prover is used to search for an instantiation of the existential variable satisfying the above conditions.)","The output of the content-planning phase, a discourse plan representing a full answer, is the input to the plan-pruning phase. The goal of this phase is to make the response more concise, i.e. to determine which of the planned acts can be omitted while still allowing Q to infer the full plan. To do this, the generator considers each of the acts in the frontier of the full plan tree from right to left (thus ensuring that a satellite is considered before its nucleus). The generator creates trial plans consisting of the original plan minus the nodes pruned so far and minus the current node. Then, the generator simulates Q's interpretation of the trial plan. If Q could infer the full plan (as the most preferred plan), then the current node can be pruned. Note that, even when it is not possible to prune the direct answer, a benefit of this approach is that it generates appropriate extra information with direct answers.","11The tactical component must choose an appropriate expression to refer to R's car's timing belt, depending on whether (ld) is omitted."]},{"title":"63 5. RELATED RESEARCH","paragraphs":["It has been noted [Diller, 1989, Hirsehberg, 1985, Lakoff, 1973] that indirect answers conversationally implicale [Grice, 1975] direct answers. Recently, philosophers [Thomason, 1990, MeCafferty, 1987] have argued for a plan-based approach to conversational implicature. Plan-based computational models have been proposed for similar discourse interpretation problems, e.g. indirect speech acts [Perrault and Allen, 1980, Hinkelman, 1989], but none of these models address the interpretation of indirect answers. Also, our use of coherence relations, both 1) as constraints on the relevance of indirect answers, and 2) in our hypothesis generation algorithm, is unique in plan-based interpretation models.","In addition to RST, a number of theories of text coherence have been proposed [Grimes, 1975, Halliday, 1976, Hobbs, 1979, Polanyi, 1986, Reiehman, 1984]. Coherence relations have been used in interpretation [Dahlgren, 1989, Wu and Lytinen, 1990]. However, inference of coherence relations alone is insufficient for interpreting indirect answers, since additional pragmatic knowledge (what we represent as discourse plan operators) and discourse expectations are necessary also. Coherence relations have been used in generation [MeKeown, 1985, Hovy, 1988, Moore and Paris, 1988, Horacek, 1992] but none of these models generate indirect answers. Also, our use of stimulus conditions is unique in generation models.","Most previous formal and computational models of conversational implicature [Gazdar, 1979, Green, 1990, Hirschberg, 1985, Lasearides and Asher, 1991] derive implieatures by classical or nonclassical logical inference with one or more licensing rules defining a class of implicatures. Our coherence rules are similar conceptually to the licensing rules in Lascarides et al.'s model of temporal implicature. (However, different coherence relations play a role in indirect answers.) While Lascarides et al. model temporal implicatures as defeasible inferences, such an approach to indirect answers would fail to distinguish what R intends to convey by his response from other default inferences. We claim that R's response in (1), for example, does not warrant the attribution to R of the intention to convey that the rear axle of R's car is made of metal. Hirsehberg's model for deriving scalar implicatures addresses only a few of the types of indirect answers that our model does. Further-more, our discourse-plan-based approach avoids problems faced by licensing-rule-based approaches in handling backward cancellation and multiple-utterance responses [Green and Carberry, 1992]. Also, a potential problem faced by those approaches is scalability, i.e., as licensing rules for handling more types of implieature are added, rule conflicts may arise and tractability may decrease. In contrast, our approach avoids such problems by restricting the use of logical inference."]},{"title":"6. CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["We have described our implemented computational model for interpreting and generating indirect answers to Yes-No questions. Its main features are 1) a discourse-plan-based approach to implicature, 2) a reversible architecture, 3) a hybrid reasoning model, and 4) use of stimulus conditions for modeling a speaker's motivation for providing appropriate extra information. The model handles a wider range of types of indirect answers than previous computational models. Further-more, since Yes-No questions and their answers have features in common with other types of adjacency pairs [Levinson, 1983], we expect that this approach can be extended to them as well. Finally, a discourse-plan-based approach to implicature has significant advantages over a licensing-rule-based approach. In the future, we would like to integrate our interpretation and generation components with a dialogue system and investigate other factors in generating indirect answers (e.g. multiple goals, stylistic concerns).
