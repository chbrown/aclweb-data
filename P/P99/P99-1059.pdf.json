Such formalisms specify syntactic facts about each word of the language--in particular, the type of arguments that the word can or must take. Early mechanisms of this sort included categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953) and subcategorization frames (Chomsky, 1965). Other lexicalized formalisms include (Schabes et al., 1988; Mel'~uk, 1988; Pollard and Sag, 1994).","Besides the possible arguments of a word, a natural-language grammar does well to specify possible head words for those arguments. \"Convene\" requires an NP object, but some NPs are more semantically or lexically appropriate here than others, and the appropriateness depends largely on the NP's head (e.g., \"meeting\"). We use the general term bilexical for a grammar that records such facts. A bilexical grammar makes many stipulations about the compatibility of particular pairs of words in particular roles. The acceptability of \"Nora convened the \" The authors were supported respectively under ARPA Grant N6600194-C-6043 \"Human Language Technology\" and Ministero dell'Universitk e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica project \"Methodologies and Tools of High Performance Systems for Multimedia Applications.\" party\" then depends on the grammar writer's assessment of whether parties can be convened.","Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997). The rationale is that soft selectional restrictions play a crucial role in disambiguation, i","The chart parsing algorithms used by most of the above authors run in time O(nS), because bilexical grammars are enormous (the part of the grammar relevant to a length-n input has size O(n 2) in practice). Heavy probabilistic pruning is therefore needed to get acceptable runtimes. But in this paper we show that the complexity is not so bad after all:","• For bilexicalized context-free grammars, O(n 4) is possible.","• The O(n 4) result also holds for head automaton grammars.","• For a very common special case of these grammars where an O(n 3) algorithm was previously known (Eisner, 1997), the grammar constant can be reduced without harming the"]},{"title":"O(n 3)","paragraphs":["property.

This formalism closely resembles stochastic grammatical formalisms that are used in several existing natural language processing systems (see §1). We will specify a non-stochastic version, noting that probabilities or other weights may be attached to the rewrite rules exactly as in stochastic CFG (Gonzales and Thomason, 1978; Wetherell, 1980).

An-notating our left half-constituents with s makes this check possible. 9 Final remarks We have formally described, and given faster parsing algorithms for, three practical grammatical rewriting systems that capture dependencies between pairs of words. All three systems admit naive O(n 5) algorithms. We give the first O(n 4) results for the natural formalism of bilexical context-free grammar, and for AIshawi's (1996) head automaton grammars. For the usual case, split head automaton grammars or equivalent bilexical CFGs, we replace the O(n 3) algorithm of (Eisner, 1997) by one with a smaller grammar constant. Note that, e.g., all senses would restore the g2 factor. Indeed, this approach gives added flexibility: a word's sense, unlike its choice of flip state, is visible to the HA that reads it. three models in (Collins, 1997) are susceptible to the O(n 3) method (cf. Collins's O(nh)).","Our dynamic programming techniques for cheaply attaching head information to derivations can also be exploited in parsing formalisms other than rewriting systems. The authors have developed an O(nT)-time parsing algorithm for bilexicalized tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992), improving the naive O(n s) method.","The results mentioned in §6 are related to the closure property of CFGs under generalized sequential machine mapping (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979). This property also holds for our class of bilexical CFGs.","References","A. V. Aho and J. D. Ullman. 1972. The Theory of Parsing, Translation and Compiling, volume 1.

The format is as in Figure 1, except that (c) gives the acceptance condition. The following notation indicates that a head automaton can consume a string x from its left or right input: a : q x) qr means that (q, e, x) ~-a (q', e, c), and a : I x ~ q, means this is true for some q E Ia. Similarly, a : q' ~ x q means that (q, x, e) t-* (q~, c, c), and a : F (x q means this is true for some q~ E Fa. The special symbol F also appears as a literal in some items, and effectively means \"an unspecified final state.\"","M. Kay. 1986. Algorithm schemata and data structures in syntactic processing.
