Roughly speaking, Japanese noun phrase N1 no N2 corresponds to English noun phrase N2 of N1. However, the Japanese postposition no has much broader us-age than of as follows: watashi 'I' no kuruma 'car' tsukue 'desk' no ashi 'leg' gray no seihuku 'uniform' possession whole-part modification senmonka 'expert' no chousa 'study'","agent rugby no coach subject yakyu 'baseball' no senshu 'player'","category kaze 'cold' no virus result ryokou 'travel' no jyunbi 'preparation'","purpose toranpu 'card' no tejina 'trick' instrument","The conventional approach to this problem was to classify semantic relations, such as possession, whole-part, modification, and others. Then, classification rules were crafted by hand, or detected from relation-tagged examples by a machine learning technique (Shimazu et al., 1987; Sumita et al., 1990; Tomiura et al., 1995; Kurohashi et al., 1998).","The problem in such an approach is to set up the semantic relations. For example, the above examples and their classification came from the IPA nominal dictionary (Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan, 1996). Is it possible to find clear boundaries among subject, category, result, purpose, instrument, and others? No matter how fine-grained relations we set up, we always encounter phrases which are on the boundary or belong to two or more relations.","This paper proposes a completely different approach to the task, which exploits semantic role information of nouns in an ordinary dictionary. 2 Semantic Roles of"]},{"title":"Nouns","paragraphs":["The meaning of a word can be recognized by the relationship with its semantic roles. In the case of verbs, the arguments of the predicates constitute the semantic roles, and a considerable number of studies have been made. For example, the case grammar theory is a semantic valence theory that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a predicate and a series of case-labeled arguments such as agent, object, location, source, goal (Fillmore, 1968). Further-more, a wide-coverage dictionary describing semantic roles of verbs in machine readable form has been constructed by a great deal of labor (Ikehara et al., 1997).","Not only verbs, but also nouns can have semantic roles. For example, coach is a coach of some sport; virus is a virus causing some disease. Unlike the case of verbs, no semantic-481 Table 1: Semantic relations in N1 no N2 Relation Noun Phrase N1 no N2 Verb Phrase Semantic-role rugby no coach, kaze 'cold' no virus, tsukue 'desk' no ashi 'leg', ryokou 'travel' no jyunbi 'preparation' hon-wo 'book-Ace' yomu 'read' Agent senmonka 'expert' no chousa 'study' kare-ga"]},{"title":"'he-NOM'","paragraphs":["yomu 'read' Possession watashi 'I' no kuruma 'car' Belonging gakkou 'school' no sensei 'teacher' Time aki 'autumn' no hatake 'field' 3ji-ni 'at 3 o'clock' yomu 'read' Place Kyoto no raise 'store' heya-de 'in room' yomu 'read' Modification gray no seihuku 'uniform' isoide 'hurriedly' yomu 'read' huzoku 'attached' no neji 'screw' ki 'wooden' no hako 'box' Complement kimono no jyosei 'lady' nobel-sho 'Nobel prize' no kisetsu 'season' role dictionary for nouns has been constructed so far. However, in many cases, semantic roles of nouns are described in an ordinary dictionary for human being. For example, a Japanese dictionary for children, Reikai Shougaku Kokugojiten (abbreviated to RSK) (Tadil~, 1997), gives the definition of the word coach and virus as follows 1:","coach a person who teaches technique in some sport","virus a living thing even smaller than bacteria which causes infectious disease like in-fluenza","If an NLP system can utilize these definitions as they are, we do not need to take the trouble in constructing a semantic-role dictionary for nouns in the special format for machine-use."]},{"title":"3 Interpretation","paragraphs":["of N1 no N2"]},{"title":"using a","paragraphs":["Dictionary Semantic-role information of nouns in an ordinary dictionary can be utilized to solve the difficult problem in the semantic analysis of N1","1Although our method handles Japanese noun phrases by using Japanese definition sentences, in this paper we use their English translations for the explanation. In some sense, the essential point of our method is language-independent. no N2 phrases. In other words, we can say the problem disappears.","For example, rugby no coach can be interpreted by the definition of coach as follows: the dictionary describes that the noun coach has an semantic role of sport, and the phrase rugby no coach specifies that the sport is rugby. That is, the interpretation of the phrase can be regarded as matching rugby in the phrase to some sport in the coach definition. Furthermore, based on this interpretation, we can paraphrase rugby no coach into a person who teaches technique in rugby, by replacing some sport in the definition with rugby.","Kaze 'cold' no virus is also easily interpreted based on the definition of virus, linking kaze 'cold' to infectious disease.","Such a dictionary-based method can handle interpretation of most phrases where conventional classification-based analysis failed. As a result, we can arrange the diversity of N1 no N2 senses simply as in Table 1.","The semantic-role relation is a relation that N1 fills in an semantic role of"]},{"title":"N2.","paragraphs":["When"]},{"title":"N2","paragraphs":["is an action noun, an object-action relation is also regarded as a semantic-role relation.","On the other hand, in the agent, possession and belonging relations, N1 and N2 have a weaker relationship. In theory, any action can be done by anyone (my study, his reading, etc.); 482 anything can be possessed by anyone (my pen, his feeling, etc.); and anyone can belong to any organization (I belong to a university, he be-longs to any community, etc.).","The difference between the semantic-role relation and the agent, possession, belonging relations can correspond to the difference between the agent and the object of verbs. In general, the object has a stronger relationship with a verb than the agent, which leads several asymmetrical linguistic phenomena.","The time and place relations have much clearer correspondence to optional cases for verbs. A modification relation is also parallel to modifiers for verbs. If a phrase has a modification relation, it can be paraphrased into N2 is N1, like gray no seihuku 'uniform' is paraphrased into seihuku 'uniform' is gray.","The last relation, the complement relation is the most difficult to interpret. The relation between N1 and N2 does not come from Nl'S semantic roles, or it is not so weak as the other relations. For example, kimono no jyosei 'lady' means a lady wearing a kimono, and nobel-sho 'Nobel prize' no kisetsu 'season' means a season when the Nobel prizes are awarded. Since automatic interpretation of the complement relation is much more difficult than that of other relations, it is beyond the scope of this paper. 4 Analysis Method Once we can arrange the diversity of N1 no N 2 senses as in Table 1, their analysis becomes very simple, consisting of the following two modules:","1. Dictionary-based analysis (abbreviated to DBA hereafter) for semantic-role relations.","2. Semantic feature-based analysis (abbreviated to SBA hereafter) for some semantic-role relations and all other relations.","After briefly introducing resources employed, we explain the algorithm of the two analyses. 4.1","Resources 4.1.1"]},{"title":"RSK","paragraphs":["RSK (Reikai Shougaku Kokugojiten), a Japanese dictionary for children, is used to find semantic roles of nouns in DBA. The reason why we use a dictionary for children is that, generally speaking, definition sentences of such a dictionary are described by basic words, which helps the system finding links between N1 and a semantic role of a head word.","All definition sentences in RSK were analyzed by JUMAN, a Japanese morphological analyzer, and KNP, a Japanese syntactic and case analyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998). Then, a genus word for a head word, like a person for coach were detected in the definition sentences by simple rules: in a Japanese definition sentence, the last word is a genus word in almost all cases; if there is a noun coordination at the end, all of those nouns are regarded as genus words. 4.1.2 NTT Semantic Feature"]},{"title":"Dictionary","paragraphs":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories (NTT CS Lab) constructed a semantic feature tree, whose 3,000 nodes are semantic features, and a nominal dictionary containing about 300,000 nouns, each of which is given one or more appropriate semantic features.

One of these interpretations would be preferred depending on context, but this is a perfect analysis expected for N1 no N2 analysis. 5 Experiment and Discussion 5.1 Experimental Evaluation We have collected 300 test N1 no N2 phrases from EDR dictionary (Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute Ltd., 1995), IPA dictionary (Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan, 1996), and literatures on N1 no N2 phrases, paying attention so that they had enough diversity in their relations. Then, we analyzed the test phrases by our system, and checked the analysis results by hand.","Table 2 shows the reasonably good result both of DBA and SBA. The precision of DBA, the ratio of correct analyses to detected analyses, was 77% (=137/(137+19+21)); the recall of DBA, the ratio of correct analyses to potential semantic-role relations, was 78% (=137/(137+19+19)). The result of SBA is also good, excepting modification relation.","Some phrases were given two or more relations. On average, 1.1 relations were given to one phrase. The ratio that at least one correct relation was detected was 81% (=242/300); the ratio that all possibly correct relations were detected and no incorrect relation was detected was 73% (=219/300). 5.2","Discussion of Correct Analysis The success ratio above was reasonably good, but we would like to emphasize many interesting and promising examples in the analysis results.","(5) mado 'window' no curtain 'curtain'","curtain a hanging cloth that can be","drawn to cover a window1.0 in a","room0.s3, to divide a room0.s3, etc.","(6) osetsuma 'living room' no curtain 'curtain'","curtain a hanging cloth that can be","drawn to cover a window0.s2 in a","room 1.0, to divide a room 1.0, etc.","(7) oya 'parent' no isan 'legacy' lagacy property left on the death of","the owner 0.s4","Mado 'window' no curtain must embarrass conventional classification-based methods; it might be place, whole-part, purpose, or some other relation like being close. However, DBA can clearly explain the relation. Osetuma 'living room' no curtain is another interestingly analyzed phrase. DBA not only interprets it in a simple sense, but also provides us with more interesting information that a curtain might be being used for partition in the living room. 486","The analysis result of oya 'parent' no isan 'legacy' is also interesting. Again, not only the correct analysis, but also additional information was given by DBA. That is, the analysis result tells us that the parent died. Such information would facilitate intelligent peformance in a dialogue system analyzing:","User : I bought a brand-new car by the legacy from my parent.","System : Oh, when did your parent die? I didn't know that.","By examining these analysis results, we can conclude that the dictionary-based understanding approach can provide us with much richer information than the conventional classification-based approaches. 5.3 Discussion of Incorrect Analysis It is possible to classify some of the causes of incorrect analyses arising from our method.","One problem is that a definition sentence does not always describe well the semantic roles as follows:","(8) shiire 'stocking' no saikaku 'resoucefulness' resoucefulness the ability to use one's","head 0.1s cleverly Saikaku 'resourcefulness' can be the ability for some task, but the definition says nothing about that. On the other hand, the definition of sainou 'talent' is clearer about the semantic role as shown below. Concequently, shii~e 'stocking' no sainou 'tMent' can be interpretted correctly by DBA.","(9) shiire 'stocking' no sainou 'talent' talent power and skill, esp. to do","something 0.90 This represents an elementary problem of our method. Out of 175 phrases which should be interpreted as semantic-role relation based on the dictionary, 13 were not analyzed correctly because of this type of problem.","However, such a problem can be solved by revising the definition sentences, of course in natural language. This is a humanly reason-able task, very different from the conventional approach where the classification should be reconsidered, or the classification rules should be modified.","Another problem is that sometimes the similarity calculated by NTT semantic feature dictionary is not high enough to correspond as follows:","(10) ume 'ume flowers' no meisho 'famous place' famous place a place being famous for","scenery 0.20, etc. In some cases the structure of NTT semantic feature dictionary is questionable; in some cases a definition sentence is too rigid; in other cases an input phrase is a bit metaphorical.","As for SBA, most relations can be detected well by simple rules. However, it is not possible to detect a modification relation accurately only by using NTT semantic feature dictionary, because modifier and non-modifier nouns are often mixed in the same semantic feature category. Other proper resource should be incorporated; one possibility is to use the dictionary definition of N1. 6 Related Work From the view point of semantic roles of nouns, there have been several related research conducts: the mental space theory is discussing the functional behavior of nouns (Fauconnier, 1985); the generative lexicon theory accounts for the problem of creative word senses based on the qualia structure of a word (Pustejovsky, 1995); Dahl et al. (1987) and Macleod et al. (1997) discussed the treatment of nominalizations. Compared with these studies, the point of this paper is that an ordinary dictionary can be a useful resource of semantic roles of nouns.","Our approach using an ordinary dictionary is similar to the approach used to creat Mind-Net (Richardson et al., 1998). However, the semanitc analysis of noun phrases is a much more specialized and suitable application of utilizing dictionary entries. 7","Conclusion The paper proposed a method of analyzing Japanese N1 no N2 phrases based on a dictionary, interpreting obscure phrases very clearly.","The method can be applied to the analysis of compound nouns, like baseball player. Roughly speaking, the semantic diversity in compound nouns is a subset of that in N1 no N2 phrases. Furthermore, the method must be applicable to 487 the analysis of English noun phrases. The translated explanation in the paper naturally indicates the possibility."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The research described in this paper was supported in part by JSPS-RFTF96P00502 (The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Research for the Future Program) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research 10143209."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Deborah A.
