Resnik (1993) initiated research into the automatic acquisition of semantic selectional restrictions. Ribas (1994) presented an approach which takes into account the syntactic position of the elements whose semantic relation is to be acquired. However, those and most of the following approaches require as a prerequisite a fixed taxonomy of semantic relations. This is a problem because (i) entailment hierarchies are presently available for few languages, and (ii) we regard it as an open ques-tion whether and to what degree existing designs for lexical hierarchies are appropriate for representing lexical meaning. Both of these considerations suggest the relevance of inductive and experimental approaches to the construction of lexicons with semantic information.","This paper presents a method for automatic induction of semantically annotated subcategorization frames from unannotated corpora. We use a statistical subcat-induction system which estimates probability distributions and corpus frequencies for pairs of a head and a subcat frame (Carroll and Rooth, 1998). The statistical parser can also collect frequencies for the nominal fillers of slots in a subcat frame. The induction of labels for slots in a frame is based upon estimation of a probability distribution over tuples consisting of a class label, a selecting head, a grammatical relation, and a filler head. The class label is treated as hidden data in the EM-framework for statistical estimation. 2 EM-Based Clustering In our clustering approach, classes are derived directly from distributional data--a sample of pairs of verbs and nouns, gathered by parsing an unannotated corpus and extracting the fillers of grammatical relations. Semantic classes corresponding to such pairs are viewed as hidden variables or unobserved data in the context of maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm. This approach allows us to work in a mathematically well-defined framework of statistical inference, i.e., standard monotonicity and convergence results for the EM algorithm extend to our method. The two main tasks of EM-based clustering are i) the induction of a smooth probability model on the data, and ii) the automatic discovery of class-structure in the data. Both of these aspects are respected in our application of lexicon induction. The basic ideas of our EM-based clustering approach were presented in Rooth (Ms). Our approach constrasts with the merely heuristic and empirical justification of similarity-based approaches to clustering (Dagan et al., to appear) for which so far no clear probabilistic interpretation has been given. The probability model we use can be found earlier in Pereira et al. (1993).

Every such maximization step increases the log-likelihood function L, and a se- quence of re-estimates eventually converges to a (local) maximum of L. In the following, we will present some exam- ples of induced clusters. Input to the clustering algorithm was a training corpus of 1280715 to- kens (608850 types) of verb-noun pairs partici- pating in the grammatical relations of intransi- tive and transitive verbs and their subject- and object-fillers. The data were gathered from the maximal-probability parses the head-lexicalized Figure 3: Evaluation of pseudo-disambiguation Fig. 2 shows an induced semantic class out of a model with 35 classes. At the top are listed the 20 most probable nouns in the p(nl5 ) distribu- tion and their probabilities, and at left are the 30 most probable verbs in the p(vn5) distribution. 5 is the class index. Those verb-noun pairs which were seen in the training data appear with a dot in the class matrix. Verbs with suffix .as : s in- dicate the subject slot of an active intransitive. Similarily .ass : s denotes the subject slot of an active transitive, and .ass : o denotes the object slot of an active transitive. Thus v in the above discussion actually consists of a combination of a verb with a subcat frame slot as : s, ass : s, or ass : o.

(1993), but differing in detail. The task is to judge which of two verbs v and v ~ is more likely to take a given noun n as its argument where the pair (v, n) has been cut out of the original corpus and the pair (v ~, n) is constructed by pairing n with a randomly chosen verb v ~ such that the combination (v ~, n) is completely unseen. Thus this test evaluates how well the models generalize over unseen verbs.","The data for this test were built as follows. We constructed an evaluation corpus of (v, n, v ~) triples by randomly cutting a test corpus of 3000 (v, n) pairs out of the original corpus of 1280712 tokens, leaving a training corpus of 1178698 tokens. Each noun n in the test corpus was combined with a verb v ~ which was randomly chosen according to its frequency such that the pair (v ~, n) did appear neither in the training nor in the test corpus. However, the elements v, v ~, and n were required to be part of the training corpus. Furthermore, we restricted the verbs and nouns in the evalutation corpus to the ones which occured at least 30 times and at most 3000 times with some verb-functor v in the training corpus. The resulting 1337 evaluation triples were used to evaluate a sequence of clustering models trained from the training corpus.","The clustering models we evaluated were • parametrized in starting values of the training algorithm, in the number of classes of the model, and in the number of iteration steps, resulting in a sequence of 3 × 10 x 6 models.

Fig. 4 plots the smoothing results for the above models against the number of classes. Starting values had an in-fluence of -+ 1% on performance. Given the proportion of the number of types in the training corpus to the V × N-space, without clustering we have a smoothing power of 0.14 % whereas for example a model with 50 classes and 50 iterations has a smoothing power of about 93 %.","Corresponding to the maximum likelihood paradigm, the number of training iterations had a decreasing effect on the smoothing performance whereas the accuracy of the pseudodisambiguation was increasing in the number of iterations.

Fourth: induced entry for related intransitive increase. one-place predicate in the structure on the left in Fig. 11. Linguistically, such representations are motivated by argument alternations (diathesis), case linking and deep word order, language acquistion, scope ambiguity, by the desire to represent aspects of lexical meaning, and by the fact that in some languages, the postulated decomposed representations are overt, with each primitive predicate corresponding to a morpheme. For references and recent discussion of this kind of theory see Hale and Keyser (1993) and Kural (1996).","We will sketch an understanding of the lexical representations induced by latent-class labeling in terms of the linguistic theories mentioned above, aiming at an interpretation which combines computational leaxnability, linguistic motivation, and denotational-semantic adequacy. The basic idea is that latent classes are computational models of the atomic relation symbols occurring in lexical-semantic representations. As a first implementation, consider replacing the relation symbols in the first tree in Fig. 11 with relation symbols derived from the latent class labeling. In the second tree in Fig 11, R17 and R8 are relation symbols with indices derived from the labeling procedure of Sect. 4. Such representations can be semantically interpreted in standard ways, for instance by interpreting relation symbols as denoting relations between events and individuals.","Such representations are semantically inadequate for reasons given in philosophical critiques of decomposed linguistic representations; see Fodor (1998) for recent discussion. A lexicon' estimated in the above way has as many primitive relations as there are latent classes. We guess there should be a few hundred classes in an approximately complete lexicon (which would have to be estimated from a corpus of hundreds of millions of words or more). Fodor's arguments, which axe based on the very limited degree of genuine interdefinability of lexical items and on Putnam's arguments for contextual determination of lexical meaning, indicate that the number of basic concepts has the order of magnitude of the lexicon itself. More concretely, a lexicon constructed along the above principles would identify verbs which are labelled with the same latent classes; for instance it might identify the representations of grab and touch.","For these reasons, a semantically adequate lexicon must include additional relational constants. We meet this requirement in a simple way, by including as a conjunct a unique constant derived from the open-class root, as in the third tree in Fig. 11. We introduce indexing of the open class root (copied from the class index) in order that homophony of open class roots not result in common conjuncts in semantic representations--for instance, we don't want the two senses of decline exemplified in decline the proposal and decline five percent to have an common entailment represented by a common conjunct. This indexing method works as long as the labeling process produces different latent class labels for the different senses.","The last tree in Fig. 11 is the learned representation for the scalar motion sense of the intransitive verb increase. In our approach, learning the argument alternation (diathesis) relating the transitive increase (in its scalar motion sense) to the intransitive increase (in its scalar motion sense) amounts to learning representations with a common component R17 A increase17. In this case, this is achieved. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a procedure which maps observations of subcategorization frames with their complement fillers to structured lexical entries. We believe the method is scientifically interesting, practically useful, and flexible because:","1. The algorithms and implementation are efficient enough to map a corpus of a hundred million words to a lexicon. 110","2. The model and induction algorithm have foundations in the theory of parameterized families of probability distributions and statistical estimation. As exemplified in the paper, learning, disambiguation, and evaluation can be given simple, motivated formulations.","3. The derived lexical representations are linguistically interpretable. This suggests the possibility of large-scale modeling and observational experiments bearing on questions arising in linguistic theories of the lexicon.","4. Because a simple probabilistic model is used, the induced lexical entries could be incorporated in lexicalized syntax-based probabilistic language models, in particular in head-lexicalized models. This provides for potential application in many areas.","5. The method is applicable to any natural language where text samples of sufficient size, computational morphology, and a robust parser capable of extracting subcategorization frames with their fillers are available."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Leonard E.
