This paper adapts the notion of composition, well developed in the context of programming languages, to the domain of linguistic formalisms. We study alternative definitions for the semantics of such formalisms, suggest-ing a denotational semantics that we show to be compositional and fully-abstract. This facilitates a clear, mathematically sound way for defining grammar modularity. 1 Introduction Developing large scale grammars for natural languages is a complicated task, and the problems grammar engineers face when designing broad-coverage grammars are reminiscent of those tackled by software engineering (Erbach and Uszkoreit, 1990). Viewing contemporary linguistic formalisms as very high level declara-tive programming languages, a grammar for a natural language can be viewed as a program. It is therefore possible to adapt methods and techniques of software engineering to the domain of natural language formalisms. We believe that any advances in grammar engineering must be preceded by a more theoretical work, concentrating on the semantics of grammars. This view reflects the situation in logic programming, where developments in alternative definitions for predicate logic semantics led to implementations of various program composition operators (Bugliesi et al., 1994).","This paper suggests a denotational semantics tbr unification-based linguistic formalisms and shows that it is compositional and fully- *I am grateful to Nissim Francez for commenting on an em'lier version of this paper.

While most of the results we report on are probably not surprising, we believe that it is important to derive them directly for linguistic formalisms for two reasons. First, practitioners of linguistic formMisms usually do not view them as instances of a general logic programming framework, but rather as first-class programming environments which deserve independent study. Second, there are some crucial differences between contemporary linguistic formalisms and, say, Prolog: the basic elements -- typed feature-structures -- are more general than first-order terms, the notion of unification is different, and computations amount to parsing, rather than SLD-resolution. The fact that we can derive similar results in this new domain is encouraging, and should not be considered trivial.","Analogously to logic programming languages, the denotation of grammars can be defined using various techniques. We review alternative approaches, operational and denotational, to the semantics of linguistic formalisms in section 2 and show that they are \"too crude\" to support grammar composition. Section 3 presents an alternative semantics, shown to be compositional (with respect to grammar union, a simple syntactic combination operation on grammars). However, this definition is \"too fine\": in section 4 we present an adequate, compositional and fully-abstract semantics for linguistic formalisms. For lack of space, some proofs are omitted; an extended version is available as a technical report (Wintner, 1999). 2 Grammar semantics Viewing grammars as formal entities that share many features with computer programs, it is 9{} natural to consider the notion of semantics of ratification-based formalisms. We review in this se(:tion the operational definition of Shieber et a,1. (1995) and the denotational definition of, e.g., Pereira and Shieber (1984) or Carpenter (1992, pp. 204-206). We show that these definitions are equivalent and that none of them supports compositionality. 2.1 Basic notions W(, assume familiarity with theories of feature structure based unification grammars, as for-mulated by, e.g., Carpenter (1992) or Shieber (1992). Grammars are defined over typed featwre .structures (TFSs) which can be viewed as generalizations of first-order terms (Carpenter, 1991). TFSs are partially ordered by subsump-tion, with ± the least (or most general) TFS. A multi-rooted structure (MRS, see Sikkel (1997) ()r Wintner and Francez (1999)) is a sequence of TFSs, with possible reentrancies among diffi;rent elements in the sequence. Meta-variables A,/3 range over TFSs and a, p - over MRSs. MRSs are partially ordered by subsumption, de-n()ted '__', with a least upper bound operation ()f 'an'llfication, denoted 'U', and a greatest lowest t)(mnd denoted 'W. We assume the existence of a. fixed, finite set WORDS of words. A lexicon associates with every word a set of TFSs, its category. Meta-variable a ranges over WORDS and .w -- over strings of words (elements of WORDS*). Grammars are defined over a signature of types and features, assumed to be fixed below. Definition 1. A rule is an MRS of length greater than or equal to 1 with a designated (fir'st) element, the head o.f the rule. The rest of the elements .form the rule's body (which may be em, pty, in which case the rule is depicted a.s' a TFS). A lexicon is a total .function .from WORDS to .finite, possibly empty sets o.f TFSs. A grammar G = (T¢,/:, A s} is a .finite set of ,rules TO, a lexicon £. and a start symbol A s that is a TFS. Figure 1 depicts an example grammar, 1 suppressing the underlying type hierarchy. 2 The definition of unification is lifted to MRSs: let a,p be two MRSs of the same length; the 'Grammars are displayed using a simple description language, where ':' denotes feature values. 2Assmne that in all the example grammars, the types s, n, v and vp are maximal and (pairwise) inconsistent.

It is continuous iftbr every chain I1 C_ /2 C_ ..., T(Uj< ~/.i) = Uj<~T(Ij) . If a function T is monotone it has a least fixpoint (Tarski-Knaster theorem); if T is also continuous, the fixpoint can be obtained by iterative application of T to the empty set (Kleene theorem): lfp(T) = TSw, where TI\" 0 = 0 and T t n = T(T t (n- 1)) when 'n is a successor ordinal and (_Jk<n(T i\" n) when n is a limit ordinal.","When the semantics of programming languages are concerned, a notion of observables is called for: Ob is a flmction associating a set of objects, the observables, with every program. The choice of semantics induces a natural equivalence operator on grammars: given a semantics 'H', G1 ~ G2 iff ~GI~ = ~G2~. An essential requirement of any semantic equivalence is that it 97' be correct (observables-preserving): if G1 -G2, then Ob(G1) = Ob(G2).","Let 'U' be a composition operation on grammars and '•' a combination operator on denorations. A (correct) semantics 'H' is compo- .s'itional (Gaifinan and Shapiro, 1989) if whenever ~1~ : ~G2~ and ~G3] -- ~G4], also ~G, U G3~ = [G2 U G4]. A semantics is commutative (Brogi et al., 1992) if ~G1 UG2] = ~G,~ • [G2~. This is a stronger notion than (:ompositionality: if a semantics is commutative with respect to some operator then it is compositional. 2.2 An operational semantics As Van Emden and Kowalski (1976) note, \"to define an operational semantics for a program-ruing language is to define an implementational independent interpreter for it. For predicate logic the proof procedure behaves as such an interpreter.\" Shieber et al. (1995) view parsing as a. deductive process that proves claims about the grammatical status of strings from assumptions derived from the grammar. We follow their in-sight and notation and list a deductive system for parsing unification-based grammars. Definition 3. The deductive parsing system associated with a grammar G = (7~,F.,AS} is defined over ITEMS and is characterized by:","Axioms: [a, i, A, i + 1] i.f B E Z.(a) and B K A; [e, i, A, i] if B is an e-rule in T~ and B K_ A Goals: [w, 0, A, [w]] where A ~ A s Inference rules:","[wx , i l , A1, ill,..., [Wk, ik, Ak , Jk ] [Wl \" \" \" Wk, i, A, j] if .'h = i1,+1 .for 1 <_ l < k and i = il and J = Jk and (A1,...,Ak) =>a A","When an item [w,i,A,j] can be deduced, applying k times the inference rules associz~ted with a grammar G, we write F-~[w, i, A, j]. When the number of inference steps is irrelevant it is omitted. Notice that the domain of items is infinite, and in particular that the number of axioms is infinite. Also, notice that the goal is to deduce a TFS which is subsumed by the start symbol, and when TFSs can be cyclic, there can be infinitely many such TFSs (and, hence, goals) - see Wintner and Francez (1999).

Note also that the start symbol A ' does not play a role in this definition; this is equivalent to assuming that the start symbol is always the most general TFS, _k.","The most natural observable for a grammar would be its language, either as a set of strings or augmented by TFSs. Thus we take Ob(G) to be L(G) and by definition, the operational semantics '~.] op' preserves observables. 2.3 Denotational semantics In this section we consider denotational semantics through a fixpoint of a transformational operator associated with grammars. -This is essentially similar to the definition of Pereira and Shieber (1984) and Carpenter (1992, pp. 204-206).

Intuitively, this is because when a grammar G1 includes a particular rule p that is inapplicable for reduction, this rule contributes nothing to the denotation of the grammar. But when G1 is combined with some other grammar, G2, p might be used for reduction in G1 U G2, where it can interact with the rules of G2. We suggest an alternative, fixpoint based semantics for unification based grammars that naturally supports compositionality. 3","A compositional semantics To overcome the problems delineated above, we follow Mancarella and Pedreschi (1988) in considering the grammar transformation operator itself (rather than its fixpoint) as the denota-99 tion of a grammar.

We, believe that this is a key to modularity in grammar design. A grammar module has to define a set of items that it \"exports\", and a set of items that can be \"imported\", in a similar way to the declaration of interfaces in programming languages. We are currently working out the details of such a definition. An immediate application will facilitate the implementation of grammar development systems that support modularity in a clear, mathematically sound way.","The results reported here can be extended in various directions. First, we are only concerned in this work with one composition operator, grammar union. But alternative operators are possible, too. In particular, it would be in-teresting to define an operator which combines the information encoded in two grammar rules, for example by unifying the rules. Such an operator would facilitate a separate development of grammars along a different axis: one module can define the syntactic component of a grammar while another module would account for the semantics. The composition operator will unify each rule of one module with an associated rule in the other. It remains to be seen whether the grammar semantics we define here is compositional and fully abstract with respect to such an operator.","A different extension of these results should provide for a distribution of the type hierarchy among several grammar modules. While we assume in this work that all grammars are defined 102 over a given signature, it is more realistic to assume separate, interacting signatures. We hope to be able to explore these directions in the future."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Antonio Brogi, Evelina Lamina, and Paola Mello. 1992.
