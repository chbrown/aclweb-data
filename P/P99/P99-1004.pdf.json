In previous work (Dagan et al., 1999), we compared the performance of three different functions: the Jensen-Shannon divergence (total divergence to the average), the L1 norm, and the confusion probability. Our experiments on a frequency-controlled pseudoword disambiguation task showed that using any of the three in a distance-weighted averaging scheme yielded large improvements over Katz's backoff smoothing method in predicting unseen coocurrences. Furthermore, by using a restricted version of model (1) that stripped in-comparable parameters, we were able to empirically demonstrate that the confusion probability is fundamentally worse at selecting useful similar words. D. Lin also found that the choice of similarity function can affect the quality of automatically-constructed thesauri to a statistically significant degree (1998a) and the ability to determine common morphological roots by as much as 49% in precision (1998b).","1The term \"similarity-based\", which we have used previously, has been applied to describe other models as well (L. Lee, 1997; Karov and Edelman, 1998).","These empirical results indicate that investigating different similarity measures can lead to improved natural language processing. On the other hand, while there have been many similarity measures proposed and analyzed in the information retrieval literature (Jones and Furnas, 1987), there has been some doubt expressed in that community that the choice of similarity metric has any practical impact: Several authors have pointed out that the difference in retrieval performance achieved by different measures of association is insignificant, providing that these are appropriately normalised. (van Rijsbergen, 1979, pg. 38) But no contradiction arises because, as van Rijsbergen continues, \"one would expect this since most measures incorporate the same information\". In the language-modeling domain, there is currently no agreed-upon best similarity metric because there is no agreement on what the \"same information\"- the key data that a similarity function should incorporate -- is.","The overall goal of the work described here was to discover these key characteristics. To this end, we first compared a number of common similarity measures, evaluating them in a parameter-free way on a decision task. When grouped by average performance, they fell into several coherent classes, which corresponded to the extent to which the functions focused on the intersection of the"]},{"title":"supports","paragraphs":["(regions of positive probability) of the distributions.

That is, the data consisted of the verb-object cooccurrence pairs in the 1988 Associated Press newswire involving the 1000 most frequent nouns, extracted via Church's (1988) and Yarowsky's processing tools. 587,833 (80%) of the pairs served as a training set from which to calculate base probabilities. From the other 20%, we prepared test sets as follows: after discarding pairs occurring in the training data (after all, the point of similarity-based estimation is to deal with unseen pairs), we split the remaining pairs into five partitions, and replaced each noun-verb pair"]},{"title":"(n, vl)","paragraphs":["with a noun-verb-verb triple (n, vl, v2) such that P(v2) ~ P(vl). The task for the language model under evaluation was to reconstruct which of (n, vl) and (n, v2) was the original cooccurrence. Note that by construction, (n, Vl) was always the correct answer, and furthermore, methods relying solely on unigram frequencies would perform no better than chance. Test-set performance was measured by the error rate, defined as T(# of incorrect choices + (# of ties)/2), where T is the number of test triple tokens in the set, and a tie results when both alternatives are deemed equally likely by the language model in question.","To perform the evaluation, we incorporated each similarity function into a decision rule as follows.

This is of interest from a computational point of view because Vqr tends to be a relatively small subset of V, the set of all verbs. Furthermore, it suggests downplaying the role of negative information, which is encoded by verbs appearing with exactly one noun, although the Jaccard coefficient does take this type of information into account.","Our explicit division of V-space into various support regions has been implicitly considered in other work. Smadja et al. (1996) observe that for two potential mutual transla-tions X and Y, the fact that X occurs with translation Y indicates association; X's occurring with a translation other than Y decreases one's belief in their association; but the absence of both X and Y yields no information. In essence, Smadja et al. argue that information from the union of supports, rather than the just the intersection, is important. D. Lin (1997; 1998a) takes an axiomatic approach to determining the characteristics of a good similarity measure. Starting with a formalization (based on certain assumptions) of the intuition that the similarity between two events depends on both their commonality and their differences, he derives a unique similarity function schema.
