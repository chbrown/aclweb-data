Since identifying the speech acts of utterances is very important to identify speaker's intentions, it is an essential part of a dialogue analysis system. It is difficult, however, to infer the speech act from a surface utterance since an utterance may represent more than one speech act according to the context. Most works done in the past on the dialogue analysis has analyzed speech acts based on knowledge such as recipes for plan inference and domain specific knowledge (Litman (1987), Caberry (1989), Hinkelman (1990), Lambert (1991), Lambert (1993), Lee (1998)). Since these knowledge-based models depend on costly hand-crafted knowledge, these models are difficult to be scaled up and expanded to other domains. Recently, machine learning models using a discourse tagged corpus are utilized to analyze speech acts in order to overcome such problems (Nagata (1994a), Nagata (1994b), Reithinger (1997), Lee (1997), Samuel (1998)). Machine learning offers promise as a means of associating features of utterances with particular speech acts, since computers can automatically analyze large quantities of data and consider many different feature interactions. These models are based on the features such as cue phrases, change of speaker, short utterances, utterance length, speech acts tag n-grams, and word n-grams, etc. Especially, in many cases, the speech act of an utterance influenced by the context of the utterance, i.e., previous utterances. So it is very important to reflect the information about the context to the model. Discourse structures of dialogues are usually represented as hierarchical structures, which reflect embedding sub-dialogues (Grosz (1986)) and provide very useful context for speech act analysis. For example, utterance 7 in Figure 1 has several surface speech acts such as acknowledge, inform, and response. Such an ambiguity can be solved by analyzing the context. If we consider the n utterances linearly adjacent to utterance 7, i.e., utterances 6, 5, etc., as context, we will get acknowledge or inform with high probabilities as the speech act of utterance 7. However, as shown in Figure 1, utterance 7 is a response utterance to utterance 2 that is hierarchically recent to utterance 7 according to the discourse structure of the dialogue. If we know the discourse structure of the dialogue, we can determine the speech act of utterance 7 as response. * This work was supported by KOSEF under the contract 97-0102-0301-3. 230 Some researchers have used the structural information of discourse to the speech act analysis (Lee (1997), Lee (1998)). It is not, however, enough to cover various dialogues since they used a restricted rule-based model such as RDTN (Recursive Dialogue Transition Networks) for discourse structure analysis. Most of the previous related works, to our knowledge, tried to determine the speech act of an utterance, but did not mention about statistical models to determine the discourse structure of a dialogue.

In the proposed model, the speech act analysis and the discourse structure analysis are combined in one framework so that they can easily provide feedback to each other. For the discourse structure analysis, we suggest a statistical model with discourse segment boundaries (DSBs) similar to the idea of gaps suggested for a statistical parsing (Collins (1996)). For training, we use a corpus tagged with various discourse knowledge. To overcome the problem of data sparseness, which is common for corpus-based works, we use split partial context as well as whole context. After explaining the tagged dialogue corpus we used in section 1, we discuss the statistical models in detail in section 2. In section 3, we explain experimental results. Finally, we conclude in section 4."]},{"title":"1 Discourse tagging","paragraphs":["In this paper, we use Korean dialogue corpus transcribed from recordings in real fields such as hotel reservation, airline reservation and tour reservation.

That is, the speaker utters a sentence, which most well expresses his/her intention (speech act) so that the hearer can easily infer what the speaker's speech act is.

Generally, dialogues have a hierarchical discourse structure. So we approximate the context as speech acts of n utterances that are hierarchically recent to the utterance. An utterance A is hierarchically recent to an utterance B if A is adjacent to B in the tree structure of the discourse (Walker (1996)). Equation (3) represents the approximated contextual probability in the case of using trigram where Uj and U~ are hierarchically recent to the utterance U, where l<j<k<i-1. 232 P(Si I S],, - ,) = P(Si I Sj, Sk)"]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["As a result, the statistical model for speech act analysis is represented in equation (4).

I. 1 1E Figure 3: An example of DSB tagging Since the DSB of an utterance represents a relationship between the utterance and the previous utterance, the DSB of utterance 1 in the example dialogue becomes NULL. By comparing utterance 2 with utterance 1 in Figure 3, we know that a new sub-dialogue starts at utterance 2. Therefore the DSB of utterance 2 becomes SS. Similarly, the DSB of utterance 3 is SS. Since utterance 4 is a response for utterance 3, utterance 3 and 4 belong to the same discourse segment. So the DSB of utterance 4 becomes DC. Since a sub-dialogue of one level (i.e., the DS 1.1.2) consisting of utterances 3 and 4 ends, and new sub-dialogue starts at utterance 5. Therefore, the DSB of utterance 5 becomes lB. Finally, utterance 7 is a response for utterance 2, i.e., the sub-dialogue consisting of utterances 5 and 6 ends and the segment 1.1 is resumed. Therefore the DSB of utterance 7 becomes 1E. 2.2.2 Statistical model for discourse structure","analysis We construct a statistical model for discourse structure analysis using DSBs. In the training phase, the model transforms discourse structure (DS) information in the corpus into DSBs by comparing the DS information of an utterance with that of the previous utterance. After transformation, we estimate probabilities for DSBs. In the analyzing process, the goal of the system is simply determining the DSB of a current utterance using the probabilities.

With this notation, P(GilU],O means the probability that G/ becomes the DSB of utterance U~ given a sequence of utterances U~, U 2 ..... Ui.

Using the Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit (Ristad 1996), we estimated the model parameter ~ corresponding to each feature functionf in equation (13). We made experiments with two models for each analysis model. Modem uses only the unified feature function, and Model-II uses the unified feature function and the separated feature function together. Among the ways to combine the unified feature function with the separated feature function, we choose the combination in which the separated feature function is used only when there is no training example applicable for the unified feature function.

As shown in table 4, the proposed models show better results than previous work, Lee (1997). As shown in table 4 and 5, ModeMI shows better results than Model-235 I in all cases. We believe that the separated feature functions are effective for the data sparseness problem. In the open test in table 4, it is difficult to compare the proposed model directly with the previous works like Samuel (1998) and Reithinger (1997) because test data used in those works consists of English dialogues while we use Korean dialogues. Furthermore the speech acts used in the experiments are different. We will test our model using the same data with the same speech acts as used in those works in the future work. We tested the integrated dialogue analysis model in which speech act and discourse structure analysis models are integrated. The integrated model uses ModeMI for each analysis model because it showed better performance. In this model, after the system determing the speech act and DSB of an utterance, it uses the results to process the next utterance, recursively. The experimental results are shown in table 6. As shown in table 6, the results of the integrated model are worse than the results of each analysis model.
