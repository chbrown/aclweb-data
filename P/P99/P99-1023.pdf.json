Typically, these tags indicate syntactic categories, such as noun or verb, and occasionally include additional feature information, such as number (singular or plural) and verb tense. The Penn Treebank documentation (Marcus et al., 1993) defines a commonly used set of tags.","Part-of-speech tagging is an important research topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Taggers are often preprocessors in NLP systems, making accurate performance especially important. Much research has been done to improve tagging accuracy using several different models and methods, including: hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Kupiec, 1992), (Charniak et al., 1993); rule-based systems (Brill, 1994), (Brill, 1995); memory-based systems (Daelemans et al., 1996); maximum-entropy systems (Ratnaparkhi, 1996); path voting constraint systems (Tiir and Oflazer, 1998); linear separator systems (Roth and Zelenko, 1998); and majority voting systems (van Halteren et al., 1998).","This paper describes various modifications to an HMM tagger that improve the performance to an accuracy comparable to or better than the best current single classifier taggers. 175 This improvement comes from using second-order approximations of the Markov assumptions. Section 2 discusses a basic first-order hidden Markov model for part-of-speech tagging and extensions to that model to handle out-of-lexicon words. The new second-order HMM is described in Section 3, and Section 4 presents experimental results and conclusions. 2 Hidden Markov Models A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical construct that can be used to solve classification problems that have an inherent state sequence representation.

Be-ing able to accurately tag unknown words is important, as they are frequently encountered when tagging sentences in applications. Most work in the area of unknown words and tagging deals with predicting part-of-speech information based on word endings and affixation information, as shown by work in (Mikheev, 1996), (Mikheev, 1997), (Weischedel et al., 1993), and (Thede, 1998). This section highlights a method devised for HMMs, which differs slightly from previous approaches.","To create an HMM to accurately tag unknown words, it is necessary to determine an estimate of the probability"]},{"title":"P(wklti)","paragraphs":["for use in the tagger.

This probability can be estimated by collecting suffix information from each word in the training corpus.","In this work, suffixes of length one to four characters are considered, up to a maximum suffix length of two characters less than the length of the given word. An overall count of the number of times each suffix/tag pair appears in the training corpus is used to estimate emit probabilities for words based on their suffixes, with some exceptions. When estimating suffix probabilities, words with length four or less are not likely to contain any word-ending information that is valuable for classification, so they are ignored. Unknown words are presumed to be open-class, so words that are not tagged with an open-class tag are also ignored.","When constructing our suffix predictor, words that contain hyphens, are capitalized, or contain numeric digits are separated from the main calculations. Estimates for each of these categories are calculated separately. For example, if an unknown word is capitalized, the probability distribution estimated from capitalized words is used to predict its part of speech. However, capitalized words at the beginning of a sentence are not classified in this way-- the initial capitalization is ignored. If a word is not capitalized and does not contain a hyphen or numeric digit, the general distribution is used. Finally, when predicting the possible part of speech for an unknown word, all possible matching suffixes are used with their predictions smoothed (see Section 3.2). 3 The Second-Order Model for Part-of-Speech Tagging The model described in Section 2 is an example of a"]},{"title":"first-order","paragraphs":["hidden Markov model. In part-of-speech tagging, it is called a"]},{"title":"bigram","paragraphs":["tagger. This model works reasonably well in part-of-speech tagging, but captures a more limited 176 amount of the contextual information than is available. Most of the best statistical taggers use a trigram model, which replaces the bigram transition probability aij = P(rp = tjITp_ 1 -~ ti) with a trigram probability aijk : P(7\"p = tklrp_l = tj, rp-2 = ti). This section describes a new type of tagger that uses trigrams not only for the context probabilities but also for the lexical (and suffix) probabilities. We refer to this new model as a full second-order hidden Markov model. 3.1","Defining New Probability","Distributions The full second-order HMM uses a notation similar to a standard first-order model for the probability distributions. The A matrix contains state transition probabilities, the B matrix contains output symbol distributions, and the C matrix contains unknown word distributions. The rr matrix is identical to its counterpart in the first-order model. However, the definitions of A, B, and C are modified to enable the full second-order HMM to use more contextual information to model part-of-speech tagging. In the following sections, there are assumed to be P words in the sentence with rp and Vp being the p-th tag and word in the sentence, respectively. 3.1.1 Contextual Probabilities The A matrix defines the contextual probabilities for the part-of-speech tagger. As in the trigram model, instead of limiting the context to a first-order approximation, the A matrix is defined as follows: A = {aijk), where\" aija= P(rp = tklrp_l = tj, rp-2 = tl), 1 < p < P Thus, the transition matrix is now three dimensional, and the probability of transitioning to a new state depends not only on the current state, but also on the previous state. This allows a more realistic context-dependence for the word tags. For the boundary cases of p = 1 and p = 2, the special tag symbols NONE and SOS are used. 3.1.2 Lexieal and Suffix Probabilities The B matrix defines the lexical probabilities for the part-of-speech tagger, while the C matrix is used for unknown words. Similarly to the trigram extension to the A matrix, the approximation for the lexical and suffix probabilities can also be modified to include second-order information as follows: B = {bij(k)) and C = {vii(k)}, where = = P(vp = wklrp = rp-1 = ti) P(vp has suffix sklrp = tj, rp-1 = tl) forl<p<P In these equations, the probability of the model emitting a given word depends not only on the current state but also on the previous state. To our knowledge, this approach has not been used in tagging. SOS is again used in the p = 1 case. 3.2","Smoothing Issues While the full second-order HMM is a more precise approximation of the underlying probabilities for the model, a problem can arise from sparseness of data, especially with lexical estimations. For example, the size of the B matrix is T2W, which for the WSJ corpus is approximately 125,000,000 possible tag/tag/word combinations. In an attempt to avoid sparse data estimation problems, the probability estimates for each distribution is smoothed. There are several methods of smoothing discussed in the literature. These methods include the additive method (discussed by (Gale and Church, 1994)); the Good-Turing method (Good, 1953); the Jelinek-Mercer method (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980); and the Katz method (Katz, 1987).","These methods are all useful smoothing algorithms for a variety of applications. However, they are not appropriate for our purposes. Since we are smoothing trigram probabilities, the additive and Good-Turing methods are of limited usefulness, since neither takes into account bigram or unigram probabilities. Katz smoothing seems a little too granular to be effective in our application--the broad spectrum of possibilities is reduced to three options, depending on the number of times the given event occurs. It seems that smoothing should be based on a function of the number of occurances. Jelinek-Mercer accommodates this by smoothing the n-gram probabilities using differing coefficients (A's) according to the number of times each n-gram occurs, but this requires holding out training data for the A's. We have implemented a model that smooths with lower order information by using coefficients calculated from the number of occurances of each trigram, bigram, and unigram without training. This method is explained in the following sections. 3.2.1 State Transition Probabilities To estimate the state transition probabilities, we want to use the most specific information. 177 However, that information may not always be available. Rather than using a fixed smoothing technique, we have developed a new method that uses variable weighting. This method at-taches more weight to triples that occur more often.","The"]},{"title":"tklrp-1","paragraphs":["P=ka formula for the estimate /3 of P(rp = = tj, rp-2 = tl) is:","Na + (1 - ka)k2 N2 + (1 - k3)(1 -- k2).

After this value is calculated for all tag triples, the values are normalized so that ~ /3 -- 1,","tkET creating a valid probability distribution.","The value of this smoothing technique be-comes clear when the triple in question occurs very infrequently, if at all. Consider calculating /3 for the tag triple CD RB VB.

Smoothing allows tag triples that were not encountered in the training data to be assigned a probability of occurance. 3.2.2 Lexical and Suffix Probabilities For the lexical and suffix probabilities, we do something somewhat different than for context probabilities. Initial experiments that used a formula similar to that used for the contextual estimates performed poorly. This poor performance was traced to the fact that smoothing allowed too many words to be incorrectly tagged with tags that did not occur with that word in the training data (over-generalization). As an alternative, we calculated the smoothed probability/3 for words as follows: (log(N3 + i) + i. N3 1 N2 t5 __ \"log(N3 + 1) + 2)C-22 + (log(N3 + 1) + 2)C-T where: N2 = number of times word wk occurs with tag tj N3 = number of times word wk occurs with tag tj preceded by tag tl C1 = number of times tj occurs C2 = number of times sequence titj occurs","Notice that this method assigns a probability of 0.0 to a word/tag pair that does not appear in the training data. This prevents the tagger from trying every possible combination of word and tag, something which both increases running time and decreases the accuracy. We be-lieve the low accuracy of the original smoothing scheme emerges from the fact that smoothing the lexical probabilities too far allows the contextual information to dominate at the expense of the lexical information. A better smoothing approach for lexical information could possibly be created by using some sort of word class idea, such as the genotype idea used in (Tzoukermann and Radev, 1996), to improve our /5 estimate. 178","In addition to choosing the above approach for smoothing the C matrix for unknown words, there is an additional issue of choosing which suffix to use when predicting the part of speech. There are many possible answers, some of which are considered by (Thede, 1998): use the longest matching suffix, use an entropy measure to determine the \"best\" affix to use, or use an average. A voting technique for cij(k) was determined that is similar to that used for contextual smoothing but is based on different length suffixes.","Let s4 be the length four suffix of the given word. Define s3, s2, and sl to be the length three, two, and one suffixes respectively. If the length of the word is six or more, these four suffixes are used. Otherwise, suffixes up to length n - 2 are used, where n is the length of the word.

After calculating/5, it is normalized. Thus, suffixes of length four are given the most weight, and a suffix receives more weight the more times it appears. Information provided by suffixes of length one to four are used in estimating the probabilities, however. 3.3","The New Viterbi Algorithm","Modification of the lexical and contextual probabilities is only the first step in defining a full second-order HMM. These probabilities must also be combined to select the most likely sequence of tags that generated the sentence. This requires modification of the Viterbi algorithm. First, the variables ~ and ¢ from (Rabiner, 1989) are redefined, as shown in Figure 1. These new definitions take into account the added dependencies of the distributions of A, B, and C. We can then calculate the most likely tag sequence using the modification of the Viterbi algorithm shown in Figure 1. The running time of this algorithm is O (NT3), where N is the length of the sentence, and T is the number of tags. This is asymptotically equivalent to the running time of a standard trigram tagger that maximizes the probability of the entire tag sequence. 4 Experiment and Conclusions","The new tagging model is tested in several different ways. The basic experimental technique is a 10-fold cross validation. The corpus in question-is randomly split into ten sections with nine of the sections combined to train the tagger and the tenth for testing. The results of the ten possible training/testing combinations are merged to give an overall accuracy measure. The tagger was tested on two corpora-- the Brown corpus (from the Treebank II CD-ROM (Marcus et al., 1993)) and the Wall Street Journal corpus (from the same source). Comparing results for taggers can be difficult, especially across different researchers. Care has been taken in this paper that, when comparing two systems, the comparisons are from experiments that were as similar as possible and that differences are highlighted in the comparison.","First, we compare the results on each corpus of four different versions of our HMM tagger: a standard (bigram) HMM tagger, an HMM using second-order lexical probabilities, an HMM using second-order contextual probabilities (a standard trigram tagger), and a full second-order HMM tagger. The results from both corpora for each tagger are given in Table 1. As might be expected, the full second-order HMM had the highest accuracy levels. The model using only second-order contextual information (a standard trigram model) was second best, the model using only second-order lexical information was third, and the standard bigram HMM had the lowest accuracies. The full second-order HMM reduced the number of errors on known words by around 16% over bigram taggers (raising the accuracy about 0.6-0.7%), and by around 6% over conventional trigram tag-gets (accuracy increase of about 0.2%). Similar results were seen in the overall accuracies. Unknown word accuracy rates were increased by around 2-3% over bigrams.","The full second-order HMM tagger is also compared to other researcher's taggers in Table 2.

Unfortunately, unknown word accuracy is still below some of the other systems. This may be due in part to experimental differences. It should also be noted that some of these other systems use hand-crafted rules for unknown word rules, whereas our system uses only statistical data. Adding additional rules to our system could result in comparable performance. Improving our model on unknown words is a major focus of future research.","In conclusion, a new statistical model, the full second-order HMM, has been shown to improve part-of-speech tagging accuracies over current models.
