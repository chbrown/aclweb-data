The phenomenon in English is illustrated in (1)-(2) below. (1) a. John offers shares to his employees. b. John offers his employees shares. (2) a. Leave a note for her. b. Leave her a note. Example (1) illustrates the dative alternation, which is characterized by an alternation between the prepositional frame 'V NP1 to NP2' and the double object frame 'V NP 1 NP2'. The benefactive alternation (cf. (2)) is structurally similar to the dative, the difference being that it involves the preposition for rather than to.","Levin (1993) assumes that the syntactic realization of a verb's arguments is directly correlated with its meaning (cf. also Pinker (1989) for a similar proposal). Thus one would expect verbs that undergo the same alternations to form a semantically coherent class. Levin's study on diathesis alternations has influenced recent work on word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), machine transla-tion (Dang et al., 1998), and automatic lexical acquisition (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 1998).","The objective of this paper is to investigate the extent to which diathesis alternations are empirically attested in corpus data. Using the dative and benefactive alternations as a test case we attempt to determine: (a) if some alternations are more frequent than others, (b) if alternating verbs have frame preferences and (c) what the representative members of an alternation are.","In section 2 we describe and evaluate the set of automatic methods we used to acquire verbs undergoing the dative and benefactive alternations. We assess the acquired frames using a filtering method presented in section 3. The results are detailed in section 4. Sections 5 and 6 discuss how the derived type and token frequencies can be used to estimate how productive an alternation is for a given verb semantic class and how typical its members are. Finally, section 7 offers some discussion on future work and section 8 conclusive remarks."]},{"title":"2 Method 2.1 The parser","paragraphs":["The part-of-speech tagged version of the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100 million word collec-tion of written and spoken British English (Burnard, 1995), was used to acquire the frames characteristic of the dative and benefactive alternations. Surface syntactic structure was identified using Gsearch (Keller et al., 1999), a tool which allows the search of arbitrary POS-tagged corpora for shallow syntactic patterns based on a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query. It achieves this by combining a left-corner parser with a regular expression matcher.","Depending on the grammar specification (i.e., recursive or not) Gsearch can be used as a full context-free parser or a chunk parser. Depending on the syntactic query, Gsearch can parse full sentences, identify syntactic relations (e.g., verb-object, adjective-noun) or even single words (e.g., all indefinite pro-397 nouns in the corpus).","Gsearch outputs all corpus sentences containing substrings that match a given syntactic query. Given two possible parses that begin at the same point in the sentence, the parser chooses the longest match. If there are two possible parses that can be produced for the same substring, only one parse is returned. This means that if the number of ambiguous rules in the grammar is large, the correctness of the parsed output is not guaranteed. 2.2 Acquisition We used Gsearch to extract tokens matching the patterns 'V NP1 NP2', 'VP NP1 to NP2', and 'V NPI for NP2' by specifying a chunk grammar for recognizing the verbal complex and NPs. POS-tags were retained in the parser's output which was postprocessed to remove adverbials and interjections.","Examples of the parser's output are given in (3). Although there are cases where Gsearch produces the right parse (cf. (3a)), the parser wrongly identifies as instances of the double object frame tokens containing compounds (cf. (3b)), bare relative clauses (cf. (3c)) and NPs in apposition (cf. (3d)). Sometimes the parser attaches prepositional phrases to the wrong site (cf. (3e)) and cannot distinguish between arguments and adjuncts (cf. (3f)) or between different types of adjuncts (e.g., temporal (cf. (3f)) versus benefactive (cf. (3g))). Erroneous output also arises from tagging mistakes. (3) a. The police driver [v shot] [NP Jamie] [ie a look of enquiry] which he missed. b. Some also [v offer] [ipa free bus] lip service], to encourage customers who do not have their own transport. c. A Jaffna schoolboy [v shows] [NP a draw-ing] lip he] made of helicopters strafing his home town. d. For the latter catalogue Barr [v chose] [NP the Surrealist writer] [yp Georges Hugnet] to write a historical essay. e. It [v controlled] [yp access] [pp to [Nr' the vault]]. f. Yesterday he [v rang] [NP the bell] [Pl, for [NP a long time]]. g. Don't Iv save] [NP the bread] [pp for [NP the birds]].","We identified erroneous subcategorization frames (cf. (3b)-(3d)) by using linguistic heuristics and a process for compound noun detection (cf. section 2.3). We disambiguated the attachment site of PPs (cf. (3e)) using Hindle and Rooth's (1993) lexical association score (cf. section 2.4). Finally, we recognized benefactive PPs (cf. (3g)) by exploiting the WordNet taxonomy (cf. section 2.5). 2.3 Guessing the double object frame We developed a process which assesses whether the syntactic patterns (called cues below) derived from the corpus are instances of the double object frame. Linguistic Heuristics. We applied several heuristics to the parser's output which determined whether corpus tokens were instances of the double object frame. The 'Reject' heuristics below identified erroneous matches (cf. (3b-d)), whereas the 'Accept' heuristics identified true instances of the double object frame (cf. (3a)).","1. Reject if cue contains at least two proper names adjacent to each other (e.g., killed Henry Phipps ).","2. Reject if cue contains possessive noun phrases (e.g., give a showman's award).","3. Reject if cue's last word is a pronoun or an anaphor (e.g., ask the subjects themselves).","4. Accept if verb is followed by a personal or indefinite pronoun (e.g., found him a home).","5. Accept if verb is followed by an anaphor (e.g., made herself a snack).","6. Accept if cue's surface structure is either 'V MOD l NP MOD NP' or 'V NP MOD NP' (e.g., send Bailey a postcard).","7. Cannot decide if cue's surface structure is 'V MOD* N N+' (e.g., offer a free bus service). Compound Noun Detection. Tokens identified by heuristic (7) were dealt with separately by a procedure which guesses whether the nouns following the verb are two distinct arguments or parts of a compound. This procedure was applied only to noun sequences of length 2 and 3 which were extracted from the parser's output 2 and compared against a compound noun dictionary (48,661 entries) compiled from WordNet. 13.9% of the noun sequences were identified as compounds in the dictionary.","I Here MOD represents any prenominal modifier (e.g., articles, pronouns, adjectives, quantifiers, ordinals).","2Tokens containing noun sequences with length larger than 3 (450 in total) were considered negative instances of the double object frame. 398"]},{"title":"G-score ~\" 2-word compound","paragraphs":["1967.68 775.21 87.02 45.40 30.58 29.94 24.04"]},{"title":"bank manager tax liability","paragraphs":["income tax book reviewer"]},{"title":"designer gear safety plan","paragraphs":["drama"]},{"title":"school","paragraphs":["Table 1 : Random sample of two word compounds Table"]},{"title":"G-score 3-word compound","paragraphs":["574.48 382.92 77.78 48.84 36.44 32.35 23.98"]},{"title":"[[energy efficiency] office] [[council","paragraphs":["tax]"]},{"title":"bills] [alcohol [education course]] [hospital [out-patient department] [[turnout suppressor] function] [[nature conservation] resources] [[quality amplifier] circuits]","paragraphs":["2: Random sample of three word compounds","For sequences of length 2 not found in WordNet, we used the log-likelihood ratio (G-score) to estimate the lexical association between the nouns, in order to determine if they formed a compound noun. We preferred the log-likelihood ratio to other statistical scores, such as the association ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990) or ;(2, since it adequately takes into account the frequency of the co-occurring words and is less sensitive to rare events and corpus-size (Dunning, 1993; Daille, 1996). We assumed that two nouns cannot be disjoint arguments of the verb if they are lexically associated. On this basis, tokens were rejected as instances of the double object frame if they contained two nouns whose G-score had a p-value less than 0.05.","A two-step process was applied to noun sequences of length 3: first their bracketing was determined and second the G-score was computed between the single noun and the 2-noun sequence. We inferred the bracketing by modifying an algorithm initially proposed by Pustejovsky et al. (1993). Given three nouns n 1, n2, n3, if either [n I n2] or [n2 n3] are in the compound noun dictionary, we built structures [[nt n2] n3] or [r/l [n2 n3]] accordingly; if both [n I n2] and In2 n3] appear in the dictionary, we chose the most frequent pair; if neither [n l n2] nor [n2 n3] appear in WordNet, we computed the G-score for [nl n2] and [n2 n3] and chose the pair with highest value (p < 0.05).

Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a partial parser to extract (v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n. We used a variant of the method described in Hindle and Rooth (1993), the main difference being that we applied their lexical association score (a log-likelihood ratio which compares the probability of noun versus verb attachment) in an unsupervised non-iterative manner. Furthermore, the procedure was applied to the special case of tuples containing the prepositions to and for only. 2.4.1 Evaluation We evaluated the procedure by randomly selecting 2,124 tokens containing to-PPs and for-PPs for which the procedure guessed verb or noun attachment. The tokens were disambiguated by two judges. Precision figures are reported in table 3.","The lexicai association score was highly accurate on guessing both verb and noun attachment for to-PPs. Further evaluation revealed that for 98.6% (K = 0.9, N = 494, k -- 2) of the tokens classified as instances of verb attachment, the to-PP was an argument of the verb, which meant that the log-likelihood ratio satisfied both requirements (1) and (2) for to-PPs.","A low precision of 36% was achieved in detecting instances of noun attachment for for-PPs. One reason for this is the polysemy of the preposition for: for-PPs can be temporal, purposive, benefactive or causal adjuncts and consequently can attach to various sites. Another difficulty is that benefactive for-PPs semantically license both attachment sites.","To further analyze the poor performance of the log-likelihood ratio on this task, 500 tokens con-","4Syntactically speaking, benefactive for-PPs are not arguments but adjuncts (Jackendoff, 1990) and can appear on any verb with which they are semantically compatible. taining for-PPs were randomly selected from the parser's output and disambiguated. Of these 73.9% (K = 0.9, N = 500, k ---- 2) were instances of verb attachment, which indicates that verb attachments outnumber noun attachments for for-PPs, and there-fore a higher precision for verb attachment (cf. requirement (1)) can be achieved without applying the log-likelihood ratio, but instead classifying all instances as verb attachment. 2.5 Benefactive PPs Although surface syntactic cues can be important for determining the attachment site of prepositional phrases, they provide no indication of the semantic role of the preposition in question. This is particularly the case for the preposition for which can have several roles, besides the benefactive.","Two judges discriminated benefactive from non-benefactive PPs for 500 tokens, randomly selected from the parser's output. Only 18.5% (K ---- 0.73, N ---- 500, k = 2) of the sample contained benefactive PPs. An analysis of the nouns headed by the preposition for revealed that 59.6% were animate, 17% were collective, 4.9% denoted locations, and the remaining 18.5% denoted events, artifacts, body parts,'or actions. Animate, collective and location nouns account for 81.5% of the benefactive data.","We used the WordNet taxonomy (Miller et al., 1990) to recognize benefactive PPs (cf. requirement (3)). Nouns in WordNet are organized into an inheritance system defined by hypernymic relations. Instead of being contained in a single hierarchy, nouns are partitioned into a set of semantic primitives (e.g., act, animal, time) which are treated as the unique beginners of separate hierarchies. We compiled a \"concept dictionary\" from WordNet (87,642 entries), where each entry consisted of the noun and the semantic primitive distinguishing each noun sense (cf. table 4).","We considered a for-PP to be benefactive if the noun headed by for was listed in the concept dictionary and the semantic primitive of its prime sense (Sense 1) was person, animal, group or location. PPs with head nouns not listed in the dictionary were considered benefactive only if their head nouns were proper names. Tokens containing personal, indefinite and anaphoric pronouns were also considered benefactive (e.g., build a home for him).","Two judges evaluated the procedure by judging 1,000 randomly selected tokens, which were accepted or rejected as benefactive. The procedure achieved a precision of 48.8% (K ----- 0.89, N = 400 gift cooking teacher university city pencil Sense 1 Sense 2 Sense 3 possession food person group location artifact cognition act cognition artifact location act group group Table 4: Sample entries from WordNet concept dictionary 500, k = 2) in detecting benefactive tokens and 90.9% (K = .94, N = 499, k = 2) in detecting non-benefactive ones. 3 Filtering Filtering assesses how probable it is for a verb to be associated with a wrong frame. Erroneous frames can be the result of tagging errors, parsing mistakes, or errors introduced by the heuristics and procedures we used to guess syntactic structure.","We discarded verbs for which we had very little evidence (frame frequency = 1) and applied a relative frequency cutoff: the verb's acquired frame frequency was compared against its overall frequency in the BNC. Verbs whose relative frame frequency was lower than an empirically established threshold were discarded. The threshold values varied from frame to flame but not from verb to verb and were determined by taking into account for each frame its overall frame frequency which was estimated from the COMLEX subcategorization dictionary (6,000 verbs) (Grishman et al., 1994). This meant that the threshold was higher for less frequent frames (e.g., the double object frame for which only 79 verbs are listed in COMLEX).","We also experimented with a method suggested by Brent (1993) which applies the binomial test on frame frequency data. Both methods yielded comparable results. However, the relative frequency threshold worked slightly better and the results reported in the following section are based on this method. 4 Results We acquired 162 verbs for the double object frame, 426 verbs for the 'V NP1 to NP2' frame and 962 for the 'V NPl for NP2' frame. Membership in alternations was judged as follows: (a) a verb participates in the dative alternation if it has the double object and 'V NP1 to NP2' frames and (b) a verb Dative Alternation Alternating V NPI NP2 allot, assign, bring, fax, feed, flick, give, grant, guarantee, leave, lend offer, owe, take pass, pay, render, repay, sell, show, teach, tell, throw, toss, write, serve, send, award allocate, bequeath, carry, catapult, cede, concede, drag, drive, extend, ferry, fly, haul, hoist, issue, lease, peddle, pose, preach, push, relay, ship, tug, yield V NPI to NP2 ask, chuck, promise, quote, read, shoot, slip","Benefactive Alternation Alternating bake, build, buy, cast, cook, earn, fetch, find, fix, forge, gain, get, keep, knit, leave, make, pour, save procure, secure, set, toss, win, write V NPI NP2 arrange, assemble, carve, choose, compile, design, develop, dig, gather, grind, hire, play, prepare, reserve, run, sew V NP1 for NP2 boil, call, shoot Table 5: Verbs common in corpus and Levin participates in the benefactive alternation if it has the double object and 'V NP1 for NP2' frames. Table 5 shows a comparison of the verbs found in the corpus against Levin's list of verbs; 5 rows 'V NP1 to NP2' and 'V NP1 for NP2' contain verbs listed as alternating in Levin but for which we acquired only one frame. In Levin 115 verbs license the dative and 103 license the benefactive alternation. Of these we acquired 68 for the dative and 43 for the benefactive alternation (in both cases including verbs for which only one frame was acquired).","The dative and benefactive alternations were also acquired for 52 verbs not listed in Levin. Of these, 10 correctly alternate (cause, deliver, hand, refuse, report and set for the dative alternation and cause, spoil, afford and prescribe for the benefactive), and 12 can appear in either frame but do not alternate (e.g., appoint, fix, proclaim). For 18 verbs two frames were acquired but only one was correct (e.g., swap and forgive which take only the double object frame), and finally 12 verbs neither alternated nor had the acquired frames.
