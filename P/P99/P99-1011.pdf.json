This paper shows how a meta-grammar, defining structure at the meta level, is useful in the case of such operations; in particular, how it solves problems in the current definition of Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994) caused by ignoring such structure in mapping between grammars, for applications such as translation. Moreover, essential properties of the formalism remain unchanged. 1 Introduction A grammar is, among other things, a device by which it is possible to express structure in a set of entities; a grammar formalism, the constraints on how a grammar is allowed to express this. Once a grammar has been used to express structural relationships, in many applications there are operations which act at a 'meta level' on the structures expressed by the grammar: for example, lifting rules on a dependency grammar to achieve pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al, 1998), and mapping between synchronised Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber 1994) as in machine translation or syntax-to-semantics transfer. At this meta level, however, the operations do not themselves exploit any structure. This paper explores how, in the TAG case, using a meta-level grammar to define meta-level structure resolves the flaws in the ability of Synchronous TAG (S-TAG) to be a representation for applications such as machine translation or paraphrase. This paper is set out as follows. It describes the expressivity problems of S-TAG as noted in Shieber (1994), and shows how these occur also in syntactic paraphrasing. It then demonstrates, illustrated by the relative structural complexity which occurs at the meta level in syntactic paraphrase, how a meta-level grammar resolves the representational problems; and it further shows that this has no effect on the generative capacity of S-TAG. 2 S-TAG and Machine Translation Synchronous TAG, the mapping between two Tree Adjoining Grammars, was first proposed by Shieber and Schabes (1990). An applica-tion proposed concurrently with the definition of S-TAG was that of machine translation, mapping between English and French (Abeill~ et al, 1990); work continues in the area, for example using S-TAG for English-Korean machine translation in a practical system (Palmer et al, 1998). In mapping between, say, English and French, there is a lexicalised TAG for each language (see XTAG, 1995, for an overview of such a grammar). Under the definition of TAG, a grammar contains elementary trees, rather than flat rules, which combine together via the operations of substitution and adjunction (composition operations) to form composite structures--derived trees--which will ultimately provide structural representations for an input string if this string is grammatical. An overview of TAGs is given in Joshi and Schabes (1996). The characteristics of TAGs make them better suited to describing natural language than Context Free Grammars (CFGs): CFGs are not adequate to describe the entire syntax of natural language (Shieber, 1985), while TAGs are able to provide structures for the constructions problematic for CFGs, and without a much greater generative capacity.

The derivation trees are context free (Weir, 1988), that is, they can be expressed by a CFG; Weir showed that applying a TAG yield function to a context free derivation tree (that is, reading the labels off the tree, and substituting or adjoining the corresponding object-level trees as appropriate) will uniquely specify a TAG tree. Schabes and Shieber (1994) characterise this as a function 7) from derivation trees to derived trees. The idea behind S-TAG is to take two TAGs and link them in an appropriate way so that when substitution or adjunction occurs in a tree in one grammar, then a corresponding composition operation occurs in a tree in the other grammar. Because of the way TAG's EDL captures dependencies, it is not problematic to have translations more complex than word-for-word mappings (Abeill~"]},{"title":"et al,","paragraphs":["1990).

Hence, a redefinition was proposed (Shieber, 1994). Under this new definition, the mapping between grammars occurs at the meta level: there is an isomorphism between derivation trees, preserv-ing structure at the meta level, which establishes the translation. For example, the deriva- • tion trees for (1) using the elementary trees of Figure 3 is given in Figure 4; there is a clear isomorphism, with a bijection between nodes, and parent-child relationships preserved in the mapping.

Section 3 looks at representing syntactic paraphrase in S-TAG, where similar problems are encountered; in doing this, it can be seen more clearly than in translation that the difficulty is caused not by the isomorphism requirement it-self but by the fact that the isomorphism does not exploit any of the structure inherent in the derivation trees. 3 S-TAG and Paraphrase Syntactic paraphrase can also be described with S-TAG (Dras, 1997; Dras, forthcoming). The manner of representing paraphrase in S-TAG is similar to the translation representation described in Section 2. The reason for illustrating both is that syntactic paraphrase, because of its structural complexity, is able to illuminate the nature of the problem with S-TAG. In a specific parallel, a difficulty like that of the clitics occurs here also, for example in paraphrases such as (4). (4) a. The jacket which collected the dust was tweed. b. The jacket collected the dust. It was tweed. Tree pairs which could represent the elements in the mapping between (4a) and (4b) are given in Figure 6. It is clearly the case that the trees in the tree pair c~9 are not elementary trees, in the same way that on esp~re que is not represented by a single elementary tree: in both cases, such single elementary trees would violate the Condition on Elementary Tree Minimality (Frank, 1992). The tree pair a0 is the one that captures the syntactic rearrangement in this paraphrase; such a tree pair will be termed the STRUCTURAL MAPPING PAIR (SMP). Taking as a basic set of trees the XTAG standard grammar of English (XTAG, 1995), the derivation tree pair for (4) would be as in Figure 7. 3 Apart from c~9, each tree in Figure 6 corresponds to an elementary object-level tree, as indicated by its label; the remaining labels, indicated in bold in the meta-level' derivation tree in Figure 7, correspond to the elementary object-level trees forming (~9, in much the same way that on esp~re que is represented by a subderivation comprising an on tree substituted into an esp~re que tree. Note that the nodes corresponding to the left tree of the SMP form two discontinuous groups, but these discontinuous groups are clearly related. Dras (forthcoming) describes the conditions under which these discontinuous groupings are acceptable in paraphrase; these discontinuous groupings are treated as a single block with SLOTS connecting the groupings, whose fillers must be of particular types. Fundamentally, however, the structure is the same as for clitics: in one derivation tree the grouped elements are in one branch of the tree, and in the other they are in two separate branches with the possibility of an unbounded amount of intervening material, as described below in Section 4. 4 Meta-Level Structure Example (5) illustrates why the paraphrase in (4) has the same difficulty as the clitic example in (3) when represented in S-TAG: because unbounded intervening material can occur when promoting arbitrarily deeply embedded relative clauses to sentence level, as indicated by Figure 8, an isomorphism is not possible between derivation trees representing paraphrases such as (4) and (5). Again, the component trees of the SMP are in bold in Figure 8. (5) a. The jacket which collected the dust which covered the floor was tweed. b.

It is clear that the meta level is fundamentally not just for establishing a one-to-one onto mapping between nodes; rather, it is also about defining structures representing, for example, the","4The referring expression that is the subject of this second sentence has changed from it in (4) to the dust so the antecedent is clear. Ensuring it is appropriately coreferent, by using two occurrences of the same diacritic in the same tree, necessitates a change in the properties of the formalism unrelated to the one discussed in this paper; see Dras (forthcoming). Assume, for the purpose of this example, that the referring expression is fixed and given, as is the case with it, rather than determined by coindexed diacritics. SMP at this meta level: in an isomorphism between trees in Figure 8, it is necessary to regard the SMP components of each tree as a unitary substructure and map them to each other. The discontinuous groupings should form these substructures regardless of intervening material, and this is suggestive of TAG's EDL. In the TAG definition, the derivation trees are context free (Weir, 1988), and can be expressed by a CFG. The isomorphism in the S-TAG definition of Shieber (1994) reflects this, by effectively adopting the single-level domain of locality (extended slightly in cases of bounded subderivation, but still effectively a single level), in the way that context free trees are fundamentally made from single level components and grown by concatenation of these single levels. This is what causes the isomorphism requirement to fail, the inability to express substructures at the meta level in order to map between them, rather than just mapping between (effec-84 ..............."]},{"title":"y Nx¢~]","paragraphs":["~DXDI, h0] ~l[:o~I~dJ /~COMPs[which] aNXdxN[dust] aDXD[the] /~N0nx0Vnxl [covered] aDXD[t he] flVvx[~s] .. _ %~xdx~lNf~c~ ~Vvx[is] /~sPUs[.] ~DXD[the] ~N0nx0Vnx l[coliect ed] anxOVnxl [covered] ~COMPs[which] aNXdxN[dust] aNXN[it] oNXdxN[floor] ~DXD[the] aDXD[the] Figure 8: Derivation tree for example (5) tively) single nodes. To solve the problem with isomorphism, a meta-level grammar can be defined to specify the necessary substructures prior to mapping, with minimality conditions on what can be considered acceptable discontinuity. Specifically, in this case, a TAG meta-level grammar can be defined, rather than the implicit CFG, because this captures the EDL well. The TAG yield function of Weir (1988) can then be applied to these derivation trees to get derived trees. This, of course, raises questions about effects on generative capacity and other properties; these are dealt with in Section 5. A procedure for automatically constructing a TAG meta-grammar is as follows in Construction 1. The basic idea is that where the node bijection is still appropriate, the grammar retains its context free nature (by using single-level TAG trees composed by substitution, mimicking CFG tree concatenation), but where EDL is required, multi-level TAG initial trees are defined, with TAG auxiliary trees for describing the intervening material. These meta-level trees are then mapped appropriately; this corresponds to a bijection of nodes at the meta-meta level. For (5), the meta-level grammar for the left projection then looks as in Figure 9, and for the right projection as in Figure 10. • Figure 11 contains the meta-meta-level trees, the tree pair that is the derivation of the meta level, where the mapping is a bijection between nodes. Adding unbounded material would then just be reflected in the meta-meta-level as a list of/3 nodes depending from the j315/j31s nodes in these trees. The question may be asked, Why isn't it the case that the same effect will occur at the meta-meta level that required the meta-grammar in the first place, leading perhaps to an infinite (and useless) sequence? The intuition is that it is the meta-level, rather than anywhere 'higher', which is fundamentally the place to specify structure: the object level specifies the trees, and the meta level specifies the grouping or structure of these trees. Then the mapping takes place on these structures, rather than the object-level trees; hence the need for a grammar at the meta-level but not beyond. Construction 1 To build a TAG metagrammar:","1. An initial tree in the metagrammar is formed for each part of the derivation tree corresponding to the substructure representing an SMP, including the slots so that a contiguous tree is formed. Any node that links these parts of the derivation tree to other subtrees in the derivation tree is also included, and becomes a substitution node in the metagrammar tree.","2. Auxiliary trees are formed corresponding to the parts of the derivation trees that are slot fillers along with the nodes in the discontinuous regions adjacent to the slots; one contiguous auxiliary tree is formed for each bounded sequence of slot fillers within each substructure. These trees also satisfy certain minimality conditions.","3. The remaining metagrammar trees then come from splitting the derivation tree into single-level trees, with the nodes on 85 Ot13: anx0Axl ~NXdxN ~Vvx aDXD ~N0nx0Vnxl ~COMPs aNXdxN$ a14: c~NXdxN","I aDXD J315: aNXdxN aDXD ~N0nx0Vnxl ~COMPs aNXdxN, Figure 9: Meta-grammar for (5a) these single-level trees in the metagrammar marked for substitution if the corresponding nodes in the derivation tree have subtrees. The minimality conditions in Step 2 of Construction 1 are in keeping with the idea of minimality elsewhere in TAG (for example, Frank, 1992). The key condition is that meta-level auxiliary trees are rooted in c~-labelled nodes, and have only ~-labelled nodes along the spine. The intuition here is that slots (the nodes which meta-level auxiliary trees adjoin into) must be c~-labelled: fl-labelled trees would not need slots, as the substructure could instead be continuous and the j3-1abelled trees would just adjoin in. So the meta-level auxiliary trees are rooted in c~-labelled trees; but they have only ~- labelled trees in the spine, as they aim to represent the minimal amount of recursive material. Notwithstanding these conditions, the construc-tion is quite straightforward. 5 Generative Capacity Weir (1988) showed that there is an infinite progression of TAG-related formalisms, in generative capacity between CFGs and indexed grammars. A formalism ~-i in the progression is defined by applying the TAG yield function to a derivation tree defined by a grammar formalism ~16; cmx0Axl ~NXdxN ~Vvx /~sPUs I I c~DXD aNXdxN c~NXdxN c~NXdxN$ cqT: aNXdxN","I aDXD aNXdxN c~DXD ~N0nx0Vnxl ~COMPs c~NXdxN, Figure 10: Meta-grammar for (5b) 0t14 ~15 a17 ~18/ Figure 11: Derivation tree pair for Fig 3 5~i_1; the generative capacity of ~i is a superset of ~'i-1- Thus using a TAG meta-grammar, as described in Section 4, would suggest that the generative capacity of the object-level formalism would necessarily have been increased over that of TAG. However, there is a regular form for TAGs (Rogers, 1994), such that the trees of TAGs in this regular form are local sets; that is, they are context free. The meta-level TAG built by Construction 1 with the appropriate conditions on slots is in this regular form. A proof of this is in Dras (forthcoming); a sketch is as follows. If adjunction may not occur along the spine of another auxiliary tree, the grammar is in regular form. This kind of adjunction does not occur under Construction 1 because all meta-level auxiliary trees are rooted in c~-labelled trees (object-level auxiliary trees), while their spines consist only of p-labelled trees (object-level initial trees). Since the meta-level grammar is context free, despite being expressed using a TAG grammar, this means that the object-level grammar is still 8{} a TAG. 6 Conclusion In principle, a meta-grammar is desirable, as it specifies substructures at a meta level, which is necessary when operations are carried out that are applied at this meta level. In a practical application, it solves problems in one such formalism, S-TAG, when used for paraphrase or translation, as outlined by Shieber (1994). Moreover, the formalism remains fundamentally the same, in specifying mappings between two grammars of restricted generative capacity; and in cases where this is important, it is possible to avoid changing the generative capacity of the S-TAG formalism in applying this meta-grammar. Currently this revised version of the S-TAG formalism is used as the low-level representation in the Reluctant Paraphrasing framework of Dras (1998; forthcoming). It is likely to also be useful in representations for machine translation between languages that are structurally more dissimilar than English and French, and hence more in need of structural definition of object-level constructs; exploring this is future work."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Abeill@, Anne, Yves Schabes and Aravind Joshi. 1990.
