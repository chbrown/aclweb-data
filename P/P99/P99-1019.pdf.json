Recently, the search for higher abstraction has been, however, challenged (E1hadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Rambow, 1997)(Busemann and Horacek, 1998). In this paper, we contribute to the issue of selecting the \"ideal\" abstraction level in the input to syntactic realization grammar by considering the case of partitives and possessives in a bilingual Hebrew-English generation grammar. In the case of bilingual generation, the ultimate goal is to provide a single input structure, where only the open-class lexical entries are specific to the language. In that case, the minimal abstraction required must cover the different syntactic constraints of the two languages.","We present a contrastive analysis of the syntactic realizations of possessives and partitives in Hebrew and English and conclude by presenting an input specification for complex NPs which is slightly more abstract than the one used in SURGE.

Traditionally, syntactic realization components have attempted to raise the abstraction level of input specifications for two reasons: (1) to preserve the possibility of paraphrasing and (2) to make it easy for the sentence planner to map from semantic data to syntactic input","As new applications appear, that cannot start generation from a semantic input because such an input is not available (for example re-generation of sentences from syntactic fragments to produce summaries (Barzilay et al., 1999) or generation of complex NPs in a hybrid template system for business letters (Gedalia, 1996)), this motivation has lost some of its strength. Consequently, \"shallow surface generators\" have recently appeared (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) (Busemann and Horacek, 1998) that require an input considerably less abstract than those required by more traditional realization components such as SURGE (E1hadad and Robin, 1996) or KPML (Bateman, 1997).","In this paper, we contribute to the debate on selecting an appropriate level of abstraction by considering the case of bilingual generation. We present results obtained while developing the HUGG syntactic realization component for Hebrew (Dahan-Netzer, 1997). One of the goals of this system is to design a generator with an input specification language as similar as possible to that of an English generator, SURGE in our case.","The ideal scenario for bilingual generation is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of the 144 John gave a book to Mary John natan sefer le-Mary"]},{"title":"cat proc partic :lause type relation-type agent affected possessor possessed composite ] possessive lex 'John' gender masculine [cat proper ] [1] lex 'Mary' gender feminine","paragraphs":["[1]"]},{"title":"cat common ] lex 'book/sefer'","paragraphs":["Figure 1\" Ideal scenario for bilingual generation following steps:","1. Prepare an input specification in one language","2. Translate all the lexical entries (func-tion words do not appear) 3.

In this case, we conclude that the input abstraction level is appropriate. In contrast, if the input had specified a structure such as indirect-object(prep=to/le, np--Mary), then it would not have been abstract enough to serve as a bilingual input structure.","Similarly, the English possessive marker is very close to the Hebrew \"construct state\" (smixut): The King's palace Armon ha-melex Palace-cs the-king","The following input structure seems, therefore, appropriate for both languages:"]},{"title":"lex possessor common 1 \"palace\" / \"armon\" [leXdefinite yes\"king\"/\"melex\"]","paragraphs":["There are, however, divergences between","the use of smixut in Hebrew and of the pos-","sessive marker in English: Segovia's pupil The pupil of Segovia * talmyd segovyah talmyd Sel segovyah ?

Dorr focuses on divergences at the clause level as illustrated by the following example:","I like Mary","Maria me gusta a mi","Mary pleases me","Dorr selects a representation structure based on Jackendoff's Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1990).","In the KPML system, the proposed solution is based on the systemic notion of \"delicacy\" and the assumption is that lowdelicacy input features (the most abstract ones) remain common to the two target languages and high-delicacy features would differ.","In this paper, we focus on the input specification for complex NPs. The main reason for this choice is that the input for NPs in SURGE has remained close to English syntax (low abstraction). It consists of the following main sub-constituents: head, classitier, describer, qualifier and determiner.","In previous work (Elhadad, 1996), we discuss how to map a more abstract domain-specific representation to the SURGE input 145 structure within a sentence planner. When moving to a bilingual generator, we have found the need for a higher level of abstraction to avoid encoding language-specific knowledge in the sentence planners. We specifically discuss here the following decisions:","• How to realize a possessive relation: John's shirt vs. the shirt of John","• How to realize a partitive relation: all the kids vs. all of the kids","In the rest of the paper, we first present basic contrastive data and existing analyses about possessives and partitives in Hebrew and English. We then present the input features we have designed to cover possessives and partitives in both languages and discuss how these features are used to account for the main decisions required of the realizer. We conclude by an evaluation of the bilingual input structure on a set of 100 sample input structures for complex NPs in the two languages and of the divergences that remain in the generated NPs. In conclusion, this bilingual analysis has helped us identify important abstractions that lead to more fluent generation in both languages."]},{"title":"2 Possessives and Partitives in Hebrew and English","paragraphs":["This section briefly presents data on possessives and partitives in English and Hebrew. These observations delimit the questions we address in the paper: when is a genitive construct used to express possessives and when is an explicit partitive used. 2.1","Possessives in English Possessives can be realized in two basic structures: as part of the determiner sequence (Halliday, 1994) (as either a possessive pronoun or a full NP marked with apostrophe-s as a genitive marker) or as a construct NP of NP.","In addition to possessive, the genitive marker can realize several semantic relations (Quirk et al., 1985) (pp.192-203): subjec-tive genitive (the boy's application --the boy applied) , genitive of origin (the girl's story -- the girl told a story), objective genitive, descriptive genitive (a women's college -- a college for woman).","As a consequence of this versatility, the general decision of apostrophe vs. of is not trivial: Quirk claims that the higher on the gender scale, i.e., the more animate the noun, the more the possessor realization tends to be realized as an inflected genitive: • Person's name: Segovia's pupil • Person's nouns: the boy's new shirt","• Collective nouns: the nation's social security • Higher Animals: the horse's neck • Geographical names: Europe's future • Locative nouns: the school's history • Temporal nouns: the decade's event","This decision also interacts with other realization decisions: if several modifiers must be attached to the same head, they can compete for the same slot in the syntactic structure. In such cases, the decision is one of preference ranking: The boy's application of last year vs. last year's application of the boy. 2.2","Possessives in Hebrew Possessives in Hebrew can be realized by three syntactic constructions: construct state cadur ha-tynok ball the-baby free genitive ha-cadur Sel ha-tynok the ball of the baby double genitive cadur-o Sel ha-tynok ball-his of the-baby","The construct state (called smixut) is similar to the apostrophe marker in English: it involves a noun adjacent to another noun or noun phrase, without any marker (like a preposition) between them (Berman, 1978). The head noun in the construct form generally undergoes morphological changes: yaldah - yaldat. Smixut is, on the one hand, very productive in Hebrew and yet very constrained (Dahan-Netzer and E1hadad, 1998b). 146","Free genitive constructs use a prepositional phrase with the preposition"]},{"title":"Sel.","paragraphs":["Many studies treat"]},{"title":"Sel","paragraphs":["as a case marker only (cf. (Berman, 1978) (Yzhar, 1993) (Borer, 1988)).","The choice of one of the three forms seems to be stylistic and vary in spoken and written Hebrew (cf. (Berman, 1978), (Glineft, 1989), (Ornan, 1964), and discussion in (Seikevicz, 1979)). But, in addition to these pragmatic factors and as is the case for the English genitive, the construct state can realize a wide variety of semantic relations (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), (Azar, 1985), (Levi, 1976). The selection is also a matter of preference ranking among competitors for the same syntactic slot. For example, we have shown in (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b) that the semantic relations that can be realized by a construct state are the ones defined as classifier in SURGE. Therefore, the co-occurrence of such a relation with another classifier leads to a competition for the syntactic slot of \"classifier\" and also contributes to the decision of how to realize a possessive.","Consider the following example: cat head classifier possessor common lex \"Simlah\"/\"dress\" ] lex \"Sabat\" ] cat common ] lex \"yalda\"/\"girl\"","If only the possessor is provided in the fol-","lowing input, it can be mapped to a con-","struct state:","Simlat ha-yaldah","dress-cs the-girl","the girl's dress If a classifier is provided in addition,","the construct-state slot is not available","anymore 1, and the free genitive construct","must be used:","Simlat ha-Sabat Sel ha-yaldah","dress-cs the-Shabat of the-girl","The Shabat dress of the girl","l If the classifier had been specified in the input as a semantic relation as discussed in (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), an alternative realization (The"]},{"title":"girl's dress/or Shabat)","paragraphs":["could have been obtained. 2.3","Partitives in English The partitive relation denotes a subset of the thing to which the head of a noun phrase refers.

In contrast to English, quantifiers that are marked as partitive, cannot be used in an explicitly partitive structure:","roy ha-yeladym - * roy me-ha-yeladym - most of the","children Se'ar ha-yeladym - * Se'ar me-ha-yeladym - the rest of the","children col ha-yeladym - * col me-ha-yeladym - all of the children","Conversely, a quantifier that is not marked","as partitive can be used in an explicitly par-","titive structure:","harbeh yeladym - many children harbeh me-hayeladym - many of the children","mewat ha-yeladym - few the-children mewat me-ha-yeladym - few of the-children There are complex restrictions in Hebrew on the co-occurrence of several determiners in the same NP and on their relative ordering within the NP. To explain them, Glinert (Glinert, 1989) adopts a functional perspective, quite appropriate to the needs of a generation system, and identifies a general pattern for the NP, that we use as a basis for the mapping rules in HUGG: [partitive determiner amount head classifiers describers post-det/quant qualifiers]","Yzhar and Doron (Doron, 1991) (Yzhar, 1993) distinguish between two sets of determiners, that they call D and Q quantifiers. The distinction is based on syntactic features, such as position, ability to be modified, ability to participate in partitive structures and requirement to agree in number and gender with the head. This distinction is used to explain co-occurrence restrictions, the order of appearance of D vs Q quantifiers and the recursive structure of D determiners: D determiners can be layered on top of other D determiners. A single Q quantifier can occur in an NP and it remains attached closest to the head.","In (Dahan-Netzer, 1997) and (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998a), we have refined the D/Q classification and preferred using functional criteria: we map the Q quantitiers to the \"amount\" category defined by Glinert, and the D set is split into the partitive and determiner categories - each with a different function. Of these, only partitives are recursive.","Given these observations, the following decisions must be left \"open\" in the input to the realizer: how to map a possessor to different realizations; in which order to place co-occurring quantifiers; and whether to use an explicit of construct for partitive quantitiers. The input specification language must also enforce that only acceptable recursive structures be expressible. 3 Defining an Abstract Input","for NP Realization 3.1 Input Features The input structure for NPs we adopt is split in four groups of features, which appear in Figure 3.1:","• Head or reference-set: defines the thing or set referred to by the NP","• Qualifying: adds information to the thing","• Identifying: identifies the thing among other possible referents","• Quantifying: determines the quantity or amount of the thing.","The main modifications from the existing SURGE input structure are the introduction of the re/-set feature and the update of the usage of the possessor feature.","For both of these features, the main requirement on the realizer is to properly handle cases of \"competition\" for the same restricted syntactic slot, as illustrated in the Shabat dress example above.","The possible realizations of possessor are controlled by the feature realize-possessor-as free-genitive, bound or double-genitive. Defaults (unmarked cases) vary between the two languages and the co-occurrence constraints also vary, because each form is mapped to different syntactic slots.","For example, a bound possessor is mapped to the determiner slot in English, while in Hebrew it is mapped to a classifier slot. 148 Qualifying features English Realization Hebrew Realization classifier Leather shoe nawal wor Electric chair cise' HaSmaly describer Pretty boy yeled yafeh qualifier A story about a cat sypur wal Hatul A story I read sypur S-kar'aty possessor The king's palace Armon ha-melez A palace of a king Armon Sel melez The book of his Armono Seio Identifying features distance That boy yeled zeh Ordinal The third child ha-yeled ha-SlySy status (deictic2) Definite yes/no Selective yes/no Total +/-/none The same child The/a book Some/D children All/No/~ children Quantifying features I Oto yeled (ha) seyer Total +/-/none Cardinal The three children Fraction Multiplier degree + degree-degree none comparative yes One-third o I the children Twice his weight (The) many ears A little butter Some children Mofl~ ears superlative yes The most cars evaluative yes Too many ears orientation-Few cars col hayeladym, A] EHad me-ha-yeladym SloSet ha-yeladym SIyS me-ha-yeladym ciflaym miSkalo harbeh mezonyot, ha-mezonyot ha-rabot kZa T Hems 'h eamah yeladym yoter mezonyot roy ha-mezonyot yoter m-day mezonyot mewaT mezonyot Figure 2: Input features","When possessives are realized as free genitives, they are mapped to the slot of qualifiers, usually in the front position.

The ordering decision must rely on semantic information (purpose) that is not available in our general input structure (cf.

The standard order is: [partitive determiner amount head]","As noted above, only partitives can enter into recursive structures, in both Hebrew 149 and English. Accordingly, our input specification language enforces the constraint that only a single amount and a single identifica-tion feature can be present simultaneously.","Whenever a partitive quantifier is desired, the input specification must include a ref-set feature instead of the head.
