This information is important for the fluency of generated text in practical applications. We propose and evaluate three approaches to identify sequential order among premodifiers: direct evidence, transitive closure, and clustering. Our implemented system can make over 94% of such ordering decisions correctly, as evaluated on a large, previously unseen test corpus. 1","Introduction Sequential ordering among premodifiers affects the fluency of text, e.g., \"large foreign financial firms\" or \"zero-coupon global bonds\" are desirable, while \"foreign large financial firms\" or \"global zero-coupon bonds\" sound odd. The difficulties in specifying a consistent ordering of adjectives have already been noted by linguists [Whorf 1956; Vendler 1968]. During the process of generating complex sentences by combining multiple clauses, there are situations where multiple adjectives or nouns modify the same head noun. The text generation system must order these modifiers in a similar way as domain experts use them to ensure fluency of the text. For example, the description of the age of a patient precedes his ethnicity and gender in medical domain as in % 50 year-old white female patient\". Yet, general lexicons such as WordNet [Miller et al. 1990] and COMLEX [Grishman et al. 1994], do not store such information.","In this paper, we present automated techniques for addressing this problem of determin-ing, given two premodifiers A and B, the preferred ordering between them. Our methods rely on and generalize empirical evidence obtained from large corpora, and are evaluated objectively on such corpora. They are informed and motivated by our practical need for ordering multiple premodifiers in the MAGIC system [Dalal et al. 1996]. MAGIC utilizes co-ordinated text, speech, and graphics to convey information about a patient's status after coronary by-pass surgery; it generates concise but complex descriptions that frequently involve four or more premodifiers in the same noun phrase.","To demonstrate that a significant portion of noun phrases have multiple premodifiers, we extracted all the noun phrases (NPs, exclud-ing pronouns) in a two million word corpus of medical discharge summaries and a 1.5 million word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (see Section 4 for a more detailed description of the corpora). In the medical corpus, out of 612,718 NPs, 12% have multiple premodifiers and 6% contain solely multiple adjectival premodifiers. In the WSJ corpus, the percentages are a little lower, 8% and 2%, respectively. These percentages imply that one in ten NPs contains multiple premodifiers while one in 25 contains just multiple adjectives.","Traditionally, linguists study the premodifier ordering problem using a class-based approach. Based on a corpus, they propose various semantic classes, such as color, size, or nationality, and specify a sequential order among the classes. However, it is not always clear how to map premodifiers to these classes, especially in domain-specific applications. This justifies the exploration of empirical, corpus-based alternatives, where the ordering between A and B is determined either from direct prior evidence in the corpus or indirectly through other words whose relative order to A and B has already been established. The corpus-based approach lacks the ontological knowledge used by linguists, but uses a much larger amount of di-135 rect evidence, provides answers for many more premodifier orderings, and is portable to different domains.","In the next section, we briefly describe prior linguistic research on this topic. Sections 3 and 4 describe the methodology and corpus used in our analysis, while the results of our experiments are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we demonstrate how we incorporated our ordering results in a general text generation system. Finally, Section 7 discusses possible improvements to our current approach. 2 Related Work The order of adjectives (and, by analogy, nominal premodifiers) seems to be outside of the grammar; it is influenced by factors such as polarity [Malkiel 1959], scope, and collocational restrictions [Bache 1978]. Linguists [Goyvaerts 1968; Vendler 1968; Quirk and Greenbaum 1973; Bache 1978; Dixon 1982] have performed manual analyses of (small) corpora and pointed out various tendencies, such as the facts that underived adjectives often precede derived adjectives, and shorter modifiers precede longer ones. Given the difficulty of adequately describ-ing all factors that influence the order of premodifiers, most earlier work is based on placing the premodifiers into broad semantic classes, and specifying an order among these classes. More than ten classes have been proposed, with some of them further broken down into sub-classes. Though not all these studies agree on the details, they demonstrate that there is fairly rigid regularity in the ordering of adjectives. For example, Goyvaerts [1968, p. 27] proposed the order quality -< size/length/shape -< old/new/young -< color -< nationality -< style -< gerund -< denominall; Quirk and Greenbaum [1973, p. 404] the order general -< age -< color -< participle -< provenance -< noun -< denominal; and Dixon [1982, p. 24] the order value -< dimension -< physical property -< speed -< human propensity -< age -< color.","Researchers have also looked at adjective ordering across languages [Dixon 1982; Frawley 1992]. Frawley [1992], for example, observed that English, German, Hungarian, Polish, Turkish, Hindi, Persian, Indonesian, and Basque, all 1Where A ~ B stands for \"A precedes B'. order value before size and both of those before color.","As with most manual analyses, the corpora used in these analyses are relatively small compared with modern corpora-based studies. Furthermore, different criteria were used to arrive at the classes. To illustrate, the adjective \"beautiful\" can be classified into at least two different classes because the phrase \"beautiful dancer\" can be transformed from either the phrase \"dancer who is beautiful\", or \"dancer who dances beautifully\".","Several deep semantic features have been proposed to explain the regularity among the positional behavior of adjectives. Teyssier [1968] first proposed that adjectival functions, i.e. identification, characterization, and classification, affect adjective order. Martin [1970] carried out psycholinguistic studies of adjective ordering. Frawley [1992] extended the work by Kamp [1975] and proposed that intensional modifiers precede extensional ones. However, while these studies offer insights at the complex phenomenon of adjective ordering, they cannot be directly mapped to a computational procedure.","On the other hand, recent computational work on sentence planning [Bateman et al. 1998; Shaw 1998b] indicates that generation research has progressed to a point where hard problems such as ellipsis, conjunctions, and ordering of paradigmatically related constituents are addressed. Computational corpus studies related to adjectives were performed by [Justeson and Katz 1991; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997], but none was directly on the ordering problem. [Knight and Hatzivassiloglou 1995] and [Langkilde and Knight 1998] have proposed models for incorporating statistical information into a text generation system, an approach that is similar to our way of using the evidence obtained from corpus in our actual generator. 3 Methodology In this section, we discuss how we obtain the premodifier sequences from the corpus for analysis and the three approaches we use for establishing ordering relationships: direct corpus evidence, transitive closure, and clustering analysis. The result of our analysis is embodied in a 136 function,"]},{"title":"compute_order(A,","paragraphs":["B), which returns the sequential ordering between two premoditiers, word A and word B.","To identify orderings among premodifiers, premodifier sequences are extracted from simplex NPs. A simplex NP is a maximal noun phrase that includes premodifiers such as determiners and possessives but not post-nominal constituents such as prepositional phrases or relative clauses. We use a part-of-speech tagger [Brill 1992] and a finite-state grammar to extract simplex NPs. The noun phrases we extract start with an optional determiner (DT) or possessive pronoun (PRP$), followed by a sequence of cardinal numbers (CDs), adjectives (JJs), nouns (NNs), and end with a noun. We include cardinal numbers in NPs to capture the ordering of numerical information such as age and amounts. Gerunds (tagged as VBG) or past participles (tagged as"]},{"title":"VBN),","paragraphs":["such as \"heated\" in \"heated debate\", are considered as adjectives if the word in front of them is a determiner, possessive pronoun, or adjective, thus separat-ing adjectival and verbal forms that are conflared by the tagger. A morphology module transforms plural nouns and comparative and superlative adjectives into their base forms to ensure maximization of our frequency counts. There is a regular expression filter which removes obvious concatenations of simplex NPs such as \"takeover bid last week\" and \"Tylenol 40 milligrams\".","After simplex NPs are extracted, sequences of premodifiers are obtained by dropping determiners, genitives, cardinal numbers and head nouns. Our subsequent analysis operates on the resulting premodifier sequences, and involves three stages: direct evidence, transitive closure, and clustering. We describe each stage in more detail in the following subsections. 3.1","Direct Evidence Our analysis proceeds on the hypothesis that the relative order of two premodifiers is fixed and independent of context. Given two premodifiers A and B, there are three possible underlying orderings, and our system should strive to find which is true in this particular case: either A comes before B, B comes before A, or the order between A and B is truly unimportant. Our first stage relies on frequency data collected from a training corpus to predict the order of adjective and noun premodifiers in an unseen test corpus.","To collect direct evidence on the order of premodifiers, we extract all the premodifiers from the corpus as described in the previous subsection. We first transform the premoditier sequences into"]},{"title":"ordered pairs.","paragraphs":["For example, the phrase \"well-known traditional brand-name drug\" has three ordered pairs, \"well-known -< traditional\", \"well-known -~ brand-name\", and \"traditional -~ brand-name\".

However, given a corpus of a fixed size there will be many cases where the frequency counts will both be small. This data sparseness problem is exacerbated by the inevitable occurrence of errors during the data extraction process, which will introduce some spurious pairs (and orderings) of premodifiers. We therefore apply probabilistic reasoning to determine when the data is strong enough to decide that A -~ B or B -~ A. Under the null hypothesis that the two premoditiers order is arbitrary, the number of times we have seen one of them follows the binomial distribution with parameter p -- 0.5. The probability that we would see the actually observed number of cases with A ~ B, say m, among n pairs involving A and B is k----m which for the special case p = 0.5 becomes"]},{"title":"(0 (0 k=m k=rn","paragraphs":["If this probability is low, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that A indeed precedes (or follows, as indicated by the relative frequencies) B. 137 3.2 Transitivity As we mentioned before, sparse data is a serious problem in our analysis. For example, the matrix of frequencies for adjectives in our training corpus from the medical domain is 99.8% empty--only 9,106 entries in the 2,232 x 2,232 matrix contain non-zero values. To compensate for this problem, we explore the transitive properties between ordered pairs by computing the transitive closure of the ordering relation. Utilizing transitivity information corresponds to making the inference that A -< C follows from A -~ B and B -< C, even if we have no direct evidence for the pair (A, C) but provided that there is no contradictory evidence to this inference either. This approach allows us to fill from 15% (WSJ) to 30% (medical corpus) of the entries in the matrix.","To compute the transitive closure of the order relation, we map our underlying data to special cases of"]},{"title":"commutative semirings","paragraphs":["[Pereira and Riley 1997].

We use logarithms to address computational precision is-sues stemming from the multiplication of small probabilities, and negate the logarithms so that we cast the problem as a minimization task (i.e., we find the path in the graph the minimizes the total sum of negative log probabilities, and therefore maximizes the product of the original probabilities). 3.3 Clustering As noted earlier, earlier linguistic work on the ordering problem puts words into semantic classes and generalizes the task from ordering between specific words to ordering the corresponding classes. We follow a similar, but evidence-based, approach for the pairs of words that neither direct evidence nor transitivity can resolve. We compute an"]},{"title":"order similarity","paragraphs":["measure between any two premodifiers, reflecting whether the two words share the same pat-138 tern of relative order with other premodifiers for which we have sufficient evidence. For each pair of premodifiers A and B, we examine every other premodifier in the corpus, X; if both A -~ X and B -~ X, or both A ~- X and B ~- X, one point is added to the similarity score between A and B. If on the other hand A -~ X and B ~- X, or A ~- X and B -~ X, one point is subtracted. X does not contribute to the similarity score if there is not sufficient prior evidence for the relative order of X and A, or of X and B. This procedure closely parallels non-parametric distributional tests such as Kendall's T [Kendall 1938].","The similarity scores are then converted into dissimilarities and fed into a non-hierarchical clustering algorithm [Sp~th 1985], which separates the premodifiers in groups. This is achieved by minimizing an"]},{"title":"objective function,","paragraphs":["defined as the sum of within-group dissimilarities over all groups. In this manner, premoditiers that are closely similar in terms of sharing the same relative order with other premodifiers are placed in the same group.","Once classes of premodifiers have been in-duced, we examine every pair of classes and decide which precedes the other. For two classes C1 and C2, we extract all pairs of premodifiers (x, y) with x E C1 and y E C2. If we have evidence (either direct or through transitivity) that x -~ y, one point is added in favor of C1 -~ C2; similarly, one point is subtracted if x ~- y. After all such pairs have been considered, we can then predict the relative order between words in the two clusters which we haven't seen together earlier. This method makes (weak) predictions for any pair (A, B) of words, except if (a) both A and B axe placed in the same cluster; (b) no ordered pairs (x, y) with one element in the class of A and one in the class of B have been identified; or (c) the evidence for one class preceding the other is in the aggregate equally strong in both directions. 4 The Corpus We used two corpora for our analysis: hospital discharge summaries from 1991 to 1997 from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and the January 1996 part of the Wall Street Journal corpus from the Penn TreeBank [Marcus et"]},{"title":"al.","paragraphs":["1993]. To facilitate comparisons across the two corpora, we intentionally limited ourselves to only one month of the WSJ corpus, so that approximately the same amount of data would be examined in each case. The text in each corpus is divided into a training part (2.3 million words for the medical corpus and 1.5 million words for the WSJ) and a test part (1.2 million words for the medical corpus and 1.6 million words for the WSJ).","All domain-specific markup was removed, and the text was processed by the MXTERMINATOR sentence boundary detector [Reynar and Ratnaparkhi 1997] and Brill's part-of-speech tagger [Brill 1992]. Noun phrases and pairs of premodifiers were extracted from the tagged corpus according to the methods of Section 3. From the medical corpus, we retrieved 934,823 simplex NPs, of which 115,411 have multiple premodifiers and 53,235 multiple adjectives only. The corresponding numbers for the WSJ corpus were 839,921 NPs, 68,153 NPs with multiple premodifiers, and 16,325 NPs with just multiple adjectives.","We separately analyze two groups of premoditiers: adjectives, and adjectives plus nouns modifying the head noun. Although our techniques are identical in both cases, the division is motivated by our expectation that the task will be easier when modifiers are limited to adjectives, because nouns tend to be harder to match correctly with our finite-state grammar and the in-put data is sparser for nouns. 5 Results We applied the three ordering algorithms proposed in this paper to the two corpora separately for adjectives and adjectives plus nouns.

We elected to follow this evaluation approach, which lowers the apparent scores of our method, rather than forcing each pair in the test corpus to one unambiguous category (A -< B, B -< A, or arbitrary).","Under this evaluation method, stage one of our system achieves on adjectives in the medical domain 98.47% correct decisions on pairs for which a determination of order could be made. Since 11.80% of the total pairs in the test corpus involve previously unseen combinations of adjectives and/or new adjectives, the overall accuracy is 92.67%. The corresponding accuracy on data for which we can make a prediction and the overall accuracy is 98.35% and 88.79% for adjectives plus nouns in the medical domain, 98.37% and 75.41% for adjectives in the WSJ data, and 95.27% and 65.93% for adjectives plus nouns in the WSJ data. Note that the WSJ corpus is considerably more sparse, with 64.24% unseen combinations of adjective and noun premoditiers in the test part. Using lower thresholds in equation (2) results in a lower percentage of cases for which the system has an opinion but a higher accuracy for those decisions. For example, a threshold of 25% results in the ability to predict 83.72% of the test adjective pairs in the medical corpus with 99.01% accuracy for these cases.","We subsequently applied the transitivity stage, testing the three semiring models discussed in Section 3.2.

Overall accuracy in the WSJ test data was 80.77% for adjectives and 71.04% for adjectives plus nouns.

Our methods expand on observable data, by inferring new relationships between premodifiers even for combinations of premodifiers that do not occur in the training corpus. We have empirically validated our approach, showing that we can predict order with more than 94% accuracy when enough corpus data is available. We have also implemented our procedure in a text generator, producing more fluent output sentences.","We are currently exploring alternative ways to integrate the classes constructed by the third stage of our system into our generator.

The qualitative analysis of the output of our clustering module shows that frequently positional and semantic classes overlap, and we are interested in measuring the extent of this phenomenon quantitatively. Conditioning the premodifier ordering on the head noun is an-other promising approach, at least for very frequent nouns. 8 Acknowledgments We are grateful to Kathy McKeown for numerous discussions during the development of this work.
