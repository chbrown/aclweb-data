Our approach is data driven: we refine our understanding and presentation of the classification scheme guided by the results of the intercoder analysis. We also present the results of a probabilistic classifier developed on the resulting annotations.","Much research in discourse processing has focused on task-oriented and instructional dialogs. The task addressed here comes to the fore in other genres, especially news reporting. The task is to distinguish sentences used to objectively present factual information from sentences used to present opinions and evaluations. There are many applications for which this distinction promises to be important, including text categorization and summarization. This research takes a large step toward developing a reliably annotated gold standard to support experimenting with such applications.","This research is also a case study of analyzing and improving manual tagging that is applicable to any tagging task.

The corrected tags serve two purposes in this work.

Using bias-corrected tags as gold-standard tags is one way to define a single best tag when there are multiple judges who disagree.","The coding manual and data from our experiments are available at: http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~wiebe/projects.","In the remainder of this paper, we describe the classification being performed (in section 2), the statistical tools used to analyze the data and produce the bias-corrected tags (in section 3), the case study of improving intercoder agreement (in section 4), and the results of the classifter for automatic subjectivity tagging (in section 5). 2 The"]},{"title":"Subjective and Objective","paragraphs":["Categories We address"]},{"title":"evidentiality","paragraphs":["in text (Chafe, 1986), which concerns issues such as what is the source of information, and whether information is being presented as fact or opinion. These ques-tions are particularly important in news reporting, in which segments presenting opinions and verbal reactions are mixed with segments presenting objective fact (van Dijk, 1988; Kan et al., 1998).","The definitions of the categories in our cod-246 ing manual are intention-based: \"If the primary intention of a sentence is objective presentation of material that is factual to the reporter, the sentence is objective. Otherwise, the sentence is subjective.\" 1","We focus on sentences about private states, such as belief, knowledge, emotions, etc. (Quirk et al., 1985), and sentences about speech events, such as speaking and writing. Such sentences may be either subjective or objective. From the coding manual: \"Subjective speech-event (and private-state) sentences are used to communicate the speaker's evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations. The primary intention of objective speech-event (and privatestate) sentences, on the other hand, is to objectively communicate material that is factual to the reporter. The speaker, in these cases, is being used as a reliable source of information.\"","Following are examples of subjective and objective sentences:","1. At several different levels, it's a fascinating tale. Subjective sentence.","2. Bell Industries Inc. increased its quarterly to 10 cents from seven cents a share. Objective sentence.","3.

The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the song \"Freedom Now\" was \"undesirable for broadcasting.\" Subjective speech-event sentence.","In sentence 4, there is no uncertainty or evaluation expressed toward the speaking event. Thus, from one point of view, one might have considered this sentence to be objective. However, the object of the sentence is not presented as material that is factual to the reporter, so the sentence is classified as subjective.","Linguistic categorizations usually do not cover all instances perfectly. For example, sen-","1 The category specifications in the coding manual axe based on our previous work on tracking point of view (Wiebe, 1994), which builds on Banfield's (1982) linguistic theory of subjectivity. tences may fall on the borderline between two categories. To allow for uncertainty in the annotation process, the specific tags used in this work include certainty ratings, ranging from 0, for least certain, to 3, for most certain. As discussed below in section 3.2, the certainty ratings allow us to investigate whether a model positing additional categories provides a better description of the judges' annotations than a binary model does.","Subjective and objective categories are potentially important for many text processing applications, such as information extraction and information retrieval, where the evidential status of information is important. In generation and machine translation, it is desirable to generate text that is appropriately subjective or objective (Hovy, 1987). In summarization, subjectivity judgments could be included in document profiles, to augment automatically produced document summaries, and to help the user make relevance judgments when using a search engine. In addition, they would be useful in text categorization. In related work (Wiebe et al., in preparation), we found that article types, such as announcement and opinion piece, are significantly correlated with the subjective and objective classification.","Our subjective category is related to but differs from the statement-opinion category of the Switchboard-DAMSL discourse annotation project (Jurafsky et al., 1997), as well as the gives opinion category of Bale's (1950) model of small-group interaction. All involve expressions of opinion, but while our category specifications focus on evidentiality in text, theirs focus on how conversational participants interact with one another in dialog. 3 Statistical Tools Table 1 presents data for two judges. The rows correspond to the tags assigned by judge 1 and the columns correspond to the tags assigned by judge 2. Let nij denote the number of sentences that judge 1 classifies as i and judge 2 classifies as j, and let/~ij be the probability that a randomly selected sentence is categorized as i by judge 1 and j by judge 2. Then, the maximum likelihood estimate of 15ij is ~ where n_l_ + , n++ = ~ij nij = 504.","Table 1 shows a four-category data configu-247 Judge 1 = D"]},{"title":"Sub j2,3","paragraphs":["Subjoj Objo,1 Obj2,3 Judge 2 = J"]},{"title":"Sub j2,3 Subjoa Objoa Obj2,3","paragraphs":["n13 = 15 n14 = 4 rill = 158 n12 = 43 n21 =0 n22 =0 n23 =0 n24 =0 n31 = 3 n32 = 2 n33 = 2 n34 = 0 n41 = 38 n42 -- 48 n43 = 49 n44 = 142 n+z = 199 n+2 = 93 n+3 = 66 n+4 = 146 nl+ = 220 n2+ = 0 n3+ = 7 n4+ = 277 n++ = 504 Table 1: Four-Category Contingency Table ration, in which certainty ratings 0 and 1 are combined and ratings 2 and 3 are combined. Note that the analyses described in this section cannot be performed on the two-category data configuration (in which the certainty ratings are not considered), due to insufficient degrees of freedom (Bishop et al., 1975).","Evidence of confusion among the classifications in Table 1 can be found in the marginal totals, ni+ and n+j. We see that judge 1 has a relative preference, or bias, for objective, while judge 2 has a bias for subjective. Relative bias is one aspect of agreement among judges. A second is whether the judges' disagreements are systematic, that is, correlated. One pattern of systematic disagreement is symmetric disagreement. When disagreement is symmetric, the differences between the actual counts, and the counts expected if the judges' decisions were not correlated, are symmetric; that is, 5n~j = 5n~i for i ~ j, where 5ni~ is the difference from independence.","Our goal is to correct correlated disagreements automatically. We are particularly in-terested in systematic disagreements resulting from relative bias. We test for evidence of such correlations by fitting probability models to the data. Specifically, we study bias using the model for marginal homogeneity, and symmetric disagreement using the model for quasisymmetry. When there is such evidence, we propose using the latent class model to correct the disagreements; this model posits an unobserved (latent) variable to explain the correlations among the judges' observations.","The remainder of this section describes these models in more detail. All models can be evaluated using the freeware package CoCo, which was developed by Badsberg (1995) and is available at: http://web.math.auc.dk/-jhb/CoCo. 3.1 Patterns of Disagreement A probability model enforces constraints on the counts in the data. The degree to which the counts in the data conform to the constraints is called the fit of the model. In this work, model fit is reported in terms of the likelihood ratio statistic, G 2, and its significance (Read and Cressie, 1988; Dunning, 1993). The higher the G 2 value, the poorer the fit. We will consider model fit to be acceptable if its reference significance level is greater than 0.01 (i.e., if there is greater than a 0.01 probability that the data sample was randomly selected from a popula-tion described by the model).","Bias of one judge relative to another is evidenced as a discrepancy between the marginal totals for the two judges (i.e., ni+ and n+j in Table 1). Bias is measured by testing the fit of the model for marginal homogeneity: ~i+ = P+i for all i. The larger the G 2 value, the greater the bias. The fit of the model can be evaluated as described on pages 293-294 of Bishop et al. (1975).","Judges who show a relative bias do not always agree, but their judgments may still be correlated. As an extreme example, judge 1 may assign the subjective tag whenever judge 2 assigns the objective tag. In this example, there is a kind of symmetry in the judges' responses, but their agreement would be low. Patterns of symmetric disagreement can be identified using the model for quasi-symmetry. This model constrains the off-diagonal counts, i.e., the counts that correspond to disagreement. It states that these counts are the product of a 248 table for independence and a symmetric table,"]},{"title":"nij = hi+ × )~+j ×/~ij,","paragraphs":["such that /kij = )~ji.

Goodman's procedure is a specialization of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which is implemented in the freeware program CoCo (Badsberg, 1995). Since its development, the latent class model has been widely applied, and is the underlying model in various unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including Auto-Class (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1996).","The form of the latent class model is that of naive Bayes: the observed variables are all conditionally independent of one another, given the value of the latent variable.

The results of the second tagging experiment are analyzed using the methods described in section 3, and bias-corrected tags are produced for the second data set.","Two disjoint corpora are used in steps 2 and 5, both consisting of complete articles taken from the Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). In both corpora, judges assign tags to each non-compound sentence and to each conjunct of each compound sentence, 504 in the first corpus and 500 in the second. The segmentation of compound sentences was performed manually before the judges received the data.","Judges J and B, the first two authors of this paper, are NLP researchers. Judge M is an undergraduate computer science student, and judge D has no background in computer science or linguistics.

For each fold, we calculate the system's accuracy on the subset of the test set consisting of such sentences. The average accuracy of the subsets across folds is 81.5%.","Taking human performance as an upper bound, the system has room for improvement.

The procedure is applicable to any tagging task in which the judges exhibit symmetric disagreement resulting from bias. We successfully use bias-corrected tags for two purposes: to guide a revision of the coding manual, and to develop an automatic classifier. The revision of the coding manual results in as much as a 16 point improvement in pairwise Kappa values, and raises the average agreement among the judges to a Kappa value of over 0.87 for the sentences that can be tagged with certainty.","Using only simple features, the classifier achieves an average accuracy 21 percentage points higher than the baseline, in 10-fold cross validation experiments. In addition, the average accuracy of the classifier is 81.5% on the sentences the judges tagged with certainty. The strong performance of the classifier and its consistency with the judges demonstrate the value of this approach to developing gold-standard tags. 7","Acknowledgements This research was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research under grant number N00014-95-1-0776.
