Some information such as statistical data is bestpresented in tabular form. A check on the more than 100,000 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) documents collected in the ACL/DCI CD-ROM reveals that at least an estimated one in 30 documents contains tables.","Tables present a unique challenge to information extraction systems. At the very least, the presence of tables must be detected so that they can be skipped over. Otherwise, processing the lines that constitute tables as if they are normal \"sentences\" is at best misleading and at worst may lead to erroneous analysis of the text.","As tables contain important data and information, it is critical for an information extraction system to be able to extract the information embodied in tables. This can be accomplished only if the structure of a table, including its rows and columns, are identified.","That table recognition is an important step in information extraction has been recognized in (Appelt and Israel, 1997). Recently, there is also a greater realization within the computational linguistics community that the layout and types of information (such as tables) contained in a document are important considerations in text processing (see the call for participation (Power and Scott, 1999) for the 1999 AAAI Fail Symposium Series).","However, despite the omnipresence of tables and their importance, there is surprisingly very little work in computational linguistics on algorithms to recognize tables. The only research that we are aware of is the work of (Hurst and Douglas, 1997; Douglas and Hurst, 1996; Douglas et al., 1995). Their method is essentially a deterministic algorithm that relies on spaces and special punctuation symbols to identify the presence and structure of tables. However, tables are notoriously idiosyncratic. The main difficulty in table recognition is that there axe so many different and varied ways in which tables can show up in real-world texts. Any deterministic algorithm based on a fixed set of conditions is bound to fail on tables with unforeseen layout and structure in some domains.","In contrast, we present a new approach in this paper that learns to recognize tables in free text. As our approach is adaptive and trainable, it is more flexible and easily adapted to texts in different domains with different table characteristics."]},{"title":"2 Task Definition","paragraphs":["The input to our table recognition program consists of plain texts in ASCII characters.

Each row containing body content information consists of several hlines -- information on \"Outcome\" spans several hlines. In Figure 3, strings of contiguous dashes \"-\" occur within the table. Furthermore, the two columns within the table appear right next to each other -- there are no blank vlines separating the two columns. Worse still, some words from the first column like \"Insulation\" and \"Plastic sheets\" spill over to the second column. Notice that there may or may not be any blank lines or delimiters that immediately precede or follow a table within an input text.","In this paper, we assume that our input texts are plain texts that do not contain any formatting codes, such as those found in an SGML or HTML document. There is a large number of documents that fall under the plain text category, and these are the kinds of texts that our approach to table recognition handles. The work of (Hurst and Douglas, 1997; Douglas and Hurst, 1996; Douglas et al., 1995) also deals with plain texts. 3 Approach A table appearing in plain text is essentially a two dimensional entity. Typically, the author of the text uses the <newline> character to separate adjacent hlines and a row is formed from one or more of such hlines. Similarly, blank space characters or some document fragment special punctuation characters are used to delimit the columns. 2 However, the specifics of how exactly this is done can vary widely across texts, as exemplified by the tables in Figure 1 to 3.","Instead of resorting to an ad-hoc method to recognize tables, we present a new approach in this paper that learns to recognize tables in plain text. Our learning method uses purely surface features like the proportion of the kinds of characters and their relative locations in a line and across lines to recognize tables. It is domain independent and does not rely on any domain-specific knowledge. We want to investigate how high an accuracy we can achieve based purely on such surface characteristics.","The problem of table recognition is broken down into 3 subproblems: recognizing table boundary, column, and row, in that order. Our learning approach treats eac~ subproblem as a separate classification problem and relies on sample training texts in which the table boundaries, columns, and rows have been correctly identified. We built a graphical user interface in which such markup by human annotators can be readily done. With our X-window based GUI, a typical table can be annotated with its boundary, column, and row demarcation within a minute.","From these sample annotated texts, training ex-","2We assume that any <tab> character has been replaced by the appropriate number of blank space characters in the input text. 445 amples in the form of feature-value vectors with correctly assigned classes are generated. One set of training examples is generated for each subproblem of recognizing table boundary, column, and row. Machine learning algorithms are used to build classifters from the training examples, one classifier per subproblem. After training is completed, the table recognition program will use the learned classifiers to recognize tables in new, previously unseen input texts.","We now describe in detail the feature extraction process, the learning algorithms, and how tables in new texts are recognized. The following classes of characters are referred to throughout the rest of this section:","• Space character: the character \" \" (i.e., the character obtained by typing the space bar on the keyboard).","• Alphanumeric character: one of the following characters: \"A\" to \"Z', \"a\" to \"z', and \"0\" to \"9\".","• Special character: any character that is not a space character and not an alphanumeric character.","• Separator character: one of the following characters: \".\", \"*', and %\"."]},{"title":"3.1 Feature Extraction 3.1.1 Boundary","paragraphs":["Every hline in an input text generates one training example for the subproblem of table boundary recognition.

For the first three feature values, F1 = 2/6 since there are two space-character-to-space-character transitions from vline 3 to 4 (namely, on hlines 13 and 14); F2 = 0 since there is no alphanumeric character or special character in vline","5For the purpose of generating the feature values for the first and last vline in a table, we assume that the table is padded with a vline of blank space characters before the first vline and after the last vline. 3; F3 = 4/6, since there are four space-character-to-alphanumeric-character transitions from vline 3 to 4 (namely, on hlines 15-18). Similarly, the last 3 feature values are derived by examining the character transitions from vline 4 to 5. 3.1.3 Row Every hline within a table generates one training example for the subproblem of table row recognition. Unlike table columns, every hline within a table belongs to some row in our formulation of the row recognition problem. As such, each hline belongs to exactly one of two classes: 1. First hline of a row 2. Subsequent hline of a row (not the first line)","The layout of a typical table is such that its rows tend to record repetitive or similar data or information. We use this clue in designing the features for table row recognition. Since the information within a row may span multiple hlines, as the \"Outcome\" information in Figure 2 illustrates, we use the first hline of a row as the basis for comparison across rows. If two hlines are similar, then they belong to two separate rows; otherwise, they belong to the same row. Similarity is measured by character type transitions, as in the case of table column recognition.","More specifically, to generate a training example for a hline H, we compare H with H ~, where H ~ is the first hline of the immediately preceding row if H is the first hline of the current row, and H ~ is the first hline of the current row if H is not the first hline of the current row. 6","Each training example consists of a set of four feature values F1,..., F4.

Let ci,k be the first non-space character in H. Then the value of F4 is kin.","To illustrate, the feature values of hline 16 in Figure 1 are: 0.236, 0.018, 0.018, 0.018 and its class is 1 (first line of a row). There are 55 vlines in the table, so n = 55. 7 Since hline 16 is the first line of a row, it is compared with hline 15, the first hline of the immediately preceding row, to generate F1, F2, and F3. F1 = 13/55 since there are 13 space-character-to-space-character transitions from hline 15 to 16. F2 = F3 = 1/55 since there is only one alphanumeric-character-to-space-character transition (\"4\" to space character in vline 19) and one space-character-to-special-character transition (space character to \".\" in vline 20). The first non-space character is \"W\" in the first vline within the table, so k = 1. 3.2 Learning Algorithms We used the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm (Quinlan, 1993) and the backpropagation algorithm for artificial neural nets (Rumelhart et al., 1986) as the learning algorithms to generate the classifiers. Both algorithms are representative state-of-the-art learning algorithms for symbolic and connectionist learning.","We used all the default learning parameters in the C4.5 package. For backpropagation, the learning parameters are: hidden units : 2, epochs = 1000, learning rate = 0.35 and momentum term = 0.5. We also used log n-bit encoding for the symbolic features and normalized the numeric features to [0... 1] for backpropagation. 3.3 Recognizing Tables in New Texts 3.3.1 Boundary Every hline generates a test example and a classifier assigns the example as either positive (within a","~'In generating the feature values for table row recognition, only the vlines enclosed within the identified first and last column of the table are considered. table) or negative (outside a table). 3.3.2","Column After the table boundary has been identified, classification proceeds from the first (leftmost) vline to the last (rightmost) vline in a table. For each vline, a classifier will return one of five classes for the test example generated from the current vline.","Sometimes, the class assigned by a classifier to the current vline may not be logically consistent with the classes assigned up to that point. For instance, it is not logically consistent if the previous vline is of class 1 (outside any column) and the current vline is assigned class 4 (last line of a column). When this happens, for the backpropagation algorithm, the class which is logically consistent and has the highest score is assigned to the current vline; for C4.5, one of the logically consistent classes is randomly chosen. 3.3.3 Row The first hline of a table always starts a new active row (class 1). Thereafter, for a given hline, it is compared with the first hline of the current active row. If the classifier returns class 1 (first hline of a row), then a new active row is started and the current hline is the first hline of this new row. If the classifier returns class 2 (subsequent hline of a row), then the current active row grows to include the current hline."]},{"title":"4 Evaluation","paragraphs":["To determine how well our learning approach performs on the task of table recognition, we selected 100 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) news documents from the ACL/DCI CD-ROM. After removing the SGML markups on the original documents, we manually annotated the plain-text documents with table boundary, column, and row information. The documents shown in Figure 1 and 2 are part of the 100 documents used for evaluation. 4.1 Accuracy Definition To measure the accuracy of recognizing table boundary of a new text, we compare the class assigned by the human annotator to the class assigned by our table recognition program on every hline of the text. Let A be the number of hlines identified by the human annotator as being part of some table. Let B 448 Feature Description F1 cl, j is a space character and ci,j is a space character F2 F3 F4 ci,,j is an alphanumeric character or a special character, and ci,j is a space character ci,,j is a space character, and ci,j is an alphanumeric character or a special character kin Table 3: Feature values for table row be the number of Mines identified by the program as being part of some table. Let C be the number of Mines identified by both the human annotator and the program as being part of some table. Then recall R = C/A and precision P = C/B. The accuracy of table boundary recognition is defined as the F measure, where F = 2RP/(R + P). The accuracy of recognizing table column (row) is defined similarly, by comparing the class assigned by the human annotator and the program to every vline (hline) within a table. 4.2 Deterministic Algorithms To determine how well our learning approach performs, we also implemented deterministic algorithms for recognizing table boundary, column, and row. The intent is to compare the accuracy achieved by our learning approach to that of the baseline deterministic algorithms. These deterministic algorithms are described below. 4.2.1 Boundary A Mine is considered part of a table if at least one character of Mine is not a space character and if any of the following conditions is met:","* The ratio of the position of the first non-space character in hline to the length of hline exceeds some pre-determined threshold (0.25) • Hline consists entirely of one special character.",". Hline contains three or more segments, each consisting of two or more contiguous space characters.","• Hline contains two or more segments, each consisting of two or more contiguous separator characters. 4.2.2 Column All vlines within a table that consist of entirely space characters are considered not part of any column. The remaining vlines within the table are then grouped together to form the columns. 4.2.3 Row The deterministic algorithm to recognize table row is similar to the recognition algorithm of the learning approach given in Section 3.3.3, except that the classifier is replaced by one that computes the proportion of character type transitions. All characters in the two hlines under consideration are grouped into four types: space characters, special characters, alphabetic characters, or digits. If the proportion of characters that change type exceeds some pre-determined threshold (0.5), then the two Mines belong to the same row. 4.3 Results We evaluated the accuracy of our learning approach on each subproblem of table boundary, column, and row recognition. For each subproblem, we conducted ten random trials and then averaged the accuracy over the ten trials. In each random trial, 20% of the texts are randomly chosen to serve as the texts for testing, and the remaining 80% texts are used for training. We plot the learning curve as each classifter is given increasing number of training texts. Figure 4 to 6 summarize the average accuracy over ten random trials for each subproblem. Besides the accuracy for the C4.5 and backpropagation classitiers, we also show the accuracy of the deterministic algorithms.","The results indicate that our learning approach outperforms the deterministic algorithms for all subproblems. The accuracy of the deterministic algorithms is about 70%, whereas the maximum accuracy achieved by the learning approach ranges over 85% - 95%. No one learning algorithm clearly outperforms the other, with C4.5 giving higher accuracy on recognizing table boundary and column, and backpropagation performing better at recognizing table row.","To test the generality of our learning approach, we also evaluated it on 50 technical patent documents from the TIPSTER Volume 3 CD-ROM. To test how well a classifier that is trained on one domain of texts will generalize to work on a different domain, we also tested the accuracy of our learning approach on patent texts after training on WSJ texts only, and vice versa. Space constraint does not permit us to present the detailed empirical results in this paper, but suffice to say that we found that our learning approach is able to generalize well to work on different domains of texts. 5 Future Work Currently, our table row recognition does not distinguish among the different types of rows, such as title (or caption) row, header row, and content row.
