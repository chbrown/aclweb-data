This paper proposes a novel framework for a large-scale, accurate acquisition method for monolingual semantic knowledge, especially for semantic relations between nominals such as hyponymy and meronymy. We call the framework bilingual co-training.","The acquisition of semantic relations between nominals can be seen as a classification task of semantic relations – to determine whether two nominals hold a particular semantic relation (Girju et al., 2007). Supervised learning methods, which have often been applied to this classification task, have shown promising results. In those methods, however, a large amount of training data is usually required to obtain high performance, and the high costs of preparing training data have always been a bottleneck.","Our research on bilingual co-training sprang from a very simple idea: perhaps training data in a language can be enlarged without much cost if we translate training data in another language and add the translation to the training data in the original language. We also noticed that it may be possible to further enlarge the training data by translating the reliable part of the classification results in another language. Since the learning settings (feature sets, feature values, training data, corpora, and so on) are usually different in two languages, the reliable part in one language may be overlapped by an unreliable part in another language. Adding the translated part of the classification results to the training data will improve the classification results in the unreliable part. This process can also be repeated by swapping the languages, as illustrated in Figure 1. Actually, this is nothing other than a bilingual version of co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).     ","                              Figure 1: Concept of bilingual co-training","Let us show an example in our current task: hyponymy-relation acquisition from Wikipedia. Our original approach for this task was super-432 vised learning based on the approach proposed by Sumida et al. (2008), which was only applied for Japanese and achieved around 80% in F-measure. In their approach, a common substring in a hypernym and a hyponym is assumed to be one strong clue for recognizing that the two words constitute a hyponymy relation. For example, recognizing a proper hyponymy relation between two Japanese words, (kouso meaning enzyme) and (kasuibunkaikouso meaning hydrolase), is relatively easy because they share a common suffix: kouso. On the other hand, judging whether their English translations (enzyme and hydrolase) have a hyponymy relation is probably more difficult since they do not share any substrings. A classifier for Japanese will regard the hyponymy relation as valid with high confidence, while a classifier for English may not be so positive. In this case, we can compensate for the weak part of the English classifier by adding the English translation of the Japanese hyponymy relation, which was recognized with high confidence, to the English training data.","In addition, if we repeat this process by swapping English and Japanese, further improvement may be possible. Furthermore, the reliable parts that are automatically produced by a classifier can be larger than manually tailored training data. If this is the case, the effect of adding the translation to the training data can be quite large, and the same level of effect may not be achievable by a reasonable amount of labor for preparing the training data. This is the whole idea.","Through a series of experiments, this paper shows that the above idea is valid at least for one task: large-scale monolingual hyponymy-relation acquisition from English and Japanese Wikipedia. Experimental results showed that our method based on bilingual co-training improved the performance of monolingual hyponymy-relation acquisition about 3.6–10.3% in the F-measure. Bilingual co-training also enables us to build classifiers for two languages in tandem with the same combined amount of data as would be required for training a single classifier in isolation while achieving superior performance.","People probably expect that a key factor in the success of this bilingual co-training is how to translate the training data. We actually did translation by a simple look-up procedure in the existing translation dictionaries without any machine translation systems or disambiguation processes. Despite this simple approach, we obtained consistent improvement in our task using various translation dictionaries.","This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents bilingual co-training, and Section 3 precisely describes our system. Section 4 describes our experiments and presents results. Section 5 discusses related work. Conclusions are drawn and future work is mentioned in Section 6."]},{"title":"2 Bilingual Co-Training","paragraphs":["Let S and T be two different languages, and let CL be a set of class labels to be obtained as a result of learning/classification. To simplify the discussion, we assume that a class label is binary; i.e., the classification results are “yes” or “no.” Thus, CL = {yes, no}. Also, we denote the set of all nonnegative real numbers by R+",".","Assume X = XS ∪ XT is a set of instances in languages S and T to be classified.

Particularly, we denote the training sets for S and T that are manually prepared by LS and LT , respectively. Also, bilingual instance dictionary DBI is defined as the translation pairs of instances in XS and XT . Thus, DBI = {(s, t)}⊂ XS × XT .

One main difference between co-training and bilingual co-training is the space of instances: co-training is based on different features of the same instances, and bilingual co-training is based on different spaces of instances divided by languages. Since some of the instances in different spaces are connected by a bilingual instance dictionary, they seem to be in the same space. Another big difference lies in the role of the two classifiers. The two classifiers in co-training work on the same task, but those in bilingual co-training do the same type of task rather than the same task."]},{"title":"3 Acquisition of Hyponymy Relations from Wikipedia","paragraphs":["Our system, which acquires hyponymy relations from Wikipedia based on bilingual co-training, is described in Figure 3.

Every English and Japanese Wikipedia article was transformed into a tree structure like Figure 4, where layout items title, (sub)section headings, and list items in an article were used as nodes in a tree structure. Sumida et al. (2008) found that some pairs consisting of a node and one of its descendants constituted a proper hyponymy relation (e.g., (TIGER,SIBERIAN TIGER)), and this could be a knowledge source of hyponymy relation acquisition. A hyponymy-relation candidate is then extracted from the tree structure by regarding a node as a hypernym candidate and all its subordinate nodes as hyponym candidates of the hypernym candidate (e.g., (TIGER,TAXON-OMY) and (TIGER,SIBERIAN TIGER) from Figure 4). 39 M English hyponymy-relation candidates and 10 M Japanese ones were extracted from Wikipedia. These candidates are classified into proper hyponymy relations and others by using the classifiers described below. 3.2 Hyponymy-Relation Classification We use SVMs (Vapnik, 1995) as classifiers for the classification of the hyponymy relations on the hyponymy-relation candidates. Let hyper beahypernym candidate, hypo be a hyper’s hyponym candidate, and (hyper, hypo) be a hyponymy-relation candidate. The lexical, structure-based, and infobox-based features of (hyper, hypo)inTable 1 are used for building English and Japanese classifiers. Note that SF3–SF5 and IF were not","1","Sumida et al. (2008) reported that they obtained 171 K, 420 K, and 1.48 M hyponymy relations from a definition sentence, a category system, and a layout structure in Japanese Wikipedia, respectively. used in Sumida et al. (2008) but LF1–LF5 and SF1–SF2 are the same as their feature set.","Let us provide an overview of the feature sets used in Sumida et al. (2008). See Sumida et al. (2008) for more details. Lexical features LF1–LF5 are used to recognize the lexical evidence encoded in hyper and hypo for hyponymy relations. For example, (hyper,hypo)is often a proper hyponymy relation if hyper and hypo share the same head morpheme or word. In LF1 and LF2, such information is provided along with the words/morphemes and the parts of speech of hyper and hypo, which can be multi-word/morpheme nouns. TagChunk (Daumé III et al., 2005) for English and MeCab (MeCab, 2008) for Japanese were used to provide the lexical features. Several simple lexical patterns2","were also applied to hyponymy-relation candidates. For example, “List of artists” is converted into “artists” by lexical pattern “list of X.” Hyponymy-relation candidates whose hypernym candidate matches such a lexical pattern are likely to be valid (e.g., (List of artists, Leonardo da Vinci)). We use LF4 for dealing with these cases. If a typical or frequently used section heading in a Wikipedia article, such as “History” or “References,” is used as a hyponym candidate in a hyponymy-relation candidate, the hyponymy-relation candidate is usually not a hyponymy relation. LF5 is used to recognize these hyponymy-relation candidates.","Structure-based features are related to the tree structure of Wikipedia articles from which hyponymy-relation candidate (hyper,hypo)isextracted. SF1 provides the distance between hyper and hypo in the tree structure. SF2 represents the type of layout items from which hyper and hypo are originated. These are the feature sets used in Sumida et al. (2008).","We also added some new items to the above feature sets. SF3 represents the types of tree nodes including root, leaf, and others. For example, (hyper,hypo) is seldom a hyponymy relation if hyper is from a root node (or title) and hypo is from a hyper’s child node (or section headings). SF4 and SF5 represent the structural contexts of hyper and hypo in a tree structure. They can provide evidence related to similar hyponymy-relation candidates in the structural contexts.","An infobox-based feature, IF, is based on a 2 We used the same Japanese lexical patterns in Sumida et","al. (2008) to build English lexical patterns with them. 435 Type Description Example LF1 Morphemes/words hyper: tiger∗",", hypo: Siberian, hypo: tiger∗ LF2 POS of morphemes/words hyper: NN∗",", hypo: NP, hypo: NN∗ LF3 hyper and hypo, themselves hyper: Tiger, hypo: Siberian tiger LF4 Used lexical patterns hyper: “List of X”, hypo: “Notable X” LF5 Typical section headings hyper: History, hypo: Reference SF1 Distance between hyper and hypo 3 SF2 Type of layout items hyper: title, hypo: bulleted list SF3 Type of tree nodes hyper: root node, hypo: leaf node SF4 LF1 and LF3 of hypo’s parent node LF3:Subspecies SF5 LF1 and LF3 of hyper’s child node LF3: Taxonomy IF Semantic properties of hyper and hypo hyper: (taxobox,species), hypo: (taxobox,name) Table 1: Feature type and its value. ∗ in LF1 and LF2 represent the head morpheme/word and its POS. Except those in LF4 and LF5, examples are derived from (TIGER,SIBERIAN TIGER) in Figure 4. Wikipedia infobox, a special kind of template, that describes a tabular summary of an article subject expressed by attribute-value pairs. An attribute type coupled with the infobox name to which it belongs provides the semantic properties of its value that enable us to easily understand what the attribute value means (Auer and Lehmann, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007). For example, infobox template City Japan in Wikipedia article Kyoto contains several attribute-value pairs such as “Mayor=Daisaku Kadokawa” as attribute=its value. What Daisaku Kadokawa, the attribute value of mayor in the example, represents is hard to understand alone if we lack knowledge, but its attribute type, mayor, gives a clue–Daisaku Kadokawa is a mayor related to Kyoto. These semantic properties enable us to discover semantic evidence for hyponymy relations. We extract triples (infobox name, attribute type, attribute value) from the Wikipedia infoboxes and encode such information related to hyper and hypo in our feature set IF.3","3.3 Bilingual Instance Dictionary Construction Multilingual versions of Wikipedia articles are connected by cross-language links and usually have titles that are bilinguals of each other (Erdmann et al., 2008).

As shown in Table 3, BICO, with half the size of the training samples used in INIT, always performed better than INIT in both languages.

The test showed that bilingual co-training can work well if we have one strong classifier. 4.3 Effect of Bilingual Instance Dictionaries We tested our method with different bilingual instance dictionaries to investigate their effect. We built bilingual instance dictionaries based on different translation dictionaries whose translation entries came from different domains (i.e., general domain, technical domain, and Wikipedia) and had a different degree of translation ambiguity. In Table 6, D1 and D2 correspond to systems based on a bilingual instance dictionary derived from two handcrafted translation dictionaries, EDICT (Breen, 2008) (a general-domain dictionary) and “The Japan Science and Technology Agency Dictionary,” (a translation dictionary for technical terms) respectively. D3, which is the same as BICO in Table 2, is based on a bilingual 438 instance dictionary derived from Wikipedia. ENTRY represents the number of translation dictionary entries used for building a bilingual instance dictionary. E2J (or J2E) represents the average translation ambiguities of English (or Japanese) terms in the entries. To show the effect of these translation ambiguities, we used each dictionary under two different conditions, α =5 and ALL. α =5 represents the condition where only translation entries with less than five translation ambiguities are used; ALL represents no restriction on translation ambiguities.","DIC F1 DIC STATISTICS","TYPE E J ENTRY E2J J2E D1 α =5 76.5 78.4 588K 1.80 1.77 D1 ALL 75.0 77.2 990K 7.17 2.52 D2 α =5 76.9 78.5 667K 1.89 1.55 D2 ALL 77.0 77.9 750K 3.05 1.71 D3 α =5 80.7 81.6 197K 1.03 1.02 D3 ALL 80.7 81.6 197K 1.03 1.02 Table 6: Effect of different bilingual instance dictionaries","The results showed that D3 was the best and that the performances of the others were similar to each other. The differences in the F1 scores between α =5 and ALL were relatively small within the same system triggered by translation ambiguities. The performance gap between D3 and the other systems might explain the fact that both hyponymy-relation candidates and the translation dictionary used in D3 were extracted from the same dataset (i.e., Wikipedia), and thus the bilingual instance dictionary built with the translation dictionary in D3 had better coverage of the Wikipedia entries consisting of hyponymy-relation candidates than the other bilingual instance dictionaries. Although D1 and D2 showed lower performance than D3, the experimental results showed that bilingual co-training was always effective no matter which dictionary was used (Note that F1 of INIT in Table 2 was 72.2 in English and 76.6 in Japanese.)"]},{"title":"5 Related Work","paragraphs":["Li and Li (2002) proposed bilingual bootstrapping for word translation disambiguation. Similar to bilingual co-training, classifiers for two languages cooperated in learning with bilingual resources in bilingual bootstrapping. However, the two classifiers in bilingual bootstrapping were for a bilingual task but did different tasks from the monolingual viewpoint. A classifier in each language is for word sense disambiguation, where a class label (or word sense) is different based on the languages. On the contrary, classifiers in bilingual co-training cooperate in doing the same type of tasks.","Bilingual resources have been used for monolingual tasks including verb classification and noun phrase semantic interpolation (Merlo et al., 2002; Girju, 2006). However, unlike ours, their focus was limited to bilingual features for one monolingual classifier based on supervised learning.","Recently, there has been increased interest in semantic relation acquisition from corpora. Some regarded Wikipedia as the corpora and applied hand-crafted or machine-learned rules to acquire semantic relations (Herbelot and Copestake, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Ruiz-casado et al., 2005; Nastase and Strube, 2008; Sumida et al., 2008; Suchanek et al., 2007). Several researchers who participated in SemEval-07 (Girju et al., 2007) proposed methods for the classification of semantic relations between simple nominals in English sentences. However, the previous work seldom considered the bilingual aspect of semantic relations in the acquisition of monolingual semantic relations."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We proposed a bilingual co-training approach and applied it to hyponymy-relation acquisition from Wikipedia. Experiments showed that bilingual co-training is effective for improving the performance of classifiers in both languages. We further showed that bilingual co-training enables us to build classifiers for two languages in tandem, outperforming classifiers trained individually for each language while requiring no more training data in total than a single classifier trained in isolation.","We showed that bilingual co-training is also helpful for boosting the performance of a weak classifier in one language with the help of a strong classifier in the other language without lowering the performance of either classifier. This indicates that the framework can reduce the cost of preparing training data in new languages with the help of our English and Japanese strong classifiers. Our future work focuses on this issue. 439"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Sören Auer and Jens Lehmann. 2007. What have Innsbruck and Leipzig in common?
