The organization name (ON) translation is the most difficult subtask in NE translation. The structure of ON is complex and usually nested, including person name, location name and sub-ON etc. For example, the organization name “ (Beijing Nokia Communication Ltd.)” contains a company name ( /Nokia) and a location name ( /Beijing). Therefore, the translation of organization names should combine transliteration and translation together.","Many previous researchers have tried to solve ON translation problem by building a statistical model or with the assistance of web resources. The performance of ON translation using web knowledge is determined by the solution of the following two problems: The efficiency of web page searching: how can we find the web pages which contain the translation equivalent when the amount of the returned web pages is limited? The reliability of the extraction method: how reliably can we extract the translation equivalent from the web pages that we obtained in the searching phase?","For solving these two problems, we propose a Chinese-English organization name translation system using heuristic web mining and asymmetric alignment, which has three innovations.","1) Chunking-based segmentation: A Chinese ON is a character sequences, we need to segment it before translation. But the OOV words always make the ON segmentation much more difficult. We adopt a new two-phase method here. First, the Chinese ON is chunked and each chunk is classified into four types. Then, different types of chunks are segmented separately using different strategies. Through chunking the Chinese ON first, the OOVs can be partitioned into one chunk which will not be segmented in the next phase. In this way, the performance of segmentation is improved.","2) Heuristic Query construction: We need to obtain the bilingual web pages that contain both the input Chinese ON and its translation equivalent. But in most cases, if we just send the Chinese ON to the search engine, we will always get the Chinese monolingual web pages which don’t contain any English word sequences, let alone the English translation equivalent. So we propose a heuristic query construction method to generate an efficient bilingual query. Some words in the Chinese ON are selected and their translations are added into the query. These English words will act as clues for searching 387 bilingual web pages. The selection of the Chinese words to be translated will take into consideration both the translation confidence of the words and the information contents that they contain for the whole ON.","3) Asymmetric alignment: When we extract the translation equivalent from the web pages, the traditional method should recognize the named entities in the target language sentence first, and then the extracted NEs will be aligned with the source ON. However, the named entity recognition (NER) will always introduce some mistakes. In order to avoid NER mistakes, we propose an asymmetric alignment method which align the Chinese ON with an English sentence directly and then extract the English fragment with the largest alignment score as the equivalent. The asymmetric alignment method can avoid the influence of improper results of NER and generate an explicit matching between the source and the target phrases which can guarantee the precision of alignment.","In order to illustrate the above ideas clearly, we give an example of translating the Chinese ON “ (China Huarong Asset Management Corporation)”.","Step1: We first chunk the ON, where “LC”, “NC”, “MC” and “KC” are the four types of chunks defined in Section 4.2. (China)/LC (Huarong)/NC (asset management)/MC (corporation)/KC","Step2: We segment the ON based on the chunking results.","(china) (Huarong) (asset) (management) (corporation)","If we do not chunk the ON first, the OOV word “ (Huarong)” may be segmented as “ ”. This result will certainly lead to translation errors.","Step 3: Query construction:","We select the words “ ” and “ ” to translate and a bilingual query is constructed as: “ ” + asset + management","If we don’t add some English words into the query, we may not obtain the web pages which contain the English phrase “China Huarong Asset Management Corporation”. In that case, we can not extract the translation equivalent.","Step 4: Asymmetric Alignment: We extract a sentence “...President of China Huarong Asset Management Corporation...” from the returned snippets. Then the best fragment of the sentence “China Huarong Asset Management Corporation” will be extracted as the translation equivalent. We don’t need to implement English NER process which may make mistakes.","The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works. In Section 3, we present the framework of our system. We discuss the details of the ON chunking in Section 4. In Section 5, we introduce the approach of heuristic query construction. In section 6, we will analyze the asymmetric alignment method. The experiments are reported in Section 7. The last section gives the conclusion and future work."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["In the past few years, researchers have proposed many approaches for organization translation. There are three main types of methods. The first type of methods translates ONs by building a statistical translation model. The model can be built on the granularity of word [Stalls et al., 1998], phrase [Min Zhang et al., 2005] or structure [Yufeng Chen et al., 2007]. The second type of methods finds the translation equivalent based on the results of alignment from the source ON to the target ON [Huang et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006]. The ONs are extracted from two corpora. The corpora can be parallel corpora [Moore et al., 2003] or content-aligned corpora [Kumano et al., 2004]. The third type of methods introduces the web resources into ON translation. [Al-Onaizan et al., 2002] uses the web knowledge to assist NE translation and [Huang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006] extracts the translation equivalents from web pages directly.","The above three types of methods have their advantages and shortcomings. The statistical translation model can give an output for any input. But the performance is not good enough on complex ONs. The method of extracting translation equivalents from bilingual corpora can obtain high-quality translation equivalents. But the quantity of the results depends heavily on the amount and coverage of the corpora. So this kind of method is fit for building a reliable ON dictionary. In the third type of method, with the assistance of web pages, the task of ON translation can be viewed as a two-stage process. Firstly, the web pages that may contain the target translation are found through a search engine. Then the translation equivalent will be extracted from the web pages based on the alignment score with the original ON. This method will not 388 depend on the quantity and quality of the corpora and can be used for translating complex ONs."]},{"title":"3 The Framework of Our System","paragraphs":["The Framework of our ON translation system shown in Figure 1 has four modules.  Figure 1. System framework","1) Chunking-based ON Segmentation Module: The input of this module is a Chinese ON. The Chunking model will partition the ON into chunks, and label each chunk using one of four classes. Then, different segmentation strategies will be executed for different types of chunks.","2) Statistical Organization Translation Module: The input of the module is a word set in which the words are selected from the Chinese ON. The module will output the translation of these words.","3) Web Retrieval Module: When input a Chinese ON, this module generates a query which contains both the ON and some words’ translation output from the translation module. Then we can obtain the snippets that may contain the translation of the ON from the search engine. The English sentences will be extracted from these snippets.","4) NE Alignment Module: In this module, the asymmetric alignment method is employed to align the Chinese ON with these English sentences obtained in Web retrieval module. The best part of the English sentences will be extracted as the translation equivalent."]},{"title":"4 The Chunking-based Segmentation for Chinese ONs","paragraphs":["In this section, we will illustrate a chunking-based Chinese ON segmentation method, which can efficiently deal with the ONs containing OOVs. 4.1 The Problems in ON Segmentation The performance of the statistical ON translation model is dependent on the precision of the Chinese ON segmentation to some extent. When Chinese words are aligned with English words, the mistakes made in Chinese segmentation may result in wrong alignment results. We also need correct segmentation results when decoding. But Chinese ONs usually contain some OOVs that are hard to segment, especially the ONs containing names of people or brand names. To solve this problem, we try to chunk Chinese ONs firstly and the OOVs will be partitioned into one chunk. Then the segmentation will be executed for every chunk except the chunks containing OOVs. 4.2 Four Types of Chunks","We define the following four types of chunks for","Chinese ONs: Location Chunk (LC): LC contains the","location information of an ON. Name Chunk (NC): NC contains the name","or brand information of an ON. In most","cases, Name chunks should be","transliterated. Modification Chunk (MC): MC contains","the modification information of an ON. Key word Chunk (KC): KC contains the","type information of an ON. The following is an example of an ON","containing these four types of chunks.","(Beijing)/LC (Peregrine)/NC","(investment consulting)/MC","(co.)/KC In the above example, the OOV “","(Peregrine)” is partitioned into name chunk. Then","the name chunk will not be segmented. 4.3 The CRFs Model for Chunking","Considered as a discriminative probabilistic model for sequence joint labeling and with the advantage of flexible feature fusion ability, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [J.Lafferty et al., 2001] is believed to be one of the best probabilistic models for sequence labeling tasks. So the CRFs model is employed for chunking.","We select 6 types of features which are proved to be efficient for chunking through experiments. The templates of features are shown in Table 1, 389 Description Features","current/previous/success character C0 C-1 C1","whether the characters is a word","W(C-2C-1C0) W(C0C1C2) W(C-1C0C1)","whether the characters is a location name","L(C-2C-1C0) L(C0C1C2) L(C-1C0C1)","whether the characters is an ON suffix","SK(C-2C-1C0) SK(C0C1C2) SK(C-1C0C1)","whether the characters is a location suffix","SL(C-2C-1C0) SL(C0C1C2) SL(C-1C0C1)","relative position in the sentence POS(C0) Table 1.

So we should develop a method to construct efficient queries which are used to obtain web pages through the search engine. 5.1 The Limitation of Monolingual Query We expect to find the web pages where the Chinese ON and its translation equivalent cooccur. If we just use a Chinese ON as the query, we will always obtain the monolingual web pages only containing the Chinese ON. In order to solve the problem, some words in the Chinese ON can be translated into English, and the English words will be added into the query as the clues to search the bilingual web pages. 5.2 The Strategy of Query Construction We use the metric of precision here to evaluate the possibility in which the translation equivalent is contained in the snippets returned by the search engine. That means, on the condition that we obtain a fixed number of snippets, the more the snippets which contain the translation equivalent are obtained, the higher the precision is. There are two factors to be considered. The first is how efficient the added English words can improve the precision. The second is how to avoid adding wrong translations which may bring down the precision. The first factor means that we should select the most informative words in the Chinese ON. The second factor means that we should consider the confidence of the SMT model at the same time. For example:","/LC /NC /MC /KC","(Tianjin Honda motor co. ltd.)","There are three strategies of constructing queries as follows: Q1. Honda Q2. Ltd. Q3. ” Motor Tianjin","In the first strategy, we translate the word “ (Honda)” which is the most informative word in the ON. But its translation confidence is very low, which means that the statistical model gives wrong results usually. The mistakes in translation will mislead the search engine. In the second strategy, we translate the word which has the largest translation confidence. Unfortunately the word is so common that it can’t give any help in filtering out useless web pages. In the third strategy, the words which have sufficient translation confidence and information content are selected.","5.3 Heuristically Selecting the Words to be Translated The mutual information is used to evaluate the importance of the words in a Chinese ON. We calculate the mutual information on the granularity of words in formula 1 and chunks in formula 2. The integration of the two kinds of mutual information is in formula 3. y Y p ( x , y ) ( , ) = l o g p ( x ) p ( y ) M I W x Y ∈"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["(1) Y p ( y , c )","( , ) = l o g p ( y ) p ( c )y M I C c Y ∈"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["(2)"]},{"title":"( , )= ( , )+(1- ) ( , )","paragraphs":["x"]},{"title":"IC x Y MIW x Y MIC c Yα α","paragraphs":["(3)","Here, MIW(x,Y) denotes the mutual information of word x with ON Y. That is the summation of the mutual information of x with every word in Y. MIC(c,Y) is similar. cx denotes the label of the chunk containing x.","We should also consider the risk of obtaining wrong translation results. We can see that the name chunk usually has the largest mutual information. However, the name chunk always needs to be transliterated, and transliteration is often more difficult than translation by lexicon. So we set a threshold Tc for translation confidence. We only select the words whose translation confidences are higher than Tc, with their mutual information from high to low. 390"]},{"title":"6 Asymmetric Alignment Method for Equivalent Extraction","paragraphs":["After we have obtained the web pages with the assistant of search engine, we extract the equivalent candidates from the bilingual web pages. So we first extract the pure English sentences and then an asymmetric alignment method is executed to find the best fragment of the English sentences as the equivalent candidate. 6.1 Traditional Alignment Method To find the translation candidates, the traditional method has three main steps.","1) The NEs in the source and the target language sentences are extracted separately. The NE collections are Sne and Tne.","2) For each NE in Sne, calculate the alignment probability with every NE in Tne.","3) For each NE in Sne, the NE in Tne which has the highest alignment probability will be selected as its translation equivalent.","This method has two main shortcomings:","1) Traditional alignment method needs the NER process in both sides, but the NER process may often bring in some mistakes.","2) Traditional alignment method evaluates the alignment probability coarsely. In other words, we don’t know exactly which target word(s) should be aligned to for the source word. A coarse alignment method may have negative effect on translation equivalent extraction. 6.2 The Asymmetric Alignment Method To solve the above two problems, we propose an asymmetric alignment method. The alignment method is so called “asymmetric” for that it aligns a phrase with a sentence, in other words, the alignment is conducted between two objects with different granularities. The NER process is not necessary for that we align the Chinese ON with English sentences directly.","[Wai Lam et al., 2007] proposed a method which uses the KM algorithm to find the optimal explicit matching between a Chinese ON and a given English ON. KM algorithm [Kuhn, 1955] is a traditional graphic algorithm for finding the maximum matching in bipartite weighted graph. In this paper, the KM algorithm is extended to be an asymmetric alignment method. So we can obtain an explicit matching between a Chinese ON and a fragment of English sentence.","A Chinese NE CO={CW1, CW2, ..., CWn} is a sequence of Chinese words CWi and the English sentence ES={EW1, EW2, ..., EWm} is a sequence of English words EWi. Our goal is to find a fragment EWi,i+n={EWi, ..., EWi+n} in ES, which has the highest alignment score with CO. Through executing the extended KM algorithm, we can obtain an explicit matching L. For any CWi, we can get its corresponding English word EWj, written as L(CWi)=EWj and vice versa. We find the optimal matching L between two phrases, and calculate the alignment score based on L. An example of the asymmetric alignment will be given in Fig2.  Fig2. An example of asymmetric alignment","In Fig2, the Chinese ON “ ” is aligned to an English sentence “... the Agriculture Bank of China is the four...”. The stop words in parentheses are deleted for they have no meaning in Chinese. In step 1, the English fragment contained in the square brackets is aligned with the Chinese ON. We can obtain an explicit matching L1, shown by arrows, and an alignment score. In step 2, the square brackets move right by one word, we can obtain a new matching L2 and its corresponding alignment score, and so on. When we have calculated every consequent fragment in English sentence, we can find the best fragment “the Agriculture Bank of China” according to the alignment score as the translation equivalent.","The algorithm is shown in Fig3. Where, m is the number of words in an English sentence and n is the number of words in a Chinese ON. KM algorithm will generate an equivalent sub-graph by setting a value to each vertex. The edge whose weight is equal to the summation of the values of its two vertexes will be added into the sub-graph. Then the Hungary algorithm will be executed in the equivalent sub-graph to find the optimal matching. We find the optimal matching between CW1,n and EW1,n first. Then we move the window right and find the optimal matching between CW1,n and EW2,n+1. The process will continue until the window arrives at the right most of the ... [(The) Agriculture Bank (of) China] (is) (the) four  (The) Agriculture [Bank (of) China] (is) (the) four]...  Step 1: Step 2: 391 English sentence. When the window moves right, we only need to find a new matching for the new added English vertex EWend and the Chinese vertex Cdrop which has been matched with EWstart in the last step. In the Hungary algorithm, the matching is added through finding an augmenting path. So we only need to find one augmenting path each time. The time complexity of finding an augmenting path is O(n 3","). So the whole complexity of asymmetric alignment is O(m*n 3 ). Algorithm: Asymmetric Alignment Algorithm Input: A segmented Chinese ON CO and an English sentence ES. Output: an English fragment EWk,k+n 1. Let start=1, end=n, L0=null 2. Using KM algorithm to find the optimal matching between two phrases CW1,n and EWstart,end based on the previous matching Lstart-1. We obtain a matching Lstart and calculate the alignment score Sstart based on Lstart. 3. CWdrop = L(EWstart) L(CWdrop)=null. 4. If (end==m) go to 7, else start=start+1, end=end+1. 5. Calculate the feasible vertex labeling for the vertexes CWdrop and EWend 6. Go to 2. 7. The fragment EWk,k+n-1 which has the highest alignment score will be returned.","Fig3.

Because the segmentation results will be used in alignment, the errors will affect the computation of alignment probability. The chunking based segmentation can generate better segmentation results; therefore better alignment probabilities can be obtained. 7.3 The Efficiency of Query Construction The heuristic query construction method aims to improve the efficiency of Web searching. The performance of searching for translation equivalents mostly depends on how to construct the query.

Q2 may give more information to search engine about which web pages we expect to obtain, but it also brings in translation mistakes that may mislead the search engine. The results show that Q3 is better than Q2, which proves that a careful clue selection is needed.","7.4 The Effect of Asymmetric Alignment Algorithm The asymmetric alignment method can avoid the mistakes made in the NER process and give an explicit alignment matching. We will compare the asymmetric alignment algorithm with the traditional alignment method on performance. We adopt two methods to align the Chinese NE with the English sentences. The first method has two phases, the English ONs are extracted from English sentences firstly, and then the English ONs are aligned with the Chinese ON. Lastly, the English ON with the highest alignment score will be selected as the translation equivalent. We use the software Lingpipe 3","to recognize NEs in the","English sentences.

So we will execute a phrase combination process before alignment, which combines some frequently occurring consequent English words into single vertex, such as “limited company” etc. The combination is based on the phrase pair table which is generated from phrase-based SMT system.

Transforming the translation problem into the problem of searching for the correct translation equivalent in web pages has three advantages. First, word order determination is difficult in statistical machine translation (SMT), while search engines are insensitive to this problem. Second, SMT often loses some function word such as “the”, “a”, “of”, etc, while our method can avoid this problem because such words are stop words in search engines. Third, SMT often makes mistakes in the selection of synonyms. This problem can be solved by the fuzzy matching of search engines. In summary, web assistant method makes Chinese ON translation easier than traditional SMT method."]},{"title":"8 Conclusion","paragraphs":["In this paper, we present a new approach which translates the Chinese ON into English with the assistance of web resources.

At last, the asymmetric alignment method aligns the Chinese ON with English sentences directly. The performance of ON translation is improved from 18.29% to 48.71%. It proves that our system can work well on the Chinese-English ON translation task.
