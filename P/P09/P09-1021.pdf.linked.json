In many cases, the same information is available in multiple languages simultaneously as a multilingual parallel corpus, e.g., European Parliament (EuroParl) and U.N. proceedings. In this paper, we consider how to use active learning (AL) in order to add a new language to such a multilingual parallel corpus and at the same time we construct an MT system from each language in the original corpus into this new target language. We introduce a novel combined measure of translation quality for multiple target language outputs (the same content from multiple source languages).","The multilingual setting provides new opportunities for AL over and above a single language pair. This setting is similar to the multi-task AL scenario (Reichart et al., 2008). In our case, the multiple tasks are individual machine translation tasks for several language pairs. The nature of the translation processes vary from any of the source","∗","Thanks to James Peltier for systems support for our experiments.

However it may be that in a single language pair, AL would pick a particular sentence for annotation, but in a multilingual setting, a different source language might be able to provide a good translation, thus saving annotation effort. In this paper, we explore how multiple MT systems can be used to effectively pick instances that are more likely to improve training quality.","Active learning is framed as an iterative learning process. In each iteration new human labeled instances (manual translations) are added to the training data based on their expected training quality. However, if we start with only a small amount of initial parallel data for the new target language, then translation quality is very poor and requires a very large injection of human labeled data to be effective. To deal with this, we use a novel framework for active learning: we assume we are given a small amount of parallel text and a large amount of monolingual source language text; using these resources, we create a large noisy parallel text which we then iteratively improve using small injections of human translations. When we build multiple MT systems from multiple source languages to the new target language, each MT system can be seen as a different ‘view’ on the desired output translation. Thus, we can train our multiple MT systems using either self-training or co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998). In self-training each MT system is re-trained using human labeled data plus its own noisy translation output on the unlabeled data. In co-training each MT system is re-trained using human labeled data plus noisy translation output from the other MT systems in the ensemble. We use consensus translations (He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2006) as an effective method for co-training between multiple MT systems.","This paper makes the following contributions:","• We provide a new framework for multilingual","MT, in which we build multiple MT systems","and add a new language to an existing multi-","lingual parallel corpus.

AL-SMT formulation for single language pair is a special case of this formulation where only one of the αd’s in the objective function (1) is one and the rest are zero. Moreover the algorithmic framework that we introduce in Sec. 2.1 for AL in the multilingual setting includes the single language pair setting as a special case (Haffari et al., 2009).","We denote the large unlabeled multilingual corpus by U := {(f 1","j , .., f D","j )}, and the small labeled multilingual corpus by L := {(f 1","i , .., f D","i , ei)}. We overload the term entry to denote a tuple in L or in U (it should be clear from the context). For a single language pair we use U and L. 2.1 The Algorithmic Framework Algorithm 1 represents our AL approach for the multilingual setting. We train our initial MT systems {MF d","→E}D","d=1 on the multilingual corpus L, and use them to translate all monolingual sentences in U. We denote sentences in U together with their multiple translations by U+","(line 4 of Algorithm 1). Then we retrain the SMT systems on L ∪ U+","and use the resulting model to decode the test set. Afterwards, we select and remove a subset of highly informative sentences from U, and add those sentences together with their human-provided translations to L. This process is continued iteratively until a certain level of translation quality is met (we use the BLEU score, WER and PER) (Papineni et al., 2002). In the baseline, against which we compare our sentence selection methods, the sentences are chosen randomly.","When (re-)training the models, two phrase tables are learned for each SMT model: one from the labeled data L and the other one from pseudo-labeled data U+","(which we call the main and auxiliary phrase tables respectively). (Ueffing et al., 2007; Haffari et al., 2009) show that treating U+ as a source for a new feature function in a log-linear model for SMT (Och and Ney, 2004) allows us to maximally take advantage of unlabeled data by finding a weight for this feature using minimum error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).","Since each entry in U+","has multiple translations, there are two options when building the auxiliary table for a particular language pair (F d",", E): (i) to use the corresponding translation ed","of the source language in a self-training setting, or (ii) to use the consensus translation among all the translation candidates (e1",", .., eD",") in a co-training setting (sharing information between multiple SMT models).","A whole range of methods exist in the literature for combining the output translations of multiple MT systems for a single language pair, operating either at the sentence, phrase, or word level (He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2006). The method that we use in this work operates at the sentence level, and picks a single high quality translation from the union of the n-best lists generated by multiple SMT models.

This motivates selecting sentences which are maximally beneficial for all the MT systems. In this section, we present several protocols for sentence selection based on the combined information from multiple language pairs. 3.1 Alternating Selection The simplest selection protocol is to choose k sentences (entries) in the first iteration of AL which improve maximally the first model MF 1","→E, while ignoring other models. In the second iteration, the sentences are selected with respect to the second model, and so on (Reichart et al., 2008). 3.2 Combined Ranking Pick any AL-SMT scoring method for a single language pair (see Sec. 4). Using this method, we rank the entries in unlabeled data U for each translation task defined by language pair (F d",", E). This results in several ranking lists, each of which represents the importance of entries with respect to a particular translation task. We combine these rankings using a combined score: Score","(","(f 1 , .., f D","))","= D ∑ d=1","αdRankd(f d ) Rankd(.) is the ranking of a sentence in the list for the dth","translation task (Reichart et al., 2008). 3.3 Disagreement Among the Translations Disagreement among the candidate translations of a particular entry is evidence for the difficulty of that entry for different translation models. The reason is that disagreement increases the possibil-ity that most of the translations are not correct. Therefore it would be beneficial to ask human for the translation of these hard entries.","Now the question is how to quantify the no-tion of disagreement among the candidate translations (e1",", .., eD",").

We introduce novel techniques which outperform those methods in the next sec-tion."]},{"title":"4 Sentence Selection: Single Language Pair","paragraphs":["Phrases are basic units of translation in phrase-based SMT models. The phrases which may potentially be extracted from a sentence indicate its informativeness. The more new phrases a sentence can offer, the more informative it is; since it boosts the generalization of the model. Additionally phrase translation probabilities need to be estimated accurately, which means sentences that of-fer phrases whose occurrences in the corpus were rare are informative. When selecting new sentences for human translation, we need to pay atten-tion to this tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, i.e. selecting sentences to discover new phrases v.s. estimating accurately the phrase translation probabilities. Smoothing techniques partly handle accurate estimation of translation probabilities when the events occur rarely (indeed it is the main reason for smoothing). So we mainly focus on how to expand effectively the lexicon or set of phrases of the model.","The more frequent a phrase (not a phrase pair) is in the unlabeled data, the more important it is to 183 know its translation; since it is more likely to see it in test data (specially when the test data is in-domain with respect to unlabeled data). The more frequent a phrase is in the labeled data, the more unimportant it is; since probably we have observed most of its translations.","In the labeled data L, phrases are the ones which are extracted by the SMT models; but what are the candidate phrases in the unlabeled data U ? We use the currently trained SMT models to an-swer this question. Each translation in the n-best list of translations (generated by the SMT models) corresponds to a particular segmentation of a sentence, which breaks that sentence into several fragments (see Fig. 1). Some of these fragments are the source language part of a phrase pair available in the phrase table, which we call regular phrases and denote their set by X","reg","s for a sentence s. However, there are some fragments in the sentence which are not covered by the phrase table – possibly because of the OOVs (out-of-vocabulary words) or the constraints imposed by the phrase extraction algorithm – called Xoov","s for a sentence s. Each member of Xoov","s offers a set of potential phrases (also referred to as OOV phrases) which are not observed due to the latent segmentation of this fragment. We present two generative models for the phrases and show how to estimate and use them for sentence selection. 4.1 Model 1 In the first model, the generative story is to generate phrases for each sentence based on independent draws from a multinomial. The sample space of the multinomial consists of both regular and OOV phrases.","We build two models, i.e. two multinomials, one for labeled data and the other one for unlabeled data. Each model is trained by maximizing the log-likelihood of its corresponding data: LD := ∑ s∈D P̃ (s) ∑ x∈Xs log P (x|θD) (2) where D is either L or U , P̃ (s) is the empirical distribution of the sentences1",", and θ","D is the parameter vector of the corresponding probability 1 P̃ (s) is the number of times that the sentence s is seen","in D divided by the number of all sentences in D.","distribution.

We let Hx to be all possible segmentations of the fragment x for which the resulting phrase lengths are not greater than the maximum length constraint for phrase extraction in the underlying SMT model. Since we do not know anything about the segmentations a priori, we have put a uniform distribution over such segmentations.","Maximizing (2) to find the maximum likelihood parameters for this model is an extremely difficult problem2",".

In the example, “go to school” has 3 segmentations with maximum phrase length 2: (go)(to school), (go to)(school), (go)(to)(school). where δ[C] is 1 if the condition C is true, and zero otherwise. We have used the fact that the number of occurrences of a phrase spanning the indices [i, j] is the product of the number of segmentations of the left and the right sub-fragments, which are ρk(x1:i−1) and ρk(xj+1:|x|) respectively. 4.2 Model 2 In the second model, we consider a mixture model of two multinomials responsible for generating phrases in each of the labeled and unlabeled data sets. To generate a phrase, we first toss a coin and depending on the outcome we either generate the phrase from the multinomial associated with regular phrases θ reg U or potential phrases θoov","U : P (x|θU ) := βU θ reg U (x) + (1 − βU )θoov","U (x) where θU includes the mixing weight β and the parameter vectors of the two multinomials. The mixture model associated with L is written similarly. The parameter estimation is based on maximizing a lower-bound on the log-likelihood which is similar to what was done for the Model 1. 4.3 Sentence Scoring The sentence score is a linear combination of two terms: one coming from regular phrases and the other from OOV phrases: φ1(s) :=","λ |X reg s | ∑","x∈Xreg s log P (x|θU ) P (x|θL) + 1 − λ |Xoov","s | ∑","x∈Xoov s ∑ h∈Hx 1 |Hx| log ∏","y∈Y h x P (y|θU ) P (y|θL) where we use either Model 1 or Model 2 for P (.|θD). The first term is the log probability ratio of regular phrases under phrase models corresponding to unlabeled and labeled data, and the second term is the expected log probability ratio (ELPR) under the two models. Another option for the contribution of OOV phrases is to take log of expected probability ratio (LEPR): φ2(s) :=","λ |X reg s | ∑","x∈Xreg s log P (x|θU ) P (x|θL) + 1 − λ |Xoov","s | ∑","x∈Xoov s log ∑ h∈Hx 1 |Hx| ∏","y∈Y h x P (y|θU ) P (y|θL) It is not difficult to prove that there is no difference between Model 1 and Model 2 when ELPR scoring is used for sentence selection.

In addition in this paper by considering multilingual parallel corpora we were able to introduce co-training for AL, while (Haffari et al., 2009) only use self-training since they are using a single language pair. 5 This observation is at the phrase level and not at the word","(Zipf, 1932) or even n-gram level (Ha et al., 2002).","(Reichart et al., 2008) introduces multi-task active learning where unlabeled data require annota-tions for multiple tasks, e.g. they consider namedentities and parse trees, and showed that multiple tasks helps selection compared to individual tasks. Our setting is different in that the target language is the same across multiple MT tasks, which we exploit to use consensus translations and co-training to improve active learning performance.","(Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003b; Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003a) provide a co-training approach to MT, where one language pair creates data for another language pair. In contrast, our co-training approach uses consensus translations and our setting for active learning is very different from their semi-supervised setting. A Ph.D. proposal by Chris Callison-Burch (Callison-burch, 2003) lays out the promise of AL for SMT and proposes some algorithms. However, the lack of experimental results means that performance and feasibility of those methods cannot be compared to ours.","While we use consensus translations (He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2007; Matusov et al., 2006) as an effective method for co-training in this paper, unlike consensus for system combination, the source languages for each of our MT systems are different, which rules out a set of popular methods for obtaining consensus translations which assume translation for a single language pair. Finally, we briefly note that triangulation (see (Cohn and Lapata, 2007)) is orthogonal to the use of co-training in our work, since it only enhances each MT system in our ensemble by exploiting the multilingual data. In future work, we plan to incorporate triangulation into our active learning approach."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper introduced the novel active learning task of adding a new language to an existing multilingual set of parallel text. We construct SMT systems from each language in the collection into the new target language. We show that we can take advantage of multilingual corpora to decrease annotation effort thanks to the highly effective sentence selection methods we devised for active learning in the single language-pair setting which we then applied to the multilingual sentence selection protocols. In the multilingual setting, a novel co-training method for active learning in SMT is proposed using consensus translations which outperforms AL-SMT with self-training. 188"]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Avrim Blum and Tom Mitchell. 1998.
