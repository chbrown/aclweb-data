For example, a predicate will have no more than one Agent in most cases. It is reasonable to label one argument while taking into account other arguments. More structural information of all arguments should be encoded in SRL approaches.","This paper explores structural information of predicate-argument structure from the perspective of rank relations between arguments. Thematic hierarchy theory argues that there exists a language independent rank of possible semantic roles, which establishes priority among arguments with respect to their syntactic realization (Levin and Hovav, 2005). This construct has been widely implicated in linguistic phenomena, such as in the subject selection rule of Fillmore’s Case Grammar (1968): ”If there is an A [=Agent], it becomes the subject; otherwise, if there is an I [=Instrument], it becomes the subject; otherwise, the subject is the O [=Object, i.e., Patient/Theme]”. This rule implicitly establishes precedence relations among semantic roles mentioned and can be simplified to: Agent ≻ Instrument ≻ P atient/T heme Emerging from a range of more basic semantic properties of the ranked semantic roles, thematic hierarchies can help to construct mapping from semantics to syntax. It is therefore an appealing op-tion for argument structure analysis. For example, if the the rank of argument ai is shown higher than aj, then the assignment [ai=Patient, aj=Agent] is illegal, since the role Agent is the highest role.","We test the hypothesis that thematic rank between arguments can be accurately detected by using syntax clues. In this paper, the concept ”thematic rank” between two arguments ai and aj means the relationship that ai is prior to aj or aj is prior to ai. Assigning different labels to different relations between ai and aj, we formulate prediction of thematic rank between two arguments as a multi-class classification task. A log-linear model is put forward for classification. Experiments on CoNLL-2005 data show that this approach can get an good performance, achieving 96.42% accuracy on gold parsing data and 95.14% accuracy on Charniak automatic parsing data.","Most existing SRL systems divide this task into two subtasks: Argument Identification (AI) and Semantic Role Classification (SRC). To add structural information to a local SRL approach, we incorporate thematic hierarchy relations into local classification results using re-ranking technique in the SRC stage. Two re-ranking approaches, 1) hard constraint re-ranking and 2) soft constraint re-ranking, are proposed to filter out unlike global semantic role assignment. Experiments on CoNLL-2005 data indicate that our method can yield significant improvement over a state-of-the-art SRC baseline, achieving 0.93% and 1.32% 253 absolute accuracy improvements on hand-crafted and automatic parsing data."]},{"title":"2 Prediction of Thematic Rank 2.1 Ranking Arguments in PropBank","paragraphs":["There are two main problems in modeling thematic hierarchy for SRL on PropBank. On the one hand, there is no consistent meaning of the core roles (i.e. Arg0-5/ArgA). On the other hand, there is no consensus over hierarchies of the roles in the thematic hierarchy. For example, the Patient occupies the second highest hierarchy in some linguistic theories but the lowest in some other theories (Levin and Hovav, 2005).","In this paper, the proto-role theory (Dowty, 1991) is taken into account to rank PropBank arguments, partially resolving the two problems above. There are three key points in our solution. First, the rank of Arg0 is the highest. The Agent is al-most without exception the highest role in proposed hierarchies. Though PropBank defines semantic roles on a verb by verb basis, for a particular verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibit-ing features of a prototypical Agent while Arg1 is a prototypical Patient or Theme (Palmer et al., 2005). As being the proto-Agent, the rank of Arg0 is higher than other numbered arguments. Second, the rank of the Arg1 is second highest or lowest. Both hierarchy of Arg1 are tested and discussed in section 4. Third, we do not rank other arguments.","Two sets of roles closely correspond to numbered arguments: 1) referenced arguments and 2) continuation arguments. To adapt the relation to help these two kinds of arguments, the equivalence relation is divided into several sub-categories. In summary, relations of two arguments ai and aj in this paper include: 1) ai ≻ aj: ai is higher than aj, 2) ai ≺ aj: ai is lower than aj, 3) aiARaj: aj is the referenced argument of ai, 4) aiRAaj: ai is the referenced argument of aj, 5) aiACaj: aj is the continuation argument of ai, 6) aiCAaj: ai is the continuation argument of aj, 7) ai = aj: ai and aj are labeled as the same role label, and 8) ai ∼ aj: ai and aj are labeled as the Arg2-5, but not in the same type. 2.2 Prediction Method Assigning different labels to possible rank between two arguments ai and aj, such as labeling ai ≻ aj as ”≻”, identification of thematic rank can be formulated as a classification problem. Delemma, POS Tag, voice, and SCF of predicate categories, position of two arguments; rewrite rules expanding subroots of two arguments content and POS tags of the boundary words and head words category path from the predicate to candidate arguments single character category path from the predicate to candidate arguments conjunction of categories, position, head words, POS of head words category and single character category path from the first argument to the second argument Table 1: Features for thematic rank identification. note the set of relations R. Formally, given a score function ST H : A × A × R ↦→ R, the relation r is recognized in argmax flavor:","r̂ = r∗ (ai, aj) = arg max","r∈R ST H (ai, aj, r) A probability function is chosen as the score function and the log-linear model is used to estimate the probability: ST H (ai, aj, r) = exp{ψ(ai, aj, r) · w}","∑ r∈R exp{ψ(ai, aj, r) · w} where ψ is the feature map and w is the parameter vector to learn. Note that the model predicts the rank of ai and aj through calculating ST H (ai, aj, r) rather than ST H (aj, ai, r), where ai precedes aj. In other words, the position information is implicitly encoded in the model rather than explicitly as a feature.","The system extracts a number of features to represent various aspects of the syntactic structure of a pair of arguments. All features are listed in Table 1. The Path features are designed as a sequential collection of phrase tags by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). We also use Single Character Category Path, in which each phrase tag is clustered to a category defined by its first character (Pradhan et al., 2005). To characterize the relation between two constituents, we combine features of the two individual arguments as new features (i.e. conjunction features). For example, if the category of the first argument is NP and the category of the second is S, then the conjunction of category feature is NP-S."]},{"title":"3 Re-ranking Models for SRC","paragraphs":["Toutanova et al. (2008) empirically showed that global information is important for SRL and that 254 structured solutions outperform local semantic role classifiers. Punyakanok et al. (2008) raised an inference procedure with integer linear programming model, which also showed promising results.","Identifying relations among arguments can provide structural information for SRL. Take the sentence ”[Arg0 She] [V addressed] [Arg1 her husband] [ArgM−MNR with her favorite nickname].” for example, if the thematic rank of she and her husband is predicted as that she is higher than her husband, then her husband should not be assigned the highest role.","To incorporate the relation information to local classification results, we employ re-ranking approach. Assuming that the local semantic classifier can produce a list of labeling results, our system then attempts to pick one from this list according to the predicted ranks. Two different polices are implemented: 1) hard constraint re-ranking, and 2) soft constraint re-ranking. Hard Constraint Re-ranking The one picked up must be strictly in accordance with the ranks. If the rank prediction result shows the rank of argument ai is higher than aj, then role assignments such as [ai=Patient and aj=Agent] will be eliminated. Formally, the score function of a global semantic role assignment is: S(a, s) = ∏ i Sl(ai, si) ∏ i,j,i<j","I(r∗ (ai, aj), r(si, sj)) where the function Sl locally scores an argument; r∗",": A × A ↦→ R is to predict hierarchy of two arguments; r : S × S ↦→ R is to point out the thematic hierarchy of two semantic roles. For example, r(Agent, P atient) = ” ≻ ”. I : R × R ↦→ {0, 1} is identity function.","In some cases, there is no role assignment satisfies all predicted relations because of prediction mistakes. For example, if the hierarchy detec-tion result of a = (a1, a2, a3) is (r∗","(a 1, a2) =≻ , r∗","(a2, a3) =≻, r∗","(a1, a3) =≺), there will be no legal role assignment. In these cases, our system returns local SRL results. Soft Constraint Re-ranking In this approach, the predicted confidence score of relations is added as factor items to the score function of the semantic role assignment. Formally, the score function in soft constraint re-ranking is: S(a, s) = ∏ i Sl(ai, si) ∏ i,j,i<j ST H (ai, aj, r(si, sj))"]},{"title":"4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Settings","paragraphs":["We evaluated our system using the CoNLL-2005 shared task data.

Its argument classification module is used as a strong local semantic role classifier. This module is retrained in our SRC experiments, using parameters described in (Koomen et al., 2005).

All experiments are tested on development corpus. The first row shows the performance of the local sematic role classifier. The second to the forth rows show the performance based on three ranking approach. A means that the rank of Agent is the highest; P↑ means that the rank of Patient is the second highest; P↓ means that the rank of the Patient is the lowest. Column SRL(S) shows SRC performance based on soft constraint re-ranking approach, and column SRL(G) shows SRC performance based on gold hierarchies. The data shows that the third thematic hierarchy fits SRL best, but is harder to learn. Compared with P↑, P↓ is more suitable for SRL. In the following SRC experiments, we use the first hierarchy because it is most helpful when predicted relations are used. 4.3 Results And Improvement Analysis Table 3 summarizes the precision, recall, and F-measure of this task.
