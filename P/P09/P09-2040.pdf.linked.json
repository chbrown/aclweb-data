This paper presents two corpora of blog posts in English and in Spanish, annotated according to the EmotiBlog annotation scheme. Furthermore, we created 20 factual and opinionated questions for each language and also the Gold Standard for their answers in the corpus. The purpose of our work is to study the challenges involved in a mixed fact and opinion question answering setting by comparing the performance of two Question Answering (QA) systems as far as mixed opinion and factual setting is concerned. The first one is open do-main, while the second one is opinion-oriented. We evaluate separately the two systems in both languages and propose possible solutions to improve QA systems that have to process mixed questions."]},{"title":"Introduction and motivation","paragraphs":["In the last few years, the number of blogs has grown exponentially. Thus, the Web contains more and more subjective texts. A research from the Pew Institute shows that 75.000 blogs are created daily (Pang and Lee, 2008). They approach a great variety of topics (computer science, sociology, political science or economics) and are written by different types of people, thus are a relevant resource for large community be-havior analysis. Due to the high volume of data contained in blogs, new Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources, tools and methods are needed in order to manage their language understanding. Our fist contribution consists in carrying out a multilingual research, for English and Spanish. Secondly, many sources are present in blogs, as people introduce quotes from newspaper articles or other information to support their arguments and make references to previous posts in the discussion thread. Thus, when performing a task such as Question Answering (QA), many new aspects have to be taken into consideration. Previous studies in the field (Stoyanov, Cardie and Wiebe, 2005) showed that certain types of queries, which are factual in nature, require the use of Opinion Mining (OM) resources and techniques to retrieve the correct answers. A further contribution this paper brings is the analysis and definition of the criteria for the discrimination among types of factual versus opinionated questions. Previous researchers mainly concentrated on newspaper collections. We formulated and annotated of a set of questions and answers over a multilingual blog collection. A further contribution is the evaluation and comparison of two different approaches to QA a fact-oriented one and another designed for opinion QA scenarios."]},{"title":"Related work","paragraphs":["Research in building factoid QA systems has a long history. However, it is only recently that studies have started to focus also on the creation and development of QA systems for opinions. Recent years have seen the growth of interest in this field, both by the research performed and the publishing of various studies on the requirements 157 and peculiarities of opinion QA systems (Stoyanov, Cardie and Wiebe, 2005), (Pustejovsky and Wiebe, 2006), as well as the organization of international conferences that promote the creation of effective QA systems both for general and subjective texts, as, for example, the Text Analysis Conference (TAC)1",". Last year’s TAC 2008 Opinion QA track proposed a mixed setting of factoid (“rigid list”) and opinion questions (“squishy list”), to which the traditional systems had to be adapted. The Alyssa system (Shen et al., 2007), classified the polarity of the question and of the extracted answer snippet, using a Support Vector Machines classifier trained on the MPQA corpus (Wiebe, Wilson and Cardie, 2005), English NTCIR2","data and rules based on the subjectivity lexicon (Wilson, Wiebe and Hoffman, 2005). The PolyU (Wenjie et al., 2008) system determines the sentiment orientation with two estimated language models for the positive versus negative categories. The QUANTA (Li, 2008) system detects the opinion holder, the object and the polarity of the opinion using a semantic labeler based on PropBank3","and some manually defined patterns."]},{"title":"Evaluation","paragraphs":["In order to carry out our evaluation, we employed a corpus of blog posts presented in (Boldrini et al., 2009). It is a collection of blog entries in English, Spanish and Italian. However, for this research we used the first two languages. We annotated it using EmotiBlog (Balahur et al., 2009) and we also created a list of 20 questions for each language. Finally, we produced the Gold Standard, by labeling the corpus with the correct answers corresponding to the questions. 1.1 Questions No TYPE QUESTION  1  F  F What international organization do people criticize for its policy on carbon emissions? ¿Cuál fue uno de los primeros países que se preocupó por el problema medioambiental?   2   O   F What motivates people’s negative opinions on the Kyoto Protocol? ¿Cuál es el país con mayor responsabilidad de la contaminación mundial según la opinión pública?   3   F   F What country do people praise for not signing the Kyoto Protocol? ¿Quién piensa que la reducción de la contaminación se debería apoyar en los consejos de los científicos?   4   F   F What is the nation that brings most criticism to the Kyoto Protocol? ¿Qué administración actúa totalmente en contra de la lucha contra el cambio climático? 1 http://www.nist.gov/tac/ 2 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ 3 http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace.html   5   O   F What are the reasons for the success of the Kyoto Protocol? ¿Qué personaje importante está a favor de la colaboración del estado en la lucha contra el calentamiento global?   6   O   F What arguments do people bring for their criticism of media as far as the Kyoto Protocol is concerned? ¿A qué políticos americanos culpa la gente por la grave situación en la que se encuentra el planeta?  7  O  F Why do people criticize Richard Branson? ¿A quién reprocha la gente el fracaso del Protocolo de Kyoto?  8  F  F What president is criticized worldwide for his reaction to the Kyoto Protocol? ¿Quién acusa a China por provocar el mayor daño al medio ambiente?  9  F  O What American politician is thought to have developed bad environmental policies? ¿Cómo ven los expertos el futuro?  10  F  O What American politician has a positive opinion on the Kyoto protocol?

The first can be the ambiguity of the questions e.g. ¿De dónde viene la riqueza de EEUU?. The answer can be explicitly stated in one of the blog sentences, or a system might have to infer them from assumptions made by the bloggers and their comments. Moreover, most of the opinion questions have longer answers, not just a phrase snippet, but up to 2 or 3 sentences. As we can observe in Table 2, the questions for which the TQA system performed better were the pure factual ones (1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 14), although in some cases (question number 14) the OQA system retrieved more correct answers. At the same time, opinion queries, although revolving around NEs, were not answered by the traditional QA system, but were satisfactorily answered by the opinion QA system (2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12). Questions 18 and 20 were not correctly answered by any of the two systems. We believe the reason is that question 18 was ambiguous as far as polarity of the opinions expressed in the answer snippets (“improvement” does not translate to either “positive” or “negative”) and question 20 referred to the title of a project proposal that was not annotated by any of the tools used. Thus, as part of the future work in our OQA system, we must add a component for the identification of quotes and titles, as well as explore a wider range of polarity/opinion scales. Furthermore, questions 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 contain both factual as well as opinion aspects and the OQA system performed better than the TQA, although in some cases, answers were lost due to the artificial boosting of the queries containing NEs of the EAT (Expected Answer Type). Therefore, it is obvious that an extra method for answer ranking should be used, as Answer Validation techniques using Textual Entailment. In Table 3, the OQA missed some of the answers due to erroneous sentence splitting, either separating text into two sentences where it was not the case or concatenating two consecutive sentences; thus missing out on one of two consecutively annotated answers. Examples are questions number 16 and 17, where many blog entries enumerated the different arguments in consecutive sentences. Another source of problems was the fact that we gave a high weight to the presence of the NE of the sought type within the retrieved snippet and in some cases the name was misspelled in the blog entries, whereas in other NER performed by 159 FreeLing either attributed the wrong category to an entity, failed to annotate it or wrongfully annotated words as being NEs. Not of less importance is the question duality aspect in question 17. Bush is commented in more than 600 sentences; therefore, when polarity is not specified, it is difficult to correctly rank the answers. Finally, also the problems of temporal expressions and the coreference need to be taken into account."]},{"title":"Conclusions and future work","paragraphs":["In this article, we created a collection of both factual and opinion queries in Spanish and English. We labeled the Gold Standard of the answers in the corpora and subsequently we employed two QA systems, one open domain, one for opinion questions. Our main objective was to compare the performances of these two systems and analyze their errors, proposing solutions to creating an effective QA system for both factoid an opinionated queries. We saw that, even using specialized resources, the task of QA is still challenging. Opinion QA can benefit from a snippet retrieval at a paragraph level, since in many cases the answers were not simple parts of sentences, but consisted in two or more consecutive sentences. On the other hand, we have seen cases in which each of three different consecutive sentences was a separate answer to a question. Our future work contemplates the study of the impact anaphora resolution and temporality on opinion QA, as well as the possibility to use Answer Validation techniques for answer re-ranking.
