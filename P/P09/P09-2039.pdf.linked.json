A comparative sentence for-mulates an ordering relation between two entities and that relation is very useful for many application areas. One key area is for the customers. For example, a customer can make a decision on his/her final choice about a digital camera after reading other customers' product reviews, e.g., “Digital Camera X is much cheaper than Y though it functions as good as Y!” Another one is for manufacturers. All the manufacturers have an interest in the articles saying how their products are compared with competitors’ ones.","Comparative sentences often contain some comparative keywords. A sentence may express some comparison if it contains any comparative keywords such as ‘보다 ([bo-da]: than)’, ‘가장 ([ga-jang]: most)’, ‘다르 ([da-reu]: different)’, ‘같 ([gat]: same)’. But many sentences also express comparison without those keywords. Similarly, although some sentences contain some keywords, they cannot be comparative sentences. By these reasons, extracting comparative sentences is not a simple or easy problem. It needs more complicated and challenging processes than only searching out some keywords for extracting comparative sentences.","Jindal and Liu (2006) previously studied to identify English comparative sentences. But the mechanism of Korean as an agglutinative language and that of English as an inflecting language have seriously different aspects. One of the greatest differences related to our work is that there are Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags for comparative and superlative in English1",", whereas, unfortunately, the POS tagger of Korean does not provide any comparative and superlative tags be-cause the analysis of Korean comparative is much more difficult than that of English. The major challenge of our work is therefore to identify comparative sentences without comparative and superlative POS Tags.","We first survey previous studies about the Korean comparative syntax and collect the corpus of Korean comparative sentences from the Web. As we refer to previous studies and investigate real comparative sentences form the collected corpus, we can construct the set of comparative keywords and extract comparative-sentence candidates; the sentences which contain one or more element of the keyword set are called comparative-sentence candidates. Then we use some machine learning techniques to eliminate non-comparative sentences from those candidates.

Section 2 describes the related work. In section 3, we explain comparative keywords and comparative-sentence candidates. In section 4, we describe how to eliminate non-comparative sentences from the candidates extracted in preceding section. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Finally, we discuss conclusions and future work in section 6 "]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["We have not found any direct work on automatically extracting Korean comparative sentences. There is only one study by Jindal and Liu (2006) that is related to English. They used comparative and superlative POS tags and additional some keywords to search English comparative sentences. Then they used Class Sequential Rules and Naïve Bayesian learning method. Their experiment showed a precision of 79% and recall of 81%.","Our research is closely related to linguistics. Ha (1999) described Korean comparative constructions with a linguistic view. Oh (2003) discussed the gradability of comparatives. Jeong (2000) classified the adjective superlative by the type of measures.","Opinion mining is also related to our work. Many comparative sentences also contain the speaker’s opinions and especially comparison is one of the most powerful tools for evaluation. We have surveyed many studies about opinion mining (Lee et al., 2008; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Wilson and Wiebe, 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).","Maximum Entropy Model is used in our technique. Berger et al. (1996) described Maximum Entropy approach to National Language Processing. In our experiments, we used Zhang’s Maximum Entropy Model Toolkit (2004). Naïve Bayesian classifier is used to prove the performance of MEM (McCallum and Nigam (1998)).",""]},{"title":"3 Extracting Comparative-sentence Candidates","paragraphs":["In this section, we define comparative keywords and extract comparative-sentence candidates by using those keywords. 3.1 Comparative keyword First of all, we classify comparative sentences into six types and then we extract single comparative keywords from each type as follows:"," Table 1. The six types of comparative sentences Type Single-keyword Examples 1 Equality ‘같 ([gat]: same)’ 2 Similarity ‘비슷하 ([bi-seut-ha]: similar)’ 3 Difference ‘다르 ([da-reu]: different)’ 4 Greater or","lesser ‘보다 ([bo-da]: than)’ 5 Superlative ‘가장 ([ga-jang]: most)’ 6 Predicative No single-keywords  We can easily find such keywords from the various sentences in first five types, while we cannot find any single keyword in the sentences of type 6.  Ex1) “X 껌의 원재료는 초산비닐수지인데, Y 껌은 천연치클이다.” ([X-gum-eui won-jae-ryo-neun cho-san-vi-nil-su-ji-in-de, Y-gum-eun cheonyeon-chi-kl-i-da]: Raw material of gum X is polyvinyl acetate, but that of Y is natural chicle.)2","  And we can find many non-comparative sentences which contain some keywords. The following example (Ex2) shows non-comparative though it contains ‘같 ([gat]: It means 'same', but it sometimes means 'think’)’.  Ex2) “내 생각엔 내일 비가 올 것 같아요.” ([Nae sang-gak-en nae-il bi-ga ol geot gat-a-yo]: I think it will rain tomorrow.)  Thus all the sentences can be divided into four categories as follows:  Table 2. The four categories of the sentences Single-keyword Contain Not contain Comparative Sentences S1 S2 Non-comparative Sentences S3 S4 (unconcerned","group)",""]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["2 In fact, type 6 can be sorted as non-comparative from linguistic view. But the speaker is probably saying that Y is better than X. This is very important comparative data as an opinion. Therefore, we also regard the sentences containing implicit comparison as comparative sentences 154","Our final goal is to find an effective method to extract S1 and S2, but single-keyword searching just outputs S1 and S3. In order to capture S2, we added long-distance-words sequences to the set of single-keywords. For example, we could extract ‘<는 [neun], 인데 [in-de], 은 [eun], 이다 [ida]>’ as a long-distance-words sequence from Ex1-sentence. It means that the sentence is formed as < S V but S V> in English (S: subject phrase, V: verb phrase). Thus we defined comparative keyword in this paper as follows:  Definition (comparative keyword): A comparative keyword is formed as a word or a phrase or a long-distance-words sequence. When a comparative keyword is contained in any sentence, the sentence is most likely to be a comparative sentence. (We will use an abbreviation ‘CK’.)  3.2 Comparative-sentence Candidates We finally set up a total of 177 CKs by human efforts. In the previous work, Jindal and Liu (2006) defined 83 keywords and key phrases in-cluding comparative or superlative POS tags in English; they did not use any long-distance-words sequence.","Keyword searching process can detect most of comparative sentences (S1, S2 and S3)3","from original text documents. That is, the recall is high but the precision is low. We here defined a comparative-sentence candidate as a sentence which contains one or more elements of the set of CKs. Now we need to eliminate the incorrect sentences (S3) from those captured sentences. First, we divided the set of CKs into two subsets denoted by CKL1 and CKL2 according to the precision of each keyword; we used 90% of the precision as a threshold value. The average precision of comparative-sentence candidates with a CKL1 keyword is 97.44% and they do not require any additional process. But that of comparative-sentence candidates with a CKL2 keyword is 29.34% and we decide to eliminate non-comparative sentences only from comparative sentence candidates with a CKL2 keyword.",""]},{"title":"4 Eliminating Non-comparative Sen-tences from the Candidates","paragraphs":[""]},{"title":"","paragraphs":["3 As you can see in the experiment section, keyword searching captures 95.96% comparative sentences. To effectively eliminate non-comparative sentences from comparative sentence candidates with a CKL2 keyword, we employ machine learning techniques (MEM and Naïve Bayes). For feature extraction from each comparative-sentence candidate, we use continuous words sequence within the radius of 3 (the window size of 7) of each keyword in the sentence; we experimented with radius options of 2, 3, and 4 and we achieved the best performance in the radius of 3. After determining the radius, we replace each word with its POS tag; in order to reflect various expressions of each sentence, POS tags are more proper than lexical information of actual words. However, since CKs play the most important role to discriminate comparative sentences, they are represented as a combination of their actual keyword and POS tag. Thus our feature is formed as “X ̆y”. (‘X’ means a sequence and ‘y’ means a class; y1 denotes comparative and y2 denotes non-comparative). For instance, ‘<pv etm nbn 같/pa ep ef sf >4","̆y2’ is one of the features from the sentence of Ex2 in section 3.1."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["Three trained human annotators compiled a corpus of 277 online documents from various domains.
