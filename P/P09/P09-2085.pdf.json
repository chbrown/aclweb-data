Goldwater et al. (2006a) presented an approximation which significantly reduces the storage and computation overhead, but we show here that their formulation was incorrect and, even after correction, is grossly inaccurate. We present an alternative formulation which is exact and can be computed easily. However this approach does not work for hierarchical models, for which case we present an efficient data structure which has a better space complexity than the naive approach."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Unsupervised learning of natural language is one of the most challenging areas in NLP. Recently, methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics have been gaining popularity as a way to approach unsupervised learning for a variety of tasks, including language modeling, word and morpheme segmentation, parsing, and machine translation (Teh et al., 2006; Goldwater et al., 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2006b; Liang et al., 2007; Finkel et al., 2007; DeNero et al., 2008). These models are often based on the Dirichlet process (DP) (Ferguson, 1973) or hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006), with Gibbs sampling as a method of inference. Exact implementation of such sampling methods requires considerable bookkeeping of various counts, which motivated Goldwater et al. (2006a) (henceforth, GGJ06) to develop an approximation using expected counts. However, we show here that their approximation is flawed in two respects: 1) It omits an important factor in the expectation, and 2) Even after correction, the approximation is poor for hierarchical models, which are commonly used for NLP applications. We derive an improved O(1) formula that gives exact values for the expected counts in non-hierarchical models. For hierarchical models, where our formula is not exact, we present an efficient method for sampling from the HDP (and related models, such as the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process) that considerably decreases the memory footprint of such models as compared to the naive implementation.","As we have noted, the issues described in this paper apply to models for various kinds of NLP tasks; for concreteness, we will focus on n-gram language modeling for the remainder of the paper, closely following the presentation in GGJ06."]},{"title":"2 The Chinese Restaurant Process","paragraphs":["GGJ06 present two nonparametric Bayesian language models: a DP unigram model and an HDP bigram model. Under the DP model, words in a corpus w = w1 . . . wn are generated as follows: G|α0, P0 ∼ DP(α0, P0) wi|G ∼ G where G is a distribution over an infinite set of possible words, P0 (the base distribution of the DP) determines the probability that an item will be in the support of G, and α0 (the concentration parameter) determines the variance of G.","One way of understanding the predictions that the DP model makes is through the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) (Aldous, 1985). In the CRP, customers (word tokens wi) enter a restaurant with an infinite number of tables and choose a seat. The table chosen by the ith customer, zi, follows the distribution: P (zi = k|z−i) = { nz −i k i−1+α0 , 0 ≤ k < K(z−i) α0 i−1+α0 , k = K(z−i) 337 The 1","meow 4 cats 2 cats 3 cats 5 a","b c d e f gh Figure 1.

Note that multiple tables may share a label. where z−i = z1 . . . zi−1 are the table assignments of the previous customers, n","z−i","k is the number of customers at table k in z−i, and K(z−i) is the total number of occupied tables. If we further assume that table k is labeled with a word type lk drawn from P0, then the assignment of tokens to tables defines a distribution over words, with wi = lzi. See Figure 1 for an example seating arrangement.","Using this model, the predictive probability of wi, conditioned on the previous words, can be found by summing over possible seating assignments for wi, and is given by P (wi = w|w−i) = n w−i w + α0P0 i − 1 + α0 (1) This prediction turns out to be exactly that of the DP model after integrating out the distribution G. Note that as long as the base distribution P0 is fixed, predictions do not depend on the seating arrangement z−i, only on the count of word w in the previously observed words (n","w−i","w ). However, in many situations, we may wish to estimate the base distribution itself, creating a hierarchical model. Since the base distribution generates table labels, estimates of this distribution are based on the counts of those labels, i.e., the number of tables associated with each word type.","An example of such a hierarchical model is the HDP bigram model of GGJ06, in which each word type w is associated with its own restaurant, where customers in that restaurant correspond to words that follow w in the corpus. All the bigram restaurants share a common base distribution P1 over unigrams, which must be inferred. Predictions in this model are as follows: P2(wi|h−i) = n h−i (wi−1,wi) + α1P1(wi|h−i) n h−i (wi−1,∗) + α1 P1(wi|h−i) = th−i wi + α0P0(wi) th−i ∗ + α0 (2) where h−i = (w−i, z−i), th−i","wi is the number of tables labelled with wi, and t","h−i","∗ is the total number of occupied tables. Of particular note for our discussion is that in order to calculate these conditional distributions we must know the table assignments z−i for each of the words in w−i.

For each method, results using α = {100, 1000, 10000, 100000} are shown (from bottom to top). Solid lines show the expected number of tables, computed using (3) and assuming P1 is a fixed uniform distribution over a finite vocabulary (values computed using the Digamma formulation (7) are the same). Dashed lines show the values given by the Antoniak approximation (4) (the line for α = 100 falls below the bottom of the graph). Stars show the mean of empirical table counts as computed over 1000 samples from an MCMC sampler in which P1 is a fixed uniform distribution, as in the unigram LM. Circles show the mean of empirical table counts when P1 is inferred, as in the bigram LM. Standard errors in both cases are no larger than the marker size. All plots are based on the 30114-word vocabulary and frequencies found in sections 0-20 of the WSJ corpus. these kinds of models, the counts are constantly changing over multiple samples, with tables going in and out of existence frequently. This can create significant bookkeeping issues in implementation, and motivated GGJ06 to present a method of computing approximate table counts based on word frequencies only."]},{"title":"3 Approximating Table Counts","paragraphs":["Rather than explicitly tracking the number of tables tw associated with each word w in their bigram model, GGJ06 approximate the table counts using the expectation E[tw]. Expected counts are used in place of th−i","wi and t h−i ∗ in (2).","The exact expectation, due to Antoniak (1974), is E[tw] = α1P1(w) nw ∑ i=1","1 α1P1(w) + i − 1 (3) 338 Antoniak also gives an approximation to this expectation: E[tw] ≈ α1P1(w) log","nw + α1P1(w) α1P1(w) (4) but provides no derivation. Due to a misinterpretation of Antoniak (1974), GGJ06 use an approximation that leaves out all the P1(w) terms from (4).1","Figure 2 compares the approximation to the exact expectation when the base distribution is fixed. The approximation is fairly good when αP1(w) > 1 (the scenario assumed by Antoniak); however, in most NLP applications, αP1(w) < 1 in order to effect a sparse prior. (We return to the case of non-fixed based distributions in a moment.) As an extreme case of the paucity of this approximation consider α1P1(w) = 1 and nw = 1 (i.e. only one customer has entered the restaurant): clearly E[tw] should equal 1, but the approximation gives log(2).","We now provide a derivation for (4), which will allow us to obtain an O(1) formula for the expectation in (3). First, we rewrite the summation in (3) as a difference of fractional harmonic numbers:2 H(α1P1(w)+nw−1) − H(α1P1(w)−1) (5) Using the recurrence for harmonic numbers: E[tw] ≈ α1P1(w) [ H(α1P1(w)+nw)−","1 α1P1(w) + nw − H(α1P1(w)+nw) +","1 α1P1(w) ] (6) We then use the asymptotic expansion, HF ≈ log F + γ + 1","2F , omiting trailing terms which are O(F −2",") and smaller powers of F :3 E[tw] ≈ α1P1(w) log","nw+α1P1(w) α1P1(w) + nw","2(α1P1(w)+nw)","Omitting the trailing term leads to the approximation in Antoniak (1974). However, we can obtain an exact formula for the expectation by utilising the relationship between the Digamma function and the harmonic numbers: ψ(n) = Hn−1 − γ.4","Thus we can rewrite (5) as:5","E[tw] = α1P1(w)· [ ψ(α1P1(w) + nw) − ψ(α1P1(w))] (7) 1 The authors of GGJ06 realized this error, and current","implementations of their models no longer use these approx-","imations, instead tracking table counts explicitly. 2 Fractional harmonic numbers between 0 and 1 are given","by HF = R 1 0","1−xF","1−x dx.

The explicit table tracking and histogram representations for Figure 1.","A significant caveat here is that the expected table counts given by (3) and (7) are only valid when the base distribution is a constant. However, in hierarchical models such as GGJ06’s bigram model and HDP models, the base distribution is not constant and instead must be inferred. As can be seen in Figure 2, table counts can diverge considerably from the expectations based on fixed P1 when P1 is in fact not fixed. Thus, (7) can be viewed as an approximation in this case, but not necessarily an accurate one. Since knowing the table counts is only necessary for inference in hierarchical models, but the table counts can-not be approximated well by any of the formulas presented here, we must conclude that the best inference method is still to keep track of the actual table counts. The naive method of doing so is to store which table each customer in the restaurant is seated at, incrementing and decrementing these counts as needed during the sampling process. In the following section, we describe an alternative method that reduces the amount of memory necessary for implementing HDPs. This method is also appropriate for hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes, for which no closed-form approximations to the table counts have been proposed."]},{"title":"4 Efficient Implementation of HDPs","paragraphs":["As we do not have an efficient expected table count approximation for hierarchical models we could fall back to explicitly tracking which table each customer that enters the restaurant sits at.
