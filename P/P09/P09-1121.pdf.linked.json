We propose to exploit this variation in quality by learning a ranking function on bilingual queries: queries that appear in query logs for two languages but represent equivalent search interests. For a given bilingual query, along with corresponding monolingual query log and monolingual ranking, we generate a ranking on pairs of documents, one from each language. Then we learn a linear ranking function which exploits bilingual features on pairs of documents, as well as standard monolingual features. Finally, we show how to reconstruct monolingual ranking from a learned bilingual ranking. Using publicly available Chinese and English query logs, we demonstrate for both languages that our ranking technique exploiting bilingual data leads to significant improvements over a state-of-the-art monolingual ranking algorithm."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Web search quality can vary widely across languages, even for a single query and search engine. For example, we might expect that ranking search results for the query (Thomas Hobbes) to be more difficult in Chinese than it is in English, even while holding the basic ranking function constant. At the same time, ranking search results for the query Han Feizi ( ) is likely to be harder in English than in Chinese. A large portion of web queries have such properties that they are originated in a language different from the one they are searched.","This variance in problem difficulty across languages is not unique to web search; it appears in a wide range of natural language processing problems. Much recent work on bilingual data has focused on exploiting these variations in difficulty to improve a variety of monolingual tasks, includ-ing parsing (Hwa et al., 2005; Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), named entity recognition (Chang et al., 2009), and topic clustering (Wu and Oard, 2008). In this work, we exploit a similar intuition to improve monolingual web search.","Our problem setting differs from cross-lingual web search, where the goal is to return machine-translated results from one language in response to a query from another (Lavrenko et al., 2002). We operate under the assumption that for many monolingual English queries (e.g., Han Feizi), there exist good documents in English. If we have Chinese information as well, we can exploit it to help find these documents. As we will see, machine translation can provide important predictive information in our setting, but we do not wish to display machine-translated output to the user.","We approach our problem by learning a ranking function for bilingual queries – queries that are easily translated (e.g., with machine translation) and appear in the query logs of two languages (e.g., English and Chinese). Given query logs in both languages, we identify bilingual queries with sufficient clickthrough statistics in both sides. Large-scale aggregated clickthrough data were proved useful and effective in learning ranking functions (Dou et al., 2008). Using these statistics, we can construct a ranking over pairs of documents, one from each language. We use this ranking to learn a linear scoring function on pairs of documents given a bilingual query.","We find that our bilingual rankings have good monolingual ranking properties. In particular, given an optimal pairwise bilingual ranking, we show that simple heuristics can effectively approximate the optimal monolingual ranking.

We develop and test our bilingual ranker on English and Chinese with two large, publicly available query logs from the AOL search engine1","(English query log) (Pass et al., 2006) and the Sougou search engine2","(Chinese query log) (Liu et al., 2007). For both languages, we achieve significant improvements over monolingual Ranking SVM (RSVM) baselines (Herbrich et al., 2000; Joachims, 2002), which exploit a variety of monolingual features."]},{"title":"2 Bilingual Query Statistics","paragraphs":["We designate a query as bilingual if the concept has been searched by users of both two languages. As a result, not only does it occur in the query log of its own language, but its translation also appears in the log of the second language. So a bilingual query yields reasonable queries in both languages. Of course, most queries are not bilingual. For example, our English log contains map of Alabama, but not our Chinese log. In this case, we wouldn’t expect the Chinese results for the query’s translation, , to be helpful in ranking the English results.","In total, we extracted 4.8 million English queries from AOL log, of which 1.3% of their translations appear in Sogou log. Similarly, of our 3.1 million Chinese queries from Sogou log, 2.3% of their translations appear in AOL log. By total number of queries issued (i.e., counting dupli-1 http://search.aol.com 2 http://www.sogou.com cates), the proportion of bilingual queries is much higher. As Figure 1 shows as the number of times a query is issued increases, so does the chance of it being bilingual. In particular, nearly 45% of the highest-frequency English queries and 35% of the highest-frequency Chinese queries are bilingual."]},{"title":"3 Learning to Rank Using Bilingual Information","paragraphs":["Given a set of bilingual queries, we now describe how to learn a ranking function for monolingual data that exploits information from both languages. Our procedure has three steps: Given two monolingual rankings, we construct a bilingual ranking on pairs of documents, one from each language. Then we learn a linear scoring function for pairs of documents that exploits monolingual information (in both languages) and bilingual information. Finally, given this ranking function on pairs and a new bilingual query, we reconstruct a monolingual ranking for the language of interest. This section addresses these steps in turn. 3.1 Creating Bilingual Training Data Without loss of generality, suppose we rank English documents with constraints from Chinese documents. Given an English log Le and a Chinese log Lc, our ranking algorithm takes as input a bilingual query pair q = (qe, qc) where qe ∈ Le and qc ∈ Lc, a set of returned English documents {ei}N","i=1 from qe, and a set of constraint Chinese documents {cj}n","j=1 from qc. In order to create bilingual ranking data, we first generate monolingual ranking data from clickthrough statistics. For each language-query-document triple, we calculate the aggregated click count across all users and rank documents according to this statistic. We denote the count of a page as C(ei) or C(cj).","The use of clickthrough statistics as feedback for learning ranking functions is not without controversy, but recent empirical results on large data sets suggest that the aggregated user clicks provides an informative indicator of relevance preference for a query. Joachims et al. (2007) showed that relative feedback signals generated from clicks correspond well with human judgments. Dou et al. (2008) revealed that a straightforward use of aggregated clicks can achieve a better ranking than using explicitly labeled data because clickthrough data contain fine-grained differences between documents useful for learning an 1076","Table 1: Clickthrough data of a bilingual query","pair extracted from query logs.","Bilingual query pair (Mazda, ) doc URL click # e1 www.mazda.com 229 e2 www.mazdausa.com 185 e3 www.mazda.co.uk 5 e4 www.starmazda.com 2 e5 www.mazdamotosports.com 2",". . . . . . c1 www.faw-mazda.com 50 c2 price.pcauto.com.cn/brand.","jsp?bid=17 43","c3 auto.sina.com.cn/salon/ FORD/MAZDA.shtml 20","c4 car.autohome.com.cn/brand/ 119/ 18","c5 jsp.auto.sohu.com/view/ brand-bid-263.html 9 . . . . . . accurate and reliable ranking. Therefore, we leverage aggregated clicks for comparing the relevance order of documents. Note that there is nothing specific to our technique that requires clickthrough statistics. Indeed, our methods could easily be employed with human annotated data. Table 1 gives an example of a bilingual query pair and the aggregated click count of each result page.","Given two monolingual documents, a preference order can be inferred if one document is clicked more often than another. To allow for cross-lingual information, we extend the order of individual documents into that of bilingual document pairs: given two bilingual document pairs, we will write ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) to indicate that the pair of ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) is ranked higher than the pair of ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) . Definition 1 ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) if and only if one of the following relations hold:","1. C(e(1)","i ) > C(e(2) i ) and C(c(1)","j ) ≥ C(c(2)","j )","2. C(e(1)","i ) ≥ C(e(2) i ) and C(c(1)","j ) > C(c(2)","j ) Note, however, that from a purely monolingual perspective, this definition introduces orderings on documents that should not initially have existed. For English ranking, for example, we may have( e(1)","i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j )","even when C(e(1) i ) = C(e(2)","i ). This leads us to the following asymmetric definition of ≻ that we use in practice: Definition 2 ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) if and only if C(e(1)","i ) > C(e(2)","i ) and C(c(1)","j ) ≥ C(c(2)","j )","With this definition, we can unambiguously compare the relevance of bilingual document pairs based on the order of monolingual documents. The advantages are two-fold: (1) we can treat multiple cross-lingual document similarities the same way as the commonly used query-document features in a uniform manner of learning; (2) with the similarities, the relevance estimation on bilingual document pairs can be enhanced, and this in return can improve the ranking of documents. 3.2 Ranking Model Given a pair of bilingual queries (qe, qc), we can extract the set of corresponding bilingual document pairs and their click counts {(ei, cj), (C(ei), C(cj))}, where i = 1, . . . , N and j = 1, . . . , n. Based on that, we produce a set of bilingual ranking instances S = {Φij, zij}, where each Φij = {xi; yj; sij} is the feature vector of (ei, cj) consisting of three components: xi = f (qe, ei) is the vector of monolingual relevancy features of ei, yi = f (qc, cj) is the vector of monolingual relevancy features of cj, and sij = sim(ei, cj) is the vector of cross-lingual similarities between ei and cj, and zij = (C(ei), C(cj)) is the corresponding click counts.","The task is to select the optimal function that minimizes a given loss with respect to the order of ranked bilingual document pairs and the gold. We resort to Ranking SVM (RSVM) (Herbrich et al., 2000; Joachims, 2002) learning for classification on pairs of instances. Compared the baseline RSVM (monolingual), our algorithm learns to classify on pairs of bilingual document pairs rather than on pairs of individual documents.","Let f being a linear function: f ⃗w(ei, cj) = ⃗wx · xi + ⃗wy · yj + ⃗ws · sij (1) where ⃗w = { ⃗wx; ⃗wy; ⃗ws} denotes the weight vector, in which the elements correspond to the relevancy features and similarities. For any two bilingual document pairs, their preference relation is measured by the difference of the functional values of Equation 1: ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) ⇔ f ⃗w ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) − f ⃗w ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) > 0 ⇔ ⃗wx · ( x(1) i − x (2) i ) + ⃗wy · ( y (1) j − y (2) j ) + ⃗ws · ( s(1) ij − s(2)","ij ) > 0 1077 We then create a new training corpus based on the preference ordering of any two such pairs: S′","= {Φ′ ij, z′","ij}, where the new feature vector becomes","Φ′ ij =","{ x(1) i − x(2)","i ; y (1) j − y","(2)","j ; s(1)","ij − s(2)","ij } , and the class label z′ ij =    +1, if ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) ≻ ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) ; −1, if ( e(2) i , c (2) j ) ≻ ( e(1) i , c (1) j ) is a binary preference value depending on the order of bilingual document pairs. The problem is to solve SVM objective: min","⃗w","1","2 ∥ ⃗w∥2","+ λ ∑","i","∑ j ξij","subject to bilingual constraints: z′ ij · ( ⃗w · Φ′","ij) ≥ 1 − ξij and ξij ≥ 0.","There are potentially Γ = nN bilingual document pairs for each query, and the number of comparable pairs may be much larger due to the combinatorial nature (but less than Γ(Γ − 1)/2). To speed up training, we resort to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007) to approximate the true gradient of the loss function evaluated on a single instance (i.e., per constraint). The parameters are then adjusted by an amount proportional to this approximate gradient. For large data set, SGD-RSVM can be much faster than batch-mode gradient descent. 3.3 Inference The solution ⃗w forms a vector orthogonal to the hyper-plane of RSVM. To predict the order of bilingual document pairs, the ranking score can be simply calculated by Equation 1. However, a prominent problem is how to derive the full order of monolingual documents for output from the order of bilingual document pairs. To our knowledge, there is no precise conversion algorithm in polynomial time. We thus adopt two heuristics for approximating the true document score:","• H-1 (max score): Choose the maximum score of the pair as the score of document, i.e., score(ei) = maxj(f (ei, cj)).","• H-2 (mean score): Average over all the scores of pairs associated with the ranked document as the score of this document, i.e., score(ei) = 1/n","∑ j f (ei, cj).","Intuitively, for the rank score of a single document, H-2 combines the “voting” scores from its n constraint documents weighted equally, while H-1 simply chooses the maximum one. A formal approach to the problem is to leverage rank aggregation formalism (Dwork et a., 2001; Liu et al., 2007), which will be left for our future work. The two simple heuristics are employed here because of their simplicity and efficiency. The time complexity of the approximation is linear to the number of ranked documents given n is constant."]},{"title":"4 Features and Similarities","paragraphs":["Standard features for learning to rank include various query-document features, e.g., BM25 (Robertson, 1997), as well as query-independent features, e.g., PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998). Our feature space consists of both these standard monolingual features and cross-lingual similarities among documents. The cross-lingual similarities are valuated using different translation mechanisms, e.g., dictionary-based translation or machine translation, or even without any translation at all. 4.1 Monolingual Relevancy Features In learning to rank, the relevancy between query and documents and the measures based on link analysis are commonly used as features. The discussion on their details is beyond the scope of this paper. Readers may refer to (Liu et al., 2007) for the definitions of many such features. We implement six of these features that are considered the most typical shown as Table 2. These include sets of measures such as BM25, language-model-based IR score, and PageRank. Because most conventional IR and web search relevancy measures fall into this category, we call them altogether IR features in what follows. Note that for a given bilingual document pair (e, c), the monolingual IR features consist of relevance score vectors f (qe, e) in English and f (qc, c) in Chinese. 4.2 Cross-lingual Document Similarities To measure the document similarity across different languages, we define the similarity vector sim(e, c) as a series of functions mapping a bilingual document pair to positive real numbers. In-tuitively, a good similarity function is one which maps cross-lingual relevant documents into close scores and maintains a large distance between ir-relevant and relevant documents. Four categories of similarity measures are employed.","Dictionary-based Similarity (DIC): For dictionary-based document translation, we use 1078","Table 2: List of monolingual relevancy measures","used as IR features in our model.","IR Feature Description BM25 Okapi BM25 score (Robertson, 1997)","BM25 PRF Okapi BM25 score with pseudo-","relevance feedback (Robertson and","Jones, 1976) LM DIR Language-model-based IR score with","Dirichlet smoothing (Zhai and Lafferty,","2001) LM JM Language-model-based IR score with","Jelinek-Mercer smoothing (Zhai and","Lafferty, 2001) LM ABS Language-model-based IR score with","absolute discounting (Zhai and Lafferty,","2001) PageRank PageRank score (Brin and Page, 1998) the similarity measure proposed by Mathieu et al.

Given a bilingual dictionary, we let T (e, c) denote the set of word pairs (we, wc) such that we is a word in English document e, and wc is a word in Chinese document c, and we is the English translation of wc. We define tf (we, e) and tf (wc, c) to be the term frequency of we in e and that of wc in c, respectively. Let df (we) and df (wc) be the English document frequency for we and Chinese document frequency for wc. If ne (nc) is the total number of English (Chinese), then the bilingual idf is defined as idf (we, wc) = log ne+nc","df(we)+df(wc) . Then the cross-lingual document similarity is calculated by sim(e, c) = ∑ (we,wc)∈T(e,c) tf(we,e)tf(wc,c)idf(we,wc)2 √ Z where Z is a normalization coefficient (see Mathieu et al. (2004) for detail). This similarity function can be understood as the cross-lingual counterpart of the monolingual cosine similarity function (Salton, 1998).","Similarity Based on Machine Translation (MT): For machine translation, the cross-lingual measure actually becomes a monolingual similarity between one document and another’s translation.

Therefore, we use the Kendall’s tau coefficient (Kendall, 1938; Joachims, 2002) to measure the degree of correla-tion between two rankings. For simplicity, let’s as-sume strict orderings of any given ranking. Therefore we ignore all the pairs with ties (instances with the identical click count). Kendall’s tau is defined as τ (ra, rb) = (P − Q)/(P + Q), where P is the number of concordant pairs and Q is the number of disconcordant pairs in the given orderings ra and rb. The value is a real number within [−1, +1], where −1 indicates a complete inversion, and +1 stands for perfect agreement, and a value of zero indicates no correlation.","Existing ranking techniques heavily depend on human relevance judgment that is very costly to obtain. Similar to Dou et al (2008), our method utilizes the automatically aggregated click count in query logs as the gold for deriving the true order of relevancy, but we use the clickthrough of different languages. We average Kendall’s tau values between the algorithm output and the gold based on click frequency for all test queries. 5.2 Data Sets Query logs can be the basis for constructing high quality ranking corpus. Due to the proprietary issue of log, no public ranking corpus based on real-world search engine log is currently available.

We use traditional RSVM (Herbrich et al., 2000; Joachims, 2002) without any bilingual considera-tion as the baseline, which uses only English IR features. We conduct this experiment using all the 1,084 bilingual query pairs with 4-fold cross validation (each fold with 271 query pairs). The number of constraint documents n is empirically set as 5. The results are shown in Table 4.","Clearly, bilingual constraints are helpful to improve English ranking. Our pairwise settings unanimously outperforms the RSVM baseline. The paired two-tailed t-test (Smucker et al., 2007) shows that most improvements resulted from heuristic H-2 (mean score) are statistically significant at 99% confidence level (p<0.01). Relatively fewer significant improvements can be made by heuristic H-1 (max score). This is because the maximum score on pair is just a rough approximation to the optimal document score. But this simple scheme works surprisingly well and still consistently outperforms the baseline.","Note that our bilingual model with only IR features, i.e., IR (no similarity), also outperforms the baseline.

This may be due to the limitation of bilingual dictionary alone for translating documents, where the issues like out-of-vocabulary words and translation ambiguity are common but can be better dealt with by MT. When DIC is combined with RATIO, which considers both forward and backward translation of words, it can capture the correlation between bilingually very similar pages, thus performs better.","We find that the URL similarity, although simple, is very useful and improves 1.5–2.4% of Kendall’s tau value than not using it. This is because the URLs of the top Chinese (constraint) documents are often similar to many of returned English URLs which are generally more regular. For example, in query pair (Toyota Camry, ), 9/13 English pages are anchored by the URLs containing keywords “toyota” and/or “camry”, and 3/5 constraint documents’ URLs also contain them. In contrast, the URLs of returned Chinese pages are less regular in general. This also explains why this measure does not improve much for Chinese ranking (see Section 5.4).","We also vary the parameter n to study how the performance changes with different number of constraint Chinese documents. Figure 2 shows the results using heuristic H-2.

One explana-tion is that the document clicked most often is not necessarily relevant, and it is very likely that no English page is similar to the first Chinese page. Joachims et al. (2007) found that users’ click be-havior is biased by the rank of search engine at the first and/or second positions (especially the first). More constraint pages are helpful because the pages after the first are less biased and the click counts can reflect the relevancy more accurately. 5.4 Chinese Ranking Performance We also benchmark Chinese ranking with English constraint documents under the similar configurations as Section 5.3. The results are given by Table 5 and Figure 3.","As shown in Table 5, improvements on Chinese ranking are even more encouraging. Kendall’s tau values under all the settings are significantly better than not only the baseline but also IR (no similarity). This may suggest that English information is generally more helpful to Chinese ranking than the other way round. The reason is straightforward: there are a high proportion of Chinese queries hav-ing English or foreign-language origins in our data set. For these queries, relevant information at Chinese side may be relatively poorer, so the English ranking can be more reliable. As far as we can, we manually identified 215 such queries from all the 1,084 bilingual queries (amount to 23.2%).","To shed more light on this finding, we examine top-20 queries improved most by our method 1081 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0.286 0.288 0.29 0.292 0.294 0.296 0.298 0.3 0.302 0.304 # of constraint documents in a different language Kendall’s tau   RSVM (baseline) IR+DIC IR+MT IR+DIC+MT IR+DIC+RATIO+MT IR+DIC+RATIO+MT+URL Figure 3: Chinese ranking results vary with the number of constraint English documents. (with all features and similarities) over the baseline. As shown in Table 6, most of the top improved Chinese queries are about concepts originated from English or other languages, or some-thing non-local (bolded). Interestingly, (political catoons) are among these Chinese queries improved most by English ranking, which is believed as rare (or sensitive) content on Chinese web. In contrast, top English queries are short of this type of queries. But we can still see Bruce Lee (), a Chinese Kung-Fu actor, and peony (), the national flower of China. Their information tends to be more popular on Chinese web, and thus helpful to English ranking. For the exceptions like Sunrider () and Aniston (), despite their English origins, we find they have surprisingly sparse click counts in English log while Chinese users look much more in-terested and provide a lot of clickthrough that is helpful."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We aim to improve web search ranking for an important set of queries, called bilingual queries, by exploiting bilingual information derived from clickthrough logs of different languages. The thrust of our technique is using search ranking of one language and cross-lingual information to help ranking of another language. Our pairwise ranking scheme based on bilingual document pairs can easily integrate all kinds of similarities into the existing framework and significantly improves both English and Chinese ranking performance. Table 6: Top 20 most improved bilingual queries. Bold means a positive example for our hypothesis. * marks an exception. Most improved CH queries Most improved EN queries (salmonella) free online tv (",") (scotland) weapons () (caffeine) lily () (epitaph) cable () (british history) *sunrider () (political cartoons) *aniston () (immune system) clothes () (wine bottles) *three little pigs (",") (hungary) hair care () (witchcraft) neon () (popcorn) bruce lee () (impetigo) radish () (bathroom design) chile () (pigeon) peony () (polar bear) toothache () (map of africa) free online translation (",") (labrador retriever) water () (pamela anderson) oil ()","(yoga clothing) shopping network ( ) (federal express) *prince harry ()","Our model can be generally applied to other search ranking problems, such as ranking using monolingual similarities or ranking for cross-lingual/multilingual web search. Another interest-ing direction is to study the recovery of the optimal document ordering from pairwise ordering using well-founded formalism such as rank aggregation approaches (Dwork et a., 2001; Liu et al., 2007).","Furthermore, we may involve more sophisticated monolingual features that do not transfer cross-lingually but are asymmetric for either side, such as clustering, document classification features built from domain taxonomies like DMOZ."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work is partially supported by the Innova-tion Technology Fund, Hong Kong (project No.: ITS/182/08).
