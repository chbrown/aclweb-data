The voted perceptron algorithm can be considerably more efficient to train, at some cost in computation on test examples."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Recent work in statistical approaches to parsing and tagging has begun to consider methods which incorporate global features of candidate structures. Examples of such techniques are Markov Random Fields (Abney 1997; Della Pietra et al. 1997; John-son et al. 1999), and boosting algorithms (Freund et al. 1998; Collins 2000; Walker et al. 2001). One appeal of these methods is their flexibility in incorporating features into a model: essentially any features which might be useful in discriminating good from bad structures can be included. A second appeal of these methods is that their training criterion is often discriminative, attempting to explicitly push the score or probability of the correct structure for each training sentence above the score of competing structures. This discriminative property is shared by the methods of (Johnson et al. 1999; Collins 2000), and also the Conditional Random Field methods of (Lafferty et al. 2001).","In a previous paper (Collins 2000), a boosting algorithm was used to rerank the output from an existing statistical parser, giving significant improvements in parsing accuracy on Wall Street Journal data. Similar boosting algorithms have been applied to natural language generation, with good results, in (Walker et al. 2001). In this paper we apply reranking methods to named-entity extraction. A state-of-the-art (maximum-entropy) tagger is used to generate 20 possible segmentations for each input sentence, along with their probabilities. We describe a number of additional global features of these candidate segmentations. These additional features are used as evidence in reranking the hypotheses from the max-ent tagger. We describe two learning algorithms: the boosting method of (Collins 2000), and a variant of the voted perceptron algorithm, which was initially described in (Freund & Schapire 1999). We applied the methods to a corpus of over one million words of tagged web data. The methods give significant improvements over the maximum-entropy tagger (a 17.7% relative reduction in error-rate for the voted perceptron, and a 15.6% relative improvement for the boosting method).","One contribution of this paper is to show that existing reranking methods are useful for a new domain, named-entity tagging, and to suggest global features which give improvements on this task. We should stress that another contribution is to show that a new algorithm, the voted perceptron, gives very credible results on a natural language task. It is an extremely simple algorithm to implement, and is very fast to train (the testing phase is slower, but by no means sluggish). It should be a viable alternative to methods such as the boosting or Markov Random Field algorithms described in previous work."]},{"title":"2 Background 2.1 The data","paragraphs":["Over a period of a year or so we have had over one million words of named-entity data annotated. The Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 489-496. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for data is drawn from web pages, the aim being to support a question-answering system over web data. A number of categories are annotated: the usual people, organization and location categories, as well as less frequent categories such as brand-names, scientific terms, event titles (such as concerts) and so on. From this data we created a training set of 53,609 sentences (1,047,491 words), and a test set of 14,717 sentences (291,898 words).","The task we consider is to recover named-entity boundaries. We leave the recovery of the categories of entities to a separate stage of processing.1","We evaluate different methods on the task through precision and recall. If a method proposes","entities on the test set, and","of these are correct (i.e., an entity is marked by the annotator with exactly the same span as that proposed) then the precision of a method is   ",". Similarly, if","is the total number of en-","tities in the human annotated version of the test set,","then the recall is "," . 2.2 The baseline tagger The problem can be framed as a tagging task – to tag each word as being either the start of an entity, a continuation of an entity, or not to be part of an entity at all (we will use the tags S, C and N respectively for these three cases). As a baseline model we used a maximum entropy tagger, very similar to the ones described in (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Borthwick et. al 1998; McCallum et al. 2000). Max-ent taggers have been shown to be highly competitive on a number of tagging tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi 1996), named-entity recognition (Borthwick et. al 1998), and information extraction tasks (McCallum et al. 2000). Thus the maximum-entropy tagger we used represents a serious baseline for the task. We used the following features (several of the features were inspired by the approach of (Bikel et. al 1999), an HMM model which gives excellent results on named entity extraction):","","The word being tagged, the previous word, and the next word.","","The previous tag, and the previous two tags (bigram and trigram features).","1","In initial experiments, we found that forcing the tagger to recover categories as well as the segmentation, by exploding the number of tags, reduced performance on the segmentation task, presumably due to sparse data problems. ","A compound feature of three fields: (a) Is the","word at the start of a sentence?; (b) does the word","occur in a list of words which occur more frequently","as lower case rather than upper case words in a large","corpus of text? (c) the type of the first letter","of","the word, where","","","is defined as ‘A’ if","is a","capitalized letter, ‘a’ if","is a lower-case letter, ‘0’","if","is a digit, and","otherwise. For example, if the","word Animal is seen at the start of a sentence, and","it occurs in the list of frequent lower-cased words,","then it would be mapped to the feature 1-1-A. ","The word with each character mapped to its"," ",". For example, G.M. would be mapped to","A.A., and Animal would be mapped to Aaaaaa. ","The word with each character mapped to its","type, but repeated consecutive character types are","not repeated in the mapped string. For example, An-","imal would be mapped to Aa, G.M. would again be","mapped to A.A.. The tagger was applied and trained in the same","way as described in (Ratnaparkhi 1996). The feature","templates described above are used to create a set of"," binary features","","",", where","is the tag, and","is the “history”, or context. An example is","         if t = S and the word being tagged = “Mr.”  otherwise","The parameters of the model are for"," ",",","defining a conditional distribution over the tags","given a history","as","   "," ","","","","  ","",""," The parameters are trained using Generalized Iterative Scaling. Following (Ratnaparkhi 1996), we only include features which occur 5 times or more in training data. In decoding, we use a beam search to recover 20 candidate tag sequences for each sentence (the sentence is decoded from left to right, with the top 20 most probable hypotheses being stored at each point). 2.3 Applying the baseline tagger As a baseline we trained a model on the full 53,609 sentences of training data, and decoded the 14,717 sentences of test data. This gave 20 candidates per test sentence, along with their probabilities. The baseline method is to take the most probable candidate for each test data sentence, and then to calculate precision and recall figures. Our aim is to come up with strategies for reranking the test data candidates, in such a way that precision and recall is improved.","In developing a reranking strategy, the 53,609 sentences of training data were split into a 41,992 sentence training portion, and a 11,617 sentence development set. The training portion was split into 5 sections, and in each case the maximum-entropy tagger was trained on 4/5 of the data, then used to decode the remaining 1/5. The top 20 hypotheses under a beam search, together with their log probabilities, were recovered for each training sentence. In a similar way, a model trained on the 41,992 sentence set was used to produce 20 hypotheses for each sentence in the development set."]},{"title":"3 Global features 3.1 The global-feature generator","paragraphs":["The module we describe in this section generates global features for each candidate tagged sequence. As input it takes a sentence, along with a proposed segmentation (i.e., an assignment of a tag for each word in the sentence). As output, it produces a set of feature strings. We will use the following tagged sentence as a running example in this section:","Whether/N you/N ’/N re/N an/N aging/N flower/N child/N or/N a/N clueless/N Gen/S Xer/C ,/N “/N The/S Day/C They/C Shot/C John/C Lennon/C ,/N ”/N playing/N at/N the/N Dougherty/S Arts/C Center/C ,/N entertains/N the/N imagination/N ./N","An example feature type is simply to list the full strings of entities that appear in the tagged input. In this example, this would give the three features WE=Gen Xer WE=The Day They Shot John Lennon WE=Dougherty Arts Center","Here WE stands for “whole entity”. Throughout this section, we will write the features in this format. The start of the feature string indicates the feature type (in this case WE), followed by =. Following the type, there are generally 1 or more words or other symbols, which we will separate with the symbol .","A seperate module in our implementation takes the strings produced by the global-feature generator, and hashes them to integers. For example, suppose the three strings WE=Gen Xer, WE=The Day They Shot John Lennon, WE=Dougherty Arts Center were hashed to 100, 250, and 500 respectively. Conceptually, the candidate","is represented by a large number of features","","","for"," where","is the","number of distinct feature strings in training data.","In this example, only","","",",  ","and","","","take the value  , all other features being zero. 3.2 Feature templates We now introduce some notation with which to describe the full set of global features.

The flag indicates whether or not the word appears in a dictionary of words which appeared more often lower-cased than capitalized in a large corpus of text. In our example, Animal appears in the lexicon, but G.M. does not, so the two values for","would be Aa1 and A.A.0 respectively.","In addition,  ","and","are all defined to be","NULL if  or ",".","Most of the features we describe are anchored on entity boundaries in the candidate segmentation.

The framework is derived by the transformation from ranking problems to a margin-based classification problem in (Freund et al. 1998). It is also related to the Markov Random Field methods for parsing suggested in (Johnson et al. 1999), and the boosting methods for parsing in (Collins 2000). We consider the following set-up:","","Training data is a set of example input/output pairs.

This section discusses why this is unlikely to be the case. The problem described here is closely related to the label bias problem described in (Lafferty et al. 2001).","One straightforward way to incorporate global features into the maximum-entropy model would be to introduce new features","","","which indicated whether the tagging decision","in the history","creates a particular global feature.
