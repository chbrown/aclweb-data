Acquisition of such a corpus is costly and time-consuming. This paper presents a method to reduce this demand using active learning, which selects what samples to annotate, instead of annotating blindly the whole training corpus. Sample selection for annotation is based upon representativeness and usefulness. A model-based distance is proposed to measure the difference of two sentences and their most likely parse trees. Based on this distance, the active learning process analyzes the sample distribution by clustering and calculates the density of each sample to quantify its representativeness. Further more, a sentence is deemed as useful if the existing model is highly uncertain about its parses, where uncertainty is measured by various entropy-based scores. Experiments are carried out in the shallow semantic parser of an air travel dialog system. Our result shows that for about the same parsing accuracy, we only need to annotate a third of the samples as compared to the usual random selection method."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["A prerequisite for building statistical parsers (Jelinek et al., 1994; Collins, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Charniak, 1997) is the availability of a (large) corpus of parsed sentences. Acquiring such a corpus is expensive and timeconsuming and is often the bottleneck to build a parser for a new application or domain. The goal of this study is to reduce the amount of annotated sentences (and hence the development time) required for a statistical parser to achieve a satisfactory performance using active learning.","Active learning has been studied in the context of many natural language processing (NLP) applications such as information extraction(Thompson et al., 1999), text classication(McCallum and Nigam, 1998) and natural language parsing(Thompson et al., 1999; Hwa, 2000), to name a few. The basic idea is to couple tightly knowledge acquisition, e.g., annotating sentences for parsing, with model-training, as opposed to treating them separately. In our setup, we assume that a small amount of annotated sentences is initially available, which is used to build a statistical parser. We also assume that there is a large corpus of unannotated sentences at our disposal this corpus is called active training set. A batch of samples1","is selected using algorithms developed here, and are annotated by human beings and are then added to training data to rebuild the model. The procedure is iterated until the model reaches a certain accuracy level.","Our efforts are devoted to two aspects: rst, we believe that the selected samples should reect the underly-ing distribution of the training corpus. In other words, the selected samples need to be representative. To this end, a model-based structural distance is dened to quantify how far two sentences are apart, and with the help of this distance, the active training set is clustered so that we can dene and compute the density of a sample; second, we propose and test several entropy-based measures to quantify the uncertainty of a sample in the active training set using an existing model, as it makes sense to ask human beings to annotate the portion of data for which the existing model is not doing well. Samples are selected from the clusters based on uncertainty scores.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a structural distance is rst dened based on the sequential representation of a parse tree. It is then straightforward to employ a k-means algorithm to cluster sentences in the active training set. Section 3 is devoted to condence measures, where three uncertainty measures are proposed. Active learning results on the shallow semantic parser of an air travel dialog system are presented 1 A sample means a sentence in this paper.

For our purpose, the distance ought to have the property that two sentences with similar structures have a small distance, even if they are lexically different. This leads us to dene the distance between two sentences based on their parse trees, which are obtained by applying an existing model to the active training set. However, computing the distance of two parse trees requires a digression of how they are represented in our parser. 2.1 Event Representation of Parse Trees A statistical parser computes","",", the probability of a parse","given a sentence",". Since the space of the entire parses is too large and cannot be modeled directly, a parse tree","is decomposed as a series of individual actions ",". In the parser (Jelinek et al., 1994) we used in this study, this is accomplished through a bottomup-left-most (BULM) derivation. In the BULM derivation, there are three types of parse actions: tag, label and extension. There is a corresponding vocabulary for tag or label, and there are four extension directions: RIGHT, LEFT, UP and UNIQUE. If a child node is the only node under a label, the child node is said to extend UNIQUE to its parent node; if there are multiple children under a parent node, the left-most child is said to extend RIGHT to the parent node, the right-most child node is said to extend LEFT to the parent node, while all the other in-termediate children are said to extend UP to their parent node. The BULM derivation can be best explained by an example in Figure 1.","1 3 5","7 11 13 (12) (16)","(9) (15)(2) (4) (17) (10) (14)(6) (8)"]},{"title":"wdwd city wd citycity LOC LOC S fly from new bostonyork to","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Serial decomposition of a parse tree as 17 parsing actions: tags (1,3,5,7,11,13) blue boxes, labels (9,15,17)green underlines, extensions (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16) red parentheses. Numbers indicate the order of actions.","The input sentence is fly from new york to boston. Numbers on its semantic parse tree indicate the order of parse actions while colors indicate types of actions: tags are numbered in blue boxes, extensions in red parentheses and labels in green underlines. For this example, the rst action is tagging the rst word fly given the sentence; the second action is extending the tag wd RIGHT, as the tag wd is the left-most child of the constituent S; and the third action is tagging the second word from given the sentence and the two proceeding actions, and so on and so forth.","We dene an event as a parse action together with its context. It is clear that the BULM derivation converts a parse tree into a unique sequence of parse events, and a valid event sequence corresponds to a unique parse tree. Therefore a parse tree can be equivalently represented by a sequence of events.

The three models (1) can be trained using decision trees (Jelinek et al., 1994; Breiman et al., 1984).","Note that raw context space","","","","","is too huge to store and manipulate efciently. In our implementation, contexts are internally represented as bitstrings through a set of pre-designed questions. Answers of each question are represented as bitstrings. To support questions like what is the previous word (or tag, label, extension)?, word, tag, label and extension vocabularies are all encoded as bitstrings. Words are encoded through an automatic clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992) while tags, labels and extensions are normally encoded using diagonal bits. An example can be found in (Luo et al., 2002).","In summary, a parse tree can be represented uniquely by a sequence of events, while each event can in turn be represented as a bitstring. With this in mind, we are now ready to dene a structural distance for two sentences given an existing model. 2.2 Sentence Distance","Recall that it is assumed that there is a statistical parser","trained with a small amount of annotated data.

The latter is a quite effective for dialog systems as a sentence is often seen more than once in the training corpus."]},{"title":"3 Uncertainty Measures","paragraphs":["Intuitively, we would like to select samples that the current model is not doing well. The current model’s uncertainty about a sentence could be because similar sentences are under-represented in the (annotated) training set, or similar sentences are intrinsically difcult. We take advantage of the availability of parsing scores from the existing statistical parser and propose three entropy-based uncertainty scores. 3.1 Change of Entropy After decision trees are grown, we can compute the entropy of each leaf node","as: ","    "," ","(10) where","sums over either tag, label or extension vocabulary, and "," is simply  ","","       , where ","","is the","count of","in leaf node",".

We would like to annotate these sentences. 3.2 Sentence Entropy Now let us consider another measurement which seeks to address the intrinsic difculty of a sentence. Intuitively, we can consider a sentence more difcult if there are potentially more parses. We calculate the entropy of the distribution over all candidate parses as the sentence entropy to measure the intrinsic ambiguity.","Given a sentence",", the existing model ","could gener-","ate the top","most likely parses","","","","",",","each","","having a probability  :"," ","","","","","","","","","","(13)","where","","is the","possible parse and","","is its associated","score.

This can be explained as follows: longer sentences tend to have more complex structures ( extension and labeling ) than shorter sentences. And the models for these complex structures are relatively less trained as compared with models for tagging. As a result, longer sentences would have higher change of entropy, in other words, larger impact on models.","As explained above, longer sentences also have larger sentence entropy. After normalizing, this trend is reversed in word entropy."]},{"title":"4 Experimental Results and Analysis","paragraphs":["All experiments are done with a shallow semantic parser (a.k.a. classer (Davies et al, 1999)) of the natural language understanding part in DARPA Communicator (DARPA Communicator Website, 2000).

It is remarkable to notice that active learning can use far less samples ( usually less than one third ) to achieve the same level of performance of random selection.

(Thompson et al., 1999) uses active learning to acquire a shift-reduce parser, and the uncertainty of an unparseable sentence is dened as the number of operators applied successfully divided by the number of words. It is more natural to dene uncertainty scores in our study because of the availbility of parse scores. (Hwa, 2000; Hwa, 2001) is related closely to our work in that both use entropy-based uncertainty scores, but Hwa does not characterize the distribution of sample space. Knowing the distribution of sample space is important since uncertainty measure, if used alone for sample selection, will be likely to select outliers. (Stolcke, 1998) used an entropy-based criterion to reduce the size of backoff n-gram language models.","The major contribution of this paper is that a model-based distance measure is proposed and used in active learning. The distance measures structural difference of two sentences relative to an existing model. Similar idea is also exploited in (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) where authors use the divergence between the unigram word distributions of two documents to measure their difference. This distance enables us to cluster the active training set and a sample is then selected and weighted based on both its uncertainty score and its density. (Sarkar, 2001) applied co-training to statistical parsing, where two component models are trained and the most condent parsing outputs of the existing model are incorporated into the next training. This is a different venue for reduc-ing annotation work in that the current model output is directly used and no human annotation is assumed. (Luo et al., 1999; Luo, 2000) also aimed to making use of unlabeled data to improve statistical parsers by transforming model parameters."]},{"title":"6 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have examined three entropy-based uncertainty scores to measure the usefulness of a sample to improving a statistical model. We also dene a distance for sentences of natural languages. Based on this distance, we are able to quantify concepts such as sentence density and homogeneity of a corpus. Sentence clustering algorithms are also developed with the help of these concepts. Armed with uncertainty scores and sentence clusters, we have developed sample selection algorithms which has achieved signicant savings in terms of labeling cost: we have shown that we can use one-third of training data of random selection and reach the same level of parsing accuracy.","While we have shown the importance of both condence score and modeling the distribution of sample space, it is not clear whether or not it is the best way to combine or reconcile the two. It would be nice to have a single number to rank candidate sentences. We also want to test the algorithms developed here on other domains (e.g., Wall Street Journal corpus). Improving speed of sentence clustering is also worthwhile."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["We thank Kishore Papineni and Todd Ward for many useful discussions.
