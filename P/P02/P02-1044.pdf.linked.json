Bilingual Bootstrapping makes use of in learning a small number of classified data and a large number of unclassified data in the source and the target languages in translation.

For instance, we are concerned with an ambiguous word in English (e.g., ‘plant’), which has multiple translations in Chinese (e.g., ‘ (gongchang)’ and ‘ (zhiwu)’). Our goal is to determine the correct Chinese translation of the ambiguous English word, given an English sentence which contains the word. Word translation disambiguation is actually a special case of word sense disambiguation (in the example above, ‘gongchang’ corresponds to the sense of ‘factory’ and ‘zhiwu’ corresponds to the sense of ‘vegetation’).1","  Yarowsky (1995) proposes a method for word sense (translation) disambiguation that is based on a bootstrapping technique, which we refer to here as ‘Monolingual Bootstrapping (MB)’.  In this paper, we propose a new method for word translation disambiguation using a bootstrapping technique we have developed. We refer to the technique as ‘Bilingual Bootstrapping (BB)’.  In order to evaluate the performance of BB, we conducted some experiments on word translation disambiguation using the BB technique and the MB technique. All of the results indicate that BB consistently and significantly outperforms MB."]},{"title":"2 Related Work","paragraphs":["The problem of word translation disambiguation (in general, word sense disambiguation) can be viewed as that of classification and can be addressed by employing a supervised learning method. In such a learning method, for instance, an English sentence containing an ambiguous English word corresponds to an example, and the Chinese translation of the word under the context corresponds to a classification decision (a label).  Many methods for word sense disambiguation using a supervised learning technique have been proposed. They include those using Naïve Bayes (Gale et al. 1992a), Decision List (Yarowsky 1994), Nearest Neighbor (Ng and Lee 1996), Transformation Based Learning (Mangu and Brill 1997), Neural Network (Towell and  1 In this paper, we take English-Chinese translation as example; it is a relatively easy process, however, to extend the discussions to translations between other language pairs. Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 343-351. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Voorhess 1998), Winnow (Golding and Roth 1999), Boosting (Escudero et al. 2000), and Naïve Bayesian Ensemble (Pedersen 2000). Among these methods, the one using Naïve Bayesian Ensemble (i.e., an ensemble of Naïve Bayesian Classifiers) is reported to perform the best for word sense disambiguation with respect to a benchmark data set (Pedersen 2000).  The assumption behind the proposed methods is that it is nearly always possible to determine the translation of a word by referring to its context, and thus all of the methods actually manage to build a classifier (i.e., a classification program) using features representing context information (e.g., co-occurring words).  Since preparing supervised learning data is expensive (in many cases, manually labeling data is required), it is desirable to develop a bootstrapping method that starts learning with a small number of classified data but is still able to achieve high performance under the help of a large number of unclassified data which is not expensive anyway.  Yarowsky (1995) proposes a method for word sense disambiguation, which is based on Monolingual Bootstrapping. When applied to our current task, his method starts learning with a small number of English sentences which contain an ambiguous English word and which are respectively assigned with the correct Chinese translations of the word. It then uses the classified sentences as training data to learn a classifier (e.g., a decision list) and uses the constructed classifier to classify some unclassified sentences containing the ambiguous word as additional training data. It also adopts the heuristics of ‘one sense per discourse’ (Gale et al. 1992b) to further classify unclassified sentences. By repeating the above processes, it can create an accurate classifier for word translation disambiguation.  For other related work, see, for example, (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994; Pedersen and Bruce 1997; Schutze 1998; Kikui 1999; Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999)."]},{"title":"3 Bilingual Bootstrapping 3.1 Overview","paragraphs":["Instead of using Monolingual Bootstrapping, we propose a new method for word translation disambiguation using Bilingual Bootstrapping. In translation from English to Chinese, for instance, BB makes use of not only unclassified data in English, but also unclassified data in Chinese. It also uses a small number of classified data in English and, optionally, a small number of classified data in Chinese. The data in English and in Chinese are supposed to be not in parallel but from the same domain.  BB constructs classifiers for English to Chinese translation disambiguation by repeating the following two steps: (1) constructing classifiers for each of the languages on the basis of the classified data in both languages, (2) using the constructed classifiers in each of the languages to classify some unclassified data and adding them to the classified training data set of the language. The reason that we can use classified data in both languages at step (1) is that words in one language generally have translations in the other and we can find their translation relationship by using a dictionary."]},{"title":"3.2 Algorithm","paragraphs":["Let E denote a set of words in English, C a set of words in Chinese, and T a set of links in a translation dictionary as shown in Figure 1.

Since A and D are equivalent to each other, we can ‘translate’ the examples with D and use them to boost the performance of classification to A. This is because the misclassified examples (crosses) with D are those mistakenly classified from C and they will not have much negative effect on classification to A, even though the translation from Chinese into English can introduce some noises. Similar explanations can be stated to other classification decisions.

The variant of BB has four modifications.  (1) It actually employs an ensemble of the Naïve Bayesian Classifiers (NBC), because an ensemble of NBCs generally performs better than a single NBC (Pedersen 2000). In an ensemble, it creates different NBCs using as data the words within different window sizes surrounding the word to be disambiguated (e.g., ‘plant’ or ‘zhiwu’) and further constructs a new classifier by linearly combining the NBCs.  (2) It employs the heuristics of ‘one sense per discourse’ (cf., Yarowsky 1995) after using an ensemble of NBCs.  (3) It uses only classified data in English at the beginning.  (4) It individually resolves ambiguities on selected English words such as ‘plant’, ‘interest’.

Each of the seed words was then used as a classified ‘sentence’. This way of creating classified data is similar to that in (Yarowsky, 1995). As unclassified data in English, we collected sentences in news articles from a web site (www.news.com), and as unclassified data in Chinese, we collected sentences in news articles from another web site (news.cn.tom.com). We observed that the distribution of translations in the unclassified data was balanced.  Table 2 shows the sizes of the data. Note that there are in general more unclassified sentences in Chinese than in English because an English word usually has several Chinese words as translations (cf., Figure 5).  As a translation dictionary, we used the HIT dictionary, which contains about 76000 Chinese words, 60000 English words, and 118000 links.  We then used the data to conduct translation disambiguation with BB, MB-B, and MB-D, as described in Section 5.  For both BB and MB-B, we used an ensemble of five Naïve Bayesian Classifiers with the window sizes being ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±9 words. For both BB and MB-B, we set the parameters of β, b, and θ to 0.2, 15, and 1.5 respectively. The parameters were tuned based on our preliminary experimental results on MB-B, they were not tuned, however, for BB. For the BB specific parameter α, we set it to 0.4, which meant that we treated the information from English and that from Chinese equally.  Table 3 shows the translation disambiguation accuracies of the three methods as well as that of a baseline method in which we always choose the major translation. Figures 6 and 7 show the learning curves of MB-D, MB-B, and BB. Figure 8 shows the accuracies of BB with different α values.  From the results, we see that BB consistently and significantly outperforms both MB-D and MB-B. The results from the sign test are statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).  Table 4 shows the results achieved by some existing supervised learning methods with respect to the benchmark data (cf., Pedersen 2000).
