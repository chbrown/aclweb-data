For example, the hypothetical extractive summary of Text (1), which is shown in Table 1, can be compacted further by deleting the clause “which is already almost enough to win”. Headline-based summaries, such as that shown in Table 1, are usually indicative of a text’s content but not informative, grammatical, or coherent. By repeatedly applying a sentence-simplification algorithm one sentence at a time, one can compress a text; yet, the outputs generated in this way are likely to be incoherent and to contain unimportant information. When summarizing text, some sentences should be dropped altogether.","Ideally, we would like to build systems that have the strengths of all these three classes of approaches. The “Document Compression” entry in Table 1 shows a grammatical, coherent summary of Text (1), which was generated by a hypothetical document compression system that preserves the most important information in a text while deleting sentences, phrases, and words that are subsidiary to the main message of the text. Obviously, generating coherent, grammatical summaries such as that produced by the hypothetical document compression system in Table 1 is not trivial because of many conflicting Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 449-456.

Given a document",", our goal is to produce a new document","by “dropping” words","from",". In order to achieve this goal, we","1","A number of other systems use the outputs of extractive summarizers and repair them to improve coherence (DUC, 2001; DUC, 2002). Unfortunately, none of these seems flexible enough to produce in one shot good summaries that are simultaneously coherent and grammatical. extent the noisy-channel model proposed by Knight & Marcu (2000). Their system compressed sentences by dropping syntactic constituents, but could be applied to entire documents only on a sentence-by-sentence basis. As discussed in Section 1, this is not adequate because the resulting summary may contain many compressed sentences that are irrelevant. In order to extend Knight & Marcu’s approach beyond the sentence level, we need to “glue” sentences together in a tree structure similar to that used at the sentence level. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) provides us this “glue.”","The tree in Figure 1 depicts the RST structure of Text (1). In RST, discourse structures are nonbinary trees whose leaves correspond to elementary discourse units (EDUs), and whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans. Each internal node in an RST tree is characterized by a rhetorical relation. For example, the first sentence in Text (1) provides BACKGROUND information for interpreting the information in sentences 2 and 3, which are in a CONTRAST relation (see Figure 1). Each relation holds between two adjacent non-overlapping text spans called NUCLEUS and SATELLITE. (There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as LIST and CONTRAST, are multinuclear.) The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer’s purpose than the satellite.","Our system is able to analyze both the discourse structure of a document and the syntactic structure of each of its sentences or EDUs. It then compresses the document by dropping either syntactic or discourse constituents."]},{"title":"3 A Noisy-Channel Model","paragraphs":["For a given document",", we want to find the summary text","that maximizes",". Using Bayes rule, we flip this so we end up maximizing ",". Thus, we are left with modelling two probability distributions:",", the probability of a document","given a summary",", and",", the probability of a summary. We assume that we are given the discourse structure of each document and the syntactic structures of each of its EDUs.","The intuitive way of thinking about this application of Bayes rule, reffered to as the noisy-channel model, is that we start with a summary","and add “noise” to it, yielding a longer document",". The noise added in our model consists of words, phrases and discourse units.","For instance, given the document “John Doe has secured the vote of most democrats.” we could add words to it (namely the word “already”) to generate “John Doe has already secured the vote of most democrats.” We could also choose to add an entire syntactic constituent, for instance a prepositional phrase, to generate “John Doe has secured the vote of most democrats in his constituency.” These are both examples of sentence expansion as used previously by Knight & Marcu (2000).","Our system, however, also has the ability to expand on a core message by adding discourse constituents. For instance, it could decide to add another discourse constituent to the original summary “John Doe has secured the vote of most democrats” by CONTRASTing the information in the summary with the uncertainty regarding the support of the governor, thus yielding the text: “John Doe has secured the vote of most democrats. But without the support of the governor, he is still on shaky ground.”","As in any noisy-channel application, there are three parts that we have to account for if we are to build a complete document compression system: the channel model, the source model and the decoder. We describe each of these below.","The source model assigns to a string the probability",", the probability that the summary is good English. Ideally, the source model should disfavor ungrammatical sentences and documents containing incoherently juxtaposed sentences.","The channel model assigns to any document/summary pair a probability",".

Each of these parts is described below. 3.1 Source model The job of the source model is to assign a score ","to a compression independent of the original document. That is, the source model should measure how good English a summary is (independent of whether it is a good compression or not). Currently, we use a bigram measure of quality (trigram scores were also tested but failed to make a difference), combined with non-lexicalized context-free syntactic probabilities and context-free discourse probabilities, giving"," ",". It would be better to use a lexicalized context free grammar, but that was not possible given the decoder used. 3.2 Channel model The channel model is allowed to add syntactic constituents (through a stochastic operation called constituent-expand) or discourse units (through another stochastic operation called EDU-expand). Both of these operations are performed on a combined discourse/syntax tree called the DS-tree. The DS-tree for Text (1) is shown in Figure 1 for reference.","Suppose we start with the summary","“The mayor is looking for re-election.” A constituent-     S NPB DT NN VP VBZ ADVP RB VP−A VBG PP NPB NN PUNC.

A constituent-expand operation could also add single words: for instance the word “now” could be added between “is” and “looking,” yielding ","“The mayor is now looking for re-election.” The probability of inserting this word is based on the syntactic structure of the node into which it’s in-serted.","Knight and Marcu (2000) describe in detail a noisy-channel model that explains how short sentences can be expanded into longer ones by inserting and expanding syntactic constituents (and words). Since our constituent-expand stochastic operation simply reimplements Knight and Marcu’s model, we do not focus on them here. We refer the reader to (Knight and Marcu, 2000) for the details.","In addition to adding syntactic constituents, our system is also able to add discourse units. Consider the summary","“John Doe has already secured the vote of most democrats in his consituency.” Through a sequence of discourse expansions, we can expand upon this summary to reach the original text. A complete discourse expansion process that would occur starting from this initial summary to generate the original document is shown in Figure 2.","In this figure, we can follow the sequence of steps required to generate our original text, beginning with our summary",".

From this corpus, we were able to estimate parameters for a discourse PCFG using standard maximum likelihood methods.","Furthermore, 150 document from the same corpus are paired with extractive summaries on the EDU level. Human annotators were asked which EDUs were most important; suppose in the example DS-tree (Figure 1) the annotators marked the second and fifth EDUs (the starred ones). These stars are propagated up, so that any discourse unit that has a descendent considered important is also considered important. From these annotations, we could deduce that, to compress a NUC=CONTRAST that has two children, NUC=SPAN and SAT=EVALUATION, we can drop the evaluation satellite. Similarly, we can compress a NUC=CONTRAST that has two children, SAT=CONDITION and NUC=SPAN by dropping the first discourse constituent. Finally, we can compress the ROOT deriving into SAT=BACKGROUND NUC=SPAN by dropping the SAT=BACKGROUND constituent. We keep counts of each of these examples and, once collected, we normalize them to get the discourse expansion probabilities. 3.3 Decoder","The goal of the decoder is to combine","with","","to get",". There are a vast number","of potential compressions of a large DS-tree, but we can efficiently pack them into a shared-forest structure, as described in detail by Knight & Marcu (2000). Each entry in the shared-forest structure has three associated probabilities, one from the source syntax PCFG, one from the source discourse PCFG and one from the expansion-template probabilities described in Section 3.2. Once we have generated a forest representing all possible compressions of the original document, we want to extract the best (or the","-best) trees, taking into account both the expansion probabilities of the channel model and the bigram and syntax and discourse PCFG probabilities of the source model. Thankfully, such a generic extractor has already been built (Langkilde, 2000). For our purposes, the extractor selects the trees with the best combination of LM and expansion scores after performing an exhaustive search over all possible summaries. It returns a list of such trees, one for each possible length."]},{"title":"4 System","paragraphs":["The system developed works in a pipelined fash-","ion as shown in Figure 3.

The syntax trees of the EDUs are then merged with the discourse tree in the forest generator to create a DS-tree similar to that shown in Figure 1. From this DS-tree we generate a forest that subsumes all possible compressions. This forest is then passed on to the forest ranking system which is used as decoder (Langkilde, 2000). The decoder gives us a list of possible compressions, for each possible length. Example compressions of Text (1) are shown in Figure 4 together with their respective log-probabilities.","In order to choose the “best” compression at any possible length, we cannot rely only on the log-probabilities, lest the system always choose the shortest possible compression. In order to compensate for this, we normalize by length. However, in practice, simply dividing the log-probability by the length of the compression is insufficient for longer documents. Experimentally, we found a reasonable metric was to, for a compression of length",", divide each log-probability by  ",". This was the job of the length chooser from Figure 3, and enabled us to choose a single compression for each document, which was used for evaluation.

Six human evaluators rated the systems according to three metrics. The first two, presented together to the evaluators, were grammaticality and coherence; the third, presented separately, was summary quality. Grammaticality was a judgment of how good the English of the compressions were; coherence included how well the compression flowed (for instance, anaphors lacking an antecedent would lower coherence). Summary quality, on the other hand, was a judgment of how well the compression re-tained the meaning of the original document. Each measure was rated on a scale from","(worst) to (best).","We can draw several conclusions from the evaluation results shown in Table 2 along with average compression rate (Cmp, the length of the compressed document divided by the original length).5 First, it is clear that genre influences the results. Because the Mitre data contained mostly short sentences, the syntax and discourse parsers made fewer errors, which allowed for better compressions to be generated. For the Mitre corpus, compressions obtained starting from discourse trees built above the sentence level were better than compressions obtained starting from discourse trees built above the EDU level. For the WSJ corpus, compression obtained starting from discourse trees built above the sentence level were more grammatical, but less coherent than compressions obtained starting from discourse trees built above the EDU level. Choosing the manner in which the discourse and syntactic representations of texts are mixed should be influenced by the genre of the texts one is interested to compress. 5","We did not run the system on the MITRE data with perfect discourse trees because we did not have hand-built discourse trees for this corpus.","WSJ Mitre","Cmp Grm Coh Qual Cmp Grm Coh Qual","Random 0.51 1.60 1.58 2.13 0.47 1.43 1.77 1.80 Concat 0.44 3.30 2.98 2.70 0.42 2.87 2.50 2.08 EDU 0.49 3.36 3.33 3.03 0.47 3.40 3.30 2.60 Sent 0.47 3.45 3.16 2.88 0.44 4.27 3.63 3.36","PD-EDU 0.47 3.61 3.23 2.95","PD-Sent 0.48 3.96 3.65 2.84 Hand 0.59 4.65 4.48 4.53 0.46 4.97 4.80 4.52 Table 2: Evaluation Results","The compressions obtained starting from perfectly derived discourse trees indicate that perfect discourse structures help greatly in improving coherence and grammaticality of generated summaries. It was surprising to see that the summary quality was affected negatively by the use of perfect discourse structures (although not statistically significant). We believe this happened because the text fragments we summarized were extracted from longer documents. It is likely that had the discourse structures been built specifically for these short text snippets, they would have been different. Moreover, there was no component designed to handle cohesion; thus it is to be expected that many compressions would contain dangling references.","Overall, all our systems outperformed both the Random baseline and the Concat systems, which empirically show that discourse has an important role in document summarization. We performed","- tests on the results and found that on the Wall Street Journal data, the differences in score between the Concat and Sent systems for grammaticality and coherence were statistically significant at the 95% level, but the difference in score for summary quality was not.

An error that our system makes often is that of dropping complements that cannot be dropped, such as the phrase “for re-election”, which is the complement of “is looking”. We are currently experimenting with lexicalized models of syntax that would prevent our compression system from dropping required verb arguments. We also consider methods for scaling up the decoder to handling documents of more realistic length."]},{"title":"Acknoledgements","paragraphs":["This work was partially supported by DARPA-ITO grant N66001-00-1-9814, NSF grant IIS-0097846, and a USC Dean Fellowship to Hal Daume III.
