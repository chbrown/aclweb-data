Existing algorithms for parsing and estimation require the enumeration of all of the parses of a string in order to determine the most likely one, or in order to calculate the statistics needed to estimate a grammar from a training corpus. This paper describes a graph-based dynamic programming algorithm for calculating these statistics from the packed UBG parse representations of Maxwell and Kaplan (1995) which does not require enumerating all parses. Like many graphical algorithms, the dynamic programming algorithm’s complexity is worst-case exponential, but is often polynomial. The key observation is that by using Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations, the required statistics can be rewritten as either the max or the sum of a product of functions. This is exactly the kind of problem which can be solved by dynamic programming over graphical models.","","We would like to thank Eugene Charniak, Miyao Yusuke, Mark Steedman as well as Stefan Riezler and the team at PARC; naturally all errors remain our own.

These grammars can incorporate virtually all kinds of linguistically important constraints (including non-local and non-context-free constraints), and are equipped with a statistically sound framework for estimation and learning.","Abney (1997) pointed out that the non-context-free dependencies of a unication grammar require stochastic models more general than Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) and Markov Branching Processes, and proposed the use of log-linear models for dening probability distributions over the parses of a unication grammar. Unfortunately, the maximum likelihood estimator Abney proposed for SUBGs seems computationally in-tractable since it requires statistics that depend on the set of all parses of all strings generated by the grammar. This set is innite (so exhaustive enumeration is impossible) and presumably has a very complex structure (so sampling estimates might take an extremely long time to converge).","Johnson et al. (1999) observed that parsing and related tasks only require conditional distributions over parses given strings, and that such conditional distributions are considerably easier to estimate than joint distributions of strings and their parses. The conditional maximum likelihood estimator proposed by Johnson et al. requires statistics that depend on the set of all parses of the strings in the training cor-Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 279-286. Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for pus. For most linguistically realistic grammars this set is nite, and for moderate sized grammars and training corpora this estimation procedure is quite feasible.","However, our recent experiments involve training from the Wall Street Journal Penn Tree-bank, and repeatedly enumerating the parses of its 50,000 sentences is quite time-consuming. Matters are only made worse because we have moved some of the constraints in the grammar from the unication component to the stochastic component. This broadens the coverage of the grammar, but at the expense of massively expanding the number of possible parses of each sentence.","In the mid-1990s unication-based parsers were developed that do not enumerate all parses of a string but instead manipulate and return a packed representation of the set of parses. This paper describes how to nd the most probable parse and the statistics required for estimating a SUBG from the packed parse set representations proposed by Maxwell III and Kaplan (1995). This makes it possible to avoid explicitly enumerating the parses of the strings in the training corpus.","The methods proposed here are analogues of the well-known dynamic programming algorithms for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs); specically the Viterbi algorithm for nding the most probable parse of a string, and the Inside-Outside algorithm for estimating a PCFG from un-parsed training data.1","In fact, because Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations are just Truth Maintenance System (TMS) representations (Forbus and de Kleer, 1993), the statistical techniques described here should extend to non-linguistic applications of TMSs as well.","Dynamic programming techniques have been applied to log-linear models before. Lafferty et al. (2001) mention that dynamic programming can be used to compute the statistics required for conditional estimation of log-linear models based on context-free grammars where the properties can include arbitrary functions of the input string. Miyao and Tsujii (2002) (which","1","However, because we use conditional estimation, also known as discriminative training, we require at least some discriminating information about the correct parse of a string in order to estimate a stochastic unication grammar. appeared after this paper was accepted) is the closest related work we know of. They describe a technique for calculating the statistics required to estimate a log-linear parsing model with non-local properties from packed feature forests.","The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section describes unication grammars and Maxwell and Kaplan packed representation. The following section reviews stochastic unication grammars (Abney, 1997) and the statistical quantities required for efciently estimating such grammars from parsed training data (Johnson et al., 1999). The nal substantive section of this paper shows how these quantities can be dened directly in terms of the Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations.","The notation used in this paper is as follows. Variables are written in upper case italic, e.g., X; Y , etc., the sets they range over are written in script, e.g., X ; Y, etc., while specic values are written in lower case italic, e.g., x; y, etc. In the case of vector-valued entities, subscripts indicate particular components."]},{"title":"2 Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations","paragraphs":["This section characterises the properties of unication grammars and the Maxwell and Kaplan packed parse representations that will be important for what follows. This characterisation omits many details about unication grammars and the algorithm by which the packed representations are actually constructed; see Maxwell III and Kaplan (1995) for details.","A parse generated by a unication grammar is a nite subset of a set F of features. Features are parse fragments, e.g., chart edges or arcs from attribute-value structures, out of which the packed representations are constructed. For this paper it does not matter exactly what features are, but they are intended to be the atomic entities manipulated by a dynamic programming parsing algorithm. A grammar denes a set of well-formed or grammatical parses. Each parse ! 2 is associated with a string of words Y (!) called its yield. Note that except for trivial grammars F and are innite.","If y is a string, then let ( y) = f! 2 jY (!) = yg and F (y) = S !2( y)ff 2 !g. That is, ( y) is the set of parses of a string y and F (y) is the set of features appearing in the parses of y. In the grammars of interest here ( y) and hence also F (y) are nite.","Maxwell and Kaplan’s packed representations often provide a more compact representation of the set of parses of a sentence than would be obtained by merely listing each parse separately. The intuition behind these packed representations is that for most strings y, many of the features in F (y) occur in many of the parses ( y). This is often the case in natural language, since the same substructure can appear as a component of many different parses.","Packed feature representations are dened in terms of conditions on the values assigned to a vector of variables X. These variables have no direct linguistic interpretation; rather, each different assignment of values to these variables identies a set of features which constitutes one of the parses in the packed representation. A condition a on X is a function from X to f0; 1g. While for uniformity we write conditions as functions on the entire vector X, in practice Maxwell and Kaplan’s approach produces conditions whose value depends only on a few of the variables in X, and the efciency of the algorithms described here depends on this.","A packed representation of a nite set of parses is a quadruple R = (F 0","; X; N; ), where:","F 0 F (y) is a nite set of features,","X is a nite vector of variables, where each variable X‘ ranges over the nite set X‘,","N is a nite set of conditions on X called the no-goods,2","and","is a function that maps each feature f 2 F 0 to a condition f on X.","A vector of values x satises the no-goods N iff N (x) = 1, where N (x) = Q","2N (x). Each x","that satises the no-goods identies a parse !(x) =","ff 2 F 0","j","f (x) = 1g, i.e., ! is the set of features whose conditions are satised by x. We require that each parse be identied by a unique value satisfying 2","The name no-good comes from the TMS literature, and was used by Maxwell and Kaplan. However, here the no-goods actually identify the good variable assignments. the no-goods. That is, we require that:","8x; x0","2 X if N (x) = N (x0",") = 1 and","!(x) = !(x0",") then x = x0","(1) Finally, a packed representation R represents the set of parses ( R) that are identied by values that satisfy the no-goods, i.e., ( R) = f!(x)jx 2 X ; N (x) = 1g:","Maxwell III and Kaplan (1995) describes a parsing algorithm for unication-based grammars that takes as input a string y and returns a packed representation R such that ( R) = ( y), i.e., R represents the set of parses of the string y.

For a more detailed exposition and descriptions of regularization and other important details, see Johnson et al. (1999).","The probability distribution over parses is dened in terms of a nite vector g = (g1; : : : ; gm) of properties. A property is a real-valued function of parses . Johnson et al. (1999) placed no restric-tions on what functions could be properties, permitting properties to encode arbitrary global information about a parse. However, the dynamic programming algorithms presented here require the information encoded in properties to be local with respect to the features F used in the packed parse representation. Specically, we require that properties be dened on features rather than parses, i.e., each feature f 2 F is associated with a nite vector of real values (g1(f ); : : : ; gm(f )) which dene the property functions for parses as follows: gk(!) = X f2! gk(f ); for k = 1 : : : m: (2) That is, the property values of a parse are the sum of the property values of its features. In the usual case, some features will be associated with a single property (i.e., gk(f ) is equal to 1 for a specic value of k and 0 otherwise), and other features will be associated with no properties at all (i.e., g(f ) = 0).","This requires properties be very local with respect to features, which means that we give up the ability to dene properties arbitrarily. Note how-ever that we can still encode essentially arbitrary linguistic information in properties by adding specialised features to the underlying unication grammar. For example, suppose we want a property that indicates whether the parse contains a reduced relative clauses headed by a past participle (such garden path constructions are grammatical but often almost incomprehensible, and alternative parses not including such constructions would probably be preferred). Under the current denition of properties, we can introduce such a property by modifying the underlying unication grammar to produce a certain diacritic feature in a parse just in case the parse actually contains the appropriate reduced relative construction. Thus, while properties are required to be local relative to features, we can use the ability of the underlying unication grammar to encode essentially arbitrary non-local information in features to introduce properties that also encode non-local information.","A Stochastic Unication-Based Grammar is a triple (U; g; ), where U is a unication grammar that denes a set of parses as described above, g = (g1; : : : ; gm) is a vector of property functions as just described, and = ( 1; : : : ; m) is a vector of non-negative real-valued parameters called property weights. The probability P (!) of a parse ! 2 is: P (!) =","W (!) Z ; where: W (!) = mY j=1  gj(!) j ; and Z = X","!0 2","W (!0 ) Intuitively, if gj(!) is the number of times that property j occurs in ! then j is the ‘weight’ or ‘cost’ of each occurrence of property j and Z is a normalising constant that ensures that the probability of all parses sums to 1.","Now we discuss the calculation of several important quantities for SUBGs. In each case we show that the quantity can be expressed as the value that maximises a product of functions or else as the sum of a product of functions, each of which depends on a small subset of the variables X. These are the kinds of quantities for which dynamic programming graphical model algorithms have been developed. 3.1 The most probable parse In parsing applications it is important to be able to extract the most probable (or MAP) parse !̂(y) of string y with respect to a SUBG. This parse is:","!̂(y) = argmax !2( y) W (!) Given a packed representation (F 0","; X; N; ) for the parses ( y), let x̂(y) be the x that identies !̂(y). Since W (!̂(y)) > 0, it can be shown that:","x̂(y) = argmax x2X N (x) mY j=1  gj(!(x)) j","= argmax x2X N (x) mY j=1 ","P f2!(x) gj(f) j","= argmax x2X N (x) mY j=1 ","P f2F0 f (x)gj(f) j","= argmax x2X N (x) mY j=1 Y f2F0  f (x)gj(f) j","= argmax x2X N (x) Y f2F0 0 @ mY j=1  gj(f) j 1 A f (x)","= argmax x2X Y 2N (x) Y f2F0 h ;f (x) (3) where h ;f (x) =","Qm j=1","gj(f)","j if f (x) = 1 and h ;f (x) = 1 if f (x) = 0. Note that h ;f (x) depends on exactly the same variables in X as f does. As (3) makes clear, nding x̂(y) involves maximising a product of functions where each function depends on a subset of the variables X. As explained below, this is exactly the kind of maximisation that can be solved using graphical model techniques. 3.2 Conditional likelihood We now turn to the estimation of the property weights from a training corpus of parsed data D = (!1; : : : ; !n). As explained in Johnson et al. (1999), one way to do this is to nd the that maximises the conditional likelihood of the training corpus parses given their yields. (Johnson et al. actually maximise conditional likelihood regularized with a Gaussian prior, but for simplicity we ignore this here). If yi is the yield of the parse !i, the conditional likelihood of the parses given their yields is: LD( ) = nY i=1 W (!i) Z (( yi)) where ( y) is the set of parses with yield y and: Z (S) = X !2S W (!): Then the maximum conditional likelihood estimate ̂of is ̂= argmax","LD( ).","Now calculating W (!i) poses no computational problems, but since ( yi) (the set of parses for yi) can be large, calculating Z (( yi)) by enumerating each ! 2 ( yi) can be computationally expensive.","However, there is an alternative method for calculating Z (( yi)) that does not involve this enumeration. As noted above, for each yield yi; i = 1; : : : ; n, Maxwell’s parsing algorithm returns a packed feature structure Ri that represents the parses of yi, i.e., ( yi) = ( Ri). A derivation parallel to the one for (3) shows that for R = (F 0","; X; N; ): Z (( R)) = X x2X Y 2N (x) Y f2F0 h ;f (x) (4) (This derivation relies on the isomorphism between parses and variable assignments in (1)). It turns out that this type of sum can also be calculated using graphical model techniques. 3.3 Conditional Expectations In general, iterative numerical procedures are required to nd the property weights that maximise the conditional likelihood LD( ). While there are a number of different techniques that can be used, all of the efcient techniques require the calculation of conditional expectations E [gkjyi] for each property gk and each sentence yi in the training corpus, where: E [gjy] = X !2( y) g(!)P (!jy) =","P !2( y) g(!)W (!) Z (( y))","For example, the Conjugate Gradient algorithm, which was used by Johnson et al., requires the calculation not just of LD( ) but also its derivatives @LD( )=@ k. It is straight-forward to show:","@LD( ) @ k =","LD( ) k nX i=1 (gk(!i) E [gkjyi]) : We have just described the calculation of LD( ), so if we can calculate E [gkjyi] then we can calculate the partial derivatives required by the Conjugate Gradient algorithm as well.","Again, let R = (F 0","; X; N; ) be a packed representation such that ( R) = ( yi). First, note that (2) implies that: E [gkjyi] = X f2F0 gk(f ) P(f! : f 2 !gjyi): Note that P(f! : f 2 !gjyi) involves the sum of weights over all x 2 X subject to the conditions that N (x) = 1 and f (x) = 1. Thus P(f! : f 2 !gjyi) can also be expressed in a form that is easy to evaluate using graphical techniques. Z (( R))P (f! : f 2 !gjyi) = X x2X f (x) Y 2N (x) Y f0 2F0 h ;f0(x) (5)"]},{"title":"4 Graphical model calculations","paragraphs":["In this section we briey review graphical model algorithms for maximising and summing products of functions of the kind presented above. It turns out that the algorithm for maximisation is a generalisation of the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs, and the algorithm for computing the summation in (5) is a generalisation of the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs (Smyth et al., 1997). Viewed abstractly, these algorithms simplify these expressions by moving common factors over the max or sum operators respectively. These techniques are now relatively standard; the most well-known approach involves junction trees (Pearl, 1988; Cowell, 1999). We adopt the approach approach described by Geman and Kochanek (2000), which is a straightforward generalization of HMM dynamic programming with minimal assumptions and programming overhead. However, in principle any of the graphical model computational algorithms can be used.","The quantities (3), (4) and (5) involve maximisation or summation over a product of functions, each of which depends only on the values of a subset of the variables X. There are dynamic programming algorithms for calculating all of these quantities, but for reasons of space we only describe an algorithm for nding the maximum value of a product of functions. These graph algorithms are rather involved. It may be easier to follow if one reads Example 1 before or in parallel with the denitions below.","To explain the algorithm we use the following notation. If x and x0","are both vectors of length m then x =j x0","iff x and x0","disagree on at most their jth components, i.e., xk = x0","k for k = 1; : : : ; j 1; j + 1; : : : m.

That is, Xj 2 d(f ) iff changing the value of Xj can change the value of f .","The algorithm relies on the fact that the variables in X = (X1; : : : ; Xn) are ordered (e.g., X1 precedes X2, etc.), and while the algorithm is correct for any variable ordering, its efciency may vary dramatically depending on the ordering as described below. Let H be any set of functions whose do-mains are X. We partition H into disjoint subsets H1; : : : ; Hn+1, where Hj is the subset of H that depend on Xj but do not depend on any variables ordered before Xj, and Hn+1 is the subset of H that do not depend on any variables at all (i.e., they are constants).3","That is, H","j = fH 2 HjXj 2 d(H); 8i < j Xi 62 d(H)g and Hn+1 = fH 2 Hjd(H) = ;g.","As explained in section 3.1, there is a set of functions A such that the quantities we need to calculate have the general form:","Mmax = max x2X Y A2A A(x) (6)","x̂ = argmax x2X Y A2A A(x): (7) Mmax is the maximum value of the product expression while x̂ is the value of the variables at which the maximum occurs. In a SUBG parsing application x̂ identies the MAP parse.","3","Strictly speaking this does not necessarily dene a partition, as some of the subsets Hj may be empty.","The procedure depends on two sequences of functions Mi; i = 1; : : : ; n + 1 and Vi; i = 1; : : : ; n. Informally, Mi is the maximum value attained by the subset of the functions A that depend on one of the variables X1; : : : ; Xi, and Vi gives information about the value of Xi at which this maximum is attained.","To simplify notation we write these functions as functions of the entire set of variables X, but usually depend on a much smaller set of variables. The Mi are real valued, while each Vi ranges over Xi. Let M = fM1; : : : ; Mng. Recall that the sets of functions A and M can be both be partitioned into disjoint subsets A1; : : : ; An+1 and M1; : : : ; Mn+1 respectively on the basis of the variables each Ai and Mi depend on. The denition of the Mi and Vi; i = 1; : : : ; n is as follows:","Mi(x) = max x0 2X s:t: x0","=ix Y A2Ai","A(x0 ) Y M2Mi","M (x0 ) (8)","Vi(x) = argmax x0 2X s:t: x0","=ix Y A2Ai","A(x0 ) Y M2Mi","M (x0 ) Mn+1 receives a special denition, since there is no variable Xn+1. Mn+1 = 0 @ Y A2An+1 A 1 A 0 @ Y M2Mn+1 M 1 A (9) The denition of Mi in (8) may look circular (since M appears in the right-hand side), but in fact it is not. First, note that Mi depends only on variables ordered after Xi, so if Mj 2 Mi then j < i. More specically, d(Mi) = 0 @ [ A2Ai d(A) [ [ M2Mi d(M ) 1 A n fXig: Thus we can compute the Mi in the order M1; : : : ; Mn+1, inserting Mi into the appropriate set Mk, where k > i, when Mi is computed.","We claim that Mmax = Mn+1. (Note that Mn+1 and Mn are constants, since there are no variables ordered after Xn). To see this, consider the tree T whose nodes are the Mi, and which has a directed edge from Mi to Mj iff Mi 2 Mj (i.e., Mi appears in the right hand side of the denition (8) of Mj). T has a unique root Mn+1, so there is a path from every Mi to Mn+1. Let i j iff there is a path from Mi to Mj in this tree. Then a simple induction shows that Mj is a function from d(Mj) to a maximisation over each of the variables Xi where i j of Q","i j;A2Ai A.","Further, it is straightforward to show that Vi(x̂) = x̂i (the value x̂ assigns to Xi). By the same arguments as above, d(Vi) only contains variables ordered after Xi, so Vn = x̂n. Thus we can evaluate the Vi in the order Vn; : : : ; V1 to nd the maximising assignment x̂.

The algorithm rests on the observation that so long as features are local to the parse fragments used in the packed representations, the statistics required for parsing and estimation are the kinds of quantities that dynamic programming algorithms for graphical models can perform. Since neither Maxwell and Kaplan’s packed parsing algorithm nor the procedures described here depend on the details of the underlying linguistic theory, the approach should apply to virtually any kind of underlying grammar.","Obviously, an empirical evaluation of the algorithms described here would be extremely useful. The algorithms described here are exact, but because we are working with unication grammars and apparently arbitrary graphical models we cannot polynomially bound their computational complexity. However, it seems reasonable to expect that if the linguistic dependencies in a sentence typically factorize into largely non-interacting cliques then the dynamic programming methods may offer dramatic computational savings compared to current methods that enumerate all possible parses.","It might be interesting to compare these dynamic programming algorithms with a standard unication-based parser using a best-rst search heuristic. (To our knowledge such an approach has not yet been explored, but it seems straightforward: the gure of merit could simply be the sum of the weights of the properties of each partial parse’s fragments). Because such parsers prune the search space they cannot guarantee correct results, unlike the algorithms proposed here. Such a best-rst parser might be accurate when parsing with a trained grammar, but its results may be poor at the beginning of parameter weight estimation when the parameter weight estimates are themselves inaccurate.","Finally, it would be extremely interesting to compare these dynamic programming algorithms to the ones described by Miyao and Tsujii (2002). It seems that the Maxwell and Kaplan packed representation may permit more compact representations than the disjunctive representations used by Miyao et al., but this does not imply that the algorithms proposed here are more efcient. Further theoretical and empirical investigation is required."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Steven Abney. 1997. Stochastic Attribute-Value Grammars.
