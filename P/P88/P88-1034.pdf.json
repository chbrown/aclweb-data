In this paper we show that Combinatory Categorial Grammars also generates the same class of languages. We discuss the slruclm'al descriptions produced by Combinawry Categorial Grammars and compare them to those of grammar formalisms in the class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems. We also discuss certain extensions of CombinaWry Categorial Grammars and their effect on the weak generative capacity."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["There have been a number of results concerning the relationship between the weak generative capacity (family of string languages) associated with different grammar formalisms; for example, the thecxem of Oaifman, et al. [3] that Classical Categorial Grammars are weakly equivalent to Context-Free Grammars (CFG's). Mote recently it has been found that there is a class of languages slightly larger than the class of Context-Free languages that is generated by several different formalisms. In pardodar, Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG's) and Head Grammars (HG's) have been shown to be weakly equivalent [15], and these formalism are also equivalent to a reslriction of Indexed Grammars considered by Gazdar [6] called Linear Indexed Grammars (LIG's) [13].","In this paper, we examine Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG's), an extension of Classical Categorial Grammars developed by Steedman and his collaborators [1,12,9,10,11]. The main result in this paper is","*This work was partially mpported by NSF gnmts MCS-82-19116-CER. MCS-82-07294, DCR-84-10413, ARO grant DAA29-84-9-0027. and DARPA gnmt N0014-85-K0018. We are very grateful to Mark Steedmm, ]C Vijay-Shanker and Remo Pare~:hi for helpful disctmiem. that CCG's are weakly equivalent to TAG's, HG's, and LIG's. We prove this by showing in Section 3 that Combinatory Categorlal Languages (CCL's) are included in Linear Indexed Languages (LIL's), and that Tree Adjoining Languages (TAL's) are included in CCL's.","After considering their weak generative capacity, we investigate the relationship between the struclzwal descriptions produced by CCG's and those of other grammar formalisms. In [14] a number of grammar formalisms were compared and it was suggested that an important aspect of their descriptive capacity was reflected by the derivation structures that they produced. Several formalisms that had previously been descn2~d as mildly context-sensitive were found to share a number of properties. In particular, the derivations of a grammar could be represenled with trees that always formed the tree set of a context-free grammar. Formalisms that share these properties were called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems"]},{"title":"('LCFRS's) [14].","paragraphs":["On the basis of their weak generative capacity, it appears that CCG's should be classified as mildly context-sensitive. In Section 4 we consider whether CCG's should be included in the class of LCFRS's. The derivation tree sets traditionally associated with CCG's have Context-free path sets, and are similar to those of LIG's, and therefore differ from those of LCFRS's. This does not, however, nile out the possibility that there may be alternative ways of representing the derivation of CCG's that will allow for their classification as LCP'RS's.","Extensions to CCG's have been considered that enable them to compare two unbounded sU'uctures (for example, in [12]). It has been argued that this may be needed in the analysis of certain coordination phenomena in Dutch. In Section 5 we discuss how these additional features increase the power of the formalism. In so doing, we also give an example demonstrating that the Parenthesis-free Categorial Grammar formalism [5,4] is moze powerful that CCG's as defined here. Extensions to TAG's (Multicomponent TAG) have been considered for similar 278 reasons. However, in this paper, we will not investigate the relationship between the extension of CCG's and Multicomponent TAG."]},{"title":"2 Description of Formalisms","paragraphs":["In this section we describe Combinatory Categorial Grammars, Tree Adjoining Grammars, and Linear Indexed Grammars. 2.1 Combinatory Categoriai Grammars Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), as defined here, is the most recent version of a system that has evolved in a number of papers [1,12,9,10,11].","A CCG, G, is denoted by (VT, VN, S, f, R) where VT is a finite set of terminals (lexical items), VN is a finite set of nonterminals (atomic categories), S is a distinguished member of VN, f is a function that maps elements of VT U {e} to finite subsets of"]},{"title":"C(VN),","paragraphs":["the set of categories*, where V N g C(VN) and if CI, C 2"]},{"title":"e C(VN)","paragraphs":["then (el/c2) E C(VN) and (c1\\c2) E C(VN).","R is a finite set of combinatory rules, described below.","We now give the combinatory rules, where z, y, z are variables over categories, and each Ii denotes either \\ or /. 1. forward application: 2. backward application:"]},{"title":"u (z\\u) -. z","paragraphs":["3. generaliT~d forward composition for some n _> 1:"]},{"title":"(...

When a combinatory rule is used, there is a bound on the number of immediate components that the secondary categories of that rule may have. Thus, because immediate constituents must belong to De(G) (a finite set), there is a bound on the number of categories that can fill the role of secondary categories in the use of a combinatory rule. Thus, theae is a bound on the number of instantiations of the variables y and zi in the combinatory rules in Section 2.1. The only variable that can be instantiated to an unbounded number of categories is z. Thus, by enumerating each of the finite number of variable bindings for y and each z~, the number of combinatory rules in R can be increased in such a way that only x is needed.

LCFRS's are constrained to have linear nonerasing composition operations and derivation trees that are structurally identical to those of context-free grammars. The intuition behind the latter restriction is that the rewriting (whether it be of strings, trees or graphs) be performed in a context-free way; i.e., choices about how to rewrite a structure should not be dependent on an unbounded amount of the previous or future context of the derivation. Several wen-known formalisms fall into this class including Context-Free Grammars, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (GPSG), Head Grammars, Tree Adjoining Grammars, and Multicomponent Tree Adjoining Grammars. In [14] it is shown that each formalism in the class generates scmilinear languages that can be recognized in polynomial time.","In this section, we examine derivation trees of CCG's and compare them with respect to those of formalisms that are known to be LCFRS's. In order to compare CCG's with other systems we must choose a suitable method for the representation of derivations in a CCG. In the case of CFG, TAG, HG, for example, it is fairly clear what the elementary structures and composition operations should be, and as a result, in the case of these formalisms, it is apparent how to represent derivations.","The traditional way in which derivations of a CCG have been represented has involved a binary tree whose nodes are labeled by categories with annotations indicat-ing which combinatory rule was used at each stage. These derivation trees are different from those systems in the class of LCFRS's in two ways. They have context-free path sets, and the set of categories labeling nodes may be infinite. A property that they share with LCFRS's is that there is no dependence between unbounded paths. In fact, the derivation trees sets produced by CCG's have the same properties as those produced by LIG's (this is apparent from the construction in Section 3A).","Although the derivation trees that are traditionally associated with CCG's differ from those of LCFRS's, this does not preclude the possibility that there may be an alternative way of representing derivations. What appears to be needed is some characterization of CCG's that identities a finite set of elementary structures and a finite set of composition operations.","The equivalence of TAG's and CCG's suggests one way of doing this. The construction that we gave from TAG's to CCG's produced CCG's having a specific form which can be thought of as a normal form for CCG's. We can represent the derivations of grammars in this form with the same tree sets as the derivation tree sets of the TAG from which they were constructed. Hence CCG's in this normal form can be classified as LCFRS's. 283","TAG derivation trees encode the adjanction of specified elementary trees at specified nodes of other elementary trees.
