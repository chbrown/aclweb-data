The linguistic description should define certain string-combination operations (defined on siring I\"YI~) associated with information structures. Then what we do is identify shamble packages of common string-types and information slmctures among independently motivated languuge-spccific grammatical assertaions. These packages are then put into the shared part of the grammnr D and the remaining language-specifics are potential sources for mofe sharing. This extraction is essential in what we call ATOMIZATION, which is basically \"breaking up of grammatical a~gions into mailer independeot parts\" (Le. decomposition).

Nominals here are those that realize AR~ such as subjects and objects. Nominals are more commonly labeled NP, a phrase typically built axound N or CN (comm*~ noun), as in phrase structure NP->DET N as well as in the categorlal grammar characterization of DET as a functor NPICN (Le. combines with CN and builds NP) (e.g. Ades & Steedm~n 1982; Wittenberg 1986a). This BI.LEV]~ View of nominals is motivated by facts in western European languages. In English, for instance, while cat or wide cat cannot f'dl a subject position, a cat and thLv ca: can. In comrast, while he can be a subject, it cannot be modified as ~ he or srange h~. This motivates the following category-assJguments with a constraint that only NPs can be arguments: ca: is CN, he is NP, a and #~s are NP/CN, and white and sWange are CN/CN. This, bewevef, requires that plurals and mass nouns be CN and NP at the sanlc time since ca~, gold, white cats, white gold, these cms, and this gold can all be arguments. The count/nmss distinction is also often blurred since a singular count noun llke ca: may be used as a mass noun referring to the meat of the cat, and a mass noun like gold may be used as a singular count noun referring to a UNIT of gold or a KIND of gold (see e.g. Bach 1986). The boundmT between NP and CN is at best Ftr22Y. When we ~ to othm\" languages, the basis for the bi-level view vmisbes. In Japanese, for instance, neko 'cat' can be an argument on its own, and pronoun kam 'he' can be modified as in ano kate 'that he' and okas/na kate 'strange he'. In short, there is no basic syntactic diff~iew.e among count nouns, pronouns, and mass nouns (and no singular/plural distinction on a 'count' noun). All of them behave iJ~ plural and mass nouns in English. This supports a mono-level view of nominals, which we intend to captm~ with category N. Figure 3 shows the SG-templates relevant to the most general characterization of N in each language. SG-templates in the following illustrations are marked as follows: atomic templates SG-x (boldface), utility templates 9~SG-x, and substantive templates $SG-x.","At the moat general level, the basic llomlnall ill Gezman (OE-N) and Arabic (AR-N) must be unsaturated because gcnitivc-inflectod Ns may take arguments.

In *_d,]ition, all but JA-N inherit relevant AGR(eemant) templates (see below). Crucially, note that what 1oo~ like a reasonable characterization of N in each language actually consists of a particular selection from the common set of primitives.","ARGUMENT and NON-ARGUMENT: We posit a pseudc~functiomd level of description in terms of ARG(ument) and NON-ARG for category N instead of the categozy=level distinction between NP and CN.

In this view, the ARG/NON-ARG distinction is 'grounded on a complex intcraction of morphology, semantics, and syntax.","In English and Germa~ singular count nouns (e.g. wee, Baum) are NON-ARG while plurals, mass (~ngu~) nouns, proper names, and pronouns are ARG.

The exceptionally ordered MODs of the five languages revealed en implk:ational chain amnng modifiers: Numerals < Demonstratives < Adjectives < Genitives .: Relative clauses.

Although the case discussed covers only simple nominals in five languages, we believe that the fundamental process that we","GRAMMATICAL ATOMIZATION will remain crucial in developing a shared grammar of any sU'uctural complexity a~l linguistic coverage. The specif~ merits of this process is that (a) it tends to prevent the grammar writer from implementing treatments that work only for a language or a language type, and that (b) it pmvidas insights as to how certain conflated properties in a languase actually mnsist of smaller independent pros. In the end, when a prototype shared grammar anains a reasonable scale, we hope to verify the prediction that it will facilitate adding coverage for new languages.","The purpose of this wo~ at MCC was to demonstrate the feasibility of a shared syn~ rule base for dissimilar languages. We only assumed that languages are used to . convey information contents that can be represented in a common knowledge base. As the next step, therefore, we have chosen to connect syntax with 'deeper' levels of information pmces~in~ (i.e. sern*.tlcs, discourse, and knowledge base) rather them continuing to increase the syntactic coverage alone. Our current effort is on developing a blackboard-like system for controlling various knowledge sources (i.e. morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, and a commmutense knowledge base (MCC's CYC, Lanat and Feigenhaum 1987)). In the future, we hope to see a shared grammar integrated in a full-blown interface tool for man-machine commuuical/on."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This shared grammar work is a collaborative effort of a team at MCC.

The basic idea is that an order constraint stated on a d_,~'__~-ndant (e.g. DEM < head) ovearides that stated on its anc~tont (e.g. head < MOD). This differs from GPSG's LP rules (Gazdar & Pullum 1981; Gazd& et al. 1985; Uzlmreit 1986) in that the order conslraints apply to items located anywhen\" in the derivational Iree struclrue, not limited to sister constituents, and the pieces of an item can be scattered in the tree.
