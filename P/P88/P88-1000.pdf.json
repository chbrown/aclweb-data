Over the years, this meeting has come to be the forum at which some of the newest and most exciting work is first presented, and this year is no exception.","It is, of course, the authors of the papers who are most responsible for this and who ensure the success of the meeting. We all owe them our gratitude, as we do to all those who submitted papers which unfortunately could not be included in the program. I am personally very pleased at the high quality of the papers we had to choose among.","We are also indebted to the members of the Program Committee, who devoted a great deal of time and effort to coming to these difficult decisions. They are Jared Bernstein, SRI International; Roy Byrd, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center; Sandra Carberry, University of Delaware; Eugene Charniak, Brown University; Raymonde Guindon, MCC; Lynette Hirschmann, Unisys; Karen Jensen, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center; Lauri Karttunnen, Xerox PARC; William Rounds, University of Michigan; Ralph Weischedel, BBN Laboratories; and Robert Wilensky, University of California at Berkeley.","In addition much credit goes to William J. Rapaport who has been in charge of the huge task of local arrangements, to Lynda Spahr who organized the demonstrations and exhibits as well as providing major support for local arrangements, to Ralph Grishman who organized the tutorial sessions, and to Mae Jones for her extensive secretarial help. I would also like to thank Dedre Gentner who agreed to give the invited lecture.","Perhaps most of all I would like to express my gratitude to Don Walker, who published the Call for Papers and this Proceedings, sent out the advertisements and registration packets, and in general, this year as in past years, has kept the Association for Computational Linguistics to-gether and operational. We owe our gratitude as well to Betty Walker, who does more for the organization and its meetings than any of us know.

I will try to explain the linguistic motivations for the proposals I will discuss, and also convergences among the theories. Little in the way of background will be assumed, beyond a rudimentary knowledge of phrase structure grammars and basic transformational mechanisms (movement, deletion, etc.). Text Processing Systems Martha Palmer, Lynette Hirschman, and Deborah Dahl Unisys Defense Systems","This tutorial will cover issues in text processing, focusing on the current state-of-the-art in text processing, the applications of text processing, the architecture of a text-processing system (using the Unisys PUNDIT system as an exampie), issues of portability and extenslbility, and Issues relating to large-scale computational linguistics projects. The section on system architecture will describe a modular architecture, with components that handle syntax, semantics and pragmatics, emphasizing the importance of segregating domain-specific and domain-independent data. We will then discuss, in the context of recent experiences with the PUNDIT system, the issue of portability across domains and the tools that support bringing up an application in a new domain. We will also look at the problems associated with building a large natural language processing system: how to integrate people with a variety of backgrounds (computer science, linguistics), how to manage and maintain a large system, and how to do development in multiple domains simultaneously. We will conclude with a survey of text-processing systems, comparing their strengths and weaknesses as related to their particular goals. Natural Language Generation David McDonald"]},{"title":"Brattle Research Corporation","paragraphs":["This tutorial will take participants through the workings of a complete, albeit very simple, generation system from the underlying conceptual representation to the surface morphology. This mini-system, which uses a \"direct replacement\" algorithm, would be quite satisfactory for the demands of most present expert systems; its weaknesses will be used to motivate the research that is going on in generation today. The major themes of that research will be surveyed, concentrating on the rationales behind the adoption of specific frameworks, such as systemic, unification, or tree adjoining grammar. Illustrations will be taken from current and historically important systems. Emphasis will be on generation as a planning and construction process which has markedly different concerns and issues from language understanding, and on how this has led to the approaches generation researchers are taking today. Efficient Parsing Algorithms Masaru Tomita"]},{"title":"Carnegie-Mellon University","paragraphs":["Parsing efficiency is crucial when building practical natural language systems. This is especially the case for interactive applications such as natural language database access, interfaces to expert systems and interactive machine translation. This tutorial covers several et~icient context-free parsing algorithms, including chart parsing, Earley's algorithm, LR parsing and the generalized LR algorithm. Augmentation to the context-free parsing algorithms is also discussed, to handle unification-based grammar formalisms such as Lexical-Functional Grammar, Functional Unification Grammar, and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar. vii"]},{"title":"TABLE OF CONTENTS","paragraphs":["Adapting an English Morpholoqieal Analyzer for French Roy J.
