Moran Artificial Intelligence Center","SKI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue","Menlo Park, California 94025, USA ABSTRACT","An algorithm for generating the possible quantifier scopings for a sentence, in order of preference, is outlined. The scoping assigned to a quantifier is determined by its interactions with other quantifiers, modals, negation, and certain syntactic-constituent boundaries. When a potential scoping is logically equivalent to another, the less preferred one is discarded.","The relative scoping preferences of the individual quantifiers are not embedded in the algorithm, but are specified by a set of rules. Many of the rules presented here have appeared in the linguistics literature and have been used in various natural language processing systems. However, the coordination of these rules and the resulting coverage represents a significant contribution. Because experimental data on human quantifier-scoping preferences are still fragmentary, we chose to design a system in which the set of preference rules could be easily modified and expanded..","The algorithm described has been implemented in Prolog as part of a larger natural language processing system. Extensions of this algorithm are in progress. INTRODUCTION","One of the major sources of ambiguity in sentences results from the different scopes that can be assigned to the various quantified noun phrases in the sentence. Part of the problem in determining the preferred scopings of quantifiers is the number of factors involved. For example, consider these three sentences John visited every house on a street. (1) John visited every house on a square. (2) John visited every patient in a private room. (3) Each of these sentences has two quantifier scopings: in one, \"every' has wider scope over \"a,\" and while in the other, \"a\" has the wider scope. However, the readings that most people obtain for these sentences are quite different. In (1), the reading in which \"a\" has wider scope is highly preferred; in (3), the reading in which \"everf has wider scope is highly preferred; in (2), the reading with wide-scope \"everf is preferred, but wide-scope \"a\" is also acceptable. A plausible explanation for the difference between (1) and (2) is that, since the typical house is located on a street but not on a square, the default preference represented by (2) is overridden by a conversational maxim of quantity--if \"~ streeff has narrow scope, \"on a street\" would contribute too little information to justify its presence. A plausible explana-tion for the difference between (2) and (3) is based on the relationship among the components. The reading of (3) in which \"a\" is given wider scope is improbable because the domain of quantification for \"every\" would then be the single patient in the selected room--an infelicitous use of \"every, ~ whereas there is no similar problem in (2) because there are normally multiple houses on a square. Similarly, in John visited a person on every committee. (4) John visited a house on every street. (5) the reading in which \"a\" has wider scope is reasonable for (4) but not for (5)--in a normal domain of discourse, it is conceivable that there could be a person who is on all of the committees, but it is highly improbable that the geometry of the streets is such that a single house could be located on all of them.","In (1), (3), and (5), discourse criteria and domain information seem to be the primary factors in determining the preferred quantifier scopings, whereas in (2) and (4), linguistic criteria seem to 33 be the determining factors.","Our approach presumes that the determination of a sentence's preferred scoping can be divided into two phases, the first of which is the subject of the algorithm described here. In this initial phase, linguistic information is used to generate the possible quantifier scopings in order of preference. The relevant linguistic information consists of surface position, syntactic structure, and the relationship among the function words (determiners, modals, and negation). In the second phase (future work), domain and discourse information is applied successively to these scopings, modifying the scores produced by the first phase. We expect that the modifications will be only penalties, thus making it possible to identify the best choice when it is encountered (cutting off the processing of remaining scopings generated by the first phase).","The primary study of quantifier scoping preferences was done by VanLehn (1978). The experimental data reported therein was of limited usefulhess in developing the algorithm described here-- it was gathered and evaluated under assumptions arising from a different linguistic theory.","We shall first present the rules that governed the structure of our design, then outline the algorithm. This scoping algorithm has been implemented as a component of a larger system that is under continuing development. In this system, called the Core Language Engine or CLE (Alshawi et"]},{"title":"aL,","paragraphs":["1987), the semantic interpretation phase produces unscoped logical forms in which quantifier expressions are represented by quantifier terms (qterms).

This comparison is based upon a combination of factors that include their relative strengths and surface positions, and whether or not either has been raised.","In many systems, determiners are assigned numerical strengths and these values are compared to determine what scope should be assigned to each quantifier. Such a ranking is implicit in our preference rules and can be viewed as a first approxima-tion of the relationships represented by our rules. Our algorithm permits a set of properties to be associated with determiners and for these to be used in ascertaining which determiner has wide-scope preference. The properties currently employed are surface position (the integer index of the determiner) and a Boolean value indicating when a quantifier has already been raised. Preference 3.1 There is a strong preference for %ach\" to outscope other determiners.","That \"each\" is the strongest determiner is a common feature of most quantifier-scoping treatments. However, the evidence for the relative strengths of the remaining quantifiers is much less clear---our current ranking of them is an ad hoc blending of those in TEAM (Grosz ef al., 1987) and VanLehn (1978). Preference 3.2 There is a strong preference for WH.terms to outscope all determiners ezcepf \"each,\" which outscopes WH-terms.","In the unscoped logical forms currently produced, WH-words (\"which,\" \"who,\" \"what\") and phrases are represented as qterms. Our scoping-preference rules assign wide scope to \"each\" in Which ezams did each student pass? (8) There is a reported dialect in which sentences of the above form are judged to be malformed, but that dialect was not found among our informants. The design of our algorithm makes it easy to re-place the current preferences with these.","The definite determiner \"the\" is currently treated as a very strong quantifier, but this approach is not entirely satisfactory. Consider Every student passed the ezam. (9) The student in every race celebrated. (1O) The student in each race celebrated. (11) Every student in the race celebrated. (12) Each student in the race celebrated. (13) In (9)-(12), the preferred scopings are as predicted by the rules. However in (13), the preferred reading selected is the one with wide-scope \"each.\" Although both scopings of this sentence are logically equivalent (as are those for (9) and (12)), wide-scope \"the\" seems to he the preferred reading.","Our algorithm does not distinguish between specific and nonspecific use of indefinite articles. It is debatable whether this belongs in quantifier scolP ing or in another part of the system. Preference 3.3 A logically weaker interpretation is preferred. This preference is strong when it maintains surface order, weak when it inverts surface order. 2","The quantifier order V'~ is weaker than ~/, accounting for the preferences in A man loves every woman."]},{"title":"(14)","paragraphs":["Every man loves a woman. (15) In both sentences, the reading with wide-scope \"eeerf is the preferred one; the reading with wide-scope \"a\" is possible for (14), but is very strained for (15). Rule 4 Raising a quantifier out of certain syntactic constituents changes the strength of its determiner.","VanLehn presents an \"embedding hierarchy\" of the probability of a quantifier in the modifier of an NP being raised to have wider scope than the quantifier in the NP's head","2Vanl.mhn proposes a more general form of this preference--that, when comparing two quantifiers within the same ge~neral group, the \"more numerous\" one will have a preference for wider scope. For example, \"many\" would take wider scope over \"few.\" However, for everything except \"ever~'/\"a,\" such preferences appear to he very slight. 35 PP > Reduced Relative Clause > Relative Clause A method frequently proposed to account for this distinction is to use, as a measure of the cost of raising, a count of the number of nodes in the syntactic structure over which the quantifier is raised. However, such accounts are acknowledged to have various deficiencies and to be overly sensitive to the syntactic representation used. We have chosen to permit rules to associate a cost for raising a quantifier with certain types of nodes (other nodes can be viewed as having zero costs). This capability of the system is currently invoked only on an all-or-nothing basis. Preference 4.1 A quantifier cannot be raised across more than one major clause boundary.","A common rule in the quantifier-scoping literature is \"quantification is generally clause bound.\" While it is possible to generate sentences with acceptable readings when a quantifier has wider scope than the clause in which it occurs, we have been unable to find any examples showing that it can be raised out of two clauses. Preference 4.2 A quantifier cannot be raised out of a relative clause.","This is a common restriction in many quantifier-scoping algorithms. In our system, this is not a special rule, but one of the preferences. Consequently, this could easily be modified from vever being permitted to being \"highly unpreferred.\" Rule 5 In unscoped logical form, quantifiers can occur within the scope of an opaque operator. Whether or not to raise such a quantifier outside that operator is determined by a pairwise comparison between the operator and the determiner in the quantifier, as well as by their relative surface position. Preference 5.1 There is a strong preference for \"some\" to outscope negation. Preference 5.2 There is a preference for negation to outscope %very.\" This preference is strong when it maintains surface order, weak when it doesn't.","Different scopings of \"some\" and \"every\" under negation produce equivalent readings (3\"~ is equivalent to --V).

If such antecedents were treated as a negative environment (or equivalent thereto), the foregoing preferences could produce this effect.","SThe CLE system does not currently provide a treatmerit of \",n~.\" However, within the qu~ati~er-scoping compon~t, \"4n~\" is treated ~ ~ potenti~dly ambiguotm between the usual universal quantifier, free-choice \"any,\" and a ~cond form, polarity-sensitive \"anlt,\" which occurs in conjunction with negative-polarlty items. Polarity-~mitive \"anlh\" is treated as & narrow.cope existelxtied quantifier (Ladtmaw, 1980). 36 Preference 5.3 There is a strong preference for free-choice \"any\" to have wider scope than modals. There is a strong preference for all other determiners that occur within the scope of a modal to have narrower scope than that modal. Did some student take every testf (22) Does some student take every test? (23) Some student took every test. (24) Some student takes every test. (25) Some student is taking every test. (26) For sentences (23), (25), and (26), there are two acceptable quantifier scopings. However, for (22) and (24), the scoping in which \"every\" is assigned narrower scope seems to be strongly preferred. We ascribe this to the presence in the logical form of a modal operator corresponding to the past tense. This effect is accentuated in (27), which exhibits an ambiguity resulting from whether \"some teacher\" is scoped inside or outside the modal, corresponding to (28) and (29), respectively: Some teacher took every course.

The performance of the Hobbs and Shieber algorithm deteriorates as the number of quantifiers in the sentence increases---our analysis is that it spends a significant amount of time repeatedly travers-ing the logical form and doing structure copying (their goal was to produce a provably correct algorithm, not a highly efficient one). Our algorithm traverses the unscoped logical form, collecting the qterms (quantifier terms) into a store; then as the scoping for each qterm is determined, it is pulled out of the store, producing a scoped logical form. 4This was brought to my attention by Richard Crouch. 37 For a sentence with four qusatifiers, our algorithm is typically an order of magnitude faster than that presented by Hobbs sad Shieber.","A simple example of the use of the store is provided by the sentence \"John saw a student,\" which has an unscoped logical form of"]},{"title":"see'(john',qterm(a',X,student'(X)))","paragraphs":["After quantifier scoping has placed the"]},{"title":"qterm","paragraphs":["in the store, the logical form is"]},{"title":"see'(john',X)","paragraphs":["sad the store is"]},{"title":"[ [ qterm(a',X,student'(X)) ] ]","paragraphs":["The scope for this quantifier is the whole sentence, so the"]},{"title":"qterm is","paragraphs":["puned out of the store to produce the scoped logical form quant(3,X,studeet'(X),"]},{"title":"see'~iohn',X))","paragraphs":["The sentence \"Few students pass most ezamg' has the unscoped logical form"]},{"title":"pass'(qterm(few',X,student'(X)), qterm(most'.V.exam'(V)))","paragraphs":["After the"]},{"title":"qterms","paragraphs":["have been extracted, the remaining logical form sad the store are"]},{"title":"p ss'(x,v) [ [ qterm(few',X,stud ent'(X)) ], [ qterm(rhost',Y,exam'(Y))) ] ]","paragraphs":["A qterm can have other qterms in its restriction sad our quantifier store is a structured collection (unlike the stores of Cooper sad LUNAR).

In implementing this algorithm in Prolog, we found that it was considerably easier to generate the scopings by working from the narrowest to the widest scope, rather than rice versa. As the various permutations of the quantifiers are generated, equivalent scopings are detected, and all but the most preferred one are then filtered out. In the following, both scopings of each sentence are logitally equivalent: Every student takes every test. Every student takes each test. A student takes a test. Some student takes a tes~.

Filtering of equivalent permutations is achieved simply by comparing the qtree currently being pulled from the store with the preceding one; if the qusatifiers in their head qterms are logically equivalent, this quantifier scoping is discarded unless the qtree being pulled has wide-scope preference over its predecessor (in which case the other logically equivalent ordering will be discarded).","Logically equivalent scopings can also be produced when a quantifier is raised out of the restriction of another. However, the quantifier permutations that produce equivalent scopings by raising are a subset of those produced by permuting siblings: Every student in every race celebrated. (40) A student in a race celebrated. (41) Some student in a race celebrated. (42) 38 Each student in the race celebrated. (43) Every student in the race celebrated. (44) The student in every race celebrated. (45) Note that the scopings for (40) and (45) are not logically equivalent. The scopings in the others axe logically equivalent, but in (41) and (43), the preferred scoping is the one corresponding to constituent structure, whereas in (42) and (44), the preferred scoping has the NP from the PP raised to have wider scope over the head noun.","When a qtree is pulled from the store, the algorithm tries to produce additional permutations by raising subsets of qterrns (actually of qtrees) out of that qtree's restriction. When a qtree is raised, it is put back into the store---since qtrees are being assigned scope from narrowest to widest, this ensures that a raised qtree will receive wider scope than the qtree out of which it was raised.","Because a raised qtrse may have its strength re-duced when it is placed back in the store (an op-tion in our system), a set of logically equivalent scopings could have all instances filtered out by a naive implementation. The problem arises in the following manner. Before the qtree is raised, the algorithm determines that the unraised scoping is logically equivalent to a raised one and that the latter is preferred, so it discards the former. When the qtree is raised and its strength reduced, it becomes weaker than the qtree out of which it was raised. The algorithm detects that the raised scoping is logically equivalent to an unralsed one, and determines--on the\" basis of the current strengths--that the unraised scoping is preferred, so it now discards the raised one. This problem is avoided by doing some additional bookkeeping.","The current implementation of the above rules is very coarse-grained. The \"score\" indicating whether or not a quantifier should be assigned wide scope over another quantifier, logical form operator (e.g., a modal, negation), or syntactic constituent is one of four values: always (narrow scope is impossible), never (wide scope is impossible), pref (wide scope is preferred, but narrow scope is acceptable), and unpref (narrow scope is preferred). In the current implementation of the above preferences, a strong preference to take wider scope is treated as an instance of always, and a weak preference is treated as pref. For example, Preferences (3.1)-(3.3) are given by the following rules, in which Pref is the preference of a determiner Detl to take wider scope over another determiner Det2:","if Detl and Det2 are both \"each\": - if Detl precedes Det2 in surface order,"]},{"title":"Pref = pref, - otherwise, Pref =","paragraphs":["unpre.f."]},{"title":"otherwise, if Detl is","paragraphs":["\"each\""]},{"title":"(and Det2 is","paragraphs":["not), Pref = always","otherwise, if Detl is an interrogative determiner, Pref-- always","otherwise, if the logical forms for Detl and Det2 are V and 3, respectively: -","if Detl precedes Det2 in surface order,","Pref = always - otherwise, Pref = pref.
