This process of attitude revision is an interesting domain for the application of nonmonotonic reasoning because speech acts have a conventional aspect that is readily represented by defaults, but that interacts with an agent's beliefs and intentions in many complex ways that may override the defaults. Perrault has developed a theory of speech acts, based on Rieter's default logic, that captures the conventional aspect; it does not, however, adequately account for certain easily observed facts about attitude revision resulting from speech acts. A natural theory of attitude revision seems to require a method of stating preferences among competing defaults. We present here a speech act theory, formalized in hierarchic autoepistemic logic (a refinement of Moore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision of both the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can be adequately described. As a collateral benefit, efficient automatic reasoning methods for the formalism exist. The theory has been implemented and is now being employed by an utterance-planning system."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The general idea of utterance planning has been at the focus of much NL processing research for the last ten years. The central thesis of this 170 approach is that utterances are actions that are planned to satisfy particular speaker goals. This has led researchers to formalize speech acts in a way that would permit them to be used as operators in a planning system [1,2]. The central problem in formalizing speech acts is to correctly capture the pertinent facts about the revision of the speaker's and hearer's attitudes that ensues as a consequence of the act. This turns out to be quite difficult bemuse the results of the attitude revision are highly conditional upon the context of the utterance.","To consider just a small number of the contingencies that may arise, consider a speaker S uttering a declarative sentence with propositional content P to hearer H. One is inclined to say that, if H believes S is sincere, H will believe P. However, if H believes -~P initially, he may not be convinced, even if he thinks S is sincere. On the other hand, he may change his beliefs, or he may suspend belief as to whether P is true. H may not believe --P, but simply believe that S is neiter competent nor sincere, and so may not come to believe P. The problem one is then faced with is this: How does one describe the effect of uttering the declarative sentence so that given the appropriate contextual elements, any one of these possibilities can follow from the description?","One possible approach to this problem would be to find some fundamental, context-independent effect of informing that is true every time a declarative sentence is uttered. If one's general theory of the world and of rational behavior were sufficiently strong and detailed, any of the consequences of attitude revision would be derivable from the basic effect in combination with the elaborate theory of rationality. The initial efforts made along this path [3,5] entailed the axiomatization the effects of speech acts as producing in the hearer the belief that the speaker wants him to recognize the latter's intention to hold some other belief. The effects were characterized by nestings of Goal and Bel operators, as in Bel(H, Goal(S, Bel(H, P))). If the right conditions for attitude revision obtained, the conclusion BeI(H,P) would follow from the above assumption.","This general approach proved inadequate because there is in fact no such statement about b.e-liefs about goals about beliefs that is true in every performance of a speech act. It is possible to construct a counterexample contradicting any such effect that might be postulated. In addition, long and complicated chains of reasoning are required to derive the simplest, most basic consequences of an utterance in situations in which all of the \"nor-real\" conditions obtain -- a consequence that runs counter to one's intuitive expectations.","Cohen and Levesque [4] developed a speech act theory in a monotonic modal logic that incorporates context-dependent preconditions in the axioms that state the effects of a speech act. Their approach overcomes the theoretical difficulties of earlier context-independent attempts; however, if one desires to apply their theory in a practical computational system for reasoning about speech acts, one is faced with serious difficulties. Some of the context-dependent conditions that determine the effects of a speech act, according to their theory, involve statements about what an agent does no~ believe, as well as what he does believe. This means that for conclusions about the effect of speech acts to follow from the theory, it must in-clude an explicit representation of an agent's ignorance as well as of his knowledge, which in practice is difficult or even impossible to achieve.","A further complication arises from the type of reasoning necessary for adequate characterization of the attitude revision process. A theory based on monotonic reasoning can only distinguish between belief and lack thereof, whereas one based on nonmonotonic reasoning can distinguish between be-171 lief (or its absence) as a consequence of known facts, and belief that follows as a default because more specific information is absent. To the extent that such a distinction plays a role in the attitude revision process, it argues for a formalization with a nonmonotonic character.","Our research is therefore motivated by the following observations: (1) earlier work demonstrates convincingly that any adequate speech-act theory must relate the effects of a speech act to context-dependent preconditions; (2) these preconditions must depend on the ignorance as well as on the knowledge of the relevant agents; (3)any practical system for reasoning about ignorance must be based on nonmonotonic reasoning; (4) existing speech act theories based on nonmonotonic reasoning cannot account for the facts of attitude revision resulting from the performance of speech acts."]},{"title":"2 Perrault's Default Theory of Speech Acts","paragraphs":["As an alternative to monotonic theories, Perrault has proposed a theory of speech acts, based on an extension of Reiter's default logic [11] extended to include-defanlt-rule schemata.

Furthermore, the theory can make correct predictions in cases in which the usual preconditions of the speech act do not obtain. For example, if the speaker is ly-ing, but the hearer does not recognize the lie, then the heater's beliefs are exactly the same as when the speaker tells the truth; moreover the speaker's beliefs about mutual belief are the same, but he still does not believe the proposition he uttered m that is, he fails to be convinced by his own lie."]},{"title":"3 Problems with Perrault's Theory","paragraphs":["A serious problem arises with Perrault's theory concerning reasoning about an agent's ignorance.

One clearly does not want an axiom or default rule of the form that asserts what amounts to \"ignorance persists\" to defeat conclusions drawn from speech acts. In that case, one could never conclude that anyone ever learns anything as a result of a speech act. The alternative is to weaken the conditions under which the default rules can be defeated. However, by adopting this strategy we are giving up the advantage of using normal defaults. In general, nonnormal default theories do not necessarily have extensions, nor is there any proof procedure for such logics.","Perrault has intentionally left open the question of how a speech act theory should be integrated with a general theory of action and belief revision. He finesses this problem by introducing the persistence axiom, which states that beliefs always persist across changes in state. Clearly this is not true in general, because actions typically change our beliefs about what is true of the world. Even if one considers only speech acts, in some cases • one can get an agent to change his beliefs by say-ing something, and in other cases not. Whether one can or not, however, depends on what belief revision strategy is adopted by the respective agents in a given situation. The problem cannot be solved by simply adding a few more axioms and default rules to the theory. Any theory that allows for the possibility of describing belief revision must of necessity confront the problem of in-consistent extensions. This means that, if a hearer initially believes -~p, the default theory will have (at least) one extension for the case in which his belief that -~p persists, and one extension in which he changes his mind and believes p. Perhaps it will even have an extension in which he suspends belief as to whether p.","The source of the difficulties surrounding Perranlt's theory is that the default logic h e adopts is unable to describe the attitude revision that occurs in consequence of a speech act. It is not our purpose here to state what an agent's belief revision strategy should be. Rather we introduce a framework within which a variety of belief revision strategies can be accomodated efficiently, and we demonstrate that this framework can be applied in a way that eliminates the problems with Perranlt's theory.","Finally, there is a serious practical problem faced by anyone who wishes to implement Perfault's theory in a system that reasons about speech acts. There is no way the belief transfer rule can be used efficiently by a reasoning system; even if it is assumed that its application is restricted to the speaker and hearer, with no other agents in the domain involved. If it is used in a backward direction, it applies to its own result. In-voking the rule in a forward direction is also problematic, because in general one agent will have a very large number of beliefs (even an infinite number, if introspection is taken into account) about another agent's beliefs, most of which will be ir-relevant to the problem at hand."]},{"title":"4 Hierarchic Autoepistemic Logic","paragraphs":["Autoepistemic (AE) logic was developed by Moore [I0] as a reconstruction of McDermott's nonmonotonic logic [9].

The first is a representational problem: how to incorporate preferences among default inferences in a natural way within the logic. Such preferences arise in many disparate settings in nonmonotonic reasoning -- for example, in taxonomic hierarchies [6] or in reasoning about events over time [12]. To some extent, preferences among defaults can be 173 encoded in AE logic by introducing auxiliary information into the statements of the defaults, but this method does not always accord satisfactorily with our intuitions. The most natural statement of preferences is with respect to the multiple ex-"]},{"title":"pansions","paragraphs":["of a particular base set, that is, we prefer certain expansions because the defaults used in them have a higher priority than the ones used in alternative expansions.","The second problem is computational: how to tell whether a proposition is contained within the desired expansion of a base set. As can be seen from the above definition, a stable expansion of an autoepistemic theory is defined as a fixedpoint; the question of whether a formula belongs to this fixedpoint is not even semidecidable. This problem is shared by all of the most popular nonmonotonic logics. The usual recourse is to restrict the expressive power of the language, e.g., normal default theories [11] and separable circumscriptive theories [8]. However, as exemplified by the difficulties of Perrault's approach, it may not be easy or even possible to express the relevant facts with a restricted language.","Hierarchical autoepistemic logic is a modification of autoepistemic logic that addresses these two considerations. In HAEL, the primary structure is not a single uniform theory, but a collection of subtheories linked in a hierarchy. Snbtheories represent different sources of information available to an agent, while the hierarchy expresses the way in which this information is combined. For example, in representing taxonomic defaults, more specific information would take precedence over general attributes. HAEL thus permits a natural expression of preferences among defaults. Further-more, given the hierarchical nature of the subtheory relation, it is possible to give a constructive semantics for the autoepistemic operator, in contrast to the usual self-referential fixedpoints. We can then arrive easily at computational realiza-tions of the logic.","The language of HAEL consists of a standard first-order language, augmented by a indexed set of unary modal operators Li.

We assume that there is a hierarchy of autoepisternic subtheories as illustrated in Figure i. The lowest subtheory, ~'0, contains the strongest evidence about the speaker's and hearer's mental states. For example, if it is known to the hearer that the speaker is lying, this information goes into r0.","In subtheory vl, defaults are collected about the effects of the speech act on the beliefs of both hearer and speaker. These defaults can be over-ridden by the particular evidence of r0. Together r0 and rl constitute the first level of reasoning about the speech act. At Level 2, the beliefs of the speaker and hearer that can be deduced in rl are used as evidence to guide defaults about nested beliefs, that is, the speaker's beliefs about the heater's beliefs, and vice versa. These results are collected in r2. In a similar manner, successive levels contain the result of one agent's reflection upon his and his interlocutor's beliefs and intentions at the next lower level. We shall discuss here how Levels r0 and rl of the HAEL theory are axiomatized, and shall extend the axiomatization to the higher theories by means of axiom schemata.","An agent's belief revision strategy is represented by two features of the model. The position of the speech act theory in the general hierarchy of theories determines the way in which conclusions drawn in those theories can defeat conclusions that follow from speech acts. In our model, the speech act defaults will go into the subtheory rl, while evidence that will be used to defeat these defaults will go in r0. In addition, the axioms that relate rl to r0 determine precisely what each agent is willing to accept from 1\"0 as evidence against the default conclusions of the speech act theory.","It is easy to duplicate the details of Perrault's analysis within this framework. Theory r0 would contain all the agents' beliefs prior to the speech act, while the defaults of rl would state that an agent believed the utterance P if he did not believe its negation in r0. As we have noted, this analysis does not allow for the situation in which the speaker utters P without believing either it or its opposite, and then becomes convinced of its truth by the very fact of having uttered it m nor does it allow the hearer to change his belief in -~P as a result of the utterance.","We choose a more complicated and realistic expression of belief revision. Specifically, we allow an agent to believe P (in rl) by virtue of the utterance of P only if he does not have any evidence (in r0) against believing it. Using this scheme, we can accommodate the hearer's change of belief, and show that the speaker is not convinced by his own efforts.","We now present the axioms of the HAEL theory for the declarative utterance of the proposition P. The language we use is a propositional modal one 175 for the beliefs of the speaker and hearer.

If he utters a sentence, regardless of whether he is lying, or in any other way insincere, he should believe P after the utterance if and only if he believed it before. However, in the bearer's case, whether he believes P depends not only on his prior mental state with respect to P, but also on whether he believes that the speaker is being sincere. ~iom 13 states that a hearer is willing to believe what a speaker says if it does not conflict with his own beliefs in ~, and if the utterance does not conflict with what the hearer believes about the speaker's mental state, (i.e., that the speaker is not lying), and if he believes that believing P is consistent with his beliefs about the speaker's prior intentions (i.e., that the speaker is using the utterance with communicative intent, as distinct from, say, testing a microphone).","As a first example of the use of the theory, consider the normal case in which A0 contains no evidence about the speaker's and bearer's beliefs after the speech act.

The problems are stem from the theory's formulation in normal default logic. We have demonstrated how these difficulties can be overcome by formulating the theory instead in a version of autoepistemic logic that is designed to combine reasoning about belief with autoepistemic reasoning. Such a logic makes it possible to for-realize a description of the agents' belief revision processes that can capture observed facts about attitude revision correctly in response to speech acts. This theory has been tested and implemented as a central component of the GENESYS utterance-planning system."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was supported in part by a contract with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, in part by the Office of Naval Research under Contract N00014-85-C-0251, and in part under subcontract with Stanford University under Contract N00039-84-C-0211 with the Defense"]},{"title":"Advanced Research Projects Agency.
