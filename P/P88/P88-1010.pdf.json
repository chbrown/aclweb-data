Contextual information--information about the world and about the history of a discourse-- influences not only an utterance's meaning, but even its preferred syntactic analysis [3,5,7,16]. Of course, context also influences the interpretation (or meaning in context) of the utterance, in which, for example, referring expressions have been resolved.","One possible solution is to move to an integrated system of semantic and pragmatic interpretation, defined recursively on syntactic analyses that are","1 This research has been funded by DARPA under Contract N00039-84-C-0524, and by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation as part of a coordinated research effort with the Center for the Study of Language and In-formation, Stanford University. We would like to thank David Israel, FLay Perrault, and Stuart Shieber for their helpful discussions regarding this work. neutral about those decisions that depend upon context. In this approach, a least-commitment grammar may be used to produce neutral representations that can be reconfigured later. Such a grammar might, for example, leave quantifiers in place [30], attach all prepositional phrases low and right [22], and bracket to the right all compound nominals. 2 These neutral analyses can then serve as input to a system that produces interpretations (and not meanings) in a nearly compositional manner, in that the interpretation of a phrase a is a function of the interpretations of its syntactic constituents together with its context of utterance.","This model of semantic interpretation assumes that contextual information is available whenever it is needed for deciding among alternative interpretations. However, this is often not the case: questions about the interpretation of some constituent of an utterance might be answerable only when information about the interpretation of syntactically distant constituents becomes available. Familiar examples of this can be found, for instance, in sentences with quantifier scoping ambiguities and in sentences that include intrasentential anaphora. The so-called donkey sentences [9] exhibit both these phenomena.","These difficulties do not necessitate a complete abandonment of compositionality. To take advantage of the generally compositional nature of semantic analysis without constraining unduly the order in which pragmatic decisions are made, we assign to phrases conditional interpretations,","2Tllere are reasons to suspect that ultinmtely syntactic analysis should be incorporated into the same stage of processing as semantic and pragnuLtic analysis; in particular, it is difficult to develop syntactically neutral representations for certain constructions such as conjunction.","3For simplicity, we shall use the term \"phrase\" to refer both to an entire utterance and to a constituent of an utterance, distinguishing betweeal the two only when needed. 75 which represent the dependence of a phrase's interpretation on assumptions about subsequent pragmatic processing. Conditional interpretations are built compositionally according to declaratively specified interpretation rules.","The interpretation mechanism we discuss here has been implemented in Prolog as part of the Candide system, a multimodal tool for knowledge acquisition. Incorporating both a graphical interface and a processor for English discourse, Candide allows a user of the Procedural Reasoning System (PITS) [10] to build and maintain procedural networks in a natural way. Procedural networks, an essential part of PRS's knowledge base, encode the information about procedures that is used by PItS for reasoning about and performing tasks in any given domain. The current version of Candide has been used to construct networks for malfunction procedures for NASA's space shuttle. Further details of the Candide system will be presented elsewhere [24]."]},{"title":"2 Conditional Interpretations","paragraphs":["In our approach to semantic and pragmatic interpretation, conditional interpretations separate the context-independent aspects of an interpretation from those that are context-dependent.

Applying the same discharge rule at different points in the interpretation process for some utterance may lead to alternative interpretations, as we shall illustrate with the examples in Sections 6 and 7.","Given a sentence and its syntactic analysis, the interpretation process applies semantic-interpretation and pragmatic-discharge rules, according to their applicability conditions, to construct the derivation of a complete interpretation of the sentence. In Candide, this process resembles a syntax-directed translation system [1]. Interpretation starts at the root node of the analysis tree. For each node of the tree, the interpretation process selects an appropriate semantic-interpretation rule and calls itself recursively for each of the node's daughters. Interpretations are constructed on return from the recursion, and pragmatic-discharge rules are optionally applied in a discharge cycle that follows each application to a node of a semantic-interpretation rule.","Lexical ambiguity, multiple semantic-interpretation rules for a given syntactic construction, op-tional application of discharge rules, and alternative ways of discharging a given assumption. are all sources of nondeterrninism in the interpretation process, which need to be somehow controlled. In Candide, we adopted four simple control tactics: overall depth-first search, early discharge of assumptions, breadth-first search for alternative bindings of a discharged parameter, and bounds on assumption percolation wherever it can be shown that an assumption would not be dischargeable outside a certain syntactic domain. For lack of space, a fuller discussion of these heuristics will be conducted elsewhere [24]."]},{"title":"4 The Discourse Context","paragraphs":["Pragmatic-discharge rules need access to a discourse context that encodes information about relevant world knowledge and the discourse history.

The local context generally contains detailed information about the immediately preceding sentence, 4 while the global context includes somewhat less detailed information about entities referred to throughout longer stretches of the discourse. We use the local context primarily for pronoun resolution, following the theory of centering introduced by Grosz et aL[12]. The global context is employed primarily for the resolution of definite anaphora, and is structured as a stack to make use of the theory of focusing. Each element of the global-context stack is itself a list of entries containing information about the entities referred to in a discourse segment [13]. We refer to the top element of the global context as the intermediate contezt.","Individual discharge rules used in processing a sentence can extend the immediate context for that sentence. For instance, the rule mentioned earlier that binds a parameter as a definite reference acids to the irmnediate context an entry for the entity to which the parameter is bound. When the assumption in (1) is discharged, resulting in the interpretation in (2), an entry for j must be added to the immediate context. The entry will include the sort of j (jet) and the surface position of that phrase in the sentence (subject).","The discourse context must also be updated after each sentence has been processed. In the simplest case, tile update will be quite straightforward, as illustrated in Figure 1: the current immediate context will become the new local context, while a subset of the information encoded in the immediate context will be also added to the intermediate context (the topmost element of the global-context stack).

Alternative approaches that attempt to address these interactions include discourse-representation theory (DRT) [14,18] and Barwise's partial-valuation approach [2].","In DRT, the interpretation of a sentence is derived in a compositional manner from an intermediate representation called a discourse-representation structure (DRS). Itowever, the rules that have been developed for constructing DRSs are not themselves compositional. Accord-ing to the DRS-construction rules presented by Kamp [18], the DRS for a phrase is found only as a by-product of finding the DRS for the embedding discourse. In particular, DRS-construction rules apply only after the relative scope of noun phrases and anaphoric bindings have been determined. It is conceivable that our notion of conditional interpretation might be reexpressible in DRT terms, leading to a compositional system for DRS construction.","Barwise [2] uses the notion of partial valuation, that is, partial assignments of values to variables, to analyze the sorts of interactions exemplified by the donkey sentences. Similar comments apply to Webber's work [29]. In addition, none of the afore-mentioned accounts has been concerned with as wide a range of phenomena as is currently haw died in Candide. 12 One of the motivations for our work has been to see how Barwise's direct-interpretation approach could be turned into a two-stage one in which phrases are first \"compiled\" into conditional interpretations, which are then \"executed\" by applying pragmatic-discharge rules.","Finally, several other computational systems developed recently are concerned with interactions between context and meaning, especially Pundit [8,21] and Tacitus [17,16]. Both these systems have emphasized solutions to such difficult pragmatic problems as reference resolution. In particular, the Pundit project has made notable progress on the question of resolving missing arguments, while the Tacitus group has done the same for questions involving the determination of implicit relations. In Candide, solutions to such pragmatic problems should be encoded in the procedures that discharge assumptions; in future versions of the system the discharge procedures might be improved applying some of the techniques developed in this other work. What neither Pundit nor Tacitus has been concerned with is the question of how to build interpretations composition-12To date, we have included capabilitea for processing reference and coreference (definlte and indefinite noun phraaea, pronouns, poeatesaivea, and proper nouns), quantifier scope, compound nominals, prepmltional-phrase at-tachment, and certain types of underapecified relations (e.g., maln-verb \"have\"). We shall report on these mecha, nisms elsewhere [24]. 84 ally. Both systems first build partial interpretations of sentences, and then attempt to solve a collection of associated pragmatic problems. Pundit does the latter in an overly constrained way, with the result that it cannot handle systematically the sort of interactions exemplified by the donkey sentences. Tacitus, on the other hand, casts all the pragmatic problems as theorems to be proved; the result is an underconstrained control strategy. We believe that the generally compositional approach developed in Candide enables us to avoid both these extremes."]},{"title":"9 Further Work","paragraphs":["We have developed a mechanism of semantic and pragmatic interpretation that relaxes the constraints of compositional semantics just-enough to allow pragmatic information to play its necessary role in the derivation of sentence interpretations. Central to the mechanism are conditional interpetations, which allow us to separate constraints on interpretation that depend only on syntactic structure, represented by the sense component of the conditional interpretation, from those that depend on pragmatic choices, represented by the assumption component. The interpretation process is carried out by a combination of semantic-interpretation rules, which build conditional interpretations of phrases on the basis of lexical and syntactic information, and pragmatic-discharge rules, which satisfy assumptions on the basis of discourse and domain information. While the system we have implemented deals with a variety of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, of which only a few were discussed in this paper, it can only be seen as a first limited instantiation of a system architecure that requires much further work. We shall mention now a few of the directions that might be pursued in developing the architecture further.","At the most theoretical level, it is interesting to note the formal similarity of our interpretation rules to rules in \"deductive ~ models of programruing language semantics [25]. It is also interesting to consider the connection between conditional interpretations and the relational theory of meaning from situation semantics [3]. These two similarities might be fruitful in developing a semantic justification for our formal interpretation rules in terms of constraints on interpretation relations.","The applicability of discharge rules depends in many cases on the compatibility of expected and supplied sorts for relation arguments. In general, these sorts may be parameterized by assumption parameters, and some semantic interpretation problems not considered here suggest that higher-order parameterized types, instead of first-order sorts, may be needed. A suitable notion of type subsumption for such higher-order parameterized types [15] would be useful. More generally, the whole architecture would benefit from a semantically grounded treatment of parameters and parameterized objects.","Other pragmatic processes associated with discharge rules, such as those for reference resolution, also must be able to reason with parameterized objects--for example in checking the uniqueness of a dependent object relative to arbitrary parameter assignments. Ultimately, the proper treatment of singular noun phrases in context will require a closer connection between assumptions and [parameterized] fragments of the discourse context."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] A.
