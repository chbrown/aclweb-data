Although the N]gel grammar does contain a few inquiries that are termed interpersonal, there has not been enough work here really to determine whether the inquiry framework is going to provide the took necessary for capturing the kind of meaning this involves.","If the inquiry framework can be used in thk area also, then we can use it to investigate the knowledge base distinctions that will need to be represented in order to control interpersonal grammatical resources. This is a methodology that has already been applied with great success to ideational meaning in the Nlgel project. There, projecting through the inquiry interface from the grammar on to context has allowed for the construction of a domain independent knowledge organization hierarchy called the upper structure (e.g. Moore and Arens, 1985). Since inquiries rely upon specific semantic distinctions to control the grammatical choices for which they are responsible, the for-mulation of a chooser's inquiries amounts to a constraiut on the organization and content of the knowledge base and text planning that needs to be done of the following form: if the ling~stic distinction for which the present chooser is responsible is to be available as a resource for the text planner to exploit, then that text planner and the knowledge base have at least to support the semantic distinctions identified by the inquiries that constitute that chooser.","Thus, the semantic distinctions revealed to be necessary for the implementation of the inquiries that control ideational choices have guided the construction of the upper structure. To extend the kind of organizational resource the upper structure provides into the interpersonal arena would therefore be very beneficial for our understanding of what needs to be included in the interpersonal area of the knowledge base and the text planning process and so would promise to improve the range and quality of the texts we can generate."]},{"title":"2 A new domain: The ex- pression of politeness in Japanese clauses","paragraphs":["As part of a proposed text generation project in Japanese at Kyoto University, some fragments of a systemlc-functlonal grammar of Japanese have been constructed (Bateman, 1985; Bateman et aL, 1987). In Japanese discourse the grammatical expression of various interpersonal relationships is quite common. Gaining control of these resources was therefore an ideal way to test further the applicability of the inquiry semantics approach in a domain which was clearly not ideational","The particular area of interpersonal meaning examined here ls that concerned with the expression of appropriate degrees of humility and respect in references to one's own actions, to those of one's audience, and to those of third parties. Although the general rule of being humble about one's own actions and respectful about those of others is complicated by a number of factors, even thk simplest case presents problems as far as controlling the grammar is concerned. In this section, I will briefly describe some of the forms in-voived and, in the next, how these create problems for the inquiry and chooser framework as used in l~geL","A variety of clause forms are regularly employed in Japanese for the expression of interpersonal meanings related to 'politeness'. For example, the 'demotion' of the process information to a nominal-like form preceded by a normal nominal honorific prefix (e.g. o, as in o-e]~: 'honorable' tea) supported by an auxiliary verb such as Juru, 'to do', or naru, 'to become', often explicitly expresses the relative social statuses of the participants involved and the fact of those participants' acknowledgment of those statuses. This we can see in, o-VERB suru humble referral to do seif's action o-VERB- n/ naru respectful referral becomes to action of other o-VERB dssu more distant respect • be for action of other","Another type of form involves combinations of morphemes that conventionall~, represent distinctive ways of being polite. Here, there are a number of different interpersonal speech act types that may be performed. For example, both the expression of gratitude for fa~ yore received and the expression of the ~v/nO of favors","virtually obligatory in normal discourse; this is achieved by appending one of the many verbs expressing 'to give/receive' to the process performed. These verbs are highly sensitive to relative social positions and the perspective taken on the action performed (e.g. Kuno and Kaburaki, 1977; Inoue, 1979) and this aspect of their meaning is carried over for the expression of favors done or perceived. 1 Typical combina~ tions also express po]ite ways of seeking permission for actions; one here modifies the action to be performed by means of the morphemes for causation/allowing, receiving a favor, wizhlng for, and thinking: a rough literal gloss of this form would be along the lines of 'I think I want to humbly receive from you your allowing me to do X'.","Thus, the following clause forms are also commonly required in normal discourse:","lThus, for verbs corresponding to the English 'give' and 'receive', there are seven Japanese verbs in common usage and these differ in most part according to the relative social positions of the participants in the giving. 148 VERB-giving doing a 'favor': respectfully or humbly","VERB-recelving receiving a 'favor': respectfully or humbly","[VERB-cause-receive-wish]-t hink deferential seeking of permission This by no means exhausts the range of formo that are relevant to discussions of politeness, respect, and humility in present-day Japanese, but it will be sufficient as an indication of the kinds of structures and meanings addressed within the present grammar, s It should also be noted that there are different 'dimensions' of politeness involved in the use of these forms; for example the clause yoku kite- kuretane well come favor to speaker tag which means 'thanks for coming' is in the familiar level of speech form, i.e. it could only be used between people who are on familiar terms. It is nevertheless 8Jill necessary for the favor being done to be explicitly acknowledged; not expressing it would result in a clause that would often be inappropriate. The present grammar also treats the range of distinctions that arise along this 'famlliar'/'polite' levels of speech dimension but this will not be of immediate concern here.","The differences in meaning that these alternative politeness-related forms represent need to be made available to a text generation system. Thls may be done by offering a set of grammatical resources that serves to express interpersonal knowledge about the interactive situation. As has been the case in the systemic grammar approach employed in Nigel generally, it is desirable to factor the knowledge and meanings to be expressed in terms of a structured set of alternatives that may be selected from straightforwardly; for ideational meanings this is provided by the upper structure. The internal organization of the systemic grammar then takes care of the construction of linguistic structures appropriate to those meanings. Now we want to be able to do the same with the linguistic structures described here. Information which will need to be held in appropriately constructed speaker and hearer models should be factored according to the in-quirles that are necessary for driving the grammatical distinctions concerned. A problem arises here, how-ever, in that it is not possible to state within N]gel's grammar and chooser framework that the alternative grammatical forms available for the expression of po-","2A very good introduction and summary of the range of meanings and forms devoted to aspects of politeness in Japanese is given in Migutani and Misutani (1987). liteness are alternatives at all. The next section explains why this is so."]},{"title":"3 Problems with the existing formalization of chooser- grammar interaction","paragraphs":["The principle problem encountered with controlling the deployment of structures such as those introduced in the previous section by means of a chooser mechanism k that, formerly, all chooser decisions have been local. Each chooser determines which grammatical feature is to be selected as appropriate for the context of use from a single point of minimal grammatical alternation. For example, the grammatical aVatern that presents the minimal grammatical alterna-tion in Japanese between having a constituent express a circumstance of location, and not having such a constituent, has a chooser associated with it which interrogates the knowledge base and text plan by means of its inquiries in order to see which of the two alternatives is applicable in the case at hand. If a location is to be expressed a grammatical ?eature is selected that entails the insertion of a constituent characterized functionally as a location; if there is no location to be expressed than a feature which does not have such an entailment is selected. This selection between the alternative grammatical choices, or features, that are offered by a sinOle grammatical system is the only influence that the chooser of that system is permitted to have on the generation process. Thus, in the location case, the effects of the chooser responsible for insertion or not of a location constituent are entirely local to the portion of the generation process delimited by the location system of the grammar.","With the politeness forms we seem to be faced again wlth a set of alternative meanings concerning level and type of politeness to be expressed. However, the problem as far as the previously implemented view of the possible effects of choosers is concerned is that these alternatives correspond to no single points of grammatical alternation. For example, if the process of reading (yomu) is to be expressed but we want to make a selection of politeness-related meaning between a simple respectful reference to another's actions and a more distanced, indirect and reserved respectful reference, then the choice of appropriate forrn~ for that process is between ovomi nl naru HONORIFIC reading CASE becoming and o-Voyr6 desu HONORIFIC reading COPULA-be 149 Now, while the distinction in meaning may be captured by a simple scale of the 'directness' of the sentence that is appropriate for the particular interactive situation in which it is to be used, there is no grammatical system in the grammar of Japanese that offers a direct choice between these two clause structures. The former structure is similar to the typical use of the verb 'become' as in Z-hi naru, 'to become X'; the latter is similar to clauses such as X deau, 'it is X'. They are not normally, e.g. in contexts not involving this particular contrast of politeness, in grammatical contrast.","The distinction is, thenl in the use. and meaning of the structures rather than in their grammatical construction. Indeed, such distinctions may often crosscut the distinctions that are made in the grammar; this is simply to accept that the semantic and pragmatic distinctions that a language draws need not be matched one-for-one by corresponding minimal points of grammatical alternation. The levels of coding are distinct and incorporate distinct aspects of the meaning and construction of the linguistic units involved.","It is not then possible to associate a 'politeness' chooser with a grammatical system as is done with the choosers for ideational meanings because there is no grammatical system of 'politeness' to which it may be attached. A simple choice between minimal alternatives of politeness can result in radically different grammatlcal structures that differ by virtue of many features. This means that politeness of this kind can-not be made available as a controllable expressive resource for a text planner within the chooser framework as it is implemented within the Nigel project."]},{"title":"4 An implemented solution","paragraphs":["In order to meet this problem and to allow full control of politeness phenomena, the following extension was implemented within the context of the computational systemic grammar framework supported at Kyoto.","The chooser framework is maintained as a decision tree that selects between minimal points of semantic alternation. However, it is no longer the case that this needs to be held in a one-to-one correspondence with the minimal alternations that the grammar network represents. The possibility of distinct patterns of organization at the two levels, as would be claimed by systemic linguistics proper, is therefore captured. Accordingly, any chooser is permitted to make any number of selections of grammatical features from anywhere in the grammatical network. Choosers are thereby permitted to take on more of the organizational work required during text planning.","This extension made it possible to construct a chooser decision tree that interrogates the text need concerning precisely those distinctions in meaning required to ascertain which level and form of politeness to employ. The inquiries of this decision tree are free to ask all the questions related to the aspects of the social relationships of the participants in the speech situation that are necessary without being concerned about where in the grammatical network the consequences of those questions will be felt. This makes that reasoning available in a modular and easily comprehensible form. The result of any particular path through the decision tree is a set of grammatical features that the grammatical product being generated as a whole must bear. This can therefore call for very different structural results to be selected which differ by many grammatical features drawn from many distinct grammatical points of alternation° The present politeness 'chooser', or decision tree, has around 15 decision points where a distinct inquiry needs to be put to the knowledge base. These ]nqulrles are still at the stage of informal approximation.","For example, after traversal of the decision tree has already established a number of important facts concerning the text need, including that the actor is the hearer, that the situation is not one classifiable as for-many 'o/~clal', that there is considerable social 'distance' between the speaker and hearer, among others, the simple semantic distinction glossable in English as","Is the subject-matter o/ the procssa ~uch","that additional reserve should be ahownf is drawn. If the text need is classifiable as requir-ing a yes-response to this inquiry then the grammatlcal features: identi/ying, intensive, and speeialframmalical-pla¢ing are constrained to appear. If a no-classification is possible, then the grammatical features: becomlng-attribute, intensive, and special-grammatical-placing appear. The former set results in clauses with a functional structure of the form: e-VERB dssu HONORIFIC X COPULA-be which, as we have seen, expresses additional distance between the action and its performance as required. The latter set is sufficient to constrain the structure produced to be of the form: o-VERB ni naru HONORIFIC X CASE becoming which is the less indirect expression of respect.","By way of contrast, the portion of the 'politeness' chooser that is concerned with the expression of humility, rather than respect, is shown in figure 1.","Formerly, any such decision tree would only have been able to call for the appearance of a single grammatlcal feature; here any number of features may be selected (as indicated by the '++' operator in figure 1) during the decision tree's traversaL Modelling the kind of non-local organization inherent in the expression of politeness would therefore have required numerous decision trees split according to the grammat-"]},{"title":"150","paragraphs":["IS the action independent Of otJlerS, the audience In particular?
