Box 517","Paoli, PA ABSTRACT This paper describes an analysis of telegraphic fragments as regular structures (not errors) handled by rn~n~nal extensions to a system designed for processing the standard language. The modular approach which has been implemented in the Unlsys natural language processing system PUNDIT is based on a division of labor in which syntax regulates the occurrence and distribution of elided elements, and semantics and pragumtics use the system's standard mechankms to interpret them. 1. INTRODUCTION","In t]~ paper we discuss the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of fragmentary sentences in English. Our central claim is that these sentences, which have often been classified in the literature with truly erroneous input such as misspellings (see, for example, the work discussed in ~wnsny1980, Thompson1980, Kwnsny1981, Sondheimer1983, Eustman1981, Jensen1983]), are regular structures which can be processed by adding a small number of rules to the grammar and other components of the system. The syntactic regularity of fragment structures has been demonstrated elsewhere, notably in ~/larsh1983, Hirschman1983]; we will focus here upon the regularity of these structures across all levels of linguistic representation. Because the syntactic component regularizes these structures into a form almost indistinguishable from full","tThis work has been supported in part by DARPA under contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered by the Office of Naval Research; by National Science Foundation contract DCR-85-02205; and by Independent R~D fuudinz from Systens Development Corporation, now part of Unisys Corporation. Approved for public release, distribution unlimited. assertions, the semantic and pragmatic components are able to interpret them with few or no extensions to existing mechanisms. This process of incremental regularisation of fragment structures~is possible only within a linguistically modular system. Furthermore, we claim that although fra~nents may occur more frequently in specialised sublanguages than in the standard grammar, they do not provide evidence that sublanguages are based on gra,~m*tical principles fundamentally different from those underlying standard languages, as claimed by ~itspatrick1986], for example.","This paper is divided into five sections. The introductory section defines fragments and describes the scope of our work. In the second section, we consider certain properties of sentence fragments which motivate a modular approach. The third section describes our implementation of processing for fragments, to which each component of the system makes a distinct contribution. The fourth section describes the temporal analysis of fragments. Finally, the fifth section discusses the status of sublanguages characterized by these telegraphic constructions.","We define fragments as regular structures which are distinguished from full assertions by a missing element or elements which are normally syntactically obligatory. We distinguish them from errors on the basis of their regularity and consistency of interpretation, and because they appear to be generated intentionally. We are not denying the existence of true errors, nor that proceasing sentences containing true errors may require sophisticated techniques and deep reasoning. Rather, we are saying that fragments are distinct from errors, and can be handled in a quite general fashion, with minimal extensions to normal processing. Because we base the definition of /ragmer, t on the absence of a syntactically 7 obligatory element, noun phrases without articles are not considered to be fragmentary, since this om;~sion is conditioned heavily by sem•ntlc factors such •s the mass vs. count distinction. However, we have implemented a pr•gm•tlcaliy based treatment of noun phrases without determiners, which is briefly discussed in Section 3.","Fragments, then, •re defined here as elislons. We describe below the way in which these ore;••ions are detected and subsequently 'filled in' by different modules of the system.","The problem of processing fragmentary sentences has arisen in the context of a l•rge-scnle natural language processing research project conducted at UNIsYs over the past five years ~almer1986, Hirschman1986, Dowding1987, Dahl1987]. We have developed a portable, broad-coverage text-processing system, PUNDIT. 1 Our initial applications have involved v•rlons message types, including: field engineering reports for maintenance of computers; Navy maintenance reports (Casualty Reports, or CASR~S) for starting air compressors; Navy intelligence reports (~m~roRm); trouble and f•U~ reports (TEas) from Navy Vessels; and recently we have examined several medical domains (radiology reports, COmments fields from • DNA sequence database). At least half the sentences in these corpora are fragments; Table 1 below gives • summary of the fragment content of three domains, showing the percent of centers which are classified as fragments. (Centers comprise all sentence types: assertions, questions, fragments, and so forth.) Table 1. Fragments in three domaiu~ Total centers Percent fragments CASP.EPS 153 53% ]~s.J~F OP.~ 41 7S% TFR 35 51%","The PUNDIT system is highly modular: it consists of a syntactic component, based on string grammar and restriction grammar [Sager1981, Hirschman1985]; a semantic component, based on inference-driven mapping, which decomposes predicating expressions into predicates and thematic roles ~almer1983, Palmerlg85]; and a pragmatic• component which processes both referring expressions ~)ah11986], and temporal expressions ~assonneau1987, Passonneau1988]. 1 Prolog UNDer#h;~isO ol l~tzgr~zd Teal 2. DIVISION OF LABOR AMONG SYN-TAX, SEMANTICS, AND PRAGMATICS","We argue here that sentence fragments provide a strong case for linguistically modular systems such as PUNDIT, because such elislons have distinct consequences •t different levels of linguistic description. Our approach to fragments can be snmm•rlsed by saying that syntax detects 'holes' in surface structure and creates dummy elements as piaceholders for the missing elements; semantics and pragmatics interpret these placeholders at the appropriate point in sentence processing, utllising the same mechanisms for fragments •s for full assertions.","Syntax regulates the holes. Fragment eUsions cannot be accounted for in purely semantlc/pragmatic terms. This is evidenced by the fact that there •re syntactic restrictions on om;nlons; the acceptability of a sentence fragment hinges on gramm•tlcal factors rather than, e.g., how readily the elided material can be inferred from context. For example, the discourse Old howe too small. *New one ~ be larger titan _","was (where the elided object of t~an is understood to be old howe) is Ul-formed, whereas a comparable discourse First repairman ordered new air eonditiom~r. Second repairman will inltali_ (where the elided object of inJto//is understood to be air eoaditloasr) is acceptable. In both cases above, the referent of the elided element is available from context, and yet only the second elilpsis sounds well-formed. Thus •n appreciation of where such ellipses may occur is part of the lingu, t/e knowledge of speakers of English and not simply a function of the contextual salience of elided elements. Since these restrictions concern structure rather than content, they would be d;~cult or impossible to state in • system such •s a 'pure' semantic grammar which only recognised such omissions at the level of semantic/pragmatic representation.","Furthermore, it matters to semantics and pragmatic• HOW an argument is omitted. The syntactic component must tell sem•ntlcs whether a verb argument is re;Ring bec•use the verb is used intransitively (as in The tiger was eating, where the patient argument is not specified) or because of • fragment ellipsis (as in Eaten bl/ a tiger, where the patient argument is missing because the subject of a passive sentence has been elided). Only in the latter case does the missing argument of eat function •s •n antecedent subsequently in the discourse: compare Eaten by a tiler. Had mcreamed bloody murder right before tKe attack (where the victim and the screamer are the same) vs. TKe tiger teas eating. Had screamed bloody murder right before tKe attack (where it is dlmcnlt or impossible to get the reading in which the victim and the screamer are the same). Semantles and pragmstles fill the holes. In PUNDIT's treatment of fragments, each component contributes exactly what is appropriate to the specification of elided elements. Thus the syntax does not attempt to 'fill in' the holes that it discovers, unless that information is completely predictable given the structure at hand. Instead, it creates • dummy element. If the missing element is an elided subject, then the dummy element created by the syntactic component is assigned a referent by the pragmatics component. This referent is then assigned • thematic role by the semantics component llke any other referent, and is subject to any selectlonal restrictions atomcinted with the thematic role assigned to it. If the missing element is a verb, it is specified in either the syntactic or the semantic component, depending upon the fragment type. |. PROCESSING FRAGMENTS IN PUNDIT","Although the initial PUNDIT system wu designed to handle full, as opposed to fragmentary, sentences, one of the interesting results of our work is that it has required only very minor changes to the system to handle the basic fragment types introduced below. These included the additions of: 6 fragment BNF definitions to the grammar (a 5~ increase in grammar size) and 7 context-sensitive restrictions (a 12~o increase in the number of restrictions); one semantic rule for the interpret••ion of the dummy element inserted for missing verbs; • minor modification to the reference resolution mechanism to treat elided noun phrases llke pronouns; and a small addition to the temporal processing mechanism to handle tenseless fragments. The small number of changes to the semantic and pragmatic components reflects the fact that these components are not 'aware' that they are interpreting fragmentary structures, because the regularlsatlon performed by the syntactic component renders them structurally indistinguishable from full assertions.","Fragments present parsing problems because the ellipsis creates degenerate structures. For example, • sequence such as cheer negative can be analysed as a 'sero-copuia' fragment meaning the chest X-ray im negative, or • noun compound llke tKe nefative of the ehe,L This is compounded by the lack of deriv•tional and inflectional morphology in English, so that in many cases it may not be possible to distinguish • noun from • verb (repair parts) or a past tense from a past participle (decreased medication). Adding fragment definitions to the grammar (especially if determiner om;Mion is •]so allowed) results in •n explosion of ambiguity. This problem has been noted and discussed by Kwasny and Sondheimer ~wasny1981]. Their solution to the problem is to suggest special relax••ion techniques for the analysis of fragments. However, in keeping with our thesis that fragments are normal constructions, we have chosen the alternative of constraining the explosion of parses in two ways. The first is the addition of • control structure to implement a i;m;ted form of preference via 'unbacktr•ckable' or (xor). This binary operator tries its second argument only if its first argument does not lead to • parse. In the grammar, this is used to prefer \"the most structured\" alternative. That is, full assertions are preferred over fragments - if an assertion or other non-fragment parse is obtained, the parser does not try for • fragment parse.","The second mechanism that helps to control generation of incorrect parses is selection. PUNDIT applies surface selectlonal constraints incrementally, as the parse is built up ~ang1988]. For example, the phrase air compressor would NOT be allowed as • serocopnla because the construction air is eompree#or would fall selection, s 8.1. Fragment Types","The fragment types currently treated in PUNDIT include the following: Zerocopula: a subject followed by • predicate, differing from a full clause only in the absence of • verb, as in ImpeUor blade tip erosion eviden~ Tvo (tensed verb + object): a sentence m;~ing its subject, as in Believe the coupling from diesel to lac lube oil pump to be reheated;","s Similarly, the assertion parse for the title of this paper would fail selection (sentences don't frngment structures), permitting the serocopuin fragment pLrse.

The CONTENT of these dummy elements, however, is left unspecified in most cases, to be filled in by the semantic or pragmatic components of the system.","Tvo. We consider first the tvo, a subject-less tensed clause such as Operate, norton/Ill. This is parsed as a sequence of tensed verb and object: no subject is inferred at the level of surface structure. In the ISR, the missing subject is fined in by the dnmmy element elided. At the level of the ISR, then, the fragment operates norma/f~/ differs from a full assertion such as ]t operates normaU~/ only by virtue of the element elided in place of sn overt pronoun. The element elided is asslgned a referent which subsequently fills a thematic role, exactly as if it were a pronoun; thus these two sentences get the same treatment from semantics and reference resolutlon~)ah11986, Palmer1988].","Elided subjects in the domains we have looked at often refer to the writer of the report, so one strategy for interpreting them might be simply to assume that the filler of the elided sub-Sect is the writer of the report. This simple strategy is not snlBclent in all cases. For example, in the CASREPS corpus we observe sequences such as the following, where the filler of the elided sub-Sect is provided by the previous sentence, and is clearly not the writer of the report."]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["Problem appears to be caused by one or more of two hydraulic valves.

We demonstrated in section 2 that elided subjects, but not semantically implicit arguments, are expected loci (or forward-looklng centers [Gross1988]) for later sentences. 10","The basic assumption underlying this treatment is that the pragmatic analysis for elided subjects should be as re;re;far to that of pronouns as possible. One piece of supporting evidence for this assumption is that in many languages, such as Japanese [Gundel1980, l-nnds1983, Kameyama1985] the functional equivalent of unstressed pronouns in English is a sere, or elided noun phrase, s If seres in other languages can correspond to unstressed pronouns in English, then we hypothesise that seres in a sublunguage of English can correspond functionally to pronouns in standard English. In addition, since proceasing of pronouns is independently motlvated, it is a priori simpler to try to fit elision Into the pronominal paradigm, if possible, than to create an entirely separate component for handling elision. Under this hypothesis, then, tvo fragments represent 8~ply a realization of a grammatical strategy that is generally available to languages of the world, s","Zeroeopula. For a serocopuia (e.g., D~Jk bad), the surface parse tree rather than the ISR inserts a dnmmy verb, In order to enforce subcategorization constraints on the object. And In the ISR, this null verb is 'filled in' as the verb be. It is possible to fill in the verb at this level because no further semantic or pragmatic information is required in order to determ;ne its content. 7 Hence the representation for D~k bad is nearly indistinguishable from that assigned to the corresponding/)/Ik/s bad; the only difference is in the absence of tense from the former. If the null verb represents an~llsLry be, then, like an overt an~I;ary, it does not appear in the regularised form. Sac .failing thus receives a regularisatlon with /ai/ as the main verb. Thus the null verb inserted in the syntax is treated in the ISR ill a fashion exactly parallel to the treatment of overt","t Stressed pronouns in Eugiish corrupond to overt pronouns in lanzua,res like Japanese. u discummd in [Gundell980, Gundellg81J, and [Dahl1982J.","t An interesting hypothesis, discussed by Gundel and Kameyama, is that the more topic prominent a language is, the more likely it is to have sero-NP's.

The syntactic parse tree for this fragment type contains no empty elements; it is a regular noun phrase, labeled as an nstg_f~aK. The ISR transforms it into a VSO sequence. This is done by treating it as the sub-Sect of an element empty_verb; in the semantic component, the subject of empty_verb is treated as the sole argument of a predicate exlstentlsl(X). As a result, the nstg_frag Fai/ure o[ see and a synonymous assertion such as Failure o.f sac occurred are eventually mapped onto s;rnil~r final representations by virtue of the temporal semantics of empty_verb and of the bead of the noun phrase.","Objbe_/~ag and predicate. These are isointed complements; the same devices described above are utillsed in their processing. The surface parse tree of these fragment types contains no empty elements; as with seroeopula, the unteused verb be is inserted into the ISR; as with tvo, the dnr-my subject elided is also inserted in the ISR, to be filled in by reference resolution. Thus the simple adjective Inoperatiee will receive an ISR quite s;rn;lsr to that of .~e/,Ise/it ~ inoperative.","ObJ_gap_~agment. The final fragment type to be considered here is the elided noun phrase object. Such object elisioca occur more widely in English in the context of instructions, as in Handle _ udtA sere. Cookbooks are especially well-known respositories of elided objects, presumably because they are filled with instructions. Object elision also occurs in telegrarnmatic sublanguages generally, as in Took _ under .~re ud~ m,e~es from the Navy sighting messages. If these omissions occurred only in direct object position following the verb, one might argue for a lexlcal treatment; that is, such omissions could be treated as a lexlcal process of intransitivisation rather than by explicitly representing gaps in the syntactic structure. However, noun phrase objects of prepositions may also be omitted, as in FraCas. Do not tamper ~th _. Thus we have chosen to represent such elislons with an explicit surface structure gap. This gap is permitted in most contexts where nstKo (noun phrase object) is found: as a direct object of the verb and as an object of a preposition. 8 In PUNDIT, elided objects are","s Note, however, that there are some restrictions on the occurrence of these elements. They seem not to occur in 11 permitted only in a fragment type called obj_gap_fkagment, which, llke other fragment types, may be attempted only if an assertion parse has failed. Thus a sentence such as Pressure was c/stressing rap~ffy will never be analysed as containing an elided object, because there is a semantically acceptable assertion parse. In contrust, Johts ~as deere~inf gr~uag[I/ will receive an elided object analysis, paraphrasable as Joh~ w~ deere~i~f IT gradua~v, because Jo~n is not an acceptable subject of intransitive Jeere~e; only pressure or some equally mensurable entity may be said to decrease. This selectional failure of the assertion parse permits the elided object analysis.","Our working hypothesis for determ;u;uS the reference of object gaps is that they are, just llke subject gaps, appropriately treated as pronouns. However, we have not as yet seen extensive data relevant to this hypothesis, and it remains subject to further testing.","These, then, are the fragment types currently Inzplemented In PUNDIT. As mentioned above, we do not consider noun phrases without determ;-ers to be fragments, because it is not clear that the missing element is symf~f~e~y obligatory. The Interpretation of these noun phrases is treated as a pragmatic problem. In the style of speech characteristic of the CASREPs, determ;uers are nearly always omitted. Their function must therefore be replaced by other mechanisms. One possible approach to this problem would be to have the system try to determine what the determ;uer would have been, had there been one, insert it, and then resume processing as if the detervn;ner had been there all along. This approach was taken by ~V[arsh1981]. However, it was rejected here for two reasons. The first is that it was judged to be more error-prone than simply equipping the reference resolution component with the ability to handle noun phrases without determiners directly. 0 The second reason predicative objects, in double dative constructions, and, perhaps, in sentence adjuncts rather than arguments of the verb. (Thus compare P4fiesf eertf d/..Do sot opersfe os with Opersti~ room cloud os Snadslt. Do nor pe~om ~rgcIT oz..) One po~ibility is that these expreruione can occur only where a definite pronoun would also be acceptable. In general, object pps seem mcet acceptable where they represent an argument ot n verb, either as direct object or u object of a preposition selected for by a verb.","This ability would be required in any case, should the system be extended to process languages which do not have for not selecting this approach is that it would el|m;uate the distinction between noun phrases which originally had a determiner and those which did not. At some point in the development of the system it may become necessary to use this information°","The basic approach currently taken is to assume that the noun phrase is definite, that is, it triggers a search through the discourse context for a previously mentioned referent. If the search succeeds, the noun phrase is assumed to refer to that entity. If the search fans, z new discourse entity is created.","In summary, then, these fragment types are parsed 'as is' at the surface level; dummy elements are inserted Into the ISR to bring fragments into close parallelism with fuil assertions. Because of the resulting structural s;m;l~rlty between these two sentence types, the semantic and pragmatic components can apply exactly the same Interpretive processes to both fragments and assertions, using preexisting mechanisms to 'flu In' the holes detected by syntax. 4. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF FI~G-MENTS","Temporal processing of fragmentary sentences further supports the efficacy of a modular approach to the analysis of these strings. 1° In PUNDIT'S current message domains, a single assumption leads to assignment of present or past tense in untensed fragments, depending on the nspectual properties of the fragment, lz This assumption is that the messages report on actual situations which are of present relevance. Consequently, the default tense assignment is present unless th~ prevents assigning an actual time. 1~","For sentences having progressive grammatical aspect or statlve lexical aspect, the assignment of present tense always permits interpreting articl~","1°For a discussion of the temporal component, of. ~Parsonsoan1987, PassonnenulgSnJ.","u$ince the rye fragment is tensed, its input to the time component is indistinguishable from that of a full mntence.","z~Pundit do~ not currently take full advantage of modifier information that could indicate whether a situation has real time associated with it (e.,r, pot4ntial sac tinware), or whether a situation is past or present (e.g., sac 1~ure yenteeday; pump now opera/~ng so~m~y). 12 a situation as having an actual time ~assonneau1987]. Thus, • present tense reading is always assigned to an untensed progressive fragment, such as pressure decreasing; or an untensed serocopula with • non-partlclplal complement, such as pump i~operatlee.","A non-progressive serocopula fragment containing • cognitive state verb, as in /a~ure believed due to wow bushings, is assigned • present tense reading. However, if the lexlc•l verb has non-stative aspect, Is e.g., tss~ eomluetsd (process) or new sac received (transition event) then assignment of present tense conflicts with the assumption that the mentioned situation has occurred or is occurring. The slmple present tense form of verbs in this class is given • habitual or iterative reading. That is, the corresponding full sentences in the present, tss~ are conducted and nelo sac ~ reeelved, are interpreted as referring to types of situations that tend to occur, rather than to situations that have occurred. In order to permit actual temporal reference, these fragments are assigned • past tense reading.","Nst~/~ag represents another case where present tense may conflict with lexical aspect. If • n nmtg_frag refers to • non-st•tire situation, the situation is interpreted as having an actual past time. This can be the case if the head of the noun phrase is • nom;nallsation, and is derived from • verb in the process or tr•nsltlon event aspectual class. Thus, ineestlgation of problem would be interpreted as an actual process which took place prior to the report time, and ~irnilurly, sac/ai/ure would be interpreted •s • past transi-t|on event. On the other hand, an nstff~raJ¢ which refers to • st•tire situation, as in i~opera- ~iee pump, is assigned present tense. 5. RELATION OF FRAGMENTS TO THE LARGER G~","An important finding which has emerged from the investigation of sentence fragments in a variety of sublanguage domains is that the linguistic properties of these constructions are largely domain-independent."]},{"title":"A~nrn|rlg","paragraphs":["that these sentence fragments remain constant across different sublanguages, what is their relationship to the language at large?
