The work is ~n'nmtly funded by IBM and carried out in collaboration with colleagues at IBM UK (W'~) and IBM Yorktown Heights. The paper will focus on the lexicon component of the word raging system, the UCREL grammar, the datal~zlks of parsed sentences, and the tools that have been written to support developmem of these comlm~ems. ~ wozk has applications to speech technology, sl~lfing conectim, end other areas of natural lmlguage pngessil~ ~y, our goal is to provide a language model using transin'ca statistics to di.~.nbigu~ al.:mative 1~ for a speech .:a~nicim device. 1. Text Corpora","Historically, the use of text corpora to provide mnp/ncal data for tes~g gramm.~e.al theories has been regarded as important to varying degn~es by philologists and linguists of differing pe~msions. The use of co~us citations in ~-~,~ma~ and dictionaries pre~t~ electronic da~a processing (Brown. 1984: 34). While most of the generative 8r~-,-a,iam of the 60S and 70S ignored corpus ant,,: the inc~tsed power Of the new t~mlogy ,wenlw.l~ points the way to new applications of computerized text cmlxEa in dictiona~ makln~_: style checking and speech w, cognition. Compmer corpora present the computational linguist with the diversity and complexity of real language which is more challenging for testing language models than intuitively derived examples. Ultimately grammatl must be judged by their ability to contend with the teal facts of language and not just basic constructs extrapolated by grammm/ans. 2. Word Tagging","The system devised for automatic word tagging or part of speech selection for processing nmn/ng Enfli~ text, known as the Constituent-Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS) (Garside et aL, 1987) serves as the basis for the current work. The word tagging system is an automated c~mponent of the probabilist/c parsing system we are curnmtly woddng on. In won/tagging, each of the rurmi.$ words in the coqms text to be processed is associated with a pre-termina/ symbol, denoting word class. In e.~enc~ the CLAWS suite can be conceplually divided imo two phases: tag assignment and tag selection. constable NNSI NNSI: NPI: constant JJ NNI constituent NNI constitutional JJ NNI@ construction NNI consultant NNI cons~\"w~-~e JJ W0 contact NNI VV0 contained VVD VVN jJ@ containing WG NNI% contemporary JJ NNI@ content NNI JJ VV0@ contessa NNSI NNSI : contest NNI VV0@ contestant NNI continue VV0 continued VVD VVN JB@ contraband NNI JJ contract NNI W0@ contradictory jj contrary JJ NNI contrast NNI VV0@ Figure 1: Section of the CLAWS I.~icon JB = attributive adjective; JJ = general adjective: NNI = singular~co~mon noun; I~S1 = noun of style or title; NP1 = singular proper noun; W0 : base form of lexical verb, VVD -- past tense of lex/cal verb; WG = qng form of lexical verb; VVN = past participle of lexical verb; %, @ = probability markers; :- = word initial capital marker. 211","Tag assignmeat involves, for each input nmning word or punctuation mask. lexicon look-up, which provides one or more potential word tags for each input word or punctuation mark. The lexicon is a list of about 8,000 records containing fields for (1) the word form","(2) the set of one or more ~u-~41da~ tabs denoting the wont's word class(es) with probability markers attached indicating three ~ levels of plrl0~tl~lity.","Words not in the CLAWS lcxicoa me assigned potemial tabs either by suffixlist look-up, which attempts to match end characters of the input wo~ with a suffix in the ~ or, if the input word does not have a word.ending to match one of these enuies, default tags are assigned.

Feamrisation","The development of the CLAWS tagset md UCREL grammar owes much to the work of Quirk et al. (1985) while the tags themselves have evolved from the Brown tagset G:~ and Ku~ra, 1982). However, the rules and symbols chosen have been wa~l,-~_ into a notation compatible with other theories of grammar. For instate, tags from the extended ve~ion of the CLAWS lexicon have been translated into a formalism compatible with the Winchester pa~er (Sharman, 1988). A program has also been written to map all of the ten thousand productions of the c~urent UCREL grammar into the notation used by the Gr~-mm~tr Deve/opment Environment ((]DE) (Briscoe et at., 1987; Grover et aL, 1988; Carroll et aL. 1988).
