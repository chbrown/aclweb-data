The common idea is to delay the enumeration of all readings for as long as possible. In-stead, they work with a compact underspecified representation; readings are enumerated from this representation by need.","Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999) is the standard formalism for semantic underspecification used in large-scale HPSG grammars (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Copestake and Flickinger, ). Despite this clear relevance, the most obvious questions about MRS are still open:","1. Is it possible to enumerate the readings of","MRS structures efficiently? No algorithm has","been published so far. Existing implementa-","tions seem to be practical, even though the","problem whether an MRS has a reading is NP-","complete (Althaus et al., 2003, Theorem 10.1).","2. What is the precise relationship to other un-","derspecification formalism? Are all of them the","same, or else, what are the differences?","We distinguish the sublanguages of MRS nets and normal dominance nets, and show that they can be intertranslated. This translation answers the first question: existing constraint solvers for normal dominance constraints can be used to enumerate the readings of MRS nets in low polynomial time.","The translation also answers the second ques-tion restricted to pure scope underspecification. It shows the equivalence of a large fragment of MRSs and a corresponding fragment of normal dominance constraints, which in turn is equivalent to a large fragment of Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) as proven in (Koller et al., 2003). Additional underspecified treatments of ellipsis or reinterpretation, however, are available for extensions of dominance constraint only (CLLS, the constraint language for lambda structures (Egg et al., 2001)).","Our results are subject to a new proof technique which reduces reasoning about MRS structures to reasoning about weakly normal dominance constraints (Bodirsky et al., 2003). The previous proof techniques for normal dominance constraints (Koller et al., 2003) do not apply."]},{"title":"2 Minimal Recursion Semantics","paragraphs":["We define a simplified version of Minimal Recursion Semantics and discuss differences to the original definitions presented in (Copestake et al., 1999).","MRS is a description language for formulas of first order object languages with generalized quantifiers. Underspecified representations in MRS consist of elementary predications and handle constraints. Roughly, elementary predications are object language formulas with “holes” into which other formulas can be plugged; handle constraints restrict the way these formulas can be plugged into each other. More formally, MRSs are formulas over the following vocabulary: 1. Variables. An infinite set of variables ranged over by h. Variables are also called handles. 2. Constants. An infinite set of constants ranged over by x, y, z. Constants are the individual variables of the object language. 3. Function symbols.","(a) A set of function symbols written as P.","(b) A set of quantifier symbols ranged over by Q (such as every and some). Pairs Qx are further function symbols (the variable binders of x in the object language). 4. The symbol ≤ for the outscopes relation.","Formulas of MRS have three kinds of literals, the first two are called elementary predications (EPs) and the third handle constraints: 1. h : P(x1, . . . , xn, h1, . . . , hm) where n, m ≥ 0 2. h : Qx(h1, h2) 3. h1 ≤ h2 Label positions are to the left of colons ‘:’ and argument positions to the right. Let M be a set of literals. The label set lab(M) contains those handles of M that occur in label but not in argument position. The argument handle set arg(M) contains the handles of M that occur in argument but not in label position. Definition 1 (MRS). An MRS is finite set M of MRS-literals such that:","M1 Every handle occurs at most once in label and at most once in argument position in M.","M2 Handle constraints h1 ≤ h2 in M always relate argument handles h1 to labels h2 of M.","M3 For every constant (individual variable) x in argument position in M there is a unique literal of the form h : Qx(h1, h2) in M. We call an MRS compact if it additionally satisfies:","M4 Every handle of M occurs exactly once in an elementary predication of M.","We say that a handle h immediately outscopes a handle h′","in an MRS M iff there is an EP E in M such that h occurs in label and h′","in argument position of E. The outscopes relation is the reflexive, transitive closure of the immediate outscopes relation. everyx studentx readx,y somey booky {h1 : everyx(h2, h4), h3 : student(x), h5 : somey(h6, h8), h7 : book(y), h9 : read(x, y), h2 ≤ h3, h6 ≤ h7} Figure 1: MRS for “Every student reads a book”.","An example MRS for the scopally ambiguous sentence “Every student reads a book” is given in Fig. 1. We often represent MRSs by directed graphs whose nodes are the handles of the MRS. Elementary predications are represented by solid edges and handle constraints by dotted lines. Note that we make the relation between bound variables and their binders explicit by dotted lines (as from everyx to readx,y); redundant “binding-edges” that are subsumed by sequences of other edges are omitted how-ever (from everyx to studentx for instance).","A solution for an underspecified MRS is called a configuration, or scope-resolved MRS. Definition 2 (Configuration). An MRS M is a configuration if it satisfies the following conditions.","C1 The graph of M is a tree of solid edges: handles don’t properly outscope themselves or occur in different argument positions and all handles are pairwise connected by elementary predications.","C2 If two EPs h : P(. . . , x, . . .) and h0 : Qx(h1, h2) belong to M, then h0 outscopes h in M (so that the binding edge from h0 to h is redundant).","We call M a configuration for another MRS M′","if","there exists some substitution s: arg(M′",") ↦→ lab(M′",")","which states how to identify argument handles of M′","with labels of M′",", so that:","C3 M = {s(E) | E is EP in M′","}, and","C4 s(h1) outscopes h2 in M, for all h1 ≤ h2 ∈ M′",".","The value s(E) is obtained by substituting all argument handles in E, leaving all others unchanged.","The MRS in Fig. 1 has precisely two configurations displayed in Fig. 2 which correspond to the two readings of the sentence. In this paper, we present an algorithm that enumerates the configurations of MRSs efficiently. everyx studentx somey booky readx,y somey booky everyx studentx readx,y Figure 2: Graphs of Configurations. Differences to Standard MRS. Our version departs from standard MRS in some respects. First, we assume that different EPs must be labeled with different handles, and that labels cannot be identified. In standard MRS, however, conjunctions are encoded by labeling different EPs with the same handle. These EP-conjunctions can be replaced in a preprocessing step introducing additional EPs that make conjunctions explicit.","Second, our outscope constraints are slightly less restrictive than the original “qeq-constraints.” A handle h is qeq to a handle h′","in an MRS M, h =","q h′ ,","if either h = h′ or a quantifier h : Q","x(h1, h2) occurs","in M and h2 is qeq to h′ in M. Thus, h =","q h′","implies h ≤ h′",", but not the other way round. We believe that the additional strength of qeq-constraints is not needed in practice for modeling scope. Recent work in semantic construction for HPSG (Copestake et al., 2001) supports our conjecture: the examples discussed there are compatible with our simplification.","Third, we depart in some minor details: we use sets instead of multi-sets and omit top-handles which are useful only during semantics construction."]},{"title":"3 Dominance Constraints","paragraphs":["Dominance constraints are a general framework for describing trees, and thus syntax trees of logical formulas. Dominance constraints are the core language underlying CLLS (Egg et al., 2001) which adds parallelism and binding constraints. 3.1 Syntax and Semantics We assume a possibly infinite signature Sof function symbols with fixed arities and an infinite set Var of variables ranged over by X ,Y, Z. We write f , g for function symbols and ar( f ) for the arity of f .","A dominance constraint j is a conjunction of dominance, inequality, and labeling literals of the following forms where ar( f ) = n:","j::= X ◁∗ Y | X ̸= Y | X : f (X1, . . . , Xn) | j∧ j′","Dominance constraints are interpreted over finite constructor trees, i.e. ground terms constructed from the function symbols in S. We identify ground terms with trees that are rooted, ranked, edge-ordered and labeled. A solution for a dominance constraint consists of a tree tand a variable assignment athat maps variables to nodes of tsuch that all constraints are satisfied: a labeling literal X : f (X1, . . . , Xn) is satisfied iff the node a(X ) is labeled with f and has daughters a(X1), . . . , a(Xn) in this order; a dominance literal X ◁∗","Y is satisfied iff a(X ) is an ancestor of a(Y ) in t; and an inequality literal X ̸= Y is satisfied iff a(X ) and a(Y ) are distinct nodes.","Note that solutions may contain additional material. The tree f (a, b), for instance, satisfies the constraint Y : a ∧ Z : b. 3.2 Normality and Weak Normality The satisfiability problem of arbitrary dominance constraints is NP-complete (Koller et al., 2001) in general. However, Althaus et al. (2003) identify a natural fragment of so called normal dominance constraints, which have a polynomial time satisfiability problem. Bodirsky et al. (2003) generalize this notion to weakly normal dominance constraints.","We call a variable a hole of jif it occurs in argument position in jand a root of jotherwise. Definition 3. A dominance constraint jis normal (and compact) if it satisfies the following conditions. N1 (a) each variable of joccurs at most once in the","labeling literals of j.","(b) each variable of joccurs at least once in the","labeling literals of j. N2 for distinct roots X and Y of j, X ̸= Y is in j. N3 (a) if X ◁∗","Y occurs in j, Y is a root in j.","(b) if X ◁∗","Y occurs in j, X is a hole in j. A dominance constraint is weakly normal if it satisfies all above properties except for N1(b) and N3(b).","The idea behind (weak) normality is that the constraint graph (see below) of a dominance constraint consists of solid fragments which are connected by dominance constraints; these fragments may not properly overlap in solutions.","Note that Definition 3 always imposes compact-ness, meaning that the heigth of solid fragments is at most one. As for MRS, this is not a serious restriction, since more general weakly normal dominance constraints can be compactified, provided that dominance links relate either roots or holes with roots. Dominance Graphs. We often represent dominance constraints as graphs. A dominance graph is the directed graph (V, ◁∗","⊎ ◁). The graph of a weakly normal constraint jis defined as follows: The nodes of the graph of jare the variables of j. A labeling literal X : f (X1, . . . , Xn) of jcontributes tree edges (X , Xi) ∈ ◁ for 1 ≤ i ≤ n that we draw as X Xi; we freely omit the label f and the edge order in the graph. A dominance literal X ◁∗","Y contributes a dominance edge (X ,Y ) ∈ ◁∗","that we draw as X Y . Inequality literals in jare also omitted in the graph.","f a","gFor example, the constraint graph","on the right represents the dominance","constraint X : f (X ′",") ∧ Y : g(Y ′",") ∧ X ′","◁∗","Z ∧","Y ′ ◁∗ Z ∧ Z : a ∧ X ̸=Y ∧ X ̸=Z ∧ Y ̸=Z. A dominance graph is weakly normal or a wnd-","graph if it does not contain any forbidden subgraphs: Dominance graphs of a weakly normal dominance constraints are clearly weakly normal. Solved Forms and Configurations. The main difference between MRS and dominance constraints lies in their notion of interpretation: solutions versus configurations.","Every satisfiable dominance constraint has in-finitely many solutions. Algorithms for dominance constraints therefore do not enumerate solutions but solved forms. We say that a dominance constraint is in solved form iff its graph is in solved form. A wnd-graph Fis in solved form iff Fis a forest. The solved forms of Fare solved forms F′","that are more specific than F, i.e. Fand F′","differ only in their dominance edges and the reachability relation of Fextends the reachability of F′",". A minimal solved form of Fis a solved form of Fthat is minimal with respect to specificity.","The notion of configurations from MRS applies to dominance constraints as well. Here, a configuration is a dominance constraint whose graph is a tree without dominance edges. A configuration of a constraint jis a configuration that solves jin the obvious sense. Simple solved forms are tree-shaped solved forms where every hole has exactly one outgoing dominance edge. L1 L2 L3 L4 L2 L1 L4L3 Figure 3: A dominance constraint (left) with a minimal solved form (right) that has no configuration. Lemma 1. Simple solved forms and configurations correspond: Every simple solved form has exactly one configuration, and for every configuration there is exactly one solved form that it configures.","Unfortunately, Lemma 1 does not extend to minimal as opposed to simple solved forms: there are minimal solved forms without configurations. The constraint on the right of Fig. 3, for instance, has no configuration: the hole of L1 would have to be filled twice while the right hole of L2 cannot be filled."]},{"title":"4 Representing MRSs","paragraphs":["We next map (compact) MRSs to weakly normal dominance constraints so that configurations are preserved. Note that this translation is based on a non-standard semantics for dominance constraints, namely configurations. We address this problem in the following sections.","The translation of an MRS M to a dominance constraint jM is quite trivial. The variables of jM are the handles of M and its literal set is: {h : Px1,...,xn (h1, . . .) | h : P(x1, . . . , xn, h1, . . .) ∈ M} ∪{h : Qx(h1, h2) | h : Qx(h1, h2) ∈ M} ∪{h1◁∗","h2 | h1 ≤ h2 ∈ M}","∪{h◁∗ h0 | h : Qx(h1, h2), h0 : P(. . . , x, . . .) ∈ M}","∪{h̸=h′","| h, h′","in distinct label positions of M} Compact MRSs M are clearly translated into (compact) weakly normal dominance constraints. Labels of M become roots in jM while argument handles become holes. Weak root-to-root dominance literals are needed to encode variable binding condition C2 of MRS. It could be formulated equivalently through lambda binding constraints of CLLS (but this is not necessary here in the absence of parallelism). Proposition 1. The translation of a compact MRS M into a weakly normal dominance constraint jM preserves configurations.","This weak correctness property follows straightforwardly from the analogy in the definitions."]},{"title":"5 Constraint Solving","paragraphs":["We recall an algorithm from (Bodirsky et al., 2003) that efficiently enumerates all minimal solved forms of wnd-graphs or constraints. All results of this sec-tion are proved there.","The algorithm can be used to enumerate configurations for a large subclass of MRSs, as we will see in Section 6. But equally importantly, this algorithm provides a powerful proof method for reasoning about solved forms and configurations on which all our results rely. 5.1 Weak Connectedness Two nodes X and Y of a wnd-graph F= (V, E) are weakly connected if there is an undirected path from X to Y in (V, E). We call Fweakly connected if all its nodes are weakly connected. A weakly connected component (wcc) of F is a maximal weakly connected subgraph of F. The wccs of F= (V, E) form proper partitions of V and E. Proposition 2. The graph of a solved form of a weakly connected wnd-graph is a tree. 5.2 Freeness The enumeration algorithm is based on the notion of freeness. Definition 4. A node X of a wnd-graph Fis called free in F if there exists a solved form of F whose graph is a tree with root X . A weakly connected wnd-graph without free","nodes is unsolvable. Otherwise, it has a solved form","whose graph is a tree (Prop. 2) and the root of this","tree is free in F.

We illustrate the algorithm for the problematic wnd-graph Fin Fig. 3. The graph of F is weakly connected, so that we can call solve(F). This procedure guesses topmost fragments in solved forms of F(which always exist by Prop. 2).","The only candidates are L1 or L2 since L3 and L4 have incoming dominance edges, which violates F1. Let us choose the fragment L2 to be topmost. The graph which remains when removing L2 is still weakly connected. It has a single minimal solved form computed by a recursive call of the solver, where L1 dominates L3 and L4. The solved form of the restricted graph is then put below the left hole of L2, since it is connected to this hole. As a result, we obtain the solved form on the right of Fig. 3. Theorem 1. The function solved-form(F) computes all minimal solved forms of a weakly normal dominance graph F; it runs in quadratic time per solved form."]},{"title":"6 Full Translation","paragraphs":["Next, we explain how to encode a large class of MRSs into wnd-constraints such that configurations correspond precisely to minimal solved forms. The result of the translation will indeed be normal. 6.1 Problems and Examples The naive representation of MRSs as weakly normal dominance constraints is only correct in a weak sense. The encoding fails in that some MRSs which have no configurations are mapped to solvable wnd-constraints. For instance, this holds for the MRS on the right in Fig 3.","We cannot even hope to translate arbitrary MRSs correctly into wnd-constraints: the configurability problem of MRSs is NP-complete, while satisfiability of wnd-constraints can be solved in polynomial time.

This means that all roots of Fare labeled in F, and that all fragments X : f (X1, . . . , Xn) of Fsatisfy one of the following three conditions: strong. n ≥ 0 and for all Y ∈ {X1, . . . , Xn} there exists a unique Z such that Y ◁∗","Z in F, and there exists no Z such that X ◁∗","Z in F. weak. n ≥ 1 and for all Y ∈ {X1, . . . , Xn−1, X } there exists a unique Z such that Y ◁∗","Z in F, and there exists no Z such that Xn ◁∗","Z in F. island. n = 1 and all variables in {Y | X1 ◁∗","Y } are connected by a hypernormal path in the graph of the restricted constraint F|V −{X1}, and there exists no Z such that X ◁∗","Z in F.","The requirement of hypernormal connections in islands replaces the notion of chain-connectedness in (Koller et al., 2003), which fails to apply to dominance constraints with weak dominance edges.","For ease of presentation, we restrict ourselves to a simple version of island fragments. In general, we should allow for island fragments with n > 1. 6.3 Normalizing Dominance Nets Dominance nets are wnd-constraints. We next translate dominance nets F to normal dominance constraints F′","so that Fhas a configuration iff F′","is satisfiable. The trick is to normalize weak dominance edges. The normalization norm(F) of a weakly normal dominance constraint Fis obtained by convert-ing all root-to-root dominance literals X ◁∗","Y as follows:","X ◁∗ Y ⇒ Xn ◁∗","Y if X roots a fragment of F that satisfies schema weak of net fragments. If Fis a dominance net then norm(F) is indeed a normal dominance net. Theorem 2. The configurations of a weakly connected dominance net F correspond bijectively to the minimal solved forms of its normalization norm(F).","For illustration, consider the problematic wnd-constraint Fon the left of Fig. 3. Fhas two minimal solved forms with top-most fragments L1 and L2 respectively. The former can be configured, in contrast to the later which is drawn on the right of Fig. 3.","Normalizing F has an interesting consequence: norm(F) has (in contrast to F) a single minimal solved form with L1 on top. Indeed, norm(F) cannot be satisfied while placing L2 topmost. Our algorithm detects this correctly: the normalization of fragment L2 is not free in norm(F) since it violates property F2.","The proof of Theorem 2 captures the rest of this section. We show in a first step (Prop. 3) that the configurations are preserved when normalizing weakly connected and satisfiable nets. In the second step, we show that minimal solved forms of normalized nets, and thus of norm(F), can always be configured (Prop. 4). Corollary 1. Configurability of weakly connected MRS-nets can be decided in polynomial time; configurations of weakly connected MRS-nets can be enumerated in quadratic time per configuration. 6.4 Correctness Proof Most importantly, nets can be recursively decomposed into nets as long as they have configurations: Lemma 3. If a dominance net Fhas a configuration whose top-most fragment is X : f (X1, . . . , Xn), then the restriction F|V −{X,X1,...,Xn} is a dominance net.","Note that the restriction of the problematic net F by L2 on the left in Fig. 3 is not a net. This does not contradict the lemma, as Fdoes not have a configuration with top-most fragment L2. Proof. First note that as X is free in Fit cannot have incoming edges (condition F1). This means that the restriction deletes only dominance edges that depart from nodes in {X , X1, . . . , Xn}. Other fragments thus only lose ingoing dominance edges by normality condition N3. Such deletions preserve the validity of the schemas weak and strong.","The island schema is more problematic. We have to show that the hypernormal connections in this schema can never be cut. So suppose that Y : f (Y1) is an island fragment with outgoing dominance edges Y1 ◁∗","Z","1 and Y1 ◁∗ Z","2, so that Z1 and Z2 are connected by some hypernormal path traversing the deleted fragment X : f (X1, . . . , Xn).

(c) island Figure 6: Traversals through fragments of free roots strong: since X does not have incoming dominance edges, there is only a single non-trival kind of traversal, drawn in Fig. 6(a).

The traversal proves that Y belongs to the weakly connected components of one of the Xi, so the F∧ Xn ◁∗","Y is unsatisfiable. This shows that the hole Xn cannot be identified with any root, i.e. Fdoes not have any configuration in contrast to our assumption. island: free island fragments permit one single nontrivial form of traversals, depicted in Fig. 6(c). But such traversals are not hypernormal. Proposition 3. A configuration of a weakly connected dominance net Fconfigures its normalization norm(F), and vice versa of course. Proof. Let C be a configuration of F. We show that it also configures norm(F). Let S be the simple solved form of Fthat is configured by C (Lemma 1), and S′","be a minimal solved form of Fwhich is more general than S.","Let X : f (Y1, . . . ,Yn) be the top-most fragment of the tree S. This fragment must also be the top-most fragment of S′",", which is a tree since Fis assumed to be weakly connected (Prop. 2). S′","is constructed by our algorithm (Theorem 1), so that the evaluation of solve(F) must choose X as free root in F.","Since Fis a net, some literal X : f (Y1, . . . ,Yn) must belong to F. Let F′","= F|{X,Y1,...,Yn} be the restriction of Fto the lower fragments. The weakly connected components of all Y1, . . ., Yn−1 must be pairwise disjoint by F2 (which holds by Lemma 2 since X is free in F). The X -fragment of net Fmust satisfy one of three possible schemata of net fragments: weak fragments: there exists a unique weak dominance edge X ◁∗","Z in Fand a unique hole Yn without outgoing dominance edges. The variable Z must be a root in Fand thus be labeled. If Z is equal to X then Fis unsatisfiable by normality condition N2, which is impossible. Hence, Z occurs in the restriction F′ but not in the weakly connected components of any Y1, . . ., Yn−1. Otherwise, the minimal solved form S′ could not be configured since the hole Yn could not be identified with any root. Furthermore, the root of the Z-component must be identified with Yn in any configuration of F with root X . Hence, C satisfies Yn ◁∗","Z which is add by normalization. The restriction F′","must be a dominance net by Lemma 3, and hence, all its weakly connected components are nets. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, the component of Yi in F′","is configured by the subtree of C at node Yi, while the subtree of C at node Yn configures the component of Z in F′",". The induction hypothesis yields that the normalizations of all these components are configured by the respective subconfigura-tions of C. Hence, norm(F) is configured by C. strong or island fragments are not altered by normalization, so we can recurse to the lower fragments (if there exist any). Proposition 4. Minimal solved forms of normal, weakly connected dominance nets have configurations. Proof. By induction over the construction of minimal solved forms, we can show that all holes of minimal solved forms have a unique outgoing dominance edge at each hole. Furthermore, all minimal solved forms are trees since we assumed connectedness (Prop.2). Thus, all minimal solved forms are simple, so they have configurations (Lemma 1)."]},{"title":"7 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have related two underspecification formalism, MRS and normal dominance constraints.
