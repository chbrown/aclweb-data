Some often used criteria are, for example, F-Measure for parsing, mean average precision for ranked retrieval, and BLEU or multi-reference word error rate for statistical machine translation. The use of statistical techniques in natural language processing often starts out with the simplifying (often implicit) assumption that the final scoring is based on simply counting the number of wrong decisions, for instance, the number of sentences incorrectly translated in machine translation. Hence, there is a mismatch between the basic assumptions of the used statistical approach and the finalevaluation criterion used to measure success in a task.","Ideally, we would like to train our model parameters such that the end-to-end performance in some application is optimal. In this paper, we investigate methods to efficiently optimize model parameters with respect to machine translation quality as measured by automatic evaluation criteria such as word error rate and BLEU."]},{"title":"2 Statistical Machine Translation with Log-linear Models","paragraphs":["Let us assume that we are given a source (‘French’) sentence  ",""," ","","","",", which is","to be translated into a target (‘English’) sentence","  ","","","","","","  ","Among all possible","target sentences, we will choose the sentence with","the highest probability:1   ","","  Pr","  (1) The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language. The decision in Eq. 1 minimizes the number of decision errors. Hence, under a so-called zero-one loss function this decision rule is optimal (Duda and Hart, 1973). Note that using a different loss function—for example, one induced by the BLEU metric—a different decision rule would be optimal. 1 The notational convention will be as follows.

Yet, the ultimate goal is to obtain good translation quality on unseen test data. Experience shows that good results can be obtained using this approach, yet there is no reason to assume that an optimization of the model parameters using Eq. 4 yields parameters that are optimal with respect to translation quality.","The goal of this paper is to investigate alternative training criteria and corresponding training algorithms, which are directly related to translation quality measured with automatic evaluation criteria. In Section 3, we review various automatic evaluation criteria used in statistical machine translation.

Examples of such methods are word error rate, position-independent word error rate (Tillmann et al., 1997), generation string accuracy (Bangalore et al., 2000), multi-reference word error rate (Nießen et al., 2000), BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST score (Doddington, 2002).

To avoid finding a poor local optimum, we start from different initial parameter values. A major problem with the standard approach is the fact that grid-based line optimization is hard to adjust such that both good performance and efficient search are guaranteed. If a fine-grained grid is used then the algorithm is slow. If a large grid is used then the optimal solution might be missed.","In the following, we describe a new algorithm for efficient line optimization of the unsmoothed error count (Eq. 5) using a log-linear model (Eq. 3) which is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

In this translation model, a sentence is translated by segmenting the input sentence into phrases, translating these phrases and reordering the translations in the target language. In addition to the feature functions described in (Och and Ney, 2002), our system includes a phrase penalty (the number of alignment templates used) and special alignment features. Altogether, the log-linear model includes   ","different features.","Note that many of the used feature functions are derived from probabilistic models: the feature function is defined as the negative logarithm of the corresponding probabilistic model. Therefore, the feature functions are much more ’informative’ than for instance the binary feature functions used in standard maximum entropy models in natural language processing.","For search, we use a dynamic programming beam-search algorithm to explore a subset of all possible translations (Och et al., 1999) and extract","- best candidate translations using A* search (Ueffing et al., 2002).","Using an","-best approximation, we might face the problem that the parameters trained are good for the list of","translations used, but yield worse translation results if these parameters are used in the dynamic programming search. Hence, it is possible that our new search produces translations with more errors on the training corpus. This can happen because with the modified model scaling factors the  -best list can change significantly and can include sentences not in the existing","-best list. To avoid this problem, we adopt the following solution: First, we perform search (using a manually defined set of parameter values) and compute an","-best list, and use this","-best list to train the model parameters. Second, we use the new model parameters in a new search and compute a new","-best list, which is combined with the existing","-best list. Third, using this extended","-best list new model parameters are computed. This is iterated until the resulting","-best list does not change. In this algorithm convergence is guaranteed as, in the limit, the","-best list will contain all possible translations. In our experiments, we compute in every iteration about 200 alternative translations. In practice, the algorithm converges after about five to seven iterations. As a result, error rate cannot increase on the training corpus.","A major problem in applying the MMI criterion is the fact that the reference translations need to be part of the provided","-best list. Quite often, none of the given reference translations is part of the","-best list because the search algorithm performs pruning, which in principle limits the possible translations that can be produced given a certain input sentence. To solve this problem, we definefor the MMI training new pseudo-references by selecting from the","- best list all the sentences which have a minimal number of word errors with respect to any of the true references. Note that due to this selection approach, the results of the MMI criterion might be biased toward the mWER criterion. It is a major advantage of the minimum error rate training that it is not necessary to choose pseudo-references."]},{"title":"7 Results","paragraphs":["We present results on the 2002 TIDES Chinese– English small data track task.

For the unsmoothed error count, we presented a new line optimization algorithm which can efficiently findthe optimal solution along a line. We showed that this approach obtains significantly better results than using the MMI training criterion (with our method to definepseudoreferences) and that optimizing error rate as part of the training criterion helps to obtain better error rate on unseen test data. As a result, we expect that actual ’true’ translation quality is improved, as previous work has shown that for some evaluation criteria there is a correlation with human subjective evaluation of fluenc y and adequacy (Papineni et al., 2001; Doddington, 2002). However, the different evaluation criteria yield quite different results on our Chinese–English translation task and therefore we expect that not all of them correlate equally well to human translation quality.","The following important questions should be an-swered in the future:","","How many parameters can be reliably esti-","mated using unsmoothed minimum error rate","criteria using a given development corpus size?","We expect that directly optimizing error rate for","many more parameters would lead to serious","overfitting problems. Is it possible to optimize","more parameters using the smoothed error rate","criterion?"," Which error rate should be optimized during training? This relates to the important question of which automatic evaluation measure is optimally correlated to human assessment of translation quality.","Note, that this approach can be applied to any evaluation criterion. Hence, if an improved automatic evaluation criterion is developed that has an even better correlation with human judgments than BLEU and NIST, we can plug this alternative criterion directly into the training procedure and optimize the model parameters for it. This means that improved translation evaluation measures lead directly to improved machine translation quality. Of course, the approach presented here places a high demand on the fidelity of the measure being optimized. It might happen that by directly optimizing an error measure in the way described above, weaknesses in the measure might be exploited that could yield better scores without improved translation quality. Hence, this approach poses new challenges for developers of automatic evaluation criteria.","Many tasks in natural language processing, for instance summarization, have evaluation criteria that go beyond simply counting the number of wrong system decisions and the framework presented here might yield improved systems for these tasks as well."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This work was supported by DARPA-ITO grant 66001-00-1-9814."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Srinivas Bangalore, O.
