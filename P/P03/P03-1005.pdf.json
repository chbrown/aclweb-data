The HDAG Kernel directly accepts several levels of both chunks and their relations, and then efficiently computes the weighed sum of the number of common attribute sequences of the HDAGs. We applied the proposed method to question classification and sentence alignment tasks to evaluate its performance as a similarity measure and a kernel function. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the HDAG Kernel is superior to other kernel functions and baseline methods."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["As it has become easy to get structured corpora such as annotated texts, many researchers have applied statistical and machine learning techniques to NLP tasks, thus the accuracies of basic NLP tools, such as POS taggers, NP chunkers, named entities taggers and dependency analyzers, have been improved to the point that they can realize practical applications in NLP.","The motivation of this paper is to identify and use richer information within texts that will improve the performance of NLP applications; this is in contrast to using feature vectors constructed by a bag-of-words (Salton et al., 1975).","We now are focusing on the methods that use numerical feature vectors to represent the features of natural language data. In this case, since the original natural language data is symbolic, researchers convert the symbolic data into numeric data. This process, feature extraction, is ad-hoc in nature and differs with each NLP task; there has been no neat formulation for generating feature vectors from the semantic and grammatical structures inside texts.","Kernel methods (Vapnik, 1995; Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) suitable for NLP have recently been devised. Convolution Kernels (Haussler, 1999) demonstrate how to build kernels over discrete structures such as strings, trees, and graphs. One of the most remarkable properties of this kernel method-ology is that it retains the original representation of objects and algorithms manipulate the objects simply by computing kernel functions from the inner products between pairs of objects. This means that we do not have to map texts to the feature vectors by explicitly representing them, as long as an efficient calculation for the inner products between a pair of texts is defined. The kernel method is widely adopted in Machine Learning methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995). In addition, kernel function has been described as a similarity function that satisfies certain properties (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). The similarity measure between texts is one of the most important factors for some tasks in the application areas of NLP such as Machine Translation, Text Categorization, Information Retrieval, and Question Answering.","This paper proposes the Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) Kernel. It can handle several of the structures found within texts and can calculate the similarity with regard to these structures at practical cost and time. The HDAG Kernel can be widely applied to learning, clustering and similarity measures in NLP tasks.","The following sections define the HDAG Kernel and introduce an algorithm that implements it. The results of applying the HDAG Kernel to the tasks of question classification and sentence alignment are then discussed."]},{"title":"2 Convolution Kernels","paragraphs":["Convolution Kernels were proposed as a concept of","kernels for a discrete structure.

That is, certain nodes contain DAGs within themselves.","In basic NLP tasks, chunking and parsing are used to analyze the text semantically or grammatically. There are several levels of chunks, such as phrases, named entities and sentences, and these are bound by relation structures, such as dependency structure, anaphora, and coreference. HDAG is designed to enable the representation of all of these structures inside texts, hierarchical structures for chunks and DAG structures for the relations of chunks. We believe this richer representation is extremely useful to improve the performance of similarity measure between texts, moreover, learning and clustering tasks in the application areas of NLP.","Figure 1 shows an example of the text structures that can be handled by HDAG. Figure 2 contains simple examples of HDAG that elucidate the calculation of similarity.","As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the nodes are allowed to have more than zero attributes, because nodes in texts usually have several kinds of attributes.
