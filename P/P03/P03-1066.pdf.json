There are two major obstacles to successfully incorporating linguistic structure into a language model: (1) capturing longer distance word dependencies leads to higher-order n-gram models, where the number of parameters is usually too large to estimate; (2) capturing deeper linguistic relations in a language model requires a large annotated training corpus and a decoder that assigns linguistic structure, which are not always available.","This paper presents a new dependency language model (DLM) that captures long distance linguistic constraints between words via a dependency structure, i.e., a set of probabilistic dependencies that capture linguistic relations between headwords of each phrase in a sentence. To deal with the first obstacle mentioned above, we approximate long-distance linguistic dependency by a model that is similar to a skipping bigram model in which the prediction of a word is conditioned on exactly one other linguistically related word that lies arbitrarily far in the past. This dependency model is then in-terpolated with a headword bigram model and a word trigram model, keeping the number of parameters of the combined model manageable. To overcome the second obstacle, we used an unsupervised learning method that discovers the dependency structure of a given sentence using an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like procedure. In this method, no manual syntactic annotation is required, thereby opening up the possibility for building a language model that performs well on a wide variety of data and languages. The proposed model is evaluated using Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion, achieving significant error rate reduction over the word trigram model."]},{"title":"2 Motivation","paragraphs":["A trigram language model predicts the next word based only on two preceding words, blindly discarding any other relevant word that may lie three or more positions to the left. Such a model is likely to be linguistically implausible: consider the English sentence in Figure 1(a), where a trigram model would predict cried from next seat, which does not agree with our intuition. In this paper, we define a dependency structure of a sentence as a set of probabilistic dependencies that express linguistic relations between words in a sentence by an acyclic, planar graph,","where two related words are connected by an undirected graph edge (i.e., we do not differentiate the modifier and the head in a dependency). The dependency structure for the sentence in Figure 1(a) is as shown; a model that uses this dependency structure would predict cried from baby, in agreement with our intuition.   (a) [A baby] [in the next seat] cried [throughout the flight]    (b) [ / ] [ / ] [ / ] [ / ] [ ] [ / ]"," Figure 1. Examples of dependency structure. (a) A dependency structure of an English sentence. Square brackets indicate base NPs; underlined words are the headwords. (b) A Japanese equivalent of (a). Slashes demarcate morpheme boundaries; square brackets indicate phrases (bunsetsu).","A Japanese sentence is typically divided into non-overlapping phrases called bunsetsu. As shown in Figure 1(b), each bunsetsu consists of one content word, referred to here as the headword H, and several function words F. Words (more precisely, morphemes) within a bunsetsu are tightly bound with each other, which can be adequately captured by a word trigram model. However, headwords across bunsetsu boundaries also have dependency relations with each other, as the diagrams in Figure 1 show. Such long distance dependency relations are expected to provide useful and complementary information with the word trigram model in the task of next word prediction.","In constructing language models for realistic applications such as speech recognition and Asian language input, we are faced with two constraints that we would like to satisfy: First, the model must operate in a left-to-right manner, because (1) the search procedures for predicting words that correspond to the input acoustic signal or phonetic string work left to right, and (2) it can be easily combined with a word trigram model in decoding. Second, the model should be computationally feasible both in training and decoding. In the next section, we offer a DLM that satisfies both of these constraints."]},{"title":"3 Dependency Language Model","paragraphs":["The DLM attempts to generate the dependency structure incrementally while traversing the sentence left to right.

As described in Section 2, headwords and function words play different syntactic and semantic roles capturing different types of dependency relations, so the prediction of them can better be done separately. Assuming that each word token can be uniquely classified as a headword or a function word in Japanese, the DLM can be conceived of as a cluster-based language model with two clusters, headword H and function word F. We can then define the conditional probability of wj based on its history as the product of two factors: the probability of the category given its history, and the probability of wj given its category. Let hj or fj be the actual headword or function word in a sentence, and let Hj or Fj be the category of the word wj.

We first describe the estimation of headword probability P(wj | Φ (Wj-1, Dj-1), Hj). Let HWj-1 be the headwords in (j-1)-prefix, i.e., containing only those headwords that are included in Wj-1. Because HWj-1 is determined by Wj-1, the headword probability can be rewritten as P(wj | Φ (Wj-1, HWj-1, Dj-1), Hj). The problem is to determine the mapping Φ so as to identify the related words in the left context that we would like to condition on. Based on the discussion in Section 2, we chose a mapping function that retains (1) two preceding words wj-1 and wj-2 in Wj-1, (2) one preceding headword hj-1 in HWj-1, and (3) one linguistically related word wi according to Dj-1. wi is determined in two stages: First, the parser updates the dependency structure Dj-1 incrementally to Dj assuming that the next word is wj.

Steps (2) and (3) are iterated until the improvement in the probability of training data is less than a threshold. Initialize: We set a window of size N and assumed that each headword pair within a headword N-gram constitutes an initial dependency. The optimal value of N is 3 in our experiments. That is, given a headword trigram (h1, h2, h3), there are 3 initial dependencies: d12, d13, and d23. From the initial dependencies, we computed an initial dependency parsing model by Equation (4). (Re-)parse the corpus: Given the parsing model, we used the parsing algorithm in Figure 2 to select the most probable dependency structure for each sentence in the training data.

This is a similar problem to speech recognition, except that it does not include acoustic ambiguity. Performance on this task is measured in terms of the character error rate (CER), given by the number of characters wrongly converted from the phonetic string divided by the number of characters in the correct transcript.","For our experiments, we used two newspaper corpora, Nikkei and Yomiuri Newspapers, both of which have been pre-word-segmented. We built language models from a 36-million-word subset of the Nikkei Newspaper corpus, performed parameter optimization on a 100,000-word subset of the Yomiuri Newspaper (held-out data), and tested our models on another 100,000-word subset of the Yomiuri Newspaper corpus. The lexicon we used contains 167,107 entries.","Our evaluation was done within a framework of so-called “N-best rescoring” method, in which a list of hypotheses is generated by the baseline language model (a word trigram model in this study), which is then rescored using a more sophisticated language model. We use the N-best list of N=100, whose “oracle” CER (i.e., the CER of the hypotheses with the minimum number of errors) is presented in Table 1, indicating the upper bound on performance. We also note in Table 1 that the performance of the conversion using the baseline trigram model is much better than the state-of-the-art performance currently available in the marketplace, presumably due to the large amount of training data we used, and to the similarity between the training and the test data.","Baseline Trigram Oracle of 100-best 3.73% 1.51% Table 1.

The baseline result was obtained by using a conventional word trigram model (WTM).7","HBM stands for headword bigram model, which does not use any dependency structure (i.e. λ2 = 1 in Equation (13)). DLM_1 is the DLM that does not use headword bigram (i.e. λ 2 = 0 in Equation (13)). DLM_2 is the model where the headword probability is estimated by interpolating the word trigram probability, the headword bigram probability, and the probability given one previous linguistically related word in the dependency structure.","Although Equation (7) suggests that the word probability P(wj|Φ (Wj-1,Dj-1)) and the parsing model probability can be combined through simple multiplication, some weighting is desirable in practice, especially when our parsing model is estimated using an approximation by the parsing score P(D|W). We therefore introduced a parsing model weight PW: both DLM_1 and DLM_2 models were built with and without PW. In Table 2, the PW-prefix refers to the DLMs with PW = 0.5, and the DLMs without PW- prefix refers to DLMs with PW = 0.

By combining headword bigram and dependency structure, we obtained the best model PW-DLM_2 that achieves 11.3% CER reduction over the baseline.

The discussion includes: (1) the use of DLM as a parser, (2) the definition of the mapping function Φ , and (3) the method of unsupervised dependency structure acquisition.","One basic approach to using linguistic structure for language modeling is to extend the conventional language model P(W) to P(W, T), where T is a parse tree of W. The extended model can then be used as a parser to select the most likely parse by T*","= argmaxT P(W, T). Many recent studies (e.g., Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Charniak, 2001; Roark, 2001) adopt this approach. Similarly, dependency-based models (e.g., Collins, 1996; Chelba et al., 1997) use a dependency structure D of W instead of a parse tree T, where D is extracted from syntactic trees. Both of these models can be called grammar-based models, in that they capture the syntactic structure of a sentence, and the model parameters are estimated from syntactically annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank. DLM, on the other hand, is a non-grammar-based model, because it is not based on any syntactic annotation: the dependency structure used in language modeling was learned directly from data in an unsupervised manner, subject to two weak syntactic constraints (i.e., dependency structure is acyclic and planar).8","This resulted in capturing the dependency relations that are not precisely syntactic in nature within our model. For example, in the conversion of the string below, the word ban 'evening' was correctly predicted in DLM by using the long-distance bigram ~ asa~ban 'morning~evening', even though these two words are not in any direct syntactic dependency relationship:  'asks for instructions in the morning and submits daily reports in the evening' Though there is no doubt that syntactic dependency relations provide useful information for language modeling, the most linguistically related word in the previous context may come in various linguistic relations with the word being predicted, not limited to syntactic dependency. This opens up new possibilities for exploring the combination of different knowledge sources in language modeling.","Regarding the function Φ that maps the left context onto equivalence classes, we used a simple approximation that takes into account only one linguistically related word in left context. An alternative is to use the maximum entropy (ME) approach (Rosenfeld, 1994; Chelba et al., 1997). Although ME models provide a nice framework for incorporating arbitrary knowledge sources that can be encoded as a large set of constraints, training and using ME models is extremely computationally expensive. Our working hypothesis is that the information for predicting the new word is dominated by a very limited set of words which can be selected heuristically: in this paper, Φ is defined as a heuristic function that maps D to one word in D that has the strongest linguistic relation with the word being predicted, as in (8). This hypothesis is borne out by  8 In this sense, our model is an extension of a dependency-based model proposed in Yuret (1998). However, this work has not been evaluated as a language model with error rate reduction. an additional experiment we conducted, where we used two words from D that had the strongest relation with the word being predicted; this resulted in a very limited gain in CER reduction of 0.62%, which is not statistically significant (P>0.05 according to the t test).","The EM-like method for learning dependency relations described in Section 3.3 has also been applied to other tasks such as hidden Markov model training (Rabiner, 1989), syntactic relation learning (Yuret, 1998), and Chinese word segmentation (Gao et al., 2002a). In applying this method, two factors need to be considered: (1) how to initialize the model (i.e. the value of the window size N), and (2) the number of iterations. We investigated the impact of these two factors empirically on the CER of Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion. We built a series of DLMs using different window size N and different number of iterations. Some sample results are shown in Table 3: the improvement in CER begins to saturate at the second iteration. We also find that a larger N results in a better initial model but makes the following iterations less effective. The possible reason is that a larger N generates more initial dependencies and would lead to a better initial model, but it also introduces noise that prevents the initial model from being improved. All DLMs in Table 2 are initialized with N = 3 and are run for two iterations.

Promising results of our experiments suggest that long-distance dependency relations can indeed be successfully exploited for the purpose of language modeling.","There are many possibilities for future improvements. In particular, as discussed in Section 6, syntactic dependency structure is believed to capture useful information for informed language modeling, yet further improvements may be possible by incorporating non-syntax-based dependencies. Correlating the accuracy of the dependency parser as a parser vs. its utility in CER reduction may suggest a useful direction for further research."]},{"title":"Reference","paragraphs":["Charniak, Eugine. 2001.
