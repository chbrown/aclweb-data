Supertagging is the process of assigning the correct supertag to each word of an input sentence. The following two facts make supertagging attractive. Firstly supertags encode much more syntactical information than POS tags, which makes supertagging a useful pre-parsing tool, so-called, almost parsing (Srinivas and Joshi, 1999). On the","1","By the correct supertag we mean the supertag that an LTAG parser would assign to a word in a sentence. other hand, as the term ’supertagging’ suggests, the time complexity of supertagging is similar to that of POS tagging, which is linear in the length of the input sentence.","In this paper, we will focus on the NP chunking task, and use it as an application of supertagging. (Abney, 1991) proposed a two-phase parsing model which includes chunking and attaching. (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) approached chuck-ing by using Transformation Based Learning(TBL). Many machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to chunking tasks, such as Regularized Winnow (Zhang et al., 2001), SVMs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), CRFs (Sha and Pereira, 2003), Maximum Entropy Model (Collins, 2002), Memory Based Learning (Sang, 2002) and SNoW (Muñoz et al., 1999).","The previous best result on chunking in literature was achieved by Regularized Winnow (Zhang et al., 2001), which took some of the parsing results given by an English Slot Grammar-based parser as input to the chunker. The use of parsing results contributed ","absolute increase in F-score. However, this approach conflicts with the purpose of chunking. Ideally, a chunker geneates n-best results, and an at-tacher uses chunking results to construct a parse.","The dilemma is that syntactic constraints are useful in the chunking phase, but they are unavailable until the attaching phase. The reason is that POS tags are not a good labeling system to encode enough linguistic knowledge for chunking. However another labeling system, supertagging, can provide a great deal of syntactic information.","In an LTAG, each word is associated with a set of possible elementary trees. An LTAG parser assigns the correct elementary tree to each word of a sentence, and uses the elementary trees of all the words to build a parse tree for the sentence. Elementary trees, which we call supertags, contain more information than POS tags, and they help to improve the chunking accuracy.","Although supertags are able to encode long distance dependence, supertaggers trained with local information in fact do not take full advantage of complex information available in supertags.","In order to exploit syntactic dependencies in a larger context, we propose a new model of supertagging based on Sparse Network of Winnow (SNoW) (Roth, 1998). We also propose a novel method of applying SNoW to sequential models in a way analogous to the Projection-base Markov Model (PMM) used in (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000). In contrast to PMM, we construct a SNoW classifier for each POS tag. For each word of an input sentence, its POS tag, instead of the supertag of the previous word, is used to select the corresponding SNoW classifier. This method helps to avoid the sparse data problem and forces SNoW to focus on difficult cases in the context of supertagging task. Since PMM suffers from the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001), we have used two methods to cope with this problem. One method is to skip the local normalization step, and the other is to combine the results of left-to-right scan and right-to-left scan.","We test our supertagger on both the hand-coded supertags used in (Chen et al., 1999) as well as the supertags extracted from Penn Treebank(PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994; Xia, 2001). On the dataset used in (Chen et al., 1999), our supertagger achieves an accuracy of",".","We then apply our supertagger to NP chunking. The purpose of this paper is to find a better way to exploit syntactic information which is useful in NP chunking, but not the machine learning part. So we just use TBL, a well-known algorithm in the community of text chunking, as the machine learning tool in our research. Using TBL also allows us to easily evaluate the contribution of supertags with respect to Ramshaw and Marcus’s original work, the de facto baseline of NP chunking. The use of supertags with TBL can be easily extended to other machine learning algorithms.","We repeat Ramshaw and Marcus’ Transformation Based NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) algorithm by substituting supertags for POS tags in the dataset. The use of supertags gives rise to almost ","absolute increase (from","to",") in F-score under Transformation Based Learning(TBL) frame. This confirms our claim that using supertagging as a labeling system helps to increase the over-all performance of NP Chunking. The supertagger presented in this paper provides an opportunity for advanced machine learning techniques to improve their performance on chunking tasks by exploiting more syntactic information encoded in the supertags."]},{"title":"2 Supertagging and NP Chunking","paragraphs":["In (Srinivas, 1997) trigram models were used for supertagging, in which Good-Turing discounting technique and Katz’s back-off model were employed. The supertag for a word was determined by the lexical preference of the word, as well as by the contextual preference of the previous two supertags. The model was tested on WSJ section 20 of PTB, and trained on section 0 through 24 except section 20. The accuracy on the test data is","2",".","In (Srinivas, 1997), supertagging was used for NP chunking and it achieved an F-score of",". (Chen, 2001) reported a similar result with a trigram supertagger. In their approaches, they first supertagged the test data and then uesd heuristic rules to detect NP chunks. But it is hard to say whether it is the use of supertags or the heuristic rules that makes their system achieve the good results.","As a first attempt, we use fast TBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001), a TBL program, to repeat Ramshaw and Marcus’ experiment on the standard dataset. Then we use Srinivas’ supertagger (Srinivas, 1997) to supertag both the training and test data. We run the fast TBL for the second round by using supertags instead of POS tags in the dataset. With POS tags we achieve an F-score of",", but with supertags we only achieve an F-score of",". This is not surprising becuase Srinivas’ supertag was only trained with a trigram model. Although supertags are able to encode long distance dependence, supertaggers trained with local information in fact do not take full advantage of their strong capability. So we must use long distance dependencies to train supertaggers to take full advantage of the information in supertags.","2","This number is based on footnote 1 of (Chen et al., 1999). A few supertags were grouped into equivalence classes for evaluation","The trigram model often fails in capturing the cooccurrence dependence between a head word and its dependents. Consider the phrase ”will join the board as a nonexecutive director”. The occurrence of join has influence on the lexical selection of as. But join is outside the window of trigram. (Srinivas, 1997) proposed a head trigram model in which the lexical selection of a word depended on the supertags of the previous two head words , instead of the supertags of the two words immediately leading the word of interest. But the performance of this model was worse than the traditional trigram model because it discarded local information.","(Chen et al., 1999) combined the traditional trigram model and head trigram model in their trigram mixed model. In their model, context for the current word was determined by the supertag of the previous word and context for the previous word according to 6 manually defined rules. The mixed model achieved an accuracy of","on the same dataset as that of (Srinivas, 1997). In (Chen et al., 1999), three other models were proposed, but the mixed model achieved the highest accuracy. In addition, they combined all their models with pairwise voting, yielding an accuracy of",".","The mixed trigram model achieves better results on supertagging because it can capture both local and long distance dependencies to some extent. However, we think that a better way to find useful context is to use machine learning techniques but not define the rules manually. One approach is to switch to models like PMM, which can not only take advantage of generative models with the Viterbi algorithm, but also utilize the information in a larger contexts through flexible feature sets. This is the basic idea guiding the design of our supertagger."]},{"title":"3 SNoW","paragraphs":["Sparse Network of Winnow (SNoW) (Roth, 1998) is a learning architecture that is specially tailored for learning in the presence of a very large number of features where the decision for a single sample depends on only a small number of features. Further-more, SNoW can also be used as a general purpose multi-class classifier.","It is noted in (Muñoz et al., 1999) that one of the important properites of the sparse architecture of SNoW is that the complexity of processing an example depends only on the number of features active in it,",", and is independent of the total number of features,",", observed over the life time of the system and this is important in domains in which the total number of features in very large, but only a small number of them is active in each example.","As far as supertagging is concerned, word context forms a very large space. However, for each word in a given sentence, only a small part of features in the space are related to the decision on supertag. Specifically the supertag of a word is determined by the appearances of certain words, POS tags, or supertags in its context. Therefore SNoW is suitable for the supertagging task.","Supertagging can be viewed in term of the sequential model, which means that the selection of the supertag for a word is influenced by the decisions made on the previous few words. (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000) proposed three methods of using classifiers in sequential inference, which are HMM, PMM and CSCL. Among these three models, PMM is the most suitable for our task. The basic idea of PMM is as follows.","Given an observation sequence",", we find the most likely state sequence","given","by maximizing ","                 ","              "," (1)","In this model, the output of SNoW is used to estimate   "," and   ",", where  is the current state,  is the previous state, and","is the current","observation.     "," is separated to many subfunctions   ","according to previous state  . In practice,","  ","","","is estimated in a wider window","of the observed sequence, instead of","only. Then","the problem is how to map the SNoW results into","probabilities. In (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000), the","sigmoid   ","","is defined as confidence,","where","is the threshold for SNoW,","is the dot","product of the weight vector and the example vec-","tor. The confidence is normalized by summing to 1","and used as the distribution mass   ","."]},{"title":"4 Modeling Supertagging 4.1 A Novel Sequential Model with SNoW","paragraphs":["Firstly we have to decide how to treat POS tags. One approach is to assign POS tags at the same time that we do supertagging. The other approach is to assign POS tags with a traditional POS tagger first, and then use them as input to the supertagger. Supertagging an unknown word becomes a problem for supertagging due to the huge size of the supertag set, Hence we use the second approach in our paper. We first run the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1995) on both the training and the test data, and use POS tags as part of the input.","Let",""," ","  be the sentence,","   ","  ","be the POS tags, and"," ","be the supertags respectively. Given  ",", we can find","the most likely supertag sequence given "," by maximizing         ","   ","          ","    Analogous to PMM, we decompose ","   ","    ","","into sub-classifiers. How-","ever, in our model, we divide it with respect to POS","tags as follows ","   ","      ","   ","    "," (2) There are several reasons for decomposing ","   ","    ","","with respect to the POS tag of","the current word, instead of the supertag of the pre-","vious word."," To avoid sparse-data problem. There are 479 supertags in the set of hand-coded supertags, and almost 3000 supertags in the set of supertags extracted from Penn Treebank."," Supertags related to the same POS tag are more difficult to distinguish than supertags related to different POS tags. Thus by defining a classifier on the POS tag of the current word but not the POS tag of the previous word forces the learning algorithm to focus on difficult cases."," Decomposition of the probability estimation can decrease the complexity of the learning algorithm and allows the use of different parameters for different POS tags.","For each POS , we construct a SNoW classifier  to estimate distribution      "," according to the previous supertags ",". Following the estimation of distribution function in (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000), we define confidence with a sigmoid          ","   ","     (3) where  is the threshold of ",", and","is set to 1.","The distribution mass is then defined with normal-","ized confidence                             (4) 4.2 Label Bias Problem In (Lafferty et al., 2001), it is shown that PMM and other non-generative finite-state models based on next-state classifiers share a weakness which they called the label bias problem: the transitions leaving a given state compete only against each other, rather than against all other transitions in the model. They proposed Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as solution to this problem.","(Collins, 2002) proposed a new algorithm for parameter estimation as an alternate to CRF. The new algorithm was similar to maximum-entropy model except that it skipped the local normalization step. Intuitively, it is the local normalization that makes distribution mass of the transitions leaving a given state incomparable with all other transitions.","It is noted in (Muñoz et al., 1999) that SNoW’s output provides, in addition to the prediction, a robust confidence level in the prediction, which enables its use in an inference algorithm that combines predictors to produce a coherent inference. In that paper, SNoW’s output is used to estimate the probability of open and close tags. In general, the probability of a tag can be estimated as follows                                 (5) as one of the anonymous reviewers has suggested.","However, this makes probabilities comparable only within the transitions of the same history ",". An alternative to this approach is to use the SNoW’s output directly in the prediction combination, which makes transitions of different history comparable, since the SNoW’s output provides a robust confidence level in the prediction. Furthermore, in order to make sure that the confidences are not too sharp, we use the confidence defined in (3).","In addition, we use two supertaggers, one scans from left to right and the other scans from right to left. Then we combine the results via pairwise voting as in (van Halteren et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1999) as the final supertag. This approach of voting also helps to cope with the label bias problem. 4.3 Contextual Model       ","","is estimated within a 5-word window","plus two head supertags before the current word.","For each word","",", the basic features are","","","","   ","",",","   ","","","  , ","   ","   and      , the two head supertags before the current","word. Thus ","   ","       ","     ","  ","  ","                A basic feature is called active for word","","if and","only if the corresponding word/POS-tag/supertag appears at a specified place around","",". For our","SNoW classifiers we use unigram and bigram of basic features as our feature set. A feature defined as a","bigram of two basic features is active if and only if","the two basic features are both active. The value of","a feature of","","is set to 1 if this feature is active for   , or 0 otherwise. 4.4 Related Work (Chen, 2001) implemented an MEMM model for supertagging which is analogous to the POS tagging model of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). The feature sets used in the MEMM model were similar to ours. In addition, prefix and suffix features were used to handle rare words. Several MEMM supertaggers were implemented based on distinct feature sets.","In (Muñoz et al., 1999), SNoW was used for text chunking. The IOB tagging model in that paper was similar to our model for supertagging, but there are some differences. They did not decompose the SNoW classifier with respect to POS tags. They used two-level deterministic ( beam-width=1 ) search, in which the second level IOB classifier takes the IOB output of the first classifier as input features."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Evaluation and Analysis","paragraphs":["In our experiments, we use the default settings of the SNoW promotion parameter, demotion parameter and the threshold value given by the SNoW system.

We run supertagging on the training data and use the supertagging result to generate the mapping table used in pairwise voting.","The SNoW supertagger scanning from left to right achieves an accuracy of",", and the one scanning from right to left achieves an accuracy of ",".
