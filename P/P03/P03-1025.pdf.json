A refinement of an RTN-based approximation algorithm is proposed, which extends the state space of the automaton by selectively adding distinctions based on the parsing history at the point of entering a context-free rule. The selection of history items exploits the specificlinguistic nature of word formation. As experiments show, this algorithm avoids an explosion of the size of the automaton in the approximation construction."]},{"title":"1 The locus of word formation rules in grammars for NLP","paragraphs":["In English orthography, compounds following productive word formation patterns are spelled with spaces or hyphens separating the components (e.g., classic car repair workshop). This is convenient from an NLP perspective, since most aspects of word formation can be ignored from the point of view of the conceptually simpler token-internal processes of inflectional morphology, for which standard finite-state techniques can be applied. (Let us assume that to a first approximation, spaces and punctuation are used to identify token boundaries.) It makes it also very easy to access one or more of the components of a compound (like classic car in the example), which is required in many NLP techniques (e.g., in a vector space model).","If an NLP task for English requires detailed information about the structure of compounds (as complex multi-token units), it is natural to use the formalisms of computational syntax for English, i.e., context-free grammars, or possibly unification-based grammars. This makes it possible to deal with the bracketing structure of compounding, which would be impossible to cover in full generality in the finite-statesetting.","In languages like German, spelling conventions for compounds do not support such a convenient split between sub-token processing based on finite-state technology and multi-token processing based on context-free grammars or beyond—in German, even very complex compounds are written without spaces or hyphens: words like Verkehrswegeplanungsbeschleunigungsgesetz (‘law for speeding up the planning of trafficroutes’) appear in corpora. So, for a fully adequate and general account, the token-level analysis in German has to be done at least with a context-free grammar:1","For checking the selection features of derivational affixes, in the general case a tree or bracketing structure is required. For instance, the prefixFehl- combines with nouns (compare (1)); however, it can appear linearly adjacent with a verb, including its own prefix,and only then do we get the suffix-ung, which turns the verb into a noun. (1) N  N  V  N  V  V  N  Fehl ver arbeit ung mis work","‘misprocessing’","1","For a fully general account of derivational morphology in English, the token-level analysis has to go beyond finite-state means too: the prefixnon- in nonrealizability combines with the complex derived adjective realizable, not with the verbal stem realize (and non- could combine with a more complex form). However, since in English there is much less token-level interaction between derivation and compounding, a finite-state approximation of the relevant facts at token-level is more straightforward than in German. Furthermore, context-free power is required to parse the internal bracketing structure of complex words like (2), which occur frequently and productively. (2) N  N  A  A  N  V  N  A  N  V  V  A  N  V  N  Gesund heits ver träg lich keits prüf ung healthy bear examine ‘check for health compatibility’","As the results of the DeKo project on derivational and compositional morphology of German show (Schmid et al. 2001), an adequate account of the word formation principles has to rely on a number of dimensions (or features/attributes) of the morphological units. An affix’s selection of the element it combines with is based on these dimensions. Besides part-of-speech category, the dimensions include origin of the morpheme (Germanic vs. classical, i.e., Latinate or Greek2","), complexity of the unit (simplex/derived), and stem type (for many lemmata, different base stems, derivation stems and compounding stems are stored; e.g., träg in (2) is a derivational stem for the lemma trag(en) (‘bear’); heits is the compositional stem for the affixheit).","Given these dimensions in the affixfeature selection, we need a unification-based (attribute) grammar to capture the word formation principles explicitly in a formal account.

(A basic assumption made here is that a morphological analyzer is typically used in a variety of different system contexts, so broad usability, consistency, simplicity and generality of the architecture are important criteria.)","First, there are a number of NLP applications for which a token-based finite-state analysis is standardly used as the only linguistic analysis. It would be impractical to move to a context-free technology in these areas; at the same time it is desirable to include an account of word formation in these tasks. In particular, it is important to be able to break down complex compounds into the individual components, in order to reach an effect similar to the way compounds are treated in English orthography.","Second, inflectional morphology has mostly been treated in the finite-state two-level paradigm. Since any account of word formation has to be combined with inflectional morphology, using the same technology for both parts guarantees consistency and reusability.4","Third, when a morphological analyzer is used in a linguistically sophisticated application context, there will typically be other linguistic components, most notably a syntactic grammar. In these components, more linguistic information will be available to address derivation/compounding. Since the necessary generative capacity is available in the syntactic grammar anyway, it seems reasonable to leave more sophisticated aspects of morphological analysis to this component (very much like the syntax-based account of English compounds we discussed initially). Given the first two arguments, we will however nevertheless aim for maximal exactness of the finite-stateword formation component."]},{"title":"3 Previous strategies of addressing compounding and derivation","paragraphs":["Naturally, existing morphological analyzers of languages like German include a treatment of compositional morphology (e.g., Schiller 1995). An overgeneration strategy has been applied to ensure coverage of corpus data. Exactness was aspired to for the inflected head of a word (which is always right-peripheral in German), but not for the non-head part of a complex word. The non-head may essentially be a flat concatenation of lexical elements or even an arbitrary sequence of symbols. Clearly, an account making use of morphological principles would be desirable. While the internal structure of a word is not relevant for the identification of the part-of-speech category and morphosyntactic agreement information, it is certainly important for information extraction, information retrieval, and higher-level tasks like machine translation.","4","An alternative is to construct an interface component between a finite-stateinflectional morphology and a context-free word formation component. While this can be conceivably done, it restricts the applicability of the resulting overall system, since many higher-level applications presuppose a finite-state analyzer; this is for instance the case for the Xerox Linguistic Environment (http://www.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/xle/), a development platform for syntactic Lexical-Functional Grammars (Butt et al. 1999).","An alternative strategy—putting emphasis on a linguistically satisfactory account of word formation—is to compile out a higher-level word formation grammar into a finite-state automaton (FSA), assuming a bound to the depth of recursive selfembedding. This strategy was used in a finite-state implementation of the rules in the DeKo project (Schmid et al. 2001), based on the AT&T Lextools toolkit by Richard Sproat.5","The toolkit provides a compilation routine which transforms a certain class of regular-grammar-equivalent rewrite grammars into finite-state transducers. Full context-free recursion has to be replaced by an explicit cascading of special category symbols (e.g., N1, N2, N3, etc.).","Unfortunately, the depth of embedding occur-ring in real examples is at least four, even if we assume that derivations like ver.träg.lich (‘compatible’; in (2)) are stored in the lexicon as complex units: in the initially mentioned compound Verkehrs.wege.planungs.beschleunigungs.gesetz (‘law for speeding up the planning of traffic routes’), we might assume that Verkehrs.wege (‘traffic routes’) is stored as a unit, but the remainder of the analysis is rule-based. With this depth of recursion (and a realistic morphological grammar), we get an unmanagable explosion of the number of states in the compiled (intermediate) FSA."]},{"title":"4 Proposed strategy","paragraphs":["We propose a refinement of finite-state approximation techniques for context-free grammars, as they have been developed for syntax (Pereira and Wright 1997, Grimley-Evans 1997, Johnson 1998, Nederhof 2000). Our strategy assumes that we want to express and develop the morphological grammar at the linguistically satisfactory level of a (context-free-equivalent) unification grammar. In processing, a finite-state approximation of this grammar is used. Exploiting specific facts about morphology, the number of states for the constructed FSA can be kept relatively low, while still being in a position to cover realistic corpus example in an exact way.","The construction is based on the following observation: Intuitively, context-free expressiveness is not needed to constrain grammaticality for most of the 5 Lextools: a toolkit for finite-statelinguistic analysis, AT&T","Labs Research; http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/lextools/ word formation combinations. This is because in most cases, either (i) morphological feature selection is performed between string-adjacent terminal symbols, or (ii) there are no categorial restrictions on possible combinations. (i) is always the case for suffixation, since German morphology is exclusively right-headed.6","So the head of the unit selected by the suffixis always adjacent to it, no matter how complex the unit is:","(5) X Y . . . Y X  (i) is also the case for prefixes combining with a simple unit. (ii) is the case for compounding: while affix-derivation is sensitive to the mentioned dimensions like category and origin, no such grammatical restrictions apply in compounding.7","So the fact that in compounding, the heads of the two combined units may not be adjacent (since the right unit may be complex) does not imply that context-freeness is required to exclude impossible combinations:","(6) X X","X X X","X","or X X","X","X","X","X","X or X X","X X X","X","The only configurationrequiring context-freeness to exclude ungrammatical examples is the combina-tion of a prefixwith a complex morphological unit: (7) X X X  . . .

Note that the inflectional marking is always right-peripheral.","7","Of course, when speakers disambiguate the possible bracketings of a complex compound, they can exclude many combinations as implausible. But this is a defeasible world knowledge-based effect, which should not be modeled as strict selection in a morphological grammar. keeping track of prefixembeddings in particular, but leaving the other operations unrestricted seems well justified. We will show in sec. 6 how such a technique can be devised, building on the algorithm reviewed in sec. 5."]},{"title":"5 RTN-based approximation techniques","paragraphs":["A comprehensive overview and experimental comparison of finite-state approximation techniques for context-free grammars is given in (Nederhof 2000). In Nederhof’s approximation experiments based on an HPSG grammar, the so-called RTN method provided the best trade-off between exactness and the resources required in automaton construction. (Techniques that involve a heavy explosion of the number of states are impractical for non-trivial grammars.) More specifically, a parameterized version of the RTN method, in which the FSA keeps track of possible derivational histories, was considered most adequate.","The RTN method of finite-state approximation is inspired by recursive transition networks (RTNs). RTNs are collections of sub-automata. For each rule in a context-free grammar, a sub-","automaton with","states is constructed: (8)","  ",". . .   ","  . . .","  As a symbol is processed in the  automaton (say,  ), the RTN control jumps to the respective sub-","automaton’s initial state (so, from","","in (8) to a state","  in the sub-automaton for ","), keeping the return","address on a stack representation. When the sub-","automaton is in its final state (","  ), control jumps back to the next state in the ","automaton: ",".","In the RTN-based finite-state approximation of a context-free grammar (which does not have an unlimited stack representation available), the jumps to sub-automata are hard-wired, i.e., transitions for non-terminal symbols like the ","transition from ","to ","are replaced by direct","-transitions to the initial state and from the end state of the respective sub-automata: (9). (Of course, the resulting non-deterministic FSA is then determinized and minimized by standard techniques.)","(9)   ","      . . .","           . . .  . . .  . . .  ","The technique is approximative, since on jumping back, the automaton “for gets” where it had come from, so if there are several rules with a right-hand side occurrence of, say"," ",", the automaton may nondeterministically jump back to the wrong rule.

Hence, with parameter","(“R TN2”), the technique is usable for non-trivial syntactic grammars. Nederhof (2000) discusses an important additional step for avoiding an explosion of the size of the in-termediate, non-deterministic FSA: before the described approximation is performed, the context-free grammar is split up into subgrammars of mutually recursive categories (i.e., categories which can participate in a recursive cycle); in each sub-grammar, all other categories are treated as non-terminal symbols. For each subgrammar, the RTN construction and FSA minimization is performed separately, so in the end, the relatively small minimized FSAs can be reassembled."]},{"title":"6 A selective history-based RTN-method","paragraphs":["In word formation, the split of the original grammar into subgrammars of mutually recursive (MR) categories has no great complexity-reducing effect (if any), contrary to the situation in syntax. Essentially, all recursive categories are part of a single large equivalence class of MR categories. Hence, the size of the grammar that has to be effectively approximated is fairly large (recall that we are dealing with a compiled-out unificationgrammar). For a realistic grammar, the parameterized RTN technique is unusable with parameter","","or higher. Moreover, a history of just two previous embeddings (as we get it with","",") is too limited in a heavily recursive setting like word formation: recursive embeddings of depth four occur in realistic text.","However, we can exploit more effectively the “mildly context-free” characteristics of morphological grammars (at least of German) discussed in sec. 4. We propose a refinedversion of the parameterized RTN-method, with a selective recording of derivational history. We stipulate a distinction of two types of rules: “historically important” h-rules (written","  "," ) and non-h-rules (written   ","","). The h-rules are treated as in the parameterized RTN-method. The non-h-rules are not recorded in the construction of history lists; they are however taken into account in the determination of legal histories. For instance,"," ","","  will appear as a legal history for the sub-automaton for some category D only if there is a derivation B  ","D","(i.e., a sequence of rule rewrites making use of non-h-rules). By classifying certain rules as non-h-rules, we can concentrate record-keeping resources on a particular subset of rules.","In sec. 4, we saw that for most rules in the compiled-out context-free grammar for German morphology (all rules compiled from (3b) and (3c)), the inexactness of the RTN-approximation does not have any negative effect (either due to headadjacency, which is preserved by the non-parametric version of RTN, or due to lack of category-specific constraints, which means that no context-free balancing is checked). Hence, it is safe to classify these rules as non-h-rules. The only rules in which the inexactness may lead to overgeneration are the ones compiled from the prefix rule (3a). Marking these rules as h-rules and doing selective history-based RTN construction gives us exactly the desired effect: we will get an FSA that will accept a free alternation of all three word-formation types (as far as compatible with the lexical affixes’ selection), but stacking of prefixes is kept track of.

Especially the second optimization is very effective in a selective history setting, since the “immediate” recursion need not be literally immediate, but an arbitrary number of nonh-rules may intervene. So if we find a noun prefix [N   N  ","","N], i.e., we are looking for a noun, we need not pay attention (in terms of coverage-relevant history distinctions) whether we are running into compounds or suffixations: we know, when we find another noun prefix (with the same selection features, i.e., origin etc.), one analysis will always be to close off both prefixationswith the same noun: (12) N","N  N N ","N",". . .

The resulting automaton is determinized and minimized, using the FSA library for Prolog by Gertjan van Noord.9","Emphasis was put on identifying the most suitable strategy for dealing with word formation taking into account the relative size of the FSAs generated (other techniques than the selective history strategy were tried out and discarded).","The algorithm was applied on a sample word formation grammar with 185 compiled-out context-free rules, displaying the principled mechanism of category and other feature selection, but not the full set of distinctions made in the DeKo project. 9 of the rules were compiled from the prefixation rule, and were thus marked as h-rules for the selective method.","We ran a comparison between a version of the non-selective parameterized RTN-method of (Nederhof 2000) and the selective history method proposed in this paper. An overview of the results is given in fig. 1.10","It should be noted that the optimizations of sec. 7 were applied in both methods (the non-selective method was simulated by mark-9 FSA6.2xx: Finite State Automata Utilities;","http://odur.let.rug.nl/ṽannoord/Fsa/ 10 The fact that the minimized FSAs for","are identical","for the selective method is an artefact of the sample grammar. ing all rules as h-rules).","As the size results show, the non-deterministic FSAs constructed by the selective method are more complex (and hence resource-intensive in minimization) than the ones produced by the “plain” parameterized version. However, the difference in exactness of the approximizations has to be taken into account. As a tentative indication for this, note that the minimized FSA for","","in the plain version has only two states; so obviously too many distinctions from the context-free grammar have been lost.","In the plain version, all word formation operations are treated alike, hence the history list of length one or two is quickly filled up with items that need not be recorded. A comparison of the number of different pairs of categories and history lists used in the construction shows that the selective method is more economical in the use of memory space as the depth parameter grows larger. (For","","",", the selective method would even have fewer different category/history list pairs than the plain method, since the patterns become repetitive.

Since the selective method uses non-h-rules only in the determination of legal histories (as discussed in sec. 6), it can actually “see” further back into the history than the length of the history list would suggest.","What the comparison clearly indicates is that in terms of resource requirements, our selective method with a parameter","","is much closer to the  ","-version of the plain RTN-method than to the next higher","","","","version. But since the selective method focuses its record-keeping resources on the crucial aspects of the finite-state approximation, it brings about a much higher gain in exactness than just extending the history list by one in the plain method.","We also ran the selective method on a more finegrained morphological grammar with 403 rules (including 12 h-rules).

For a full evaluation of the coverage and exactness of the approach, a comprehensive implementation of the morphological grammar would be required. We ran a preliminary experiment with a small grammar, focusing on the cases that might be problematic: we extracted from the corpus a random sample of 100 word forms containing prefixes. From these 100 forms, we generated about 3700 grammatical and ungrammatical test examples by omission, addition and permutation of stems and affixes.
