For a substantial number of linguistic phenomena such as topicalisation, wh-movement in relative clauses and interrogative sentences, however, there is an important difference between the location of the (surface) realisation of linguistic material and the location where this material should be interpreted semantically. Resolution of such long-distance dependencies (LDDs) is therefore crucial in the determination of accurate predicate-argument struc-1","Manually constructed f-structures for 105 randomly selected trees from Section 23 of the WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank ture, deep dependency relations and the construction of proper meaning representations such as logical forms (Johnson, 2002).","Modern unification/constraint-based grammars such as LFG or HPSG capture deep linguistic information including LDDs, predicate-argument structure, or logical form. Manually scaling rich unification grammars to naturally occurring free text, however, is extremely time-consuming, expensive and requires considerable linguistic and computa-tional expertise. Few hand-crafted, deep unification grammars have in fact achieved the coverage and robustness required to parse a corpus of say the size and complexity of the Penn treebank: (Riezler et al., 2002) show how a deep, carefully hand-crafted LFG is successfully scaled to parse the Penn-II treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) with discriminative (log-linear) parameter estimation techniques.","The last 20 years have seen continuously increas-ing efforts in the construction of parse-annotated corpora. Substantial treebanks2","are now available for many languages (including English, Japanese, Chinese, German, French, Czech, Turkish), others are currently under construction (Arabic, Bulgarian) or near completion (Spanish, Catalan). Treebanks have been enormously influential in the develop-ment of robust, state-of-the-art parsing technology: grammars (or grammatical information) automatically extracted from treebank resources provide the backbone of many state-of-the-art probabilistic parsing approaches (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999; Hockenmaier, 2003; Klein and Manning, 2003). Such approaches are attractive as they achieve robustness, coverage and performance while incurring very low grammar development cost. However, with few notable exceptions (e.g. Collins’ Model 3, (Johnson, 2002), (Hockenmaier, 2003) ), treebank-based probabilistic parsers return fairly simple “surfacey” CFG trees, without deep syntactic or semantic information. The grammars used by such systems are sometimes re-2 Or dependency banks. ferred to as “half” (or “shallow”) grammars (Johnson, 2002), i.e. they do not resolve LDDs but interpret linguistic material purely locally where it occurs in the tree.","Recently (Cahill et al., 2002) showed how wide-coverage, probabilistic unification grammar resources can be acquired automatically from f-structure-annotated treebanks. Many second generation treebanks provide a certain amount of deep syntactic or dependency information (e.g. in the form of Penn-II functional tags and traces) supporting the computation of representations of deep linguistic information. Exploiting this information (Cahill et al., 2002) implement an automatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithm that associates nodes in treebank trees with f-structure annotations in the form of attribute-value structure equations representing abstract predicate-argument structure/dependency relations. From the f-structure annotated treebank they automatically extract wide-coverage, robust, PCFG-based LFG approximations that parse new text into trees and f-structure representations.","The LFG approximations of (Cahill et al., 2002), however, are only “half” grammars, i.e. like most of their probabilistic CFG cousins (Charniak, 1996; Johnson, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003) they do not resolve LDDs but interpret linguistic material purely locally where it occurs in the tree.","In this paper we show how finite approximations of long distance dependency resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic LFG resources automatically acquired from treebanks. We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDD reentrancies from f-structures generated automatically for the Penn-II treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolution algorithm to parse new text. Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our approach LDDs are resolved on the level of f-structure representation, rather than in terms of empty productions and coindexation on parse trees.

C-structure captures surface grammatical configurations, f-structure encodes abstract syntactic information approximating to predicate-argument/dependency structure or simple logical form (van Genabith and Crouch, 1996).

This partitions local subtrees of depth one (corresponding to CFG rules) into left and right contexts (relative to head). The annotation algorithm is modular with four components (Figure 2): left-right (L-R) annotation principles (e.g. leftmost NP to right of V head of VP type rule is likely to be an object etc.); coordination annotation principles (separating these out simplifies other components of the algorithm); traces (translates traces and coindexation in trees into corresponding reentrancies in f-structure ( 1 in Figure 3)); catch all and clean-up.

In LFG, LDDs are resolved at the f-structure level, obviating the need for empty productions and traces in trees (Dalrymple, 2001), using functional uncertainty (FU) equations. FUs are regular expressions specifying paths in f-structure between a source (where linguistic material is encountered) and a target (where linguistic material is interpreted semantically). To account for the fronted sentential constituents in Figures 3 and 4, an FU equation of the form ↑ TOPIC = ↑ COMP* COMP would be required. The equation states that the value of the TOPIC at-tribute is token identical with the value of the final COMP argument along a path through the immediately enclosing f-structure along zero or more COMP attributes.

As an example, for a topicalised constituent to be resolved as the argument of a local predicate as specified by the FU equation, the local predicate must (i) subcategorise for the argument in question and (ii) the argument in question must not be already filled. Subcategorisation requirements are provided lexically in terms of semantic forms (subcat lists) and coherence and completeness conditions (all GFs specified must be present, and no others may be present) on f-structure representations. Semantic forms specify which grammatical functions (GFs) a predicate requires locally. For our example in Figures 3 and 4, the relevant lexical entries are: V → said ↑PRED=say⟨↑ SUBJ, ↑ COMP⟩ V → signs ↑PRED=sign⟨↑ SUBJ, ↑ OBJ⟩ FU equations and subcategorisation requirements together ensure that LDDs can only be resolved at suitable f-structure locations."]},{"title":"6 Acquiring Lexical and LDD Resources","paragraphs":["In order to model the LFG account of LDD resolution we require subcat frames (i.e. semantic forms) and LDD resolution paths through f-structure.

If the automatic f-structure annotation algorithm outlined in Section 3 generates high quality f-structures, reliable semantic forms can be extracted (reverse-engineered): for each f-structure generated, for each level of embedding we determine the local PRED value and collect the governable, i.e. subcategorisable grammatical functions present at that level of embedding. For the proper f-structure in Figure 3 we obtain sign([subj,obj]) and say([subj,comp]). We extract frames from the full WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank with 48K trees. Unlike many other approaches, our extraction process does not predefine frames, fully reflects LDDs in the source data-structures (cf. Figure 3), discriminates between active and passive frames, computes GF, GF:CFG category pair-as well as CFG category-based subcategorisation frames and associates conditional probabilities with frames.

Some of these involve extensive cleanup of the underlying Penn-II treebank resource prior to grammar extraction. In contrast, in our approach we leave the treebank as is and only add (but never correct) annotations. Earlier HPSG work (Tateisi et al., 1998) is based on independently constructed hand-crafted XTAG resources. In contrast, we acquire our resources from treebanks and achieve substantially wider coverage.","Our approach provides wide-coverage, robust, and – with the addition of LDD resolution – “deep” or “full”, PCFG-based LFG approximations. Crucially, we do not claim to provide fully adequate statistical models. It is well known (Abney, 1997) that PCFG-type approximations to unification grammars can yield inconsistent probability models due to loss of probability mass: the parser successfully returns the highest ranked parse tree but the constraint solver cannot resolve the f-equations (generated in the pipeline or “hidden” in the integrated model) and the probability mass associated with that tree is lost. This case, however, is surprisingly rare for our grammars: only 0.0018% (85 out of 48424) of the original Penn-II trees (without FRAGs) fail to produce an f-structure due to inconsistent annotations (Table 1), and for parsing section 23 with the integrated model (A-PCFG), only 9 sentences do not receive a parse because no f-structure can be generated for the highest ranked tree (0.4%). Parsing with the pipeline model, all sentences receive one complete f-structure. Research on adequate probability models for unification grammars is important. (Miyao et al., 2003) present a Penn-II treebank based HPSG with log-linear probability models. They achieve coverage of 50.2% on section 23, as against 99% in our approach. (Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004) describe how a carefully hand-crafted LFG is scaled to the full Penn-II treebank with log-linear based probability models. They achieve 79% coverage (full parse) and 21% fragement/skimmed parses. By the same measure, full parse coverage is around 99% for our automatically acquired PCFG-based LFG approximations. Against the PARC 700, the hand-crafted LFG grammar reported in (Kaplan et al., 2004) achieves an f-score of 79.6%. For the same experiment, our best automatically-induced grammar achieves an f-score of 80.24%."]},{"title":"10 Conclusions","paragraphs":["We presented and extensively evaluated a finite approximation of LDD resolution in automatically constructed, wide-coverage, robust, PCFG-based LFG approximations, effectively turning the “half”(or “shallow”)-grammars presented in (Cahill et al., 2002) into “full” or “deep” grammars. In our approach, LDDs are resolved in f-structure, not trees. The method achieves a preds-only f-score of 80.97% for f-structures with the PA-PCFG in the integrated architecture against the DCU 105 and 78.4% against the 2,416 automatically generated f-structures for the original Penn-II treebank trees. Evaluating against the PARC 700 Dependency Bank, the P-PCFG achieves an f-score of 80.24%, an overall improvement of approximately 0.6% on the result reported for the best hand-crafted grammars in (Kaplan et al., 2004)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was funded by Enterprise Ireland Basic Research Grant SC/2001/186 and IRCSET."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["S.
