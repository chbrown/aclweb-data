NLTK is written in Python and distributed under the GPL open source license. Over the past three years, NLTK has become popular in teaching and research. We describe the toolkit and report on its current state of development."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was developed in conjunction with a computational linguistics course at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001 (Loper and Bird, 2002). It was designed with three pedagogical applications in mind: assignments, demonstrations, and projects.","Assignments. NLTK supports assignments of varying difficultyand scope. In the simplest assignments, students experiment with existing components to perform a wide variety of NLP tasks. As students become more familiar with the toolkit, they can be asked to modify existing components, or to create complete systems out of existing components.","Demonstrations. NLTK’s interactive graphical demonstrations have proven to be very useful for students learning NLP concepts. The demonstrations give a step-by-step execution of important algorithms, displaying the current state of key data structures. A screenshot of the chart parsing demonstration is shown in Figure 1.","Projects. NLTK provides students with a fle xible framework for advanced projects. Typical projects might involve implementing a new algorithm, developing a new component, or implementing a new task.","We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its syntax and semantics are transparent, and it has good string-handling functionality. As an interpreted language, Python facilitates interactive exploration. As an object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily. Python comes with an extensive standard library, including tools for graphical programming and numerical processing. The recently added generator syntax makes it easy to create interactive implementations of algorithms (Loper, 2004; Rossum, 2003a; Rossum, 2003b). Figure 1: Interactive Chart Parsing Demonstration"]},{"title":"2 Design","paragraphs":["NLTK is implemented as a large collection of minimally interdependent modules, organized into a shallow hierarchy. A set of core modules definesbasic data types that are used throughout the toolkit. The remaining modules are task modules, each devoted to an individual natural language processing task. For example, the nltk.parser module encompasses to the task of parsing, or deriving the syntactic structure of a sentence; and the nltk.tokenizer module is devoted to the task of tokenizing, or dividing a text into its constituent parts. 2.1 Tokens and other core data types To maximize interoperability between modules, we use a single class to encode information about natural language texts – the Token class. Each Token instance represents a unit of text such as a word, sentence, or document, and is definedby a (partial) mapping from property names to values. For example, the TEXT property is used to encode a token’s text content:1 >>> from nltk.token import * >>> Token(TEXT=\"Hello World!\") <Hello World!> The TAG property is used to encode a token’s part-of-speech tag: >>> Token(TEXT=\"python\", TAG=\"NN\") <python/NN> The SUBTOKENS property is used to store a tokenized text: >>> from nltk.tokenizer import * >>> tok = Token(TEXT=\"Hello World!\") >>> WhitespaceTokenizer().tokenize(tok) >>> print tok[’SUBTOKENS’]) [<Hello>, <World!>] In a similar fashion, other language processing tasks such as word-sense disambiguation, chunking and parsing all add properties to the Token data structure.","In general, language processing tasks are formulated as annotations and transformations involving Tokens. In particular, each processing task takes a token and extends it to include new information. These modifications are typically monotonic; new information is added but existing information is not deleted or modified. Thus, tokens serve as a blackboard, where information about a piece of text is collated. This architecture contrasts with the more typical pipeline architecture where each processing task’s output discards its input information. We chose the blackboard approach over the pipeline approach because it allows more fle xibility when combining tasks into a single system.","In addition to the Token class and its derivatives, NLTK defines a variety of other data types. For instance, the probability module definesclasses for probability distributions and statistical smooth-ing techniques; and the cfg module definesclasses for encoding context free grammars and probabilistic context free grammars.","1","Some code samples are specific to NLTK version 1.4. 2.2 The corpus module Many language processing tasks must be developed and tested using annotated data sets or corpora. Several such corpora are distributed with NLTK, as listed in Table 1. The corpus module defines classes for reading and processing many of these corpora. The following code fragment illustrates how the Brown Corpus is accessed. >>> from nltk.corpus import brown >>> brown.groups() [’skill and hobbies’, ’popular lore’, ’humor’, ’fiction: mystery’, ...] >>> brown.items(’humor’) (’cr01’, ’cr02’, ’cr03’, ’cr04’, ’cr05’, ’cr06’, ’cr07’, ’cr08’, ’cr09’) >>> brown.tokenize(’cr01’) <[<It/pps>, <was/bedz>, <among/in>, <these/dts>, <that/cs>, <Hinkle/np>, <identified/vbd>, <a/at>, ...]> A selection of 5% of the Penn Treebank corpus is included with NLTK, and it is accessed as follows: >>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> treebank.groups() (’raw’, ’tagged’, ’parsed’, ’merged’) >>> treebank.items(’parsed’) [’wsj_0001.prd’, ’wsj_0002.prd’, ...] >>> item = ’parsed/wsj_0001.prd’ >>> sentences = treebank.tokenize(item) >>> for sent in sentences[’SUBTOKENS’]: ... print sent.pp() # pretty-print (S:","(NP-SBJ:","(NP: <Pierre> <Vinken>)","(ADJP:","(NP: <61> <years>)","<old> ) ... 2.3 Processing modules Each language processing algorithm is implemented as a class. For example, the ChartParser and RecursiveDescentParser classes each define a single algorithm for parsing a text. We implement language processing algorithms using classes instead of functions for three reasons. First, all algorithm-specificoptions can be passed to the constructor, allowing a consistent interface for applying the algorithms. Second, a number of algorithms need to have their state initialized before they can be used. For example, the NthOrderTagger class Corpus Contents and Wordcount Example Application 20 Newsgroups (selection) 3 newsgroups, 4000 posts, 780kw text classification Brown Corpus 15 genres, 1.15Mw, tagged training & testing taggers, text classification CoNLL 2000 Chunking Data 270kw, tagged and chunked training & testing chunk parsers Project Gutenberg (selection) 14 texts, 1.7Mw text classification, language modelling NIST 1999 IEER (selection) 63kw, named-entity markup training & testing named-entity recognizers Levin Verb Index 3k verbs with Levin classes parser development Names Corpus 8k male & female names text classification PP Attachment Corpus 28k prepositional phrases, tagged parser development Roget’s Thesaurus 200kw, formatted text word-sense disambiguation SEMCOR 880kw, POS & sense tagged word-sense disambiguation SENSEVAL 2 Corpus 600kw, POS & sense tagged word-sense disambiguation Stopwords Corpus 2,400 stopwords for 11 lgs text retrieval Penn Treebank (sample) 40kw, tagged & parsed parser development Wordnet 1.7 180kw in a semantic network WSD, NL understanding Wordlist Corpus 960kw and 20k affixes for 8 lgs spell checking Table 1: Corpora and Corpus Samples Distributed with NLTK must be initialized by training on a tagged corpus before it can be used. Third, subclassing can be used to create specialized versions of a given algorithm.","Each processing module defines an interface for its task. Interface classes are distinguished by naming them with a trailing capital “ I,” such as ParserI. Each interface defines a single action method which performs the task defined by the interface. For example, the ParserI interface defines the parse method and the Tokenizer interface defines the tokenize method. When appropriate, an interface defines extended action methods, which provide variations on the basic action method. For example, the ParserI interface defines the parse n method which finds at most n parses for a given sentence; and the TokenizerI interface defines the xtokenize method, which outputs an iterator over subtokens instead of a list of subtokens.","NLTK includes the following modules: cfg, corpus, draw (cfg, chart, corpus, featurestruct, fsa, graph, plot, rdparser, srparser, tree), eval, featurestruct, parser (chart, chunk, probabilistic), probability, sense, set, stemmer (porter), tagger, test, token, tokenizer, tree, and util. Please see the online documentation for details. 2.4 Documentation Three different types of documentation are available. Tutorials explain how to use the toolkit, with detailed worked examples. The API documentation describes every module, interface, class, method, function, and variable in the toolkit. Technical reports explain and justify the toolkit’s design and implementation. All are available from http:// nltk.sf.net/docs.html."]},{"title":"3 Installing NLTK","paragraphs":["NLTK is available from nltk.sf.net, and is packaged for easy installation under Unix, Mac OS X and Windows. The full distribution consists of four packages: the Python source code (nltk); the corpora (nltk-data); the documentation (nltk-docs); and third-party contributions (nltk-contrib). Before installing NLTK, it is necessary to install Python version 2.3 or later, available from www.python.org. Full installation instructions and a quick start guide are available from the NLTK homepage.","As soon as NLTK is installed, users can run the demonstrations.
