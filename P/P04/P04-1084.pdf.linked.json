As shown by Melamed (2003), a plausible model of parallel text must be able to express discontinuous constituents. Since linguistic expressions can vanish in translation, a good model must be able to express independent (in addition to synchronous) rewriting. In-version Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) and Syntax-Directed Translation Schema (SDTS) (Aho and Ullman, 1969) lack both of these properties. Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG) (Shieber, 1994) lacks the latter and allows only limited discontinuities in each tree.","Generalized Multitext Grammar (GMTG) offers a way to synchronize Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar (MCSG), while satisfying both of the above criteria. The move to MCSG is motivated by our desire to more perspicuously account for certain syntactic phenomena that cannot be easily captured by context-free grammars, such as clitic climbing, extraposition, and other types of longdistance movement (Becker et al., 1991). On the other hand, MCSG still observes some restrictions that make the set of languages it generates less expensive to analyze than the languages generated by (properly) context-sensitive formalisms.","More technically, our proposal starts from Multitext Grammar (MTG), a formalism for synchronizing context-free grammars recently proposed by Melamed (2003). In MTG, synchronous rewriting is implemented by means of an indexing relation that is maintained over occurrences of nonterminals in a sentential form, using essentially the same machinery as SDTS. Unlike SDTS, MTG can extend the dimensionality of the translation relation beyond two, and it can implement independent rewriting by means of partial deletion of syntactic structures. Our proposal generalizes MTG by moving from component grammars that generate context-free languages to component grammars whose generative power is equivalent to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), a formalism for describing a class of MCSGs. The generalization is achieved by allowing context-free productions to rewrite tuples of strings, rather than single strings. Thus, we retain the intuitive top-down definition of synchronous derivation original in SDTS and MTG but not found in LCFRS, while extending the generative power to linear context-free rewriting languages. In this respect, GMTG has also been in-spired by the class of Local Unordered Scattered Context Grammars (Rambow and Satta, 1999). A syntactically very different synchronous formalism involving LCFRS has been presented by Bertsch and Nederhof (2001).","This paper begins with an informal description of GMTG. It continues with an investigation of this formalism’s generative capacity. Next, we prove that in GMTG each component grammar retains its generative power, a requirement for synchronous formalisms that Rambow and Satta (1996) called the “weak language preservation property.” Lastly, we propose a synchronous generalization of Chomsky Normal Form, which lays the groundwork for synchronous parsing under GMTG using a CKY-style algorithm (Younger, 1967; Melamed, 2004)."]},{"title":"2 Informal Description and Comparisons","paragraphs":["GMTG is a generalization of MTG, which is itself a generalization of CFG to the synchronous case. Here we present MTG in a new notation that shows the relation to CFG more clearly. For example, the following MTG productions can generate the multitext [(I fed the cat), (ya kota kormil)]:1","","(S) (S) ","PN VP ","PN VP (1)  PN  PN  I  ya (2)  VP  VP ","V NP"," ","NP V"," (3)  V  V  fed  kormil (4)  NP  NP ","D N"," ","N  (5)  D    the   (6)  N  N  cat  kota (7) Each production in this example has two components, the first modeling English and the second (transliterated) Russian. Nonterminals with the same index must be rewritten together (synchronous rewriting). One strength of MTG, and thus also GMTG, is shown in Productions (5) and (6). There is a determiner in English, but not in Russian, so Production (5) does not have the nonterminal D in the Russian component and (6) applies only to the English component (independent rewriting). For-malisms that do not allow independent rewriting require a corresponding","to appear in the second component on the right-hand side (RHS) of Production (5), and this","would eventually generate the empty string. This approach has the disadvantage that it introduces spurious ambiguity about the position of the “empty” nonterminal with respect to the other nonterminals in its component. Spurious ambiguity leads to wasted effort during parsing.","GMTG’s implementation of independent rewriting through the empty tuple () serves a very different function from the empty string. Consider the following GMTG:         (8)           (9)                 (10)                 (11) Production (8) asserts that symbol  vanishes in translation. Its application removes both of the nonterminals on the left-hand side (LHS), pre-empting any other production. In contrast, Production (9) 1","We write production components both side by side and one above another to save space, but each component is always in parentheses. explicitly relaxes the synchronization constraint, so that the two components can be rewritten independently. The other six productions make assertions about only one component and are agnostic about the other component. Incidentally, generating the same language with only fully synchronized productions would raise the number of required productions to 11, so independent rewriting also helps to reduce grammar size.","Independent rewriting is also useful for modeling paraphrasing. Take, for example, [(Tim got a pink slip), (Tim got laid off )]. While the two sentences have the same meaning, the objects of their verb phrases are structured very differently. GMTG can express their relationships as follows:"," S  S ","NP VP ","NP VP (12)  VP  VP ","V NP"," ","V PP"," (13)  NP  PP ","DT A","N ","VB R (14)  NP  NP  Tim  Tim (15)  V  V  got  got (16)  DT    a   (17)  A    pink   (18)  N    slip   (19)    VB    laid (20)    R    off (21)","As described by Melamed (2003), MTG requires production components to be contiguous, except after binarization. GMTG removes this restriction. Take, for example, the sentence pair [(The doctor treats his teeth), (El médico le examino los dientes)] (Dras and Bleam, 2000). The Spanish clitic le and the NP los dientes should both be paired with the English NP his teeth, giving rise to a discontinuous constituent in the Spanish component. A GMTG fragment for the sentence is shown below:"," S  S ","NP VP"," ","NP VP","  VP  VP ","V NP"," ","NP V NP","  NP  NP  The doctor  El médico  V  V  treats  examino  NP ","NP NP  his teeth ","le los dientes Note the discontinuity between le and los dientes. Such discontinuities are marked by commas on both the LHS and the RHS of the relevant component.","GMTG’s fle xibility allows it to deal with many complex syntactic phenomena. For example, Becker et al. (1991) point out that TAG does not have the generative capacity to model certain kinds of scrambling in German, when the so-called “co-occurrence constraint” is imposed, requiring the derivational pairing between verbs and their complements. They examine the English/German sentence fragment [(... that the detective has promised the client to indict the suspect of the crime), (... daß des Verbrechens der Detektiv den Verd ächtigen dem Klienten zu überführen versprochen hat)]. The verbs versprochen and überführen both have two noun phrases as arguments. In German, these noun phrases can appear to the left of the verbs in any order. The following is a GMTG fragment for the above sentence pair2",":   S  S    ","N ","has promised N  ","S   ","S N ","","S N ","","S versprochen hat"," (22)    S  ","S  S  S","   ","to indict N  ","N   ","N   ","N   ","zu überführen  (23) The discontinuities allow the noun arguments of versprochen to be placed in any order with the noun arguments of überführen. Rambow (1995) gives a similar analysis."]},{"title":"3 Formal Definitions","paragraphs":["Let be a finite set of nonterminal symbols and let","be the set of integers.3 We define             ",".4 Elements of    ","will be called indexed nonterminal symbols.

We say the link  is nullable and the string at address     in  is nullable. For each nullable link, we create   versions of the link, where is the number of nullable strings of that link. There is one version for each of the possible combinations of the nullable strings being present or absent. The version of the link with all strings present is its original version. Each non-original version of the link (except in the case of start links) gets a unique subscript, which is applied to all the nonterminals in the link, so that each link is unique in the grammar. We construct a new grammar","","whose set of productions"," is determined as follows: for each production, we identify the nullable links on the RHS and replace them with each combination of the non-original versions found earlier. If a string is left empty during this process, that string is removed from the RHS and the fan-out of the production component is reduced by one. The link on the LHS is replaced with its appropriate matching non-original link. There is one exception to the replacements. If a production consists of all nullable strings, do not include this case. Lastly, we remove all strings on the RHS of productions that have","’s, and reduce the fan-out of the productions accordingly.

In this paper, we have presented some formal properties of GMTG, including proofs that the generative capacity of GMTG is comparable to ordinary LCFRS, and that GMTG has the weak language preservation property. We also proposed a synchronous generalization of Chomsky Normal Form, laying the founda-tion for synchronous CKY parsing under GMTG. In future work, we shall explore the empirical properties of GMTG, by inducing stochastic GMTGs from real multitexts."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks to Owen Rambow and the anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.
