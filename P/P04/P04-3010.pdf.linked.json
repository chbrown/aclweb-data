In English POS tagging, word is used as a linguistic unit. However, the number of possible words in agglutinative languages such as Korean is almost infinite because words can be freely formed by gluing morphemes together. Therefore, morpheme-unit tagging is preferred and more suitable in such languages than word-unit tagging. Figure 1 shows an example of morpheme structure of a sentence, where the bold lines indicate the most likely morpheme-POS sequence. A solid line represents a transition between two morphemes across a word boundary and a dotted line represents a transition between two morphemes in a word.","The previous probabilistic POS models for agglutinative languages have considered only lexical forms of morphemes, not surface forms of words.

A lexical form of a word can be mapped to more than one surface word. In this case, although the different surface forms are given, if they have the same lexical form, then the probabilities will be the same. For example, a lexical form mong-go/nc+leul/jc2",", can be mapped from two surface forms mong-gol and mong-go-leul.By applying Equation 1 and Equation 2 to both words, the following equations can be derived:","","","mong-go",""," leul","","","mong-gol","","  mong-go","","","leul","","","(4)","","","mong-go",""," leul","","","mong-go-leul","","  mong-go","","","leul","","","(5) As a result, we can acquire the following equation from Equation 4 and Equation 5:","","","mong-go","","leul","","","mong-gol","","","","mong-go  ","leul","","","mong-go-leul","(6)","That is, they assume that probabilities of","the results that have the same lexical form","are the same.

We divided the test data into ten parts. The performances of the model are measured by averaging over the ten test sets in the 10-fold cross-validation experiment. Table 1 shows the summary of the corpora.","Table 1: Summary of the data Corpus ETRI KAIST Total # of words 288,291 175,468 Total # of sentences 27,855 16,193 # of tags 27 54","Generally, POS tagging goes through the following steps: First, run a morphological analyzer, where it generates all the possible interpretations for a given input text. Then, a POS tagger takes the results as input and chooses the most likely one among them. Therefore, the performance of the tagger depends on that of the preceding morphological analyzer.","If the morphological analyzer does not generate the exact result, the tagger has no chance to select the correct one, thus an answer inclusion rate of the morphological analyzer becomes the upper bound of the tagger. The previous works preprocessed the dictionary to include all the exact an-swers in the morphological analyzer’s results. However, this evaluation method is inappropriate to the real application in the strict sense. In this experiment, we present the accuracy of the morphological analyzer instead of preprocessing the dictionary. ProKOMA’s results with the test data are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Morphological analyzer’s results with the test data Corpus ETRI KAIST Answer inclusion rate (%) 95.82 95.95 Average # of results per word 2.16 1.81 1-best accuracy (%) 88.31 90.12","In the table, 1-best accuracy is defined as the number of words whose result with the highest probability is matched to the gold standard over the entire words in the test data. This can also be a tagging model that does not consider any outer context.","To compare the proposed model with the standard model, the results of the two models are given in Table 3. As can be seen, our model outperforms the HMM model. Moreover, the HMM model is even worse than the ProKOMA’s 1-best accuracy. This tells that the standard HMM by itself is not a good model for agglutinative languages."]},{"title":"4 Conclusion","paragraphs":["We have presented a new POS tagging model that can consider the surface form for Korean, which BOS EOSNNP na PX neun NNC hag-gyo PA e VV ga EFF n-da Figure 2: Lattice of the bigram HMM-based model na/NNP+neun/PX hag-gyo/NNC+e/PA ga/VV+n-da/EFFBOS EOS na-neun hag-gyo-e gan-da Figure 3: Lattice of the proposed model","Table 3: Tagging accuracies (%) of the standard","HMM and the proposed model Corpus ETRI KAIST The standard HMM 87.47 89.83 The proposed model 90.66 92.01 is an agglutinative language.
