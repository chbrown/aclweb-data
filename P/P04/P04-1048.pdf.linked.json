Lexical synonymy (She esteemed him highly vs. She respected him greatly), syntactic variation (John paid the bill vs. The bill was paid by John), overlapping meanings (Anna turned at Elm vs. Anna rounded the corner at Elm), and other phenomena interact to produce a broad range of choices for most language generation tasks (Hirst, 2003; Rinaldi et al., 2003; Kozlowski et al., 2003). At the same time, natural language understanding must recognize what remains constant across paraphrases.","The paraphrase phenomenon affects many computational linguistic applications, including information retrieval, information extraction, question-answering, and machine translation. For example, documents that express the same content using different linguistic means should typically be retrieved for the same queries. Information sought to answer a question needs to be recognized no matter how it is expressed.","Semantic frames (Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992) address the paraphrase problem through their slot-and-filler templates, representing frequently occurring, structured experiences. Semantic frame types of an intermediate granularity have the potential to fulfill an interlingua role within a solution to the paraphrase problem.","Until now, semantic frames have been generated by hand (as in Fillmore and Atkins, 1992), based on native speaker intuition; the FrameNet project (http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ ~framenet; Johnson et al., 2002) now couples this generation with empirical validation. Only recently has this project begun to achieve relative breadth in its inventory of semantic frames. To have a comprehensive inventory of semantic frames, however, we need the capacity to generate semantic frames semi-automatically (the need for manual post-editing is assumed).","To address these challenges, we have developed SemFrame, a system that induces semantic frames automatically. Overall, the system performs two primary functions: (1) identification of sets of verb senses that evoke a common semantic frame (in the sense that lexical units call forth corresponding conceptual structures); and (2) identification of the conceptual structure of semantic frames. This paper explores the first task of identifying frame semantic verb classes. These classes have several types of uses. First, they are the basis for identifying the internal structure of the frame proper, as set forth in Green and Dorr, 2004. Second, they may be used to extend FrameNet. Third, they support applications needing access to sets of semantically related words, for example, text segmentation and word sense disambiguation, as explored to a limited degree in Green, 2004.","Section 2 presents related research efforts on developing semantic verb classes. Section 3 summarizes the features of WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn) and LDOCE (Procter, 1978) that support the automatic induction of semantic verb classes, definitions and example sentences often mention while Section 4 sets forth the approach taken by their participants using semantic-type-like nouns, SemFrame to accomplish this task. Section 5 thus mapping easily to the corresponding frame presents a brief synopsis of SemFrame’s results, element. Corpus data, however, are more likely while Section 6 presents an evaluation of to include instantiated participants, which may SemFrame’s ability to identify semantic verb not generalize to the frame element.

Verb classes at the bottom of Levin’s shallow network group together (quasi-) synonyms, hierarchically related verbs, and antonyms, alongside verbs with looser semantic relationships.","The verb categories based on Pantel and Lin (2002) and Lin and Pantel (2001) are induced automatically from a large corpus, using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, based on syntactic dependency features. The resulting clusters contain synonyms, hierarchically related verbs, and antonyms, as well as verbs more loosely related from the perspective of paraphrase.","The handcrafted WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998a) uses the hyperonymy/hyponymy relationship to structure the English verb lexicon into a semantic network. Each collection of a top-level node supplemented by its descendants may be seen as a semantic verb class.","In all fairness, resolution of the paraphrase problem is not the explicit goal of most efforts to build semantic verb classes. However, they can process some paraphrases through lexical synonymy, hierarchically related terms, and antonymy."]},{"title":"3 Resources Used in SemFrame","paragraphs":["We adopt an approach that relies heavily on pre-existing lexical resources. Such resources have several advantages over corpus data in identifying semantic frames. First, both Third, lexical resources provide their data in a more systematic fashion than do corpora.","Most centrally, the syntactic arguments of the verbs used in a definition often correspond to the semantic arguments of the verb being defined. For example, Table 1 gives the definitions of several verb senses in LDOCE that evoke the COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION frame, which includes as its semantic arguments a Buyer, a Seller, some Merchandise, and Money.

The overall approach used is shown in Figure 1. The first stage of processing extracts pairs of LDOCE and WordNet verb senses that potentially evoke the same frame. By exploiting many different clues to semantic relatedness, we overgenerate these pairs, favoring recall; subsequent stages improve the precision of the resulting data.","Figures 2 and 3 give details of the algorithms for extracting verb pairs based on different types of evidence. These include: clustering LDOCE verb senses/WordNet synsets on the basis of words in their definitions and example sentences (fig. 2); relating LDOCE verb senses defined in terms of the same verb (fig. 3a); relating LDOCE verb senses that share a common stem (fig. 3b); extracting explicit sense-linking relationships in LDOCE (fig. 3c); relating verb senses that share general or specific subject field codes in LDOCE (fig. 3d); and extracting (direct or extended) semantic relationships in WordNet (fig. 3e).","In the second stage, mapping between membership) exceed a threshold are merged together, thus reducing the number of verb sense groups.

We use the handcrafted FrameNet, which is of reliably high precision, as a gold standard for the initial2 evaluation of SemFrame's ability to achieve these subgoals. For the first, we evaluate SemFrame’s ability to generate frames that correspond to FrameNet’s frames, reasoning that the system must be able to identify a large proportion of known frames if the quality of its output is good enough to identify new frames. (At this stage we do not measure the quality of new frames.) For the second subgoal we can be more concrete: For frames identified by both systems, we measure the degree to which the verbs identified by SemFrame can be shown to evoke those frames, even if FrameNet has not identified them as frame-evoking verbs.","FrameNet includes hierarchically organized frames of varying levels of generality: Some semantic areas are covered by a general frame, some by a combination of specific frames, and some by a mix of general and specific frames.

In a head-to-head comparison with frames in FrameNet, the frame semantic verb classes developed by the SemFrame approach achieve a recall of 83.2% and the verbs listed for frames achieve a precision of 73.8%; these results far outpace those of other semantic verb classes. On a practical level, a large number of frame semantic verb classes have been identified. Associated with clustering threshold 1.5 are 1421 verb classes, averaging 14.1 WordNet verb synsets. Associated with clustering threshold 2.0 are 1563 verb classes, averaging 6.6 WordNet verb synsets.","Despite these promising results, we are limited by the scope of our input data set. While LDOCE and WordNet data are generally of high quality, the relative sparseness of these resources has an adverse impact on recall. In addition, the mapping technique used for picking out corresponding word senses in WordNet and LDOCE is shallow, thus constraining the recall and precision of SemFrame outputs. Finally, the multi-step process of merging smaller verb groups into verb groups that are intended to correspond to frames sometimes fails to achieve an appropriate degree of correspondence (all the verb classes discovered are not distinct).","Lin and Pantel have taken a similar approach,4 “ naming” their verb clusters by the first three verbs listed for a cluster, i.e., the three most similar verbs.","In our future work, we will experiment with the more recent release of WordNet (2.0). This version provides derivational morphology links between nouns and verbs, which will promote far greater precision in the linking of verb senses based on morphology than was possible in our initial implementation. Another significant addition to WordNet 2.0 is the inclusion of category domains, which co-locate words pertaining to a subject and perform the same function as LDOCE's subject field codes.","Finally, data sparseness issues may be addressed by supplementing the use of the lexical resources used here with access to, for example, the British National Corpus, with its broad coverage and carefully-checked parse trees."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research has been supported in part by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship NSF ITR grant #IIS-0326553, and NSF CISE Research Infrastructure Award EIA0130422."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Boguraev, Bran and Ted Briscoe. 1989.
