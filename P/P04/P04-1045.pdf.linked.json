We compare the results of machine learning experiments using these features alone or in combination to predict various categorizations of the annotated student emotions.

Intelligent tutoring dialogue systems have become more prevalent in recent years (Aleven and Rose, 2003), as one method of improving the performance gap between computer and human tutors; recent experiments with such systems (e.g., (Graesser et al., 2002)) are starting to yield promising empirical results. Another method for closing this performance gap has been to incorporate affective reasoning into computer tutoring systems, independently of whether or not the tutor is dialogue-based (Conati et al., 2003; Kort et al., 2001; Bhatt et al., 2004). For example, (Aist et al., 2002) have shown that adding human-provided emotional scaffolding to an automated reading tutor increases student persistence. Our long-term goal is to merge these lines of dialogue and affective tutoring research, by enhancing our intelligent tutoring spoken dialogue system to automatically predict and adapt to student emotions, and to investigate whether this improves learning and other measures of performance.","Previous spoken dialogue research has shown that predictive models of emotion distinctions (e.g., emotional vs. non-emotional, negative vs. non-negative) can be developed using features typically available to a spoken dialogue system in real-time (e.g, acoustic-prosodic, lexical, dialogue, and/or contextual) (Batliner et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003; Shafran et al., 2003). In prior work we built on and generalized such research, by den-ing a three-way distinction between negative, neutral, and positive student emotional states that could be reliably annotated and accurately predicted in human-human spoken tutoring dialogues (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004). Like the non-tutoring studies, our results showed that combining feature types yielded the highest predictive accuracy.","In this paper we investigate the application of our approach to a comparable corpus of computer-human tutoring dialogues, which displays many different characteristics, such as shorter utterances, little student initiative, and non-overlapping speech. We investigate whether we can annotate and predict student emotions as accurately and whether the relative utility of speech and lexical features as predictors is the same, especially when the output of the speech recognizer is used (rather than a human transcription of the student speech). Our best models for predicting three different types of emotion classications achieve accuracies of 66-73%, representing relative improvements of 19-36% over majority class baseline errors. Our computer-human results also show interesting differences compared with comparable analyses of human-human data. Our results provide an empirical basis for enhancing our spoken dialogue tutoring system to automatically predict and adapt to a student model that in-cludes emotional states."]},{"title":"2 Computer-Human Dialogue Data","paragraphs":["Our data consists of student dialogues with ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system) (Litman and Silliman, 2004), a spoken dialogue tutor built on top of the Why2-Atlas conceptual physics text-based tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2002). In ITSPOKE, a student rst types an essay answering a qualitative physics problem. ITSPOKE then analyzes the essay and engages the student in spoken dialogue to correct misconceptions and to elicit complete explanations.","First, the Why2-Atlas back-end parses the student essay into propositional representations, in order to nd useful dialogue topics. It uses 3 different approaches (symbolic, statistical and hybrid) competitively to create a representation for each sentence, then resolves temporal and nominal anaphora and constructs proofs using abductive reasoning (Jordan et al., 2004). During the dialogue, student speech is digitized from microphone input and sent to the Sphinx2 recognizer, whose stochastic language models have a vocabulary of 1240 words and are trained with 7720 student utterances from evaluations of Why2-Atlas and from pilot studies of ITSPOKE. Sphinx2’s best transcription(recognition output) is then sent to the Why2-Atlas back-end for syntactic, semantic and dialogue analysis. Finally, the text response produced by Why2-Atlas is sent to the Cepstral text-to-speech system and played to the student. After the dialogue, the student revises the essay, thereby ending the tutoring or causing an-other round of tutoring/essay revision.","Our corpus of dialogues with ITSPOKE was collected from November 2003 - April 2004, as part of an evaluation comparing ITSPOKE, Why2-Atlas, and human tutoring (Litman et al., 2004). Subjects are University of Pittsburgh students who have never taken college physics, and who are native English speakers. Subjects rst read a small document of background physics material, then work through 5 problems (dialogues) with ITSPOKE. The corpus contains 100 dialogues (physics problems) from 20 subjects, with a total of 2445 student turns and 398 unique words. 15 dialogues have been annotated for emotion as described in Section 3. On average, our dialogues last 19.4 minutes and contain 25 student turns. While ITSPOKE’s word error rate on this corpus is 31.2%, semantic accuracy is more useful for dialogue evaluation as it does not penalize for unimportant word errors. Semantic analysis based on speech recognition is the same as based on perfect transcription 92.4% of the time. An emotion-annotated corpus example is shown in Figure 1."]},{"title":"3 Annotating Student Turns","paragraphs":["In our data, student emotions1","can only be identied indirectly: via what is said and/or how it is 1 We use the term emotion loosely to cover both affects","and attitudes that can impact student learning. . . . dialogue excerpt at 18.3 min. into session. . .

In (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), we discuss a scheme for manually annotating student turns in a human-human tutoring dialogue corpus for in-tuitively perceived emotions.2","These emotions are viewed along a linear scale, shown and dened as follows: negative","neutral","positive.","Negative: a student turn that expresses emotions such as confused, bored, irritated. Evidence of a negative emotion can come from many knowledge sources such as lexical items (e.g., I don’t know in student","in Figure 1), and/or acoustic-prosodic features (e.g., prior-turn pausing in student",").","Positive: a student turn expressing emotions such as condent, enthusiastic. An example is student",", which displays louder speech and faster tempo.","Neutral: a student turn not expressing a negative or positive emotion. An example is student",", where evidence comes from moderate loudness, pitch and tempo.","We also distinguish Mixed: a student turn expressing both positive and negative emotions.","To avoid inuencing the annotator’s intuitive understanding of emotion expression, and because particular emotional cues are not used consistently 2 Weak and strong expressions of emotions are annotated. or unambiguously across speakers, our annotation manual does not associate particular cues with particular emotion labels. Instead, it contains examples of labeled dialogue excerpts (as in Figure 1, except on human-human data) with links to corresponding audio les. The cues mentioned in the discussion of Figure 1 above were elicited during post-annotation discussion of the emotions, and are presented here for expository use only. (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) further details our annotation scheme and discusses how it builds on related work.","To analyze the reliability of the scheme on our new computer-human data, we selected 15 transcribed dialogues from the corpus described in Section 2, yielding a dataset of 333 student turns, where approximately 30 turns came from each of 10 subjects. The 333 turns were separately annotated by two annotators following the emotion annotation scheme described above.","We focus here on three analyses of this data, itemized below. While the rst analysis provides the most ne-grained distinctions for triggering system adaptation, the second and third (simplied) analyses correspond to those used in (Lee et al., 2001) and (Batliner et al., 2000), respectively. These represent alternative potentially useful triggering mechanisms, and are worth exploring as they might be easier to annotate and/or predict."," Negative, Neutral, Positive (NPN): mixeds are conated with neutrals."," Negative, Non-Negative (NnN): positives, mixeds, neutrals are conated as nonnegatives."," Emotional, Non-Emotional (EnE): negatives, positives, mixeds are conated as Emotional; neutrals are Non-Emotional.","Tables 1-3 provide a confusion matrix for each analysis summarizing inter-annotator agreement. The rows correspond to the labels assigned by annotator 1, and the columns correspond to the labels assigned by annotator 2. For example, the annotators agreed on 89 negatives in Table 1.","In the NnN analysis, the two annotators agreed on the annotations of 259/333 turns achieving 77.8% agreement, with Kappa = 0.5. In the EnE analysis, the two annotators agreed on the annotations of 220/333 turns achieving 66.1% agreement, with Kappa = 0.3. In the NPN analysis, the two annotators agreed on the annotations of 202/333 turns achieving 60.7% agreement, with Kappa = 0.4. This inter-annotator agreement is on par with that of prior studies of emotion annotation in naturally occurring computer-human dialogues (e.g., agreement of 71% and Kappa of 0.47 in (Ang et al., 2002), Kappa of 0.45 and 0.48 in (Narayanan, 2002), and Kappa ranging between 0.32 and 0.42 in (Shafran et al., 2003)). A number of researchers have accommodated for this low agreement by exploring ways of achieving consensus between disagreed annotations, to yield 100% agreement (e.g (Ang et al., 2002; Devillers et al., 2003)). As in (Ang et al., 2002), we will experiment below with predicting emotions using both our agreed data and consensus-labeled data.","negative non-negative negative 89 36","non-negative 38 170 Table 1: NnN Analysis Confusion Matrix","emotional non-emotional emotional 129 43","non-emotional 70 91 Table 2: EnE Analysis Confusion Matrix","negative neutral positive negative 89 30 6 neutral 32 94 38 positive 6 19 19 Table 3: NPN Analysis Confusion Matrix"]},{"title":"4 Extracting Features from Turns","paragraphs":["For each of the 333 student turns described above, we next extracted the set of features itemized in Figure 2, for use in the machine learning experiments described in Section 5.","Motivated by previous studies of emotion prediction in spontaneous dialogues (Ang et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2001; Batliner et al., 2003), our acoustic-prosodic features represent knowledge of pitch, energy, duration, tempo and pausing. We further restrict our features to those that can be computed automatically and in real-time, since our goal is to use such features to trigger online adaptation in ITSPOKE based on predicted student emotions. F0 and RMS values, representing measures of pitch and loudness, respectively, are computed using Entropic Research Laboratory’s pitch tracker, get f0, with no post-correction.

Speaking Rate is automatically calculated as #syllables per second in the turn.","While acoustic-prosodic features address how something is said, lexical features representing what is said have also been shown to be useful for predicting emotion in spontaneous dialogues (Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003; Devillers et al., 2003; Shafran et al., 2003). Our rst set of lexical features represents the human transcription of each student turn as a word occurrence vector (indicating the lexical items that are present in the turn). This feature represents the ideal performance of ITSPOKE with respect to speech recognition. The second set represents ITSPOKE’s actual best speech recognition hypothesis of what is said in each student turn, again as a word occurrence vector.","Finally, we recorded for each turn the 3 identier features shown last in Figure 2. Prior studies (Oudeyer, 2002; Lee et al., 2002) have shown that subject and gender can play an important role in emotion recognition. Subject and problem are particularly important in our tutoring do-main because students will use our system repeatedly, and problems are repeated across students."]},{"title":"5 Predicting Student Emotions 5.1 Feature Sets and Method","paragraphs":["We next created the 10 feature sets in Figure 3, to study the effects that various feature combinations had on predicting emotion. We compare an acoustic-prosodic feature set (sp), a human-transcribed lexical items feature set (lex) and an ITSPOKE-recognized lexical items feature set (asr). We further compare feature sets combining acoustic-prosodic and either transcribed or recognized lexical items (sp+lex, sp+asr). Finally, we compare each of these 5 feature sets with an identical set supplemented with our 3 identier features (+id). sp: 12 acoustic-prosodic features lex: human-transcribed lexical items asr: ITSPOKE recognized lexical items sp+lex: combined sp and lex features sp+asr: combined sp and asr features +id: each above set + 3 identier features Figure 3: Feature Sets for Machine Learning","We use the Weka machine learning software (Witten and Frank, 1999) to automatically learn our emotion prediction models. In our human-human dialogue studies (Litman and Forbes, 2003), the use of boosted decision trees yielded the most robust performance across feature sets so we will continue their use here. 5.2 Predicting Agreed Turns As in (Shafran et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2001), our rst study looks at the clearer cases of emotional turns, i.e. only those student turns where the two annotators agreed on an emotion label.","Tables 4-6 show, for each emotion classication, the mean accuracy (%correct) and standard error (SE) for our 10 feature sets (Figure 3), computed across 10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation.3","For comparison, the accuracy of a standard baseline algorithm (MAJ), which always predicts the majority class, is shown in each caption.

Surprisingly, while (Lee et al., 2002) found it useful to develop separate gender-based emotion prediction models, in our experiment, gender is the only identier that does not appear in any learned model. Also note that with the addition of identier features, the speech-only feature sets (sp+id) now do outperform the majority class baselines for all three emotion classications.","4","For any feature set, the mean +/- 2*SE = the 95% condence interval. If the condence intervals for two feature sets are non-overlapping, then their mean accuracies are signicantly different with 95% condence.","With respect to the relative utility of lexical versus acoustic-prosodic features, without identier features, using only lexical features (lex or asr) almost always produces statistically better performance than using only speech features (sp); the only exception is NPN lex, which performs statistically the same as NPN sp. This is consistent with others’ ndings, e.g., (Lee et al., 2002; Shafran et al., 2003). When identier features are added to both, the lexical sets don’t always signicantly outperform the speech set; only in NPN and EnE lex+id is this the case. For NnN, just as using sp+id rather than sp-id improved performance when compared to the majority baseline, the addition of the identier features also improves the utility of the speech features when compared to the lexical features.","Interestingly, although we hypothesized that the lex feature sets would present an upper bound on the performance of the asr sets, because the human transcription is more accurate than the speech recognizer, we see that this is not consistently the case. In fact, in the -id sets, asr always signicantly outperforms lex. A comparison of the decision trees produced in either case, however, does not reveal why this is the case; words chosen as predictors are not very intuitive in either case (e.g., for NnN, an example path through the learned lex decision tree says predict negative if the utterance contains the word will but does not contain the word decrease). Understanding this result is an area for future research. Within the +id sets, we see that lex and asr perform the same in the NnN and NPN classications; in EnE lex+id signicantly outperforms asr+id. The utility of the lex features compared to asr also increases when combined with the sp features (with and without identiers), for both NnN and NPN.","Moreover, based on results in (Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004), we hypothesized that combining speech and lexical features would result in better performance than either feature set alone. We instead found that the relative performance of these sets depends both on the emotion classication being predicted and the presence or absence of id features. Although consistently with prior research we nd that the combined feature sets usually outperform the speech-only feature sets, the combined feature sets frequently perform worse than the lexical-only feature sets. However, we will see in Section 6 that combining knowledge sources does improve prediction performance in human-human dialogues.","Finally, the bolded accuracies in each table summarize the best-performing feature sets with and without identiers, with respect to both the %Corr gures shown in the tables, as well as to relative improvement in error reduction over the baseline (MAJ) error5",", after excluding all the feature sets containing lex features. In this way we give a better estimate of the best performance our system could accomplish, given the features it can currently access from among those discussed. These best-performing feature sets yield relative improvements over their majority baseline errors ranging from 19-36%. Moreover, although the NPN classication yields the lowest raw accuracies, it yields the highest relative improvement over its baseline. 5.3 Predicting Consensus Turns Following (Ang et al., 2002; Devillers et al., 2003), we also explored consensus labeling, both with the goal of increasing our usable data set for prediction, and to include the more difcult annotation cases. For our consensus labeling, the original annotators revisited each originally disagreed case, and through discussion, sought a consensus label. Due to consensus labeling, agreement rose across all three emotion classications to 100%.

A comparison with Tables 4-6 shows that overall, the human-human data yields increased performance across all feature sets and emotion classications, although it should be noted that the human-human corpus is over 100 turns larger than the computer-human corpus. Every feature set performs signicantly better than their baselines. However, unlike the computer-human data, we don’t see the +id sets performing better than the -id sets; rather, both sets perform about the same. We do see again the lex sets yielding better performance than the sp sets. However, we now see that in 5 out of 6 cases, combining speech and lexical features yields better performance than using either sp or lex alone. Finally, these feature sets yield a relative error reduction of 42.45%-77.33% compared to the majority class predictions, which is far better than in our computer tutoring experiments. Moreover, the EnE classication yields the highest raw accuracies and relative improvements over baseline error.","We hypothesize that such differences arise in part due to differences between the two corpora: 1) student turns with the computer tutor are much shorter than with the human tutor (and thus contain less emotional content - making both annotation and prediction more difcult), 2) students respond to the computer tutor differently and perhaps more idiosyncratically than to the human tutor, 3) the computer tutor is less exible than the human tutor (allowing little student initiative, questions, groundings, contextual references, etc.), which also effects student emotional response and its expression."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Current Directions","paragraphs":["Our results show that acoustic-prosodic and lexical features can be used to automatically predict student emotion in computer-human tutoring dialogues. We examined emotion prediction using a classication scheme developed for our prior human-human tutoring studies (negative/positive/neutral), as well as using two simpler schemes proposed by other dialogue researchers (negative/non-negative, emotional/non-emotional). We used machine learning to examine the impact of different feature sets on prediction accuracy. Across schemes, our feature sets outperform a majority baseline, and lexical features outperform acoustic-prosodic features. While adding identier features typically also improves performance, combining lexical and speech features does not. Our analyses also suggest that prediction in consensus-labeled turns is harder than in agreed turns, and that prediction in our computer-human corpus is harder and based on somewhat different features than in our human-human corpus.","Our continuing work extends this methodology with the goal of enhancing ITSPOKE to predict and adapt to student emotions. We continue to manually annotate ITSPOKE data, and are exploring partial automation via semi-supervised machine learning (Maeireizo-Tokeshi et al., 2004). Further manual annotation might also improve reliability, as understanding systematic disagreements can lead to coding manual revisions. We are also expanding our feature set to include features suggested in prior dialogue research, tutoring-dependent features (e.g., pedagogical goal), and other features available in our logs (e.g., semantic analysis). Finally, we will explore how the recognized emotions can be used to improve system performance. First, we will label human tutor adaptations to emotional student turns in our human tutoring corpus; this labeling will be used to formulate adaptive strategies for ITSPOKE, and to determine which of our three prediction tasks best triggers adaptation."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This research is supported by NSF Grants 9720359 & 0328431.
