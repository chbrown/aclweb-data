Sinsu-dong 1, Mapo-gu Seoul, 121-742, Korea","seojy@ccs.sogang.ac.kr  Abstract A wide range of supervised learning algorithms has been applied to Text Categorization. However, the supervised learning approaches have some problems. One of them is that they require a large, often prohibitive, number of labeled training documents for accurate learning. Generally, acquiring class labels for training data is costly, while gathering a large quantity of unlabeled data is cheap. We here propose a new automatic text categorization method for learning from only unlabeled data using a bootstrapping framework and a feature projection technique. From results of our experiments, our method showed reasonably comparable performance compared with a supervised method. If our method is used in a text categorization task, building text categorization systems will become significantly faster and less expensive. 1 Introduction Text categorization is the task of classifying documents into a certain number of pre-defined categories. Many supervised learning algorithms have been applied to this area. These algorithms today are reasonably successful when provided with enough labeled or annotated training examples. For example, there are Naive Bayes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), Rocchio (Lewis et al., 1996), Nearest Neighbor (kNN) (Yang et al., 2002), TCFP (Ko and Seo, 2002), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1998).","However, the supervised learning approach has some difficulties. One key difficulty is that it requires a large, often prohibitive, number of labeled training data for accurate learning. Since a labeling task must be done manually, it is a painfully time-consuming process. Furthermore, since the application area of text categorization has diversified from newswire articles and web pages to E-mails and newsgroup postings, it is also a difficult task to create training data for each application area (Nigam et al., 1998). In this light, we consider learning algorithms that do not require such a large amount of labeled data.","While labeled data are difficult to obtain, unlabeled data are readily available and plentiful. Therefore, this paper advocates using a bootstrapping framework and a feature projection technique with just unlabeled data for text categorization. The input to the bootstrapping process is a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of seed information to tell the learner about the specific task. In this paper, we consider seed information in the form of title words associated with categories. In general, since unlabeled data are much less expensive and easier to collect than labeled data, our method is useful for text categorization tasks including online data sources such as web pages, E-mails, and newsgroup postings.","To automatically build up a text classifier with unlabeled data, we must solve two problems; how we can automatically generate labeled training documents (machine-labeled data) from only title words and how we can handle incorrectly labeled documents in the machine-labeled data. This paper provides solutions for these problems. For the first problem, we employ the bootstrapping framework. For the second, we use the TCFP classifier with robustness from noisy data (Ko and Seo, 2004).","How can labeled training data be automatically created from unlabeled data and title words? Maybe unlabeled data don’t have any information for building a text classifier because they do not contain the most important information, their category. Thus we must assign the class to each document in order to use supervised learning approaches. Since text categorization is a task based on pre-defined categories, we know the categories for classifying documents. Knowing the categories means that we can choose at least a representative title word of each category. This is the starting point of our proposed method. As we carry out a bootstrapping task from these title words, we can finally get labeled training data. Suppose, for example, that we are interested in classifying newsgroup postings about specially ‘Autos’ category. Above all, we can select ‘automobile’ as a title word, and automatically extract keywords (‘car’, ‘gear’, ‘transmission’, ‘sedan’, and so on) using co-occurrence information. In our method, we use context (a sequence of 60 words) as a unit of meaning for bootstrapping from title words; it is generally constructed as a middle size of a sentence and a document. We then extract core contexts that include at least one of the title words and the keywords. We call them centroid-contexts because they are regarded as contexts with the core meaning of each category. From the centroid-contexts, we can gain many words contextually cooccurred with the title words and keywords: ‘driver’, ‘clutch’, ‘trunk’, and so on. They are words in first-order co-occurrence with the title words and the keywords. To gather more vocabulary, we extract contexts that are similar to centroid-contexts by a similarity measure; they contain words in second-order co-occurrence with the title words and the keywords. We finally construct context-cluster of each category as the combination of centroid-contexts and contexts selected by the similarity measure. Using the context-clusters as labeled training data, a Naive Bayes classifier can be built. Since the Naive Bayes classifier can label all unlabeled documents for their category, we can finally obtain labeled training data (machine-labeled data).","When the machine-labeled data is used to learn a text classifier, there is another difficult in that they have more incorrectly labeled documents than manually labeled data. Thus we develop and employ the TCFP classifiers with robustness from noisy data.","The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous works. In section 3 and 4, we explain the proposed method in detail. Section 5 is devoted to the analysis of the empirical results. The final section describes conclusions and future works."," 2 Related Works In general, related approaches for using unlabeled data in text categorization have two directions; One builds classifiers from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (Nigam, 2001; Bennett and Demiriz, 1999), and the other employs clustering algorithms for text categorization (Slonim et al., 2002).","Nigam studied an Expected Maximization (EM) technique for combining labeled and unlabeled data for text categorization in his dissertation. He showed that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training data with a large pool of unlabeled data.","Bennet and Demiriz achieved small improvements on some UCI data sets using SVM. It seems that SVMs assume that decision boundaries lie between classes in low-density regions of instance space, and the unlabeled examples help find these areas.","Slonim suggested clustering techniques for unsupervised document classification. Given a collection of unlabeled data, he attempted to find clusters that are highly correlated with the true topics of documents by unsupervised clustering methods. In his paper, Slonim proposed a new clustering method, the sequential Information Bottleneck (sIB) algorithm.","","3 The Bootstrapping Algorithm for Creating Machine-labeled Data The bootstrapping framework described in this paper consists of the following steps. Each module is described in the following sections in detail. ","1. Preprocessing: Contexts are separated from unlabeled documents and content words are extracted from them.","2. Constructing context-clusters for training: - Keywords of each category are created - Centroid-contexts are extracted and verified - Context-clusters are created by a similarity","measure","3. Learning Classifier: Naive Bayes classifier are learned by using the context-clusters  3.1 Preprocessing The preprocessing module has two main roles: extracting content words and reconstructing the collected documents into contexts. We use the Brill POS tagger to extract content words (Brill, 1995). Generally, the supervised learning approach with labeled data regards a document as a unit of meaning. But since we can use only the title words and unlabeled data, we define context as a unit of meaning and we employ it as the meaning unit to bootstrap the meaning of each category. In our system, we regard a sequence of 60 content words within a document as a context. To extract contexts from a document, we use sliding window techniques (Maarek et al., 1991). The window is a slide from the first word of the document to the last in the size of the window (60 words) and the interval of each window (30 words). Therefore, the final output of preprocessing is a set of context vectors that are represented as content words of each context. ","3.2 Constructing Context-Clusters for Training At first, we automatically create keywords from a title word for each category using co-occurrence information. Then centroid-contexts are extracted using the title word and keywords. They contain at least one of the title and keywords. Finally, we can gain more information of each category by assigning remaining contexts to each context-cluster using a similarity measure technique; the remaining contexts do not contain any keywords or title words. 3.2.1 Creating Keyword Lists The starting point of our method is that we have title words and collected documents. A title word can present the main meaning of each category but it could be insufficient in representing any category for text categorization. Thus we need to find words that are semantically related to a title word, and we define them as keywords of each category.","The score of semantic similarity between a title word, T, and a word, W, is calculated by the cosine metric as follows: "]},{"title":"∑∑∑","paragraphs":["== = × × = n i i n i i n i ii wt wt WTsim 1 2 1","21 ),( (1)  where ti and wi represent the occurrence (binary value: 0 or 1) of words T and W in i-th document respectively, and n is the total number of documents in the collected documents. This method calculates the similarity score between words based on the degree of their co-occurrence in the same document.","Since the keywords for text categorization must have the power to discriminate categories as well as similarity with the title words, we assign a word to the keyword list of a category with the maximum similarity score and recalculate the score of the word in the category using the following formula: ",")),(),((),(),( maxsecmaxmaxmax WTsimWTsimWTsimcWScore ond−+= (2)"," where Tmax is the title word with the maximum similarity score with a word W, cmax is the category of the title word Tmax, and Tsecondmax is other title word with the second high similarity score with the word W.","This formula means that a word with high ranking in a category has a high similarity score with the title word of the category and a high similarity score difference with other title words. We sort out words assigned to each category according to the calculated score in descending order. We then choose top m words as keywords in the category. Table 1 shows the list of keywords (top 5) for each category in the WebKB data set.  Table 1.

Among centroid-contexts, some contexts could not have good features of a category even though they include the keywords of the category. To rank the importance of centroid-contexts, we compute the importance score of each centroid-context. First of all, weights (Wij) of word wi in j-th category are calculated using Term Frequency (TF) within a category and Inverse Category Frequency (ICF) (Cho and Kim, 1997) as follows:  ))log()(log( iijiijij CFMTFICFTFW −×=×= (3)  where CFi is the number of categories that contain wi and M is the total number of categories.","Using word weights (Wij) calculated by formula 3, the score of a centroid-context (Sk) in j-th category (cj) is computed as follows:  N WWW cSScore Njjj jk +++ = ... ),( 21 (4)  where N is the number of words in the centroid-context.","As a result, we obtain a set of words in first-order co-occurrence from centroid-contexts of each category. 3.2.3 Creating Context-Clusters We gather the second-order co-occurrence information by assigning remaining contexts to the context-cluster of each category. For the assigning criterion, we calculate similarity between remaining contexts and centroid-contexts of each category. Thus we employ the similarity measure technique by Karov and Edelman (1998). In our method, a part of this technique is reformed for our purpose and remaining contexts are assigned to each context-cluster by that revised technique.  1) Measurement of word and context similarities As similar words tend to appear in similar contexts, we can compute the similarity by using contextual information. Words and contexts play complementary roles. Contexts are similar to the extent that they contain similar words, and words are similar to the extent that they appear in similar contexts (Karov and Edelman, 1998). This definition is circular. Thus it is applied iteratively using two matrices, WSM and CSM.","Each category has a word similarity matrix WSMn and a context similarity matrix CSMn. In each iteration n, we update WSMn, whose rows and columns are labeled by all content words encountered in the centroid-contexts of each category and input remaining contexts. In that matrix, the cell (i,j) holds a value between 0 and 1, indicating the extent to which the i-th word is contextually similar to the j-th word. Also, we keep and update a CSMn, which holds similarities among contexts. The rows of CSMn correspond to the remaining contexts and the columns to the centroid-contexts. In this paper, the number of input contexts of row and column in CSM is limited to 200, considering execution time and memory allocation, and the number of iterations is set as 3.","To compute the similarities, we initialize WSMn to the identity matrix. The following steps are iterated until the changes in the similarity values are small enough.","1. Update the context similarity matrix CSMn,","using the word similarity matrix WSMn.","2. Update the word similarity matrix WSMn, using the","context similarity matrix CSMn. 2) Affinity formulae To simplify the symmetric iterative treatment of similarity between words and contexts, we define an auxiliary relation between words and contexts as affinity.","Affinity formulae are defined as follows (Karov and Edelman, 1998):  ),(max),( inXWn WWsimXWaff i∈= (5) (6) ),(max),( jnXWn XXsimWXaff j∈= In the above formulae, n denotes the iteration number, and the similarity values are defined by WSMn and CSMn. Every word has some affinity to the context, and the context can be represented by a vector indicating the affinity of each word to it.  3) Similarity formulae The similarity of W1 to W2 is the average affinity of the contexts that include W1 to W2, and the similarity of a context X1 to X2 is a weighted average of the affinity of the words in X1 to X2. Similarity formulae are defined as follows: ","),(),(),( 21211 1 XWaffXWweightXXsim n XWn ⋅="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["∈+ (7) (8) ),(),(),( 1),( 21211 211 21 1 WXaffWXweightWWsim else WWsim WWif n XW n n ⋅= = ="]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["∈ + + The weights in formula 7 are computed as reflecting global frequency, log-likelihood factors, and part of speech as used in (Karov and Edelman, 1998). The sum of weights in formula 8, which is a reciprocal number of contexts that contain W1, is 1.  4) Assigning remaining contexts to a category We decided a similarity value of each remaining context for each category using the following method: ),(),(  ","= ∈∈","j CCSi","Cc SXsimavercXsim","i","c j","i (9)"," In formula 9, i) X is a remaining context, ii)","{ }mcccC ,...,, 21= is a category set, and iii) { }nc SS","i ,...,1=CC is a controid-contexts set of category ci.","Each remaining context is assigned to a category which has a maximum similarity value. But there may exist noisy remaining contexts which do not belong to any category. To remove these noisy remaining contexts, we set up a dropping threshold using normal distribution of similarity values as follows (Ko and Seo, 2000): ","} ),( max{ Cc i","θσμ +≥ ∈ icXsim (10)  where i) X is a remaining context, ii) μ is an average of similarity values , iii) σ is a standard deviation of similarity values, and iv) θ is a numerical value corresponding to the threshold (%) in normal distribution table. ),( i Cc cXsim i∈","Finally, a remaining context is assigned to the context-cluster of any category when the category has a maximum similarity above the dropping threshold value. In this paper, we empirically use a 15% threshold value from an experiment using a validation set.","3.3 Learning the Naive Bayes Classifier Using Context-Clusters In above section, we obtained labeled training data: context-clusters. Since training data are labeled as the context unit, we employ a Naive Bayes classifier because it can be built by estimating the word probability in a category, but not in a document. That is, the Naive Bayes classifier does not require labeled data with the unit of documents unlike other classifiers.","We use the Naive Bayes classifier with minor modifications based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (Craven et al., 2000). We classify a document di according to the following formula:"," "]},{"title":"∑ ∏","paragraphs":["= =       +∝ ≈= || 1 || 1 ),( );̂|( );̂|( log);̂|();̂(log  );̂|()|̂( )|̂( );̂|()|̂( );̂|( V","t it jt it j V t dwN jtj i jij ij dwP cwP dwP ncP cwPcP dP","cdPcP dcP i θ θ θ θ θθ θ θθ θ (11)   where i) n is the number of words in document di, ii) wt is the t-th word in the vocabulary, iii) N(wt,di) is the frequency of word wt in document di.","Here, the Laplace smoothing is used to estimate the probability of word wt in class cj and the probability of class cj as follows:",""]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["=+ +","=","|| 1 ),(|| ),(1 );̂|( V t ct ct jt j j GwNV","GwN cwP θ (12)"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["+ + = i i j c c c j GC G cP ||||","||1 )|̂( θ (13)  where is the count of the number of times word w ),( jct GwN","t occurs in the context-cluster ( ) of category c jcG j. ","4 Using a Feature Projection Technique for Handling Noisy Data of Machine-labeled Data We finally obtained labeled data of a documents unit, machine-labeled data. Now we can learn text classifiers using them. But since the machine-labeled data are created by our method, they generally include far more incorrectly labeled documents than the human-labeled data. Thus we employ a feature projection technique for our method. By the property of the feature projection technique, a classifier (the TCFP classifier) can have robustness from noisy data (Ko and Seo, 2004). As seen in our experiment results, TCFP showed the highest performance among conventional classifiers in using machine-labeled data.  The TCFP classifier with robustness from noisy data Here, we simply describe the TCFP classifier using the feature projection technique (Ko and Seo, 2002; 2004). In this approach, the classification knowledge is represented as sets of projections of training data on each feature dimension. The classification of a test document is based on the voting of each feature of that test document. That is, the final prediction score is calculated by accumulating the voting scores of all features.","First of all, we must calculate the voting ratio of each category for all features. Since elements with a high TF-IDF value in projections of a feature must become more useful classification criteria for the feature, we use only elements with TF-IDF values above the average TF-IDF value for voting. And the selected elements participate in proportional voting with the same importance as the TF-IDF value of each element. The voting ratio of each category cj in a feature tm is calculated by the following formula: "]},{"title":"∑∑","paragraphs":["∈∈ ⋅= mmmm jj Ilt lm","Ilt mlmm dtwltcydtwtcr )()( ),())(,(),(),( rr (14)  In formula 14, w ),( dtm r","is the weight of term tm in document d, Im denotes a set of elements selected for voting and is a function; if the category for an element t is equal to c , the output value is 1.

For fair evaluation in Newsgroups and WebKB, we employed the five-fold cross-validation method.","The Newsgroups data set, collected by Ken Lang, contains about 20,000 articles evenly divided among 20 UseNet discussion groups (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). In this paper, we used only 16 categories after removing 4 categories: three miscellaneous categories (talk.politics.misc, talk.religion.misc, and comp.os.ms-windows.misc) and one duplicate meaning category (comp.sys. ibm.pc.hardware).","The second data set comes from the WebKB project at CMU (Craven et al., 2000). This data set contains web pages gathered from university computer science departments.","The Reuters 21578 Distribution 1.0 data set consists of 12,902 articles and 90 topic categories from the Reuters newswire.

We applied a statistical feature selection method (χ2"," statistics) to a preprocessing stage for each classifier (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).","As performance measures, we followed the standard definition of recall, precision, and F1 measure. For evaluation performance average across categories, we used the micro-averaging method (Yang et al., 2002).

The comparison of performance according to the number of keywords","","We set the number of keywords to 2 in Newsgroups, 5 in WebKB, and 3 in Reuters empirically. Generally, we recommend that the number of keywords be between 2 and 5. 5.2.2 Comparing our Method Using TCFP with","those Using other Classifiers In this section, we prove the superiority of TCFP over the other classifiers (SVM, kNN, Naive Bayes (NB), Roccio) in training data with much noisy data such as machine-labeled data. As shown in Table 2, we obtained the best performance in using TCFP at all three data sets.","Let us define the notations. OurMethod(basis) denotes the Naive Bayes classifier using labeled contexts and OurMethod(NB) denotes the Naive Bayes classifier using machine-labeled data as training data. The same manner is applied for other classifiers.","OurMethod(TCFP) achieved more advanced scores than OurMethod(basis): 6.83 in Newsgroups, 1.84 in WebKB, and 0.47 in Reuters. 5.2.3 Comparing with the Supervised Naive","Bayes Classifier For this experiment, we consider two possible cases for labeling task. The first task is to label a part of collected documents and the second is to label all of them. As the first task, we built up a new training data set; it consists of 500 different documents randomly chosen from appropriate categories like the experiment in (Slonim et al., 2002). As a result, we report performances from two kinds of Naive Bayes classifiers which are learned from 500 training documents and the whole training documents respectively. ","Table 3. The comparison of our method and the","supervised NB classifier","OurMethod","(TCFP) NB (500)","NB","(All) Newsgroups 86.19 72.68 91.72 WebKB 75.47 74.1 85.29 Reuters 89.09 82.1 91.64 ","In Table 3, the results of our method are higher than those of NB(500) and are comparable to those of NB(All) in all data sets. Especially, the result in Reuters reached 2.55 close to that of NB(All) though it used the whole labeled training data. 5.2.4 Enhancing our Method from Choosing","Keywords by Human The main problem of our method is that the performance depends on the quality of the keywords and title words. As we have seen in Table 3, we obtained the worst performance in the WebKB data set. In fact, title words and keywords of each category in the WebKB data set also have high frequency in other categories. We think these factors contribute to a comparatively poor performance of our method. If keywords as well as title words are supplied by humans, our method may achieve higher performance. However, choosing the proper keywords for each category is a much difficult task. Moreover, keywords from developers, who have insufficient knowledge about an application domain, do not guarantee high performance. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid method for choosing keywords. That is, a developer obtains 10 candidate keywords from our keyword extraction method and then they can choose proper keywords from them. Table 4 shows the results from three data sets.","Table 4.

Thus we find that the new method for choosing keywords is more useful in a domain with confused keywords between categories such as the WebKB data set. 5.2.5 Comparing with a Clustering Technique In related works, we presented two approaches using unlabeled data in text categorization; one approach combines unlabeled data and labeled data, and the other approach uses the clustering technique for text categorization. Since our method does not use any labeled data, it cannot be fairly compared with the former approaches. Therefore, we compare our method with a clustering technique. Slonim et al. (2002) proposed a new clustering algorithm (sIB) for unsupervised document classification and verified the superiority of his algorithm. In his experiments, the sIB algorithm was superior to other clustering algorithms. As we set the same experimental settings as in Slonim’s experiments and conduct experiments, we verify that our method outperforms ths sIB algorithm. In our experiments, we used the micro-averaging precision as performance measure and two revised data sets: revised_NG, revised_Reuters. These data sets were revised in the same way according to Slonim’s paper as follows:","In revised_NG, the categories of Newsgroups were united with respect to 10 meta-categories: five comp categories, three politics categories, two sports categories, three religions categories, and two transportation categories into five big meta-categories.","The revised_Reuters used the 10 most frequent categories in the Reuters 21578 corpus under the ModApte split.","As shown in Table 5, our method shows 6.65 advanced score in revised_NG and 3.2 advanced score in revised_Reuters.

Though our method uses only title words and unlabeled data, it shows reasonably comparable performance in comparison with that of the supervised Naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, it outperforms a clustering method, sIB. Labeled data are expensive while unlabeled data are inexpensive and plentiful. Therefore, our method is useful for low-cost text categorization. Furthermore, if some text categorization tasks require high accuracy, our method can be used as an assistant tool for easily creating labeled training data.","Since our method depends on title words and keywords, we need additional studies about the characteristics of candidate words for title words and keywords according to each data set.
