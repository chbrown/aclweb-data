One interesting possibility is to use these techniques to improve the coverage of existing large-scale lexicon resources such as lexicons of lexicalized grammars. However, there has been little work on evaluating the impact of acquired SCFs with the exception of (Carroll and Fang, 2004).","The problem when we integrate acquired SCFs into existing lexicalized grammars is lower quality of the acquired SCFs, since they are acquired in an unsupervised manner, rather than being manually coded. If we attempt to compensate for the poor precision by being less strict in filtering out less likely SCFs, then we will end up with a larger number of noisy lexical entries, which is problematic for parsing with lexicalized grammars (Sarkar et al., 2000). We thus need some method of select-ing the most reliable set of SCFs from the system output as demonstrated in (Korhonen, 2002).","In this paper, I present a method of improving the accuracy of SCFs acquired from corpora in order to augment existing lexicon resources. I first estimate a confidence value that a word can have each SCF, using corpus-based statistics. To capture latent co-occurrence tendency among SCFs in the target lexicon, I next perform clustering of SCF confidence-value vectors of words in the acquired lexicon and the target lexicon. Since each centroid value of the obtained clusters indicates whether the words in that cluster have each SCF, we can eliminate SCFs acquired in error and predict possible SCFs according to the centroids.","I applied my method to SCFs acquired from a corpus of newsgroup posting about mobile phones (Carroll and Fang, 2004), using the XTAG English grammar (XTAG Research Group, 2001) and the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake, 2002). I then compared the resulting SCFs with SCFs obtained by naive frequency cut-off to observe the effects of clustering."]},{"title":"2 Background 2.1 SCF Acquisition for Lexicalized Grammars","paragraphs":["I start by acquiring SCFs for a lexicalized grammar from corpora by the method described in (Carroll and Fang, 2004).","#S(EPATTERN :TARGET |yield| :SUBCAT (VSUBCAT NP) :CLASSES ((24 51 161) 5293) :RELIABILITY 0 :FREQSCORE 0.26861903 :FREQCNT 1 :TLTL (VV0) :SLTL ((|route| NN1)) :OLT1L ((|result| NN2)) :OLT2L NIL :OLT3L NIL :LRL 0)) Figure 1: An acquired SCF for a verb “yield”","In their study, they first acquire fine-grained SCFs using the unsupervised method proposed by Briscoe and Carroll (1997) and Korhonen (2002). Figure 1 shows an example of one acquired SCF entry for a verb “yield.” Each SCF entry has several fields about the observed SCF. I explain here only its portion related to this study. The TARGET field is a word stem, the first number in the CLASSES field indicates an SCF type, and the FREQCNT field shows how often words derivable from the word stem appeared with the SCF type in the training corpus. The obtained SCFs comprise the total 163 SCF types which are originally based on the SCFs in the ANLT (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987) and COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) dictionaries. In this example, the SCF type 24 corresponds to an SCF of transitive verb.","They then obtain SCFs for the target lexicalized grammar (the LinGO ERG (Copestake, 2002) in their study) using a handcrafted translation map from these 163 types to the SCF types in the target grammar. They reported that they could achieve a coverage improvement of 4.5% but that average parse time was doubled. This is because they did not use any filtering method for the acquired SCFs to suppress an increase of the lexical ambiguity. We definitely need some method to control the quality of the acquired SCFs.","Their method is extendable to any lexicalized grammars, if we could have a translation map from these 163 types to the SCF types in the grammar. 2.2 Clustering of Verb SCF Distributions There is some related work on clustering of verbs according to their SCF probability distributions (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003).

(2003) applied other clustering methods to cluster polysemic SCF data. These studies aim at obtaining verb semantic classes, which are closely related to syntactic behavior of argument selection (Levin, 1993).","Korhonen (2002) made use of SCF distributions for representative verbs in Levin’s verb classes to obtain accurate back-off estimates for all the verbs in the classes. In this study, I assume that there are classes whose element words have identical SCF types. I then obtain these classes by clustering acquired SCFs, using information available in the target lexicon, and directly use the obtained classes to eliminate implausible SCFs."]},{"title":"3 Method 3.1 Estimation of Confidence Values for SCFs","paragraphs":["I first create an SCF confidence-value vector vi for each word wi, an object for clustering. Each element vij in vi represents a confidence value of SCF s j for a word wi, which expresses how strong the evidence is that the word wi has SCF s j. Note that a confidence value con fij is not a probability that a word wi appears with SCF s j but a probability of existence of SCF s j for the word wi.In this study, I assume that a word wi appears with each SCF s j with a certain (non-zero) probability θij(= p(sij|wi) > 0 where ∑ j θij = 1), but only SCFs whose probabilities exceed a certain threshold are recognized in the lexicon. I hereafter call this threshold recognition threshold. Figure 2 depicts a probability distribution of SCF for apply. In this context, I can regard a confidence value of each SCF as a probability that the probability of that SCF exceeds the recognition threshold.","One intuitive way to estimate a confidence value is to assume an observed probability, i.e., relative frequency, is equal to a probability θij of SCF s j for a word wi (θij = freqij/ ∑ j freqij where freqij is a frequency that a word wi appears with SCF s j in corpora). When the relative frequency of s j for a word wi exceeds the recognition threshold, its confidence value con fij is set to 1, and otherwise con fij is set to 0. However, an observed probability is unreliable for infrequent words. Moreover, when we want to encode confidence values of reliable SCFs in the target grammar, we cannot distinguish the confidence values of those SCFs with confidence values of acquired SCFs.","The other promising way to estimate a confidence value, which I adopt in this study, is to assume a probability θij as a stochastic variable in the context of Bayesian statistics (Gelman et al., 1995). In this context, a posteriori distribution of the probability θij of an SCF s j for a word wi is given by: p(θij|D)=","P(θij)P(D|θij) P(D) = P(θij)P(D|θij) ∫ 1 0 P(θij)P(D|θij)dθij , (1) where P(θij) is a priori distribution, and D is the data we have observed. Since every occurrence of SCFs in the data D is independent with each other, the data D can be regarded as Bernoulli trials. When we observe the data D that a word wi appears n times in total and x(≤ n) times with SCF s j,1","its conditional distribution is represented by binominal distribution:","P(D|θij)=( n x ) θ x ij(1 − θij)(n−x)",". (2)","To calculate this a posteriori distribution, I need to define the a priori distribution P(θij). The question is which probability distribution of θij can appropriately reflects prior knowledge. In other words, it should encode knowledge we use to estimate SCFs for unknown words. I simply determine it from distributions of observed probability values of s j for words seen in corpora2","by using","1","The values of FREQCNT is used to obtain n and x.","2","I estimated a priori distribution separately for each type of SCF from words that appeared more than 50 times in the training corpus in the following experiments. a method described in (Tsuruoka and Chikayama, 2001). In their study, they assume a priori distribution as the beta distribution defined as: p(θij|α, β )= θ α−1 ij (1 − θij)β−1 B(α, β ) , (3) where B(α, β )=","∫ 1 0 θ α−1 ij (1 − θij)β−1","dθ","ij. The value of α and β is determined by moment estimation.3","By substituting Equations 2 and 3 into Equation 1, I finally obtain the a posteriori distribution p(θij|D) as:","p(θij|α, β , D)=c · θ x+α−1 ij (1 − θij)n−x+β−1",",(4) where c = ( n x ) /(B(α, β )","∫ 1","0 P(θij)P(D|θij)dθij). When I regard the recognition threshold as t,I can calculate a confidence value con fij that a word wi can have s j by integrating the a posteriori distribution p(θij|D) from the threshold t to 1: con fij= ∫ 1 t","c · θ x+α−1 ij (1 − θij)n−x+β−1","dθ ij.(5) By using this confidence value, I represent an SCF confidence-value vector vi for a word wi in the acquired SCF lexicon (vij = con fij).","In order to combine SCF confidence-value vectors for words acquired from corpora and those for words in the lexicon of the target grammar, I also represent an SCF confidence-value vector v′","i for a","word w′ i in the target grammar by: v′ ij = { 1 − ε w′","i has s j in the lexicon ε otherwise, (6) where ε expresses an unreliability of the lexicon. In this study, I trust the lexicon as much as possible by setting ε to the machine epsilon.","3.2 Clustering of SCF Confidence-Value Vectors I next present a clustering algorithm of words according to their SCF confidence-value vectors.

I assume the elements of the centroids of the clusters as a discrete value of 0 or 1 because I want to obtain clusters whose element words have the exactly same set of SCFs.","I then derive a distance function d to calculate a probability that a data object vi should have an SCF set represented by a centroid cm as follows: d(vi, cm)="]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["cmj=1 vij ·"]},{"title":"∏","paragraphs":["cmj=0(1 − vij).

I call the following procedure centroid cut-off t when the confidence values are estimated under the recognition threshold t.

I then eliminate implausible SCFs s j for wi from the resulting SCFs according to their confidence values con fij.","In the following, I compare centroid cut-off with frequency cut-off and confidence cut-off t, which use relative frequencies and confidence values calculated under the recognition threshold t, respectively.
