The rst model, which we call the Sense model, builds on the work of Diab and Resnik (2002) that uses both parallel text and a sense inventory for the target language, and recasts their approach in a probabilistic framework. The second model, which we call the Concept model, is a hierarchical model that uses a concept latent variable to relate different language specic sense labels. We show that both models improve performance on the word sense disambiguation task over previous unsupervised approaches, with the Concept model show-ing the largest improvement. Furthermore, in learning the Concept model, as a by-product, we learn a sense inventory for the parallel language."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been a central question in the computational linguistics community since its inception. WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful in-termediate step for many other language process-ing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). Many recent approaches make use of ideas from statistical machine learning; the availability of shared sense denitions (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)) and recent international competitions (Kilgarrif and Rosenzweig, 2000) have enabled researchers to compare their results. Supervised approaches which make use of a small hand-labeled training set (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993) typically outperform unsupervised approaches (Agirre et al., 2000; Litkowski, 2000; Lin, 2000; Resnik, 1997; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995), but tend to be tuned to a specic corpus and are constrained by scarcity of labeled data.","In an effort to overcome the difculty of nd-ing sense-labeled training data, researchers have be-gun investigating unsupervised approaches to word-sense disambiguation. For example, the use of parallel corpora for sense tagging can help with word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan, 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Ide, 2000; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999). As an illustration of sense disambiguation from translation data, when the English word bank is translated to Spanish as orilla, it is clear that we are referring to the shore sense of bank, rather than the nancial institution sense.","The main inspiration for our work is Diab and Resnik (2002), who use translations and linguistic knowledge for disambiguation and automatic sense tagging. Bengio and Kermorvant (2003) present a graphical model that is an attempt to formalize probabilistically the main ideas in Diab and Resnik (2002). They assume the same semantic hierarchy (in particular, WordNet) for both the languages and assign English words as well as their translations to WordNet synsets. Here we present two variants of the graphical model in Bengio and Kermorvant (2003), along with a method to discover a cluster structure for the Spanish senses. We also present empirical word sense disambiguation results which demonstrate the gain brought by this probabilistic approach, even while only using the translated word to provide disambiguation information.","Our rst generative model, the Sense Model, groups semantically related words from the two languages into senses, and translations are generated by probabilistically choosing a sense and then words from the sense. We show that this improves on the results of Diab and Resnik (2002).","Our next model, which we call the Concept Model, aims to improve on the above sense structure by modeling the senses of the two languages separately and relating senses from both languages through a higher-level, semantically less precise concept. The intuition here is that not all of the senses that are possible for a word will be relevant for a concept. In other words, the distribution over the senses of a word given a concept can be expected to have a lower entropy than the distribution over the senses of the word in the language as a whole. In this paper, we look at translation data as a resource for identication of semantic concepts. Note that actual translated word pairs are not always good matches semantically, because the translation process is not on a word by word basis. This introduces a kind of noise in the translation, and an additional hidden variable to represent the shared meaning helps to take it into account. Improved performance over the Sense Model validates the use of concepts in modeling translations.","An interesting by-product of the Concept Model is a semantic structure for the secondary language. This is automatically constructed using background knowledge of the structure for the primary language and the observed translation pairs. In the model, words sharing the same sense are synonyms while senses under the same concept are semantically related in the corpus. An investigation of the model trained over real data reveals that it can indeed group related words together.","It may be noted that predicting senses from translations need not necessarily be an end result in it-self. As we have already mentioned, lack of labeled data is a severe hindrance for supervised approaches to word sense disambiguation. At the same time, there is an abundance of bilingual documents and many more can potentially be mined from the web. It should be possible using our approach to (noisily) assign sense tags to words in such documents, thus providing huge resources of labeled data for supervised approaches to make use of.","For the rest of this paper, for simplicity we will refer to the primary language of the parallel document as English and to the secondary as Spanish. The paper is organized as follows. We begin by formally describing the models in Section 2. We describe our approach for constructing the senses and concepts in Section 3. Our algorithm for learning the model parameters is described in Section 4. We present experimental results in Section 5 and our analysis in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7."]},{"title":"2 Probabilistic Models for Parallel Corpora","paragraphs":["We motivate the use of a probabilistic model by illustrating that disambiguation using translations is possible even when a word has a unique translation. For example, according to WordNet, the word prevention has two senses in English, which may be abbreviated as hindrance (the act of hindering or obstruction) and control (by prevention, e.g. the control of a disease). It has a single translation in our corpus, that being prevenci ·on. The rst English sense, hindrance, also has other words like bar that occur in the corpus and all of these other words are observed to be translated in Spanish as the word obstrucci ·on. In addition, none of these other words translate to prevenci ·on. So it is not unreasonable to suppose that the intended sense for prevention when translated as prevenci ·on is different from that of bar. Therefore, the intended sense is most likely to be control. At the very heart of the reasoning is probabilistic analysis and independence assumptions. We are assuming that senses and words have certain occurrence probabilities and that the choice of the word can be made independently once the sense has been decided. This is the avor that we look to add to modeling parallel documents for sense disambiguation. We formally describe the two generative models that use these ideas in Subsections 2.2 and 2.3.

In other words, the set of sense labels for the words in the two languages is the same and may be collapsed into one set of senses that is responsible for both English and Spanish words and the single latent variable in the model is the sense label  for both words  and ",". We also make the assumption that the words in both languages are conditionally independent given the sense label. The generative parameters","for the model are the prior probability","   of each sense  and the conditional probabilities","","  "," and","   "," of each word   and  ","in the two languages given the sense. The generation of a translation pair by this model may be viewed as a two-step process that rst selects a sense according to the priors on the senses and then selects a word from each language using the conditional probabilities for that sense. This may be imagined as a factoring of the joint distribution:","","","   ","   ","    ",". Note that in the absence of labeled training data, two of the random variables  and ","are observed, while the sense variable","is not. However, we can derive the possible values for our sense labels from WordNet, which gives us the possible senses for each English word  . The Sense model is shown in Figure 1(a). 2.3 The Concept Model The assumption of a one-to-one association between sense labels made in the Sense Model may be too simplistic to hold for arbitrary languages. In particular, it does not take into account that translation is from sentence to sentence (with a shared meaning), while the data we are modeling are aligned single-word translations","   , in which the intended meaning of ","does not always match perfectly with the intended meaning of ",". Generally, a set of","related senses in one language may be translated by one of","related senses in the other. This many-to-many mapping is captured in our alternative model using a second level hidden variable called a concept. Thus we have three hidden variables in the Concept Model the English sense  , the Spanish sense ","and the concept , where","","  ",""," ,","","  ",""," and "," ",".

We can now imagine the generative process of a translation pair by the Concept Model as rst selecting a concept according to the priors, then a sense for each language given the concept, and nally a word for each sense using the conditional probabilities of the words. As in Bengio and Kermorvant (2003), this generative procedure may be captured by factoring the joint distribution using the conditional independence assumptions as","  ","                        . The Concept model is shown in Figure 1(b)."]},{"title":"3 Constructing the Senses and Concepts","paragraphs":["Building the structure of the model is crucial for our task. Choosing the dimensionality of the hidden variables by selecting the number of senses and concepts, as well as taking advantage of prior knowledge to impose constraints, are very important as-pects of building the structure.","If certain words are not possible for a given sense, or certain senses are not possible for a given concept, their corresponding parameters should be 0. For instance, for all words","  that do not belong to a sense  ",", the corresponding parameter","","would be permanently set to 0. Only the remaining parameters need to be modeled explicitly.","While model selection is an extremely difcult problem in general, an important and interesting option is the use of world knowledge. Semantic hierarchies for some languages have been built. We should be able to make use of these known taxonomies in constructing our model. We make heavy use of the WordNet ontology to assign structure to both our models, as we discuss in the following subsections. There are two major tasks in building the structure determining the possible sense labels for each word, both English and Spanish, and constructing the concepts, which involves choosing the number of concepts and the probable senses for each concept. 3.1 Building the Sense Model Each word in WordNet can belong to multiple synsets in the hierarchy, which are its possible senses. In both of our models, we directly use the WordNet senses as the English sense labels. All WordNet senses for which a word has been observed in the corpus form our set of English sense labels. The Sense Model holds that the sense labels for the two domains are the same. So we must use the same WordNet labels for the Spanish words as well. We include a Spanish word","  for a sense ","if  is the translation of any English word","  in  . 3.2 Building the Concept Model Unlike the Sense Model, the Concept Model does not constrain the Spanish senses to be the same as the English ones. So the two major tasks in building the Concept Model are constructing the Spanish senses and then clustering the English and Spanish senses to build the concepts.

If each word has a single sense, then we add a Spanish sense  ","for each","and all Spanish words that share that ","belong to that sense. Otherwise, the","s have to be split into frequently occurring subgroups. Frequently co-occurring subsets of","s can dene more rened Spanish senses. We identify these subsets by looking at pairs of","s and comput-ing their intersections. An intersection is considered to be a Spanish sense if it occurs for a signicant number of pairs of","s. We consider both ways of building Spanish senses. In either case, a constructed Spanish sense   comes with its relevant set","    of English senses, which we denote as  ","",".","Once we have the Spanish senses, we cluster them to form concepts. We use the","corresponding to each Spanish sense to dene a measure of similarity for a pair of Spanish senses. There are many options to choose from here. We use a simple measure that counts the number of common items in the two","s.1","The similarity measure is now used to cluster the Spanish senses  ",". Since this measure is not transitive, it does not directly dene equivalence classes over ",". Instead, we get a similarity graph where the vertices are the Spanish senses and we add an edge between two senses if their similarity is above a threshold. We now pick each connected component from this graph as a cluster of similar Spanish senses.","1","Another option would be to use a measure of similarity for English senses, proposed in Resnik (1995) for two synsets in a concept hierarchy like WordNet. Our initial results with this measure were not favorable.","Now we build the concepts from the Spanish sense clusters. We recall that a concept is dened by a set of English senses and a set of Spanish senses that are related. Each cluster represents a concept. A particular concept is formed by the set of Spanish senses in the cluster and the English senses relevant for them. The relevant English senses for any Spanish sense is given by its",". Therefore, the union of the","s of all the Spanish senses in the cluster forms the set of English senses for each concept."]},{"title":"4 Learning the Model Parameters","paragraphs":["Once the model is built, we use the popular EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) for hidden variables to learn the parameters for both models. The algorithm repeatedly iterates over two steps. The rst step maximizes the expected log-likelihood of the joint probability of the observed data with the current parameter settings","",". The next step then reestimates the values of the parameters of the model. Below we summarize the re-estimation steps for each model. 4.1 EM for the Sense Model  ","","  ","   ","   ","   "," ","            ","  ","","  ","  ",""," ","         ","  ","","  ","  ",""," ","   "," ","      ","      ","  "," follows similarly. 4.2 EM for the Concept Model    ","   ","   ","","",""," ","              ","  ","","   ","   ","       ","  ",""," ","","",""," ","               ","   ","  ","","   ","     ","      ","  ",""," ","  ","","       ","              ","  and","            follow similarly. 4.3 Initialization of Model Probabilities Since the EM algorithm performs gradient ascent as it iteratively improves the log-likelihood, it is prone to getting caught in local maxima, and selection of the initial conditions is crucial for the learning procedure. Instead of opting for a uni-form or random initialization of the probabilities, we make use of prior knowledge about the English words and senses available from WordNet. WordNet provides occurrence frequencies for each synset in the SemCor Corpus that may be normalized to derive probabilities     ","for each English sense",". For the Sense Model, these probabilities form the initial priors over the senses, while all English (and Spanish) words belonging to a sense are initially assumed to be equally likely. However, initialization of the Concept Model using the same knowledge is trickier. We would like each English sense   to have            ",". But the fact that each sense belongs to multiple concepts and the constraint   ","   ","","","makes","the solution non-trivial. Instead, we settle for a","compromise.

All the Spanish and English words for a sense are set to be equally likely, as in the Sense Model. It turned out in our experiments on real data that this initialization makes a signicant difference in model performance."]},{"title":"5 Experimental Evaluation","paragraphs":["Both the models are generative probabilistic models learned from parallel corpora and are expected to t the training and subsequent test data. A good t should be reected in good prediction accuracy over a test set. The prediction task of interest is the sense of an English word when its translation is provided. We estimate the prediction accuracy and recall of our models on Senseval data.2","In addition, the Concept Model learns a sense structure for the Spanish","2","Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions and the number of attempted predictions. Recall is the ratio of the number of correct predictions and the size of the test set. language. While it is hard to objectively evaluate the quality of such a structure, we present some interesting concepts that are learned as an indication of the potential of our approach. 5.1 Evaluation with Senseval Data In our experiments with real data, we make use of the parallel corpora constructed by Diab and Resnik (2002) for evaluation purposes. We chose to work on these corpora in order to permit a direct comparison with their results. The sense-tagged portion of the English corpus is comprised of the English all-words section of the SENSEVAL-2 test data. The remainder of this corpus is constructed by adding the Brown Corpus, the SENSEVAL-1 corpus, the SENSEVAL-2 English Lexical Sample test, trial and training corpora and the Wall Street Journal sections 18-24 from the Penn Treebank. This English corpus is translated into Spanish using two commercially available MT systems: Globalink Pro 6.4 and Systran Professional Premium. The GIZA++ implementation of the IBM statistical MT models was used to derive the most-likely word-level alignments, and these dene the English/Spanish word co-occurrences. To take into account variability of translation, we combine the translations from the two systems for each English word, following in the footsteps of Diab and Resnik (2002). For our experiments, we focus only on nouns, of which there are 875 occurrences in our tagged data. The sense tags for the English domain are derived from the WordNet 1.7 inventory. After pruning stopwords, we end up with 16,186 English words, 31,862 Spanish words and 2,385,574 instances of 41,850 distinct translation pairs. The English words come from 20,361 WordNet senses.

For our best results, the Sense Model has 20,361 senses, while the Concept Model has 20,361 English senses, 11,961 Spanish senses and 7,366 concepts.

It can be seen that our models outperform all the unsupervised approaches in recall and many supervised ones as well. No unsupervised approach is better in both accuracy and recall. It needs to be kept in mind that we take into account only bilingual data for our predictions, and not monolingual features like context of the word as most other WSD approaches do. 5.2 Semantic Grouping of Spanish Senses Table 2 shows some interesting examples of different Spanish senses for discovered concepts.3","The context of most concepts, like the ones shown, can be easily understood. For example, the rst concept is about government actions and the second deals with murder and accidental deaths. The penultimate concept is interesting because it deals with different kinds of association and involves three different senses containing the word conexi ·on. The other words in two of these senses suggest that they are about union and relation respectively. The third probably involves the link sense of connection. Conciseness of the concepts depends on the similarity threshold that is selected. Some may bring together loosely-related topics, which can be separated by a higher threshold."]},{"title":"6 Model Analysis","paragraphs":["In this section, we back up our experimental results with an in-depth analysis of the performance of our two models.","Our Sense Model was motivated by Diab and Resnik (2002) but the avors of the two are quite","3","Some English words are found to occur in the Spanish Senses. This is because the machine translation system used to create the Spanish document left certain words untranslated. different. The most important distinction is that the Sense Model is a probabilistic generative model for parallel corpora, where interaction between different words stemming from the same sense comes into play, even if the words are not related through translations, and this interdependence of the senses through common words plays a role in sense disambiguation.","We started off with our discussions on semantic ambiguity with the intuition that identication of semantic concepts in the corpus that relate multiple senses should help disambiguate senses. The Sense Model falls short of this target since it only brings together a single sense from each language. We will now revisit the motivating example from Section 2 and see how concepts help in disambiguation by grouping multiple related senses together.","For the Sense Model,","  ","  ","since it is the only word that ","can generate.

Imagine two Spanish words that are associated with ten English senses and accordingly each of them has a probability for belonging to each of these ten senses. Aided with a concept variable, it is possible to model the same relationship by creating a separate Spanish sense that contains these two words and relating this Spanish sense with the ten English senses through a concept variable. Thus these words now need to belong to only one sense as opposed to ten. Of course, now there are new transition probabilities for each of the eleven senses from the new concept node.
