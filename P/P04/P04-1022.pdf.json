Unlike previous methods using bilingual parallel corpora, this paper presents a new method for acquiring collocation translations by making use of monolingual corpora and linguistic knowledge. First, dependency triples are extracted from Chinese and English corpora with dependency parsers. Then, a dependency triple translation model is estimated using the EM algorithm based on a dependency correspondence assumption. The generated triple translation model is used to extract collocation translations from two monolingual corpora. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing monolingual corpus based methods in dependency triple translation and achieves promising results in collocation translation extraction. 1 Introduction","A collocation is an arbitrary and recurrent word combination (Benson, 1990). Previous work in collocation acquisition varies in the kinds of collocations they detect. These range from two-word to multi-word, with or without syntactic structure (Smadja 1993; Lin, 1998; Pearce, 2001; Seretan et al. 2003). In this paper, a collocation refers to a recurrent word pair linked with a certain syntactic relation. For instance, <solve, verb-object, problem> is a collocation with a syntactic relation verb-object.","Translation of collocations is difficult for nonnative speakers. Many collocation translations are idiosyncratic in the sense that they are unpredictable by syntactic or semantic features. Consider Chinese to English translation. The translations of “解决” can be “solve” or “resolve”. The translations of “问题” can be “problem” or “issue”. However, translations of the collocation “解决 ~ 问题” as “solve~problem” or “resolve~ issue” is preferred over “solve~issue” or “resolve ~problem”. Automatically acquiring these collocation translations will be very useful for machine translation, cross language information retrieval, second language learning and many other NLP applications. (Smadja et al., 1996; Gao et al., 2002; Wu and Zhou, 2003).","Some studies have been done for acquiring collocation translations using parallel corpora (Smadja et al, 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Echizen-ya et al., 2003). These works implicitly assume that a bilingual corpus on a large scale can be obtained easily. However, despite efforts in compiling parallel corpora, sufficient amounts of such corpora are still unavailable. Instead of heavily relying on bilingual corpora, this paper aims to solve the bottleneck in a different way: to mine bilingual knowledge from structured monolingual corpora, which can be more easily obtained in a large volume.","Our method is based on the observation that despite the great differences between Chinese and English, the main dependency relations tend to have a strong direct correspondence (Zhou et al., 2001). Based on this assumption, a new translation model based on dependency triples is proposed. The translation probabilities are estimated from two monolingual corpora using the EM algorithm with the help of a bilingual translation dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed triple translation model outperforms the other three models in comparison. The obtained triple translation model is also used for collocation translation extraction. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description on the related work. Section 3 describes our triple translation model and training algorithm. Section 4 extracts collocation translations from two independent monolingual corpora. Section 5 evaluates the proposed method, and the last section draws conclusions and presents the future work. 2 Related work","There has been much previous work done on monolingual collocation extraction. They can in general be classified into two types: window-based and syntax-based methods. The former extracts collocations within a fixed window (Church and Hanks 1990; Smadja, 1993). The latter extracts collocations which have a syntactic relationship (Lin, 1998; Seretan et al., 2003). The syntax-based method becomes more favorable with recent significant increases in parsing efficiency and accuracy. Several metrics have been adopted to measure the association strength in collocation extraction. Thanopoulos et al. (2002) give comparative evaluations on these metrics.","Most previous research in translation knowledge acquisition is based on parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1993). As for collocation translation, Smadja et al. (1996) implement a system to extract collocation translations from a parallel English-French corpus. English collocations are first extracted using the Xtract system, then corresponding French translations are sought based on the Dice coefficient. Echizen-ya et al. (2003) propose a method to extract bilingual collocations using recursive chain-link-type learning. In addition to collocation translation, there is also some related work in acquiring phrase or term translations from parallel corpus (Kupiec, 1993; Yamamoto and Matsumoto 2000).","Since large aligned bilingual corpora are hard to obtain, some research has been conducted to exploit translation knowledge from non-parallel corpora. Their work is mainly on word level. Koehn and Knight (2000) presents an approach to estimating word translation probabilities using unrelated monolingual corpora with the EM algorithm. The method exhibits promising results in selecting the right translation among several options provided by bilingual dictionary. Zhou et al.(2001) proposes a method to simulate translation probability with a cross language similarity score, which is estimated from monolingual corpora based on mutual information. The method achieves good results in word translation selection. In addition, (Dagan and Itai, 1994) and (Li, 2002) propose using two monolingual corpora for word sense disambiguation. (Fung, 1998) uses an IR approach to induce new word translations from comparable corpora. (Rapp, 1999) and (Koehn and Knight, 2002) extract new word translations from non-parallel corpus. (Cao and Li, 2002) acquire noun phrase translations by making use of web data. (Wu and Zhou, 2003) also make full use of large scale monolingual corpora and limited bilingual corpora for synonymous collocation extraction.","3 Training a triple translation model from monolingual corpora","In this section, we first describe the dependency correspondence assumption underlying our approach. Then a dependency triple translation model and the monolingual corpus based training algorithm are proposed. The obtained triple translation model will be used for collocation translation extraction in next section.","3.1 Dependency correspondence between Chinese and English","A dependency triple consists of a head, a dependant, and a dependency relation. Using a dependency parser, a sentence can be analyzed into dependency triples. We represent a triple as (w1,r,w2), where w1 and w2 are words and r is the dependency relation. It means that w2 has a dependency relation r with w1. For example, a triple (overcome, verb-object, difficulty) means that “difficulty” is the object of the verb “overcome”.","Among all the dependency relations, we only consider the following three key types that we think, are the most important in text analysis and machine translation: verb-object (VO), noun-adj(AN), and verb- adv(AV).","It is our observation that there is a strong correspondence in major dependency relations in the translation between English and Chinese. For example, an object-verb relation in Chinese (e.g.(克服, VO, 困难)) is usually translated into the same verb-object relation in English(e.g. (overcome, VO, difficulty)).","This assumption has been experimentally justified based on a large and balanced bilingual corpus in our previous work (Zhou et al., 2001). We come to the conclusion that more than 80% of the above dependency relations have a one-one mapping between Chinese and English. We can conclude that there is indeed a very strong correspondence between Chinese and English in the three considered dependency relations. This fact will be used to estimate triple translation model using two monolingual corpora. 3.2 Triple translation model","According to Bayes’s theorem, given a Chinese triple"]},{"title":"),,(","paragraphs":["21"]},{"title":"crcc","paragraphs":["ctri"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":[", and the set of its candidate English triple translations"]},{"title":"),,(","paragraphs":["21"]},{"title":"eree","paragraphs":["etri"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":[", the best English triple"]},{"title":"),̂,(̂ˆ","paragraphs":["21"]},{"title":"eree","paragraphs":["etri"]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["is the one that maximizes the Equation (1): )|()(maxarg )(/)|()(maxarg )|(maxargˆ tritritri e tritritritri e tritri e tri ecpep cpecpep cepe tri tri tri = = = (1) where"]},{"title":")(","paragraphs":["tri"]},{"title":"ep","paragraphs":["is usually called the language model and"]},{"title":")|(","paragraphs":["tritri"]},{"title":"ecp","paragraphs":["is usually called the translation model.","Language Model The language model"]},{"title":")(","paragraphs":["tri"]},{"title":"ep","paragraphs":["is calculated with English triples database.

The candidate English translation set of Chinese triples is generated through a bilingual dictionary and the assumption of strong correspondence of dependency relations. There is a risk that unrelated triples in Chinese and English can be connected with this method. However, as the conditions that are used to make the connection are quite strong (i.e. possible word translations in the same triple structure), we believe that this risk, is not very severe. Then, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to iteratively strengthen the correct connections and weaken the incorrect connections.

Since the English triple language model provides context information for the disambiguation of the Chinese words, only the appropriate occurrences are counted.","Now, with the language model estimated using Equation (4) and the translation probabilities estimated using EM algorithm, we can compute the best triple translation for a given Chinese triple using Equations (1) and (7).","4 Collocation translation extraction from two monolingual corpora","This section describes how to extract collocation translation from independent monolingual corpora. First, collocations are extracted from a monolingual triples database. Then, collocation translations are acquired using the triple translation model obtained in section 3. 4.1 Monolingual collocation extraction","As introduced in section 2, much work has been done to extract collocations. Among all the measure metrics, log likelihood ratio (LLR) has proved to give better results (Duning, 1993; Thanopoulos et al., 2002).

It can be seen that the best English triple candidate is extracted as the translation of the given Chinese collocation only if the Chinese collocation is also the best translation candidate of the English triple. But the English triple is not necessarily a collocation. English collocation translations can be extracted in a similar way.  Figure 2: Collocation translation extraction 4.3 Implementation of our approach","Our English corpus is from Wall Street Journal (1987-1992) and Associated Press (1988-1990), and the Chinese corpus is from People’s Daily (1980-1998). The two corpora are parsed using the NLPWin parser1 (Heidorn, 2000). The statistics for three main types of dependency triples are shown in tables 1 and 2.

The first one compares our method with three other monolingual corpus based methods in triple translation. The second one evaluates the accuracy of the acquired collocation translation. 5.1 Dependency triple translation","Triple translation experiments are conducted from Chinese to English. We randomly selected 2000 Chinese triples (whose frequency is larger than 2) from the dependency triple database. The standard translation answer sets were built manually by three linguistic experts. For each Chinese triple, its English translation set contain English triples provided by anyone of the three linguists. Among 2000 candidate triples, there are 101 triples that can’t be translated into English triples with same relation. For example, the Chinese triple (讲, VO, 价钱) should be translated into “bargain”. The two words in triple cannot be translated separately. We call this kind of collocation translation no-compositional translations. Our current model cannot deal with this kind of translation. In addition, there are also 157 error dependency triples, which result from parsing mistakes. We filtered out these two kinds of triples and got a standard test set with 1,742 Chinese triples and 4,645 translations in total.","We compare our triple translation model with three other models on the same standard test set with the same translation dictionary.

It was set to the same as others in order to compare accuracy using the same test set. The oracle score is the upper bound accuracy under the conditions of current translation dictionary and standard test set. Top N accuracy is defined as the percentage of triples whose selected top N translations include correct translations.","We can see that both Model C and Model D achieve better results than Model B.

But as we can see, compared to the oracle score, the current models still have much room for improvement.

We randomly selected 1000 translations for evaluation. Three linguistic experts tag the acceptability of the translation. Those translations that are tagged as acceptable by at least two experts are evaluated as correct. The evaluation results are shown in Table 5.","Total Acceptance Accuracy (%) VO 590 373 63.22 AN 292 199 68.15 AV 118 60 50.85 All 1000 632 63.20","ColTrans 334 241 72.16","Table 5: Extracted collocation translation results","We can see that the extracted collocation translations achieve a much better result than triple translation. The average accuracy is 63.20% and the collocations with relation AN achieve the highest accuracy of 68.15%. If we only consider those Chinese collocations whose translations are also English collocations, we obtain an even better accuracy of 72.16% as shown in the last row of Table 5. The results justify our idea that we can acquire reliable translation for collocation by making use of triple translation model in two directions.","These acquired collocation translations are very valuable for translation knowledge building. Manually crafting collocation translations can be time-consuming and cannot ensure high quality in a consistent way. Our work will certainly improve the quality and efficiency of collocation translation acquisition. 5.3 Discussion","Although our approach achieves promising results, it still has some limitations to be remedied in future work. (1) Translation dictionary extension","Due to the limited coverage of the dictionary, a correct translation may not be stored in the dictionary. This naturally limits the coverage of triple translations. Some research has been done to expand translation dictionary using a non-parallel corpus (Rapp, 1999; Keohn and Knight, 2002). It can be used to improve our work. (2) Noise filtering of parsers","Since we use parsers to generate dependency triple databases, this inevitably introduces some parsing mistakes. From our triple translation test data, we can see that 7.85% (157/2000) types of triples are error triples. These errors will certainly influence the translation probability estimation in the training process. We need to find an effective way to filter out mistakes and perform necessary automatic correction. (3) Non-compositional collocation translation.","Our model is based on the dependency correspondence assumption, which assumes that a triple’s translation is also a triple. But there are still some collocations that can’t be translated word by word. For example, the Chinese triple (富有, VO, 成效) usually be translated into “be effective”; the English triple (take, VO, place) usually be translated into “发生”. The two words in triple cannot be translated separately. Our current model cannot deal with this kind of non-compositional collocation translation. Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on non-compositional phrases discovery. We will consider taking their work as a complement to our model. 6 Conclusion and future work","This paper proposes a novel method to train a triple translation model and extract collocation translations from two independent monolingual corpora. Evaluation results show that it outperforms the existing monolingual corpus based methods in triple translation, mainly due to the employment of EM algorithm in cross language translation probability estimation. By making use of the acquired triple translation model in two directions, promising results are achieved in collocation translation extraction.","Our work also demonstrates the possibility of making full use of monolingual resources, such as corpora and parsers for bilingual tasks. This can help overcome the bottleneck of the lack of a large-scale bilingual corpus. This approach is also applicable to comparable corpora, which are also easier to access than bilingual corpora.","In future work, we are interested in extending our method to solving the problem of non-compositional collocation translation. We are also interested in incorporating our triple translation model for sentence level translation. 7 Acknowledgements","The authors would like to thank John Chen, Jianfeng Gao and Yunbo Cao for their valuable suggestions and comments on a preliminary draft of this paper."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Morton Benson. 1990.
