Charles St., Baltimore, MD-21218, USA","{chelba,jelinek} @jhu.edu Abstract The paper presents a language model that develops syntactic structure and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history, thus enabling the use of long distance dependencies. The model assigns probability to every joint sequence of words-binary-parse-structure with headword annotation and operates in a left-to-right manner -- therefore usable for automatic speech recognition. The model, its probabilistic parameterization, and a set of experiments meant to evaluate its predictive power are presented; an improvement over standard trigram modeling is achieved."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["The main goal of the present work is to develop a language model that uses syntactic structure to model long-distance dependencies. During the summer96 DoD Workshop a similar attempt was made by the dependency modeling group. The model we present is closely related to the one investigated in (Chelba et al., 1997), however different in a few important aspects: • our model operates in a left-to-right manner, allowing the decoding of word lattices, as opposed to the one referred to previously, where only whole sentences could be processed, thus reducing its applicability to n-best list re-scoring; the syntactic structure is developed as a model component; • our model is a factored version of the one in (Chelba et al., 1997), thus enabling the calculation of the joint probability of words and parse structure; this was not possible in the previous case due to the huge computational complexity of the model.","Our model develops syntactic structure incrementally while traversing the sentence from left to right. This is the main difference between our approach and other approaches to statistical natural language parsing. Our parsing strategy is similar to the in-cremental syntax ones proposed relatively recently in the linguistic community (Philips, 1996). The probabilistic model, its parameterization and a few experiments that are meant to evaluate its potential for speech recognition are presented."]},{"title":"///","paragraphs":["/~tract NP the_DT contract NN ~,dc,l VBI)with INa DT Ioss_NN of_IN 7_CD ~: ~::, X~,'~ after Figure 1: Partial parse 2 The Basic Idea"]},{"title":"and Terminology","paragraphs":["Consider predicting the word after in the sentence: the contract ended with a loss of 7 cents after trading as low as 89 cents. A 3-gram approach would predict after from (7, cents) whereas it is intuitively clear that the strongest predictor would be ended which is outside the reach of even 7-grams. Our assumption is that what enables humans to make a good prediction of after is the syntactic structure in the past. The linguistically correct partial parse of the word history when predicting after is shown in Figure 1. The word ended is called the headword of the constituent (ended (with (...) )) and ended is an exposed headword when predicting after -- topmost headword in the largest constituent that contains it. The syntactic structure in the past filters out irrelevant words and points to the important ones, thus enabling the use of long distance information when predicting the next word.","Our model will attempt to build the syntactic structure incrementally while traversing the sentence left-to-right. The model will assign a probability P(W, T) to every sentence W with every possible POStag assignment, binary branching parse, non-terminal label and headword annotation for every constituent of T.","Let W be a sentence of length n words to which we have prepended <s> and appended </s> so that Wo =<s> and w,+l =</s>.

To stress this point, a word-parse k-prefix contains -- for a given parse -- only those binary subtrees whose span is completely included in the word k-prefix, excluding w0 =<s>. Single words along with their POStag can be regarded as root-only trees. Figure 2 shows a word-parse k-prefix; h_0 .. h_{-m} are the exposed heads, each head being a pair(headword, non-terminal label), or (word, POStag) in the case of a root-only tree. A complete parse -- Figure 3 -- is any binary parse of the (wl,tl)...(wn,t,) (</s>, SE) sequence with the restriction that (</s>, TOP') is the only allowed head. Note that ((wl,tl)...(w,,t,)) needn't be a constituent, but for the parses where it is, there is no restriction on which of its words is the headword or what is the non-terminal label that accompanies the headword.","The model will operate by means of three modules: • WORD-PREDICTOR predicts the next word wk+l given the word-parse k-prefix and then passes control to the TAGGER; • TAGGER predicts the POStag of the next word tk+l given the word-parse k-prefix and the newly predicted word and then passes control to the PARSER; • PARSER grows the already existing binary branching structure by repeatedly generating the transitions: (unary, NTlabel), (adjoin-left, NTlabel) or (adjoin-right, NTlabel) until it passes control to the PREDICTOR by taking a null transition. NTlabel is the non-terminal label assigned to the newly built constituent and {left ,right} specifies where the new headword is inherited from.","The operations performed by the PARSER are illustrated in Figures 4-6 and they ensure that all possible binary branching parses with all possible","T'_{.m÷l l <-<s.~. <s>","h'{-I } = h_(-2 } h'_0= (h_{-I }.word, NTlabel) Figure 5: Result of adjoin-left under NTlabel headword and non-terminal label assignments for the wl ... wk word sequence can be generated.

The A coefficients are tied based on the range of the count C(xx,...,Xn). The approach is a standard one which doesn't require an extensive description given the literature available on it (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980). 3.2","Search Strategy Since the number of parses for a given word prefix Wt grows exponentially with k, I{Tk}l ,,. O(2k), the state space of our model is huge even for relatively short sentences so we had to use a search strategy that prunes it. Our choice was a synchronous multi-stack search algorithm which is very similar to a beam search.","Each stack contains hypotheses -- partial parses -- that have been constructed by the same number of predictor and the same number of parser operations. The hypotheses in each stack are ranked according to the ln(P(W, T)) score, highest on top. The width of the search is controlled by two parameters: • the maximum stack depth -- the maximum number of hypotheses the stack can contain at any given state; • log-probability threshold -- the difference between the log-probability score of the top-most hypothesis and the bottom-most hypothesis at any given state of the stack cannot be larger than a given threshold.","Figure 7 shows schematically the operations associated with the scanning of a new word Wk+l. The above pruning strategy proved to be insufficient so we chose to also discard all hypotheses whose score is more than the log-probability threshold below the score of the topmost hypothesis. This additional pruning step is performed after all hypotheses in stage k' have been extended with the null parser transition and thus prepared for scanning a new word. 3.3 Word Level Perplexity The conditional perplexity calculated by assigning to a whole sentence the probability: P(W/T*) = fi P(wk+l/WkT~), (7) k=O where T* = argrnaxTP(W, T), is not valid because it is not causal: when predicting wk+l we use T* which was determined by looking at the entire sentence.

This is a deficient probability assignment, however useful for justifying the model parameter re-estimation.","The two estimates (8) and (10) are both consistent in the sense that if the sums are carried over all 228 possible parses we get the correct value for the word level perplexity of our model. 3.4 Parameter Re-estimation The major problem we face when trying to reestimate the model parameters is the huge state space of the model and the fact that dynamic programming techniques similar to those used in HMM parameter re-estimation cannot be used with our model.

Consider a given sentence in our \"development\" set. The \"N-best\" derivations for this sentence are trajectories through the state space of our model. They will change from one iteration to the other due to the smooth-ing involved in the probability estimation and the change of the parameters -- event counts -- defining our model, thus allowing new events to appear and discarding others through purging low probability events from the stacks. The higher the number of trajectories per sentence, the more dynamic this change is expected to be.","The results we obtained are presented in the experiments section. All the perplexity evaluations were done using the left-to-right formula (8) (L2R-PPL) for which the perplexity on the \"development set\" is not guaranteed to decrease from one iteration to another. However, we believe that our re-estimation method should not increase the approximation to perplexity based on (10) (SUM-PPL) -- again, on the \"development set\"; we rely on the consistency property outlined at the end of section 3.3 to correlate the desired decrease in L2R-PPL with that in SUM-PPL.
