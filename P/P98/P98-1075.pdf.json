Yet, due to the very nature of human language, such mappings invariably fail to achieve full coverage on unseen data. Acknowledging the impossibility of stat-ing a priori all the surface forms by which a concept can be expressed, we present GsG: an empathic computer system for the rapid deployment of NLU front-ends and their dynamic customization by non-expert end-users. Given a new domain for which an NLU front-end is to be developed, two stages are involved. In the authoring stage, GSQ aids the developer in the construction of a simple domain model and a kernel analysis grammar. Then, in the run-time stage, GSG provides the end-user with an interactive environment in which the kernel grammar is dynamically extended. Three learning methods are employed in the acquisition of semantic mappings from unseen data: (i) parser predictions, (ii) hidden understanding model, and (iii) end-user paraphrases.

A parser will work for any domain but the semantic mapping is domain-dependent. Even after the domain model has been established, the daunting task of trying to come up with all the possible surface forms by which each concept can","1 Semantic grammars are grammars whose non-terminals correspond to semantic concepts (e.g., [greeting] or [suggest.time] ) rather than to syntactic constituents (such as Verb or WounPhrase). They have the advantage that the semantics of a sentence can be directly read off its parse tree, and the disadvantage that a new grammar must be developed for each domain. be expressed, still lies ahead. Writing such mappings takes in the order of years, can only be performed by qualified humans (usually computational linguists) and yet the final result is often fragile and non-adaptive.","Following a radically different philosophy, we propose rapid (in the order of days) deployment of NLU modules for new domains with on-need basis learning: let the semantic grammar grow automatically when and where it is needed. 2 Grammar development If we analyze the traditional method of developing a semantic grammar for a new domain, we find that the following stages are involved. 1. Data collection. Naturally-occurring data from","the domain at hand are collected. 2. Design of the domain model. A hierarchical","structuring of the relevant concepts in the do-","main is built in the form of an ontology or do-","main model. 3. Development of a kernel grammar. A grammar","that covers a small subset of the collected data","is constructed. 4. Expansion of grammar coverage. Lengthy, ar-","duous task of developing the grammar to extend","its coverage over the collected data and beyond. 5. Deployment. Release of the final grammar for","the application at hand. The GsG system described in this paper aids all but the first of these stages: For the second stage, we have built a simple editor to design and analize the Domain Model; for the third, a semi-automated way of constructing the Kernel Grammar; for the fourth, an interactive environment in which new semantic mappings are dynamically acquired. As for the fifth (deployment), it advances one place: after the short initial authoring phase (stages 2 and 3 above) the final application can already be launched, since the semantic grammar will be extended, at run-time, by the non-expert end-user. 3","System architecture As depicted in Fig. 1, GsG is composed of the following modules: the Domain Model Editor and the 451 authoring stage run.~me stage ..........................................

Kernel Grammar Editor, for the authoring stage, and the SouP parser and the IDIGA environment, for the run-time stage. 3.1 Authoring stage In the authoring stage, a developer s creates the Domain Model (DM) with the aid of the DM Editor. In our present formalism, the DM is simply a directed acyclic graph in which the vertices correspond to concept-labels and the edges indicate concept-subconcept relations (see Fig. 2 for an example).","Once the DM is defined, the Kernel Grammar Editor drives the development of the Kernel Grammar by querying the developer to instantiate into grammar rules the rule templates derived from the DM.

What GsG provides in the run-time stage are mechanisms that allow a non-expert end-user to \"teach\" the meaning of new expressions.","The tight coupling between the SouP parser 4 and the IDIGA s environment allows for a rapid and multifaceted analysis of the input string.

For instance, in the DM in Fig. 2 top-level concepts such as [greeting], Cfarewell] or [suggestion], correspond to discourse speech acts, and in normally-occurring conversation, they follow a distribution that is clearly non-uniform. 1°","• Concept-subconcept HMM. Discrete hidden Markov model in which the states correspond l°Needless to say, speech-act transition distributions are empirically estimated, but, intuitively, the sequence <[greeting], [suggestion]> is more likely than the sequence < [greeting], [farewell]>. to the concepts in the DM (i.e., equivalent to grammar non-terminals) and the observations to the embedded concepts appearing as immediate daughters of the state in a parse tree. For example, the parse tree in Fig. 4 contains the following set of <state, observation> pairs: {< [time], [point] >, < [point], [day_of_week] >, < [point], [time_of_day] >}.","• Concept-word HMM. Discrete hidden Markov model in which the states correspond to the concepts in the DM and the observations to the embedded lexical items (i.e., grammar terminals) appearing as immediate daughters of the state in a parse tree. For example, the parse tree in Fig. 4 contains the pairs: {<[day_of_week], tuesday>, < [time_of_day], afternoon>}.","The HUM thus attempts to capture the recurring patterns of the language used in the domain in an asynchronous mode, i.e., independent of word order (as opposed to parser predictions that heavily depend on word order). Its aim is, again, to provide predictive power at run-time: upon encountering an unparsable expression, the HUM hypothesizes possible intended meanings in the form of a ranked list of the most likely parse trees, given the current state in the discourse, the subparses for the expression and the lexical items present in the expression.","Its parameters can be best estimated through training over a given corpus of correct parses, but in order not to compromise our established goal of rapid deployment, we employ the following techniques.","1. In the absence of a training corpus, the HUM parameters are seeded from the Kernel Grammar itself.","2. Training is maintained at run-time through dynamic updates of all model parameters after each utterance and learning episode. 3.2.4 End-user paraphrases If the end-user is not satisfied with the hypotheses presented by the parser predictions or the HUM, a third learning method is triggered: learning from a paraphrase of the original utterance, given also by the end-user. Assuming the paraphrase is understood, 11 GsG updates the grammar in such a fashion so that the semantics of the first sentence are equivalent to those of the paraphrase. 12 11 Precisely, the requirement that the grammar be complete (see note 3} ensures the existence of a suitable paraphrase for any utterance expressible in the domain. In practice, however, it may take too many attempts to find an appropriate paraphrase. Currently, if the first paraphrase is not understood, no further requests are made. 12Presently, the root of the paraphrase's parse tree directly becomes the left-hand-side of the new rule. 454 Perfect Ok Bad Expert before 55.41 17.58 27.01 Expert after 75.68 10.81 13.51 A +£0.£7 --6.77 --13.50 End-user1 before 58.11 18.92 22.97 End-user1 after 64.86 22.97 12.17 A +6.75 +.~.05 --10.80 End-user2 before 41.89 16.22 41.89 End-user2 after 48.64 28.38 22.98 A +6.75 +1£.16 --18.91 Table 1: Comparison of parse grades (in %).

We present here the results for an experiment involving the comparison of expert vs. non-expert grammar development on a spontaneous travel reservation task in English. The grammar had been developed over the course of three months by a full-time expert grammar writer and the experiment consisted in having this expert develop on an unseen set of 72 sentences using the traditional environment and asking two non-expert users is to \"teach\" Gs6 the meaning of the same 72 sentences through interactions with the system. Table 1 compares the correct parses before and after development.","It took the expert 15 minutes to add 8 rules and reduce bad coverage from 27.01% to 13.51%. As for the non-experts, end-user1, starting with a similar grammar, reduced bad parses from 22.97% to 12.17% through a 30-minute session 14 with GsG that gave rise to 8 new rules; end-user2, starting with the smallest possible complete grammar, reduced bad parses from 41.89% to 22.98% through a 35-minute session 14 that triggered the creation of 17 new rules.","60% of the learning episodes were successful, with an average number of questions of 2.91. The unsuccessful learning episodes had an average number of questions of 6.19 and their failure is mostly due to unsuccessful paraphrases.","As for the nature of the acquired rules, they differ in that the expert makes use of optional and repeatable tokens, an expressive power not currently available to GSG. On the other hand this lack of generality can be compensated by the Principle of Maximal Abstraction (see note 8).

It can take the non-expert twice as long as the expert to go through a set of sentences, but the main point is that it is possible at all for a user with no background in computer science or linguistics to teach Gso the meaning of new expressions without being aware of the underlying machinery.","Potential applications of GSG are many, most no-tably a very fast development of NLU components for a variety of tasks including speech recognition and NL interfaces. Also, the IDIGA environment enhances the usability of any system or application that incorporates it, for the end-users are able to easily \"teach the computer\" their individual language patterns and preferences.","Current and future work includes further development of the learning methods and their integration, design of a rule-merging mechanism, comparison of individual vs. collective grammars, distributed grammar development over the World Wide Web, and integration of GSG's run-time stage into the JANUS speech recognition system (Lavie et al. 1997)."]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["The work reported in this paper was funded in part by a grant from ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research Laboratories of Japan.","References","Kiyono, Masaki and Jun-ichi Tsujii. 1993. \"Linguistic knowledge acquisition from parsing failures.\" In Proceedings of the 6th Conference of the European Chapter of the A CL.
