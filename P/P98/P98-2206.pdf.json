The preliminary experiment shows that the segmentation accuracy of our algorithm is acceptable.

Introduction","paragraphs":["Any Chinese word is composed of either single or multiple characters. Chinese texts are explicitly concatenations of characters, words are not delimited by spaces as that in English. Chinese word segmentation is therefore the first step for any Chinese information processing system[ 1].","Almost all methods for Chinese word segmentation developed so far, both statistical and rule-based, exploited two kinds of important resources, i.e., lexicon and hand-crafted linguistic resources(manually segmented and tagged corpus, knowledge for unknown words, and linguistic This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 69433010. rules)[1,2,3,5,6,8,9,10]. Lexicon is usually used as the means for finding segmentation candidates for input sentences, while linguistic resources for solving segnaentation ambiguities. Preparation of these resources (well-defined lexicon, widely accepted tag set, consistent annotated corpus etc.) is very hard due to particularity of Chinese, and time consuming. Furthermore, even the lexicon is large enough, and the corpus annotated is balanced and huge in size, the word segmenter will still face the problem of data incompleteness, sparseness and bias as it is utilized in different domains.","An important issue in designing Chinese segmenters is thus how to reduce the effort of human supervision as much as possible. Palmer(1997) conducted a Chinese segrnenter which merely made use of a manually segmented corpus(without referring to any lexicon). A transformation-based algorithm was then explored to learn segmentation rules automatically from the segmented corpus. Sproat and Shih(1993) further proposed a method using neither lexicon nor segmented corpus: for input texts, simply grouping character pairs with high value of mutual information into words. Although this strategy is very simple and has many limitations(e.g., it can only treat bi-character words), the characteristic of it is that it is fully automatic -- the nmtual information between characters can be trained from raw Chinese corpus directly.","Following the line of Sproat and Shih, here we present a new algorithm for segmenting Chinese texts which depends upon neither lexicon nor any hand-crafted resource. All data necessary for our system is derived from the raw corpus. The system may be viewed as a stand-alone segmenter in some applications (preliminary experiments show that its 1265 accuracy is acceptable); nevertheless, our main purpose is to study how and how well the work can be done by machine at the extreme conditions, say, without any assistance of human. We believe the performance of the existing Chinese segmenters, that is, the ability to deal with segmentation ambiguities and unknown words as well as the ability to adapt to new domains, will be improved in some degree if the gaining of this approach is incorporated into systems properly."]},{"title":"2. Principle 2.1. Mutual information and difference of t-score between characters","paragraphs":["Mutual information and t-score, two important concepts in information theory and statistics, have been exploited to measure the degree of association between two words in an English corpus[4]. We adopt these measures almost completely here, with one major modification: the variables in two relevant formulae are no longer words but Chinese characters. Definition 1 Given a Chinese character string 'xy', the mutual information between characters x and 3,(or equally, the mutual information of the location between x and y) is defined as:","mi(x:y) = log 2 p(x,y)","p(x)p(y) where p(x,y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y, and p(x), p(y) are the independent probabilities of x and y respectively.","As claimed by Church(1991), the larger the mutual information between x and y, the higher the possibility of x and y being combined together.

To solve this problem, we need to seek other ways additionally. Definition 2 Given a Chinese character string 'xvz'. the t-score of the character y relevant to characters x and z is defined as:","p(zl y) - p(y[ x)","tSx\"(Y) = ~/var(p(zly)) + var(p(ylx)) where p(ylx) is the conditional probability of y given x, and p(zly), of z given y, and var(p(ylx)), var(p(zly)) are variances of p(ylx) and of p(zly) respectively.","Also as pointed out by Church( 1991), ts~, z (y) indicates the binding tendency of y in the context of x and z:","ifp(zly)> p(ylx), or ts~.z(y) > 0","then y tends to be bound with z rather","than with x","if p(ylx)> p(zly), or tsx, (y) < 0","then y tends to be bound with x rather","than with z","A distinct feature of ts is that it is context-dependent (a relative measure), along with certain degree of flexibility to the context, whereas mi is context-independent (an absolute measure). Its drawback is it attaches to a character rather than to the location between two adjacent characters. This may cause some inconvenience if we want to unify it with mi. We initially introduce a new measure dts instead of ts: Definition 3 Given a Chinese character string 'vxyw', the difference oft-score between characters x and y is defined as:","dts(x: y) = tSv.y (x) - tSx, w. (y) Now dts(x:y) is allocated to the location between x and y, just like mi(x:y). And the context of dts(x:y) becomes 4 characters, 1 character larger than that of tSx, z (y). The value of dts(x:y) reflects the competition results among four adjacent characters v, x, y and w:","(1) tsv,y(x) > 0 tsx,w(y ) < 0 (x tends to combine with y, and y tends to combine with x) ==> dts(x:y) > 0"]},{"title":"® ®","paragraphs":["In this case, x and y attract each other.
