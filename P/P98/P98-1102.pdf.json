Johnston et al (1997) model this integration using a unification opera-tion over typed feature structures. This is an effective solution for a broad class of systems, but limits multimodal utterances to combinations of a single spoken phrase with a single gesture. We show how the unification-based approach can be scaled up to provide a full multimodal grammar formalism. In conjunction with a multidimensional chart parser, this approach supports integration of multiple elements distributed across the spatial, temporal, and acoustic dimensions of multimodal interaction. Integration strategies are stated in a high level unification-based rule formalism supporting rapid prototyping and iterative development of multimodal systems."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Multimodal interfaces enable more natural and efficient interaction between humans and machines by providing multiple channels through which input or output may pass. Our concern here is with multimodal input, such as interfaces which support simultaneous input from speech and pen. Such interfaces have clear task performance and user preference advantages over speech only interfaces, in particular for spatial tasks such as those involving maps (Ovi-att 1996). Our focus here is on the integration of input from multiple modes and the role this plays in the segmentation and parsing of natural human input. In the examples given here, the modes are speech and pen, but the architecture described is more general in that it can support more than two input modes and modes of other types such as 3D gestural input.","Our multimodal interface technology is implemented in QuickSet (Cohen et al 1997), a work-ing system which supports dynamic interaction with maps and other complex visual displays. The initial applications of QuickSet are: setting up and interacting with distributed simulations (Courtemanche and Cercanowicz 1995), logistics planning, and navigation in virtual worlds. The system is distributed; consisting of a series of agents (Figure 1) which communicate through a shared blackboard (Cohen et al 1994). It runs on both desktop and handheld PCs, communicating over wired and wireless LANs. The user interacts with a map displayed on a wireless hand-held unit (Figure 2). Figure 1: Multimodal Architecture ~cm -~ ~ Figure 2: User Interface They can draw directly on the map and simultaneously issue spoken commands. Different kinds of entities, lines, and areas may be created by drawing the appropriate spatial features and speaking their type; for example, drawing an area and saying 'flood zone'. Orders may also be specified; for example, by drawing a line and saying 'helicopterfollow this route'. The speech signal is routed to an HMM-624 based continuous speaker-independent recognizer. The electronic 'ink' is routed to a neural net-based gesture recognizer (Pittman 1991). Both generate N-best lists of potential recognition results with associated probabilities. These results are assigned semantic interpretations by natural language processing and gesture interpretation agents respectively. A multimodal integrator agent fields input from the natural language and gesture interpretation agents and selects the appropriate multimodal or unimodal commands to execute. These are passed on to a bridge agent which provides an API to the underly-ing applications the system is used to control.","In the approach to multimodal integration proposed by Johnston et al 1997, integration of spoken and gestural input is driven by a unification opera-tion over typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992) representing the semantic contributions of the different modes. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous approaches in that it allows for a full range of gestura~ input beyond simple deictic point-ing gestures. Unlike speech-driven systems (Bolt 1980, Neal and Shapiro 1991, Koons et al 1993, Wauchope 1994), it is fully multimodal in that all elements of the content of a command can be in either mode. Furthermore, compared to related framemerging strategies (Vo and Wood 1996), it provides a well understood, generally applicable common meaning representation for the different modes and a formally well defined mechanism for multimodal integration. However, while this approach provides an efficient solution for a broad class of multimodal systems, there are significant limitations on the expressivity and generality of the approach.","A wide range of potential multimodal utterances fall outside the expressive potential of the previous architecture. Empirical studies of multimodal interaction (Oviatt 1996), utilizing wizard-of-oz techniques, have shown that when users are free to interact with any combination of speech and pen, a single spoken utterance maybe associated with more than one gesture. For example, a number of deictic point-ing gestures may be associated with a single spoken utterance: ' calculate distance from here to bere', 'put that there', 'move this team to here and prepare to rescue residents from this building'. Speech may also be combined with a series of gestures of different types: the user circles a vehicle on the map, says 'follow this route', and draws an arrow indicating the route to be followed.","In addition to more complex multipart multimodal utterances, unimodal gestural utterances may contain several component gestures which compose to yield a command. For example, to create an entity with a specific orientation, a user might draw the entity and then draw an arrow leading out from it (Figure 3 (a)). To specify a movement, the user might draw an arrow indicating the extent of the move and indicate departure and arrival times by writing expressions at the base and head (Figure 3 (b)). These"]},{"title":"I I z'°l","paragraphs":["Figure 3: Complex Unimodal Gestures are specific examples of the more general problem of visual parsing, which has been a focus of attention in research on visual programming and pen-based interfaces for the creation of complex graphical objects such as mathematical equations and flowcharts (Lakin 1986, Wittenburg et al 1991, Helm et al 1991, Crimi et al 1995).","The approach of Johnston et al 1997 also faces fundamental architectural problems. The multimodal integration strategy is hard-coded into the integration agent and there is no isolatable statement of the rules and constraints independent of the code itself. As the range of multimodal utterances supported is extended, it becomes essential that there be a declarative statement of the grammar of multimodal utterances, separate from the algorithms and mechanisms of parsing. This will enable system developers to describe integration strategies in a high level representation, facilitating rapid prototyping and iterative development of multimodal systems. 2","Parsing in Multidimensional Space The integrator in Johnston et al 1997 does in essence parse input, but the resulting structures can only be unary or binary trees one level deep; unimodal spoken or gestural commands and multimodal combinations consisting of a single spoken element and a single gesture. In order to account for a broader range of multimodal expressions, a more general parsing mechanism is needed.","Chart parsing methods have proven effective for parsing strings and are commonplace in natural language processing (Kay 1980). Chart parsing involves population of a triangular matrix of well-formed constituents: chart(i, j), where i and j are numbered vertices delimiting the start and end of the string. In its most basic formulation, chart parsing can be defined as follows, where . is an operator which combines two constituents in accordance with the rules of the grammar. chart(i, j) = U chart(i, k) * chart(k, j) i<k<j Crucially, this requires the combining constituents to be discrete and linearly ordered. However, multimodal input does not meet these requirements: 625 gestural input spans two (or three) spatial dimensions, there is an additional non-spatial acoustic dimension of speech, and both gesture and speech are distributed across the temporal dimension. Unlike words in a string, speech and gesture may overlap temporally, and there is no single dimension on which the input is linear and discrete. So then, how can we parse in this multidimensional space of speech and gesture? What is the rule for chart parsing in multi-dimensional space? Our formulation of multidimensional parsing for multimodal systems (multichart) is as follows. multichart(X) = U multichart(Y) * multichart(Z) where X = Y uz, Y nZ = O,Y ~ 0,2 ~ In place of numerical spans within a single dimension (e.g. chart(3,5)), edges in the multidimensional chart are identified by sets (e.g. multichart({[s, 4, 2], [g, 6, 1]})) containing the identifiers(IDs) of the terminal input elements they contain. When two edges combine, the ID of the resulting edge is the union of their IDs. One constraint that linearity enforced, which we can still maintain, is that a given piece of input can only be used once within a single parse. This is captured by a requirement of non-intersection between the ID sets associated with edges being combined. This requirement is especially important since a single piece of spoken or gestural input may have multiple interpretations available in the chart. To prevent multiple interpretations of a single signal being used, they are assigned IDs which are identical with respect to the the non-intersection constraint. The multichart statement enumerates all the possible combinations that need to be considered given a set of inputs whose IDs are contained in a set X.","The multidimensional parsing algorithm (Figure 4) runs bottom-up from the input elements, build-ing progressively larger constituents in accordance with the ruleset. An agenda is used to store edges to be processed. As a simplifying assumption, rules are assumed to be binary. It is straightforward to extend the approach to allow for non-binary rules using techniques from active chart parsing (Earley 1970), but this step is of limited value given the availability of multimodal subcategorization (Section 4).","while AGENDA ¢ [ ] do remove front edge from AGENDA and make it CURRENTEDGE for each EDGE, EDGE E CHART if CURRENTEDGE (1 EDGE =","find set NEWEDGES = U (","(U CURRENTEDGE * EDGE)","(U EDGE * CURRENTEDGE))","add NEWEDGES to end of AGENDA add CURRENTEDGE to CHART Figure 4: Multichart Parsing Algorithm","For use in a multimodal interface, the multidimensional parsing algorithm needs to be embedded into the integration agent in such a way that input can be processed incrementally. Each new input received is handled as follows. First, to avoid unnecessary computation, stale edges are removed from the chart. A timeout feature indicates the shelflife of an edge within the chart. Second, the interpretations of the new input are treated as terminal edges, placed on the agenda, and combined with edges in the chart in accordance with the algorithm above. Third, complete edges are identified and executed. Unlike the typical case in string parsing, the goal is not to find a single parse covering the whole chart; the chart may contain several complete nonoverlapping edges which can be executed. These are assigned to a category command as described in the next section. The complete edges are ranked with respect to probability. These probabilities are a function of the recognition probabilities of the elements which make up the comrrrand. The combination of probabilities is specified using declarative constraints, as described in the next section. The most probable complete edge is executed first, and all edges it intersects with are removed from the chart. The next most probable complete edge remaining is then executed and the procedure continues until there are no complete edges left in the chart. This means that selection of higher probability complete edges eliminates overlapping complete edges of lower probability from the list of edges to be executed. Lastly, the new chart is stored. In ongoing work, we are exploring the introduction of other factors to the selection process. For example, sets of disjoint complete edges which parse all of the terminal edges in the chart should likely be preferred over those that do not.","Under certain circumstances, an edge can be used more than once. This capability supports multiple creation of entities. For example, the user can utter 'multiple helicopters' point point point point in order to create a series of vehicles. This significantly speeds up the creation process and limits reliance on speech recognition. Multiple commands are persistent edges; they are not removed from the chart after they have participated in the formation of an executable command. They are assigned timeouts and are removed when their alloted time runs out. These 'self-destruct' timers are zeroed each time an-other entity is created, allowing creations to chain together. 3 Unification-based Multimodal Grammar"]},{"title":"Representation","paragraphs":["Our grammar representation for multimodal expressions draws on unification-based approaches to syntax and semantics (Shieber 1986) such as Head-626 driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987,1994).

The solution to this problem draws on the lexicalist treatment of complementation in HPSG. HPSG utilizes a sophisticated the-ory of subcategorization to account for the different complementation patterns that verbs and other lexical items require. Just as a verb subcategorizes for its complements, we can think of a lexical edge in the multimodal grammar as subcategorizing for the edges with which it needs to combine. For example, spoken inputs such as 'calculate distance from here to here' an d ' sandbag wall from here to here' (Figure 8) result in edges which subcategorize for two gestures. Their multimodal subcategorization is specified in a list valued subcat feature, implemented using a recursive first/rest feature structure (Shieber 1986:27-32).","\"eat : subcat.command \"fsTYPE : create.line \"l r fsTYPE : wall.obj]","content : object : ]style : sand.bag |","Lcolor : grey J","• rfsTYPE : line ] location .

Multimodal integration strategies are stated declaratively in a unification-based grammar formalism which is interpreted by an incremental multidimensional parser. We have shown how this architecture supports multimodal (pen/voice) interfaces to dynamic maps. It has been implemented and deployed as part of QuickSet (Cohen et al 1997) and operates in real time. A broad range of multimodal utterances are supported including combination of speech with multiple gestures and visual parsing of collections of gestures into complex unimodal commands. Combinatory information and constraints may be stated either in the lexical edges or in the rule schemata, allowing individual phenomena to be described in the way that best suits their nature. The architecture is sufficiently general to support other input modes and devices including 3D gestural input. The declarative statement of multimodal integration strategies enables rapid prototyping and iterative development of multimodal systems.","The system has undergone a form of pro-active evaluation in that its design is informed by detailed predictive modeling of how users interact multimodally, and incorporates the results of empirical studies of multimodal interaction (Oviatt 1996, Ovi-att et al 1997). It is currently undergoing extensive user testing and evaluation (McGee et al 1998).","Previous work on grammars and parsing for multidimensional languages has focused on two dimensional graphical expressions such as mathematical equations, flowcharts, and visual programming languages. Lakin (1986) lays out many of the initial issues in parsing for two-dimensional draw-ings and utilizes specialized parsers implemented in LISP to parse specific graphical languages. Helm et al (1991) employ a grammatical framework, constrained set grammars, in which constituent structure rules are augmented with spatial constraints. Visual language parsers are build by translation of these rules into a constraint logic programming language. Crimi et al (1991) utilize a similar relation grammar formalism in which a sentence consists of a multiset of objects and relations among them. Their rules are also augmented with constraints and parsing is provided by a prolog axiomatization. Wittenburg et al (1991) employ a unification-based grammar formalism augmented with functional constraints (F-PATR, Wittenburg 1993), and a bottom-up, incremental, Earley-style (Earley 1970) tabular parsing algorithm.","All of these approaches face significant difficulties in terms of computational complexity. At worst, an exponential number of combinations of the input elements need to be considered, and the parse table may be of exponential size (Wittenburg et al 1991:365). Efficiency concerns drive Helm et al (1991:111) to adopt a committed choice strategy under which successfully applied productions cannot be backtracked over and complex negative and quantificational constraints are used to limit rule application. Wittenburg et al's parsing mechanism is directed by expander relations in the grammar formalism which filter out inappropriate combinations before they are considered. Wittenburg (1996) addresses the complexity issue by adding top-down predictive information to the parsing process.","This work is fundamentally different from all of these approaches in that it focuses on multimodal systems, and this has significant implications in terms of computational viability. The task differs greatly from parsing of mathematical equations, flowcharts, and other complex graphical expressions in that the number of elements to be parsed is far smaller. Empirical investigation (Oviatt 1996, Ovi-att et al 1997) has shown that multimodal utterances rarely contain more than two or three elements. Each of those elements may have multiple interpretations, but the overall number of lexical edges remains sufficiently small to enable fast processing of all the potential combinations. Also, the intersection constraint on combining edges limits the impact of the multiple interpretations of each piece of input. The deployment of this architecture in an implemented system supporting real time spoken and gestural interaction with a dynamic map provides evidence of its computational viability for real tasks. Our approach is similar to Wittenburg et 629 al 1991 in its use of a unification-based grammar formalism augmented with functional constraints and a chart parser adapted for multidimensional spaces. Our approach differs in that, given the nature of the input, using spatial constraints and top-down predictive information to guide the parse is less of a concern, and as a result the parsing algorithm is significantly more straightforward and general.","The evolution of multimodal systems is follow-ing a trajectory which has parallels in the history of syntactic parsing. Initial approaches to multimodal integration were largely algorithmic in nature. The next stage is the formulation of declarative integration rules (phrase structure rules), then comes a shift from rules to representations (lexicalism, cat-egorial and unification-based grammars). The approach outlined here is at representational stage, al-though rule schemata are still used for constructional meaning. The next phase, which syntax is undergoing, is the compilation of rules and representations back into fast, low-powered finite state devices (Roche and Schabes 1997). At this early stage in the development of multimodal systems, we need a high degree of flexibility. In the future, once it is clearer what needs to be accounted for, the next step will be to explore compilation of multimodal grammars into lower power devices.","Our primary areas of future research include refinement of the probability combination scheme for multimodal utterances, exploration of alternative constraint solving strategies, multiple inheritance for rule schemata, maintenance of multimodal dialogue history, and experimentation with 3D input and other combinations of modes."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Bolt, R.
