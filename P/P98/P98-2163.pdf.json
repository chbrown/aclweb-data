In some cases, however, it is often hard to make clear argument for a relation being one rather than another.

We will see how such diversity of relations arise in the next section. 3 Organization of the Coherence Relations Although the semantic relations between the re-linked constituents are diverse, not all relations implicated by parataxis can be expressed by re-linkage (Hasegawa, 1996). For example, if the clauses equivalent to I sat down and The door opened are presented paratactically in Japanese, the interpreter naturally reads in a Temporal Sequence relation, just as in English. But this relation is not an available interpretation when the clauses are linked by re. That is, among the relations potentially implicated by two copresent clauses, some are filtered out by re-linkage.","We presume that the inherent meaning of te is \"togetherness.\" The only relations that fit with this meaning are possible to arise within re-linkage. The notion of \"togetherness\" can be divided into two categories according to the temporal properties of relations. One in parallel and the other in series. In the former, two events occur simultaneously or two","2 On the basis of a corpus of 3,330 multi-predicate sentences sampled from various types of text, Saeki (Saeki, 1975) reports a total of 26 connectives (1,047 tokens altogether), of which te holds the foremost rank: it occurs 512 times, while the second most frequent connective, 9a, occurs only 141 times. According to Inoue (Inoue, 1983), te appears most frequently in spontaneous speech (34.5% of all connectives) and in informal writing (27%). In formal writing such as newspaper editorials, te ranks second (17.2%) after ren'yoo linkage (36.9%). The actual occurrence of te is much more frequent than these numbers suggest, because these data do not include cases in which the second predicate is a so-called auxiliary. states hold at the same time, while in the latter, two events occur successively.","These two categories are further divided into smaller categories according to the event structures of conjuncts. The category of sequential relations contains both Cause-Effect and Temporal Sequence. When two events which are linked solely by temporal sequentiality are expressed via te-linkage, the conjuncts must share an agentive subject. Thus, causa-tion and one person's volitional acts are sufficient to be recognized as togetherness.","On the other hand, in order for the category of parallel occurrence of events to be compatible with re-linkage, they must be homogeneous in some sense. One such example is the case where a thing has two different properties (Additive) and another is the cases where two different things have similar properties or are engaged in similar events (Contrast). As for the Additive relation, the subject of the second conjunct is often omitted since it is the same as that of the first. In addition, both predicates of the conjuncts are stative -- adjectives or stative verbs -- because they have no temporal boundaries as opposed to events and can easily hold at the same time within one person. As for the Contrast relation, the subjects of the conjuncts must be different from each other and hence both of them are explicitly mentioned (often marked with the contrastive wa). In general, the similarities of the predicates appear as the syntactic parallelism as the example (6) shows.","The other sub-category of the parallel occurrence of events is \"accompaniment,\" where the second clause is foregrounded and the first backgrounded. The prototypical instance of this category is the case where the first clause denotes a state and the second an event, since we have a tendency to focus on a changing event rather than stable state. Thus, the Circumstance relation composes this category. The cases where the first clause denotes some manner of event are also contained in this category, since a manner accompanies an event.","The notion of the manner is continuous to the means since the means and manner of an event are often coextensive in that the means of an event often determines the manner of the event. This is exemplified by English with as well as Japanese de, which are used both as an instrumental or means marker and as a marker of manner (How is similarly polysemous) (Goldberg, 1996).","The Means-End relation is also continuous to causation, since the means can be interpreted as a kind of causation. This is exemplified by Japanese doosite (why/ ow) as follows:","(18) doo-site kitano? \"Why/How did you come?\" Answer:"]},{"title":"(18a)","paragraphs":["densya-de"]},{"title":"(means)","paragraphs":["\"by train\" (18b) aitakatta-kara (reason) 991 \"since (I) want to meet (you)\" (18b) expresses the reason why the speaker came to the hearer -- \"the wish to meet the hearer caused him/her to come.\" Thus, this relation associates the two extremes i.e., parallelism and sequentiality.","Finally, the Concession is closely related to both Cause and Contrast. In the Concession relation, the first clause implies something and the second clause denys it. The implied states or events are often those to be caused by the events or states denoted by the first clause, and then denied and contrast with the second clause.","The whole organization is shown in Figure 1.

The different or-ganizations may emerge via the other linkages. 4 Recognizing the Coherence Relations 4.1 Overview Theoretically, it is more likely that when we have heard/read the first clause and te, we narrow down the possible relations by inferring the content of the second clause. For example, if the first clause denotes an action, we will infer what is caused by the action or another action which may follow the action -- that is, Cause or Temporal Sequence will be expected. On the other hand, if the first clause denotes a state, Circumstance or Additive will be expected. In practice, however, we have both clauses at hand. Therefore, we adopt the following algorithm: STEP1 Assume part of semantic structures of the","conjuncts by reverse linking STEP2 Unify them with a verb's semantic struc-","tures STEP3 Infer the most feasible relation between","them","In STEP1, part of the semantic structure of each clause is abductively assumed by applying linking rules backward.

In the case of Japanese, they are triggered by case particles. In STEP2, the verb's semantic structures are invoked and unified with the outputs of STEP1. The examples of the linking rules and verbs' semantic structures are shown in Figure 2 and 3 respectively.","However, since the real texts contain far more complexity and ambiguity than the examples given in this paper, we have to correct the outputs of the processes manually (the gapped arguments are filled by hand). We now focus on the processes that calculate the coherence relations. 4.2 The Properties Relevant to the","Coherence Relations What is essential for recognizing the coherence relation between clauses is that the constituents of one clause bear certain kind of structural relationship to those of the other. Although there are an infinite number of situations, there seems to be only a small number of properties relevant to the coherence relations that can hold between them. They are:","1) the identity and agentivity of the subjects in","the two clauses 2) the thematic and aspectual properties of the","event denoted by each clause 3) canonical events associated with the noun that","is relevant to both clauses","Before going through the use of these properties, let's consider the other information which affects our construal of the relations.","There are some adverbials or fixed expressions which coerce the interpretation into the specific relation. In addition, there are narrow-range verb classes which specialize the implicated relation by virtue of their inherent meaning. For example, Table 1: The expressions that specialize the relations verbs that take a temporal NP as the subject and means \"the passage of time\" such as"]},{"title":"sugiru(pass away), tatu(go by), keikasuru(elapse),","paragraphs":["etc., imply the Temporal Sequence relation when followed by"]},{"title":"te.","paragraphs":["Verbs that express \"using\" such as"]},{"title":"tukau(use}, siy- ousuru(make use of), katuyousuru(apply),","paragraphs":["etc., imply the Means-End relation.

In Table 1,"]},{"title":"[TE]","paragraphs":["means temporal expressions such as days, months, years, centuries, etc. The verbs and fixed expressions appear in the first clause, while the adverbials in the second. These fixed expressions should be listed as a unit in the lexicon.","When these expressions appear in the test sentences, we can identify the relation regardless of the procedure described below. Otherwise, we have recourse to the aforementioned properties. 4.3 The Prototypes and"]},{"title":"the Extensions","paragraphs":["In the previous study, We have classified verbs into 30 semantic categories, and for each category we have given a lexical conceptual structure (LCS) representation (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997). Since the LCS representation involves lexical decomposition (Jackendoff, 1990), we can utilize the verb internal semantic structure so as to calculate coherence relations in a farely principled way.","As mentioned in the introduction, we consider each relation as a category. Categories cannot be defined in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, but rather each instance is categorized according to its similarity to the prototypes of the categories (Rosch, 1973; Lakoff, 1987; Taylor, 1989).","We define a prototypical structure for each relation by means of the predicates used in the LCSs as follows:","• Circumstance [x ACT]2 WITH [x BE z]x • Additive"]},{"title":"[x BE zx]x AND [x BE z212","paragraphs":["• Temporal Sequence [x GO TO zx]l THEN [x GO (FROM zx) TO z2]~ relations Temporal Sequence Means-End Cause-Effect Circumstance ] categories passage verbs ending verbs continuing verbs adverbials fixed expressions using verbs fixed expressions fixed expressions static relation verbs examples"]},{"title":"sugiru(pass away), keikasuru(elapse) ... owa u(end), oeru( ni h)... tuzuku(continue), hikituzuku(follow) ... sonogo(after that}, imadeha(nowadays} ...

We use the infix notation for each function rather than prefix. The square brackets identify the semantic structure of a clause and their subscripts denotes the surface ordering of the clauses linked by re. ACT, BE, GO, and BECOME are also functions and they correspond to actions, states, movement, and inchoatives respectively. They express broad-range classes of the events which are constructed by the previous steps (see Figure 3). The whole structures incorporate the identity between the subjects of two clauses by the variables x and y. Agentivity of each subject is implied by the types of the events: ACT > GO > BECOME > BE.","Often, these prototypical structures are lexicalized and expressed by a single clause. For example, the Cause-Effect relation is lexicalized into accomplishment verbs (Talmy, 1985) and the Means-End relation can be expressed by an adjunct event noun followed by the case particle de. They must be extended so that they can cover wider range of instances of re-linkage. The result of the extension is shown in Table 2 (for cases each of which shares a subject) and Table 3 (for cases each of which has distinct subjects), where each column corresponds to the type of the event in the first clause and each row to the second. The prototypes are boldfaced and they are extended to the other boxes with some directions and constraints.","For example, the Temporal Sequence relation has a prototype structure, which is roughly read as \"someone goes to somewhere,"]},{"title":"and then","paragraphs":["he/she goes (from there) to elsewhere.\" This expresses our common sense that one person cannot move along two different paths at the same time, which implys that the two movements by a person must be sequential.

They should be resolved by using the third property -- the canonical events associated with the noun that is relevant to both clauses. The generative lexicon will serve the purpose (Pustejovsky, 1995). At present, however, we have not yet fully implemented the lexicon for nouns. Therefore, we give the Circumstance relation as a default. 5 Experiment and Discussion An experiment of recognizing coherence relations of te-linkage were done for 280 sentences which were randomly extracted from EDR Corpus (EDR, 1995). The analysis results are shown in Table 4, where the coherence relations in the sentences were classified into 7 categories by authors and compared with the outputs of the program.","The relations are not balanced in number. This seems to be due to the genre of texts from which the test sentences were picked up (most of them were news articles).

There were many examples which were difficult even for humans to make clear judgements. This reflects the fact that the coherence relations do not have definite borders.","However, there were some errors which show a crucial limitation of our method. This appears as the bad marks in both precision and recall for the Concession relation, even though the number is small. For example, there is a test sentence such as follows:","(19) ano hito-wa 82sai-ni natte, annani koukisin ippal-da. that person-TOP 82-years-old-DAT become-te, so curiosity be-full-PRES \"Although that person is 82 years old, (he/she) is full of curiosity.\" Table 4: The results of the experiment coherence relations"]},{"title":"Temporal Sequence Circumstance","paragraphs":["Cause-Effect Means-End"]},{"title":"Additive","paragraphs":["Concession Contrast Total","judgement","by human(a) 89 75 64 45 3 3 280 output of","program(b) 81/46) 83(22)"]},{"title":"58(13/","paragraphs":["48(12) 3","2 280(92)","number of","agreements(c) recall(%)","c/a×lO0 precision(%)","c/b x 100","79 89 98","63 84 76","48 75 82","34 76 71","3 100 100","33","i00","82 229 20","50","82 995","Since the combination of the event type here is I(BECOME,BE), our program gave it the Circumstance relation as a default. However, we know that in general the person who is 82 years old is not so curious, therefore the Concession relation arises. Thus, our common sense knowledge is crucial to our recognition of the coherence relations. In (Hovy and Maier, 1993), they classified the Concession relation as interpersonal (i.e., author-and/or addresseerelated) rather than ideational (i.e., semantic), since they defined it as \"one of the text segments raises expectations which are contradicted/violated by the other.\" The use of interpersonal relations is predicated mainly on the interests, beliefs, and attitudes of addressee and/or author. To deal with this problem, we must incorporate the notion of intentional structure and focus space structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).","Since we have focused on te-linkage in this paper, we need not to consider how clauses are combined. However, to detect the discourse structure, we need to extend the method so as to deal with the relations between sentences. We must estimate some kind of reliable scores among possible segments and choose the relation having the maximum score (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). These issues remain to be studied in the future."]},{"title":"6 Summary","paragraphs":["Since the semantic relations exhibited by re-linkage vary so diversely, it has been claimed that the interpreter must infer the intended relationship on the basis of extralinguistic knowledge. The particulars of individual common sense knowledge are crucial to understanding any discourse (Hobbs et al., 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 1995). Nevertheless, one can, through the use of the relevant structures of events, eliminate a very large number of rules for calculating the plausible relations.","Although we have concentrated on re-linkage in this paper, we consider that the method can be applied to pure parataxis with necessary modifications. For the relations we have examined are not attributable to the meaning of te itself (though it restricts the range of them), but are implicated by the linked conjuncts. The same is true of English and. In both and- and re-linkage, the perceived coherence relations are present even if the linked constitutes are in pure parataxis without and or re. Thus, this approach can be extended so as to detect the whole discourse structure, though further study must be done to examine all relations."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["N. Asher and A.
