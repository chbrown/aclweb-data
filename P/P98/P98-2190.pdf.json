This cross-derivational power arises naturally from comparison of various derivational paths, each of which is a product of the probabilities associated with each step in each derivation. A common approach used to assign structure to language is to use a probabilistic grammar where each elementary rule * This research was partially supported by NSF grant SBR8920230 and ARO grant DAAH0404-94-G-0426.

Using such a grammar, a probability for each string in the language is computed.

This paper derives the conditions under which a given probabilistic TAG can be shown to be consistent.","TAGs are important in the modelling of natural language since they can be easily lexicalized; moreover the trees associated with words can be used to encode argument and adjunct relations in various syntactic environments. This paper assumes some familiarity with the TAG formalism. (Joshi, 1988) and (Joshi and Schabes, 1992) are good introductions to the formalism and its linguistic relevance. TAGs have 1164 been shown to have relations with both phrase-structure grammars and dependency grammars (Rambow and Joshi, 1995) and can handle (non-projective) long distance dependencies.","Consistency of probabilistic TAGs has practical significance for the following reasons:","• The conditions derived here can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked for deficiency.","• Existing EM based estimation algorithms for probabilistic TAGs assume that the property of consistency holds (Schabes, 1992). EM based algorithms begin with an initial (usually random) value for each parameter. If the initial assignment causes the grammar to be inconsistent, then it-erative re-estimation might converge to an inconsistent grammar 1.","• Techniques used in this paper can be used to determine consistency for other probability models based on TAGs (Carroll and Weir, 1997). 2","Notation In this section we establish some notational conventions and definitions that we use in this paper. Those familiar with the TAG formalism only need to give a cursory glance through this section.","A probabilistic TAG is represented by (N, E, 2:, A, S, ¢) where N, E are, respectively, non-terminal and terminal symbols. 2: U ,4 is a set of trees termed as elementary trees. We take V to be the set of all nodes in all the elementary trees. For each leaf A E V, label(A) is an element from E U {e}, and for each other node A, label(A) is an element from N. S is an element from N which is a distinguished start symbol. The root node A of every initial tree which can start a derivation must have label(A) = S.","2: axe termed initial trees and ,4 are auxiliary trees which can rewrite a tree node A E V. This rewrite step is called adjunction. ¢ is a function which assigns each adjunction with a probability and denotes the set of parameters","1Note that for CFGs it has been shown in (Chaudhari et al., 1983; S~nchez and Bened~, 1997) that inside-outside reestimation can be used to avoid inconsistency. We will show later in the paper that the method used to show consistency in this paper precludes a straightforward extension of that result for TAGs. in the model. In practice, TAGs also allow a leaf nodes A such that label(A) is an element from N. Such nodes A are rewritten with initial trees from I using the rewrite step called substitution. Except in one special case, we will not need to treat substitution as being distinct from adjunction.","For t E 2: U .4, 4̀(t) are the nodes in tree t that can be modified by adjunction. For label(A) E N we denote Adj(label(A)) as the set of trees that can adjoin at node A E V. The adjunction of t into N E V is denoted by N ~-~ t. No adjunction at N E V is denoted by N ~ nil. We assume the following proper-ties hold for every probabilistic TAG G that we consider: 1. G is lexicalized. There is at least one leaf node a that lexicalizes each elementary tree, i.e. a E E. 2. G is proper. For each N E V,","¢(g ~-~ nil) + ~ ¢(g ~-+ t) = 1 t . . Adjunction is prohibited on the foot node of every auxiliary tree. This condition is imposed to avoid unnecessary ambiguity and can be easily relaxed. There is a distinguished non-lexicalized initial tree T such that each initial tree rooted by a node A with label(A) = S substitutes into T to complete the derivation. This ensures that probabilities assigned to the in-put string at the start of the derivation are well-formed.","We use symbols S, A, B,... to range over V, symbols a,b,c,.., to range over E. We use tl,t2,.., to range over I U A and e to denote the empty string. We use Xi to range over all i nodes in the grammar. 3 Applying probability measures to Tree Adjoining Languages To gain some intuition about probability assign-ments to languages, let us take for example, a language well known to be a tree adjoining language: L(G) = {anbncndnln > 1} 1165","It seems that we should be able to use a function ¢ to assign any probability distribution to the strings in"]},{"title":"L(G)","paragraphs":["and then expect that we can assign appropriate probabilites to the adjunctions in G such that the language generated by G has the same distribution as that given by ¢.

As shown above, a probabilistic language can fail to have a generating probabilistic TAG.","The reverse is also true: some probabilistic TAGs, like some CFGs, fail to have a corresponding probabilistic language, i.e. they are not consistent. There are two reasons why a probabilistic TAG could be inconsistent: \"dirty\" grammars, and destructive or incorrect probability assignments.","\"Dirty\" grammars. Usually, when applied to language, TAGs are lexicalized and so probabilities assigned to trees are used only when the words anchoring the trees are used in a derivation. However, if the TAG allows non-lexicalized trees, or more precisely, auxiliary trees with no yield, then looping adjunctions which never generate a string are possible. However, this can be detected and corrected by a simple search over the grammar.

A formal justification for this claim is given in the next section by showing a reduction of the TAG derivation process to a multitype Galton-Watson branching process (Harris, 1963). Theorem 4.1 A probabilistic grammar is consistent if the spectral radius p(A4) < 1, where ,h,4 is the stochastic expectation matrix computed from the grammar. (Booth and Thompson, 1973; Soule, 1974)","This theorem provides a way to determine whether a grammar is consistent. All we need to do is compute the spectral radius of the square matrix A4 which is equal to the modulus of the largest eigenvalue of . If this value is less than one then the grammar is consistent 4. Computing consistency can bypass the computation of the eigenvalues for A4 by using the following theorem by Ger~gorin (see (Horn and Johnson, 1985; Wetherell, 1980)). Theorem 4.2 For any square matrix .h4, p(.M) < 1 if and only if there is an n > 1 such that the sum of the absolute values of the elements of each row of .M n is less than one. Moreover, any n' > n also has this property. (GerSgorin, see (Horn and Johnson, 1985; Wetherell, 1980))","4The grammar may be consistent when the spectral radius is exactly one, but this case involves many special considerations and is not considered in this paper. In practice, these complicated tests are probably not worth the effort. See (Harris, 1963) for details on how this special case can be solved. 1167","This makes for a very simple algorithm to check consistency of a grammar. We sum the values of the elements of each row of the stochastic expectation matrix A4 computed from the grammar. If any of the row sums are greater than one then we compute A42, repeat the test and compute :~422 if the test fails, and so on until the test succeeds 5. The algorithm does not halt ifp(A4) _> 1. In practice, such an algorithm works better in the average case since computation of eigenvalues is more expensive for very large matrices. An upper bound can be set on the number of iterations in this algorithm. Once the bound is passed, the exact eigenvalues can be computed.","For the grammar in (5) we computed the following stochastic expectation matrix: 0 0.8 0.8 0 0.2 0.2 A4= 0 0 0 0 0.4 0.4 0 0 0 The first row sum is 2.4. 0.8 0 0.2 0 0 0.2","0.4 0 0 0.1 Since the sum of each row must be less than one, we compute the power matrix ,~v/2.

There is an initial set of objects in the 0-th generation which produces with some probability a first generation which in turn with some probability generates a second, and so on. We will denote by vectors Z0, Z1, Z2,... the 0-th, first, second, ... generations. There are two assumptions made about Z0, Z1, Z2,...: . The size of the n-th generation does not influence the probability with which any of the objects in the (n + 1)-th generation is produced. In other words, Z0, Z1,Z2,... form a Markov chain. . The number of objects born to a parent object does not depend on how many other objects are present at the same level.","We can associate a generating function for each level Zi. The value for the vector Zn is the value assigned by the n-th iterate of this generating function. The expectation matrix A4 is defined using this generating function.","The theorem attributed to Galton and Watson specifies the conditions for the probability of extinction of a family starting from its 0-th generation, assuming the branching process represents a family tree (i.e, respecting the conditions outlined above).
