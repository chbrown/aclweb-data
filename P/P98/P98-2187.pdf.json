The GL is based (1) on the close cooperation of three lexical semantic structures: the argument structure, the aspectual structure and the Qualia structure (with four roles: Telic, Agentive, Constitutive and Formal), (2) on a detailed type theory and a type coercion inference rule and (3) on a refined theory of compositionality. The Generative Lexicon investigates the problem of polysemy and of the multiplicity of usages from a core sense of a lexeme and shows how these usages can be analyzed in terms of possible type shiftings w.r.t, the type expected by the core usage. Type shifting is modelled by a specific inference mechanism: type coercion.","In this paper, the following points are addressed:","• Generative systems require a clear analysis of the notions of word-sense and of sense delimita-tion. Depending on the strategy adopted (e.g. large number of narrow senses for a lexeme as in WordNet, or very few but large senses as in many Al works), the nature and the scope of generative operations may be very different.","• The Qualia structure is a complex structure, quite difficult to describe, in spite of evidence of its existence, in particular for the Telic role, (explored e.g. in the EuroWordNet project, the European WordNet). Qualias are well-designed and useful for nouns, but look more artificial for other lexical categories. We show that it is the telic role of nouns which is the most useful. We also show how the internal structure of this role can be made more precise and its use more reliable and accurate by means of types and how it can be partitioned by means of types into ontological domains for modelling some forms of metaphors.","• Types are not sufficiently 'constrained' to account for the constraints holding, for each predicate, on the different sense/usage variations they may be subject to. We show that an underspecified Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) (Jackendoff 90) is more appropriate because of its ability to represent underspecified meaning and therefore the polymorphism of senses in the GL, because of the relevance and low-granularity of its primitives (that we have slightly enhanced).","• Elements of the Qualia structure can be incorporated into semantic composition rules to make explicit the semantics of the combination predicate-argument, instead of developing lexical redundancy rules.","• A rule-based approach (also used by other authors such as (Copestake and Briscoe 95), (Ostler and Atkins 92), (Numberg and Zaenen 79)) is contrasted with the Qualia-based approach to deal with sense shiftings and in particular selective binding, metaphors (that the GL cannot resolve a priori) and metonymies.

The goal is to study the use and impact of the Qualia structure of the modified noun in the determination of the semantic representation of the association Noun + Adjective.","To illustrate this study, we have chosen one of the most polysemic French adjectives: bon (good), which covers most of the main situations. Other adjectives, often cited in the GL literature, such as ~ad, fast, difficult or noisy have been studied and confirm this analysis. We observed also many similarities within semantic families of adjectives. 2 Conceptual versus Lexicographic Analysis of Lexical Items In this section, we outline the differences but also the cooperation between conceptual and lexicographic analysis of the semantics of lexical items to build a lexicon suitable for the development of generative devices. 2.1 Adjectives in technical texts We have considered a sample of technical texts in French from various origins and used a simple tagging and extraction system developed for our needs. We have considered a total of 386 pages of text, with a total of 193 146 word occurences, among which, we have 14 598 occurences of adjectives. These occurences correspond to 754 different adjectives, among which 720 are restrictive adjectives. We will only consider this latter set. A small number of adjectives appear frequently:","Fig. 1 Adjective frequencies interval nb. of adjectives concerned > 300 5 > 300 and --< 150 12 > 150 and --< 50 81","This means that 98 adjectives appear relatively frequently in texts, i.e. only about 13.6% of the total. In terms of occurences, these adjectives cover 11887 occurences, i.e. about 81% of the occurences. Adjectives from eight main 'semantic' families appear frequently. These families do not correspond exactly to those defined by (Dixon 91) (see also an introduction in (Raskin et al. 95)), which look too vague (figures have been rounded up or down to the closest integer):","Fig. 2 Adjective semantic families Name example freq. (%) temporal actuel, pass6 10 evaluative bon, grand, cher 24 locational central, externe 10 aspectual courant, final 8 technical chimique 17 nationalities international 3 shapes rond, rectangulaire 4","society, culture economique, social 6 others 18","In terms of 'polysemic power', evaluative, locational, and shapes are the families which are the most polysemic, with a ratio of an average of 3.8 senses per adjective. Nationalities, technical and aspectual adjectives are much less polysemic. 2.2 A conceptual analysis of adjectives The GL approach requires a conceptual analysis of adjectives in order to focus oil a relatively small number of senses. The idea is to isolate generic conceptual 'behaviors', while taking also into account the constraints on linguistic realizations as in the lexicographic approach.","The principle that we attempt at validating is to define a 'deep' LCS representation for each predicative lexical item, which is generic enough to accomodate variations within a sense and precise enough to be meaningful and discriminatory w.r.t, other word-senses. To be able to represent sense variations in an efficient and reliable way, the variable or underspecified elements should be 'low level' elements such as functions or paths. Semantic fields may also be altered, e.g. going from location to psychological or to epistemological (Pinker 93). Such an approach is being validated on various semantic families of verbs.","The variable elements seem to belong to various ontologies (a crucial topic under intense investiga-tion), such as the ontology of events (active, sleeping, terminated, etc.), of people's quilities, etc. 2.3 Meanings of bon In this short document, for the purpose of illustration, let us consider the adjective bon (corresponding quite well to good), which is one of the most polysemic adjective: 25 senses identified in WordNet (e.g. (Fellbaum 93)). In fact, bon can be combined with almost any noun in French, and as (Katz 66) pointed out, 9ood would need as many different read° ings as there are functions for objects.","We have identified the following senses and sense variations (metaphors and metonymies in particular, expressed as in (Lakoff 80)):","1.

We have compared manually a subset of 54 adjectives among the above mentioned frequently used adjectives. Among these adjectives, 30 are polysenfic in our approach while 44 belong to several synsets in WordNet: Fig. 3 A comparison with WordNet ] criterion (1) (2) total number of senses found 114 256 average nb. of senses/item 2.11 4.9","(1): Conceptual approach, (2) WordNet 1.6. 22 of our descriptions are close to WordNet (for adjectives which are not much polysemic) while 32 differ 1145 largely (for highly polysemic adjectives), for which our approach identifies much less senses. 2.5 Underspecificatlon versus polysemy Each of the senses of bon has many facets and interpretations depending on the noun it modifies. As for verbs or nouns (Busa 97), polymorphic types are used to represent the semantics of the expected nouns, viewed as arguments of the adjective predicate. The semantic representation associated with a sense is therefore underspecified and tuned to reflect this polymorphism. The scope of underspecified elements must however be bounded and precisely defined by 'lexical' types and by additional constraints. The generative expansion of underspecified fields can be defined from lexical items using a fix-point semantics approach (Saint-Dizier 96). 2.6 Towards an automatic acquisition of","conceptual descriptions Some on-line resources and dictionaries may efficiently contribute to this task. We have considered several mono- and bi-lingual dictionaries in order to evaluate convergences. Only those structured on a conceptual basis are worth considering. Among them, the Harrap's German-French dictionary is very nicely structured in a conceptual perspective, providing translations on an accurate semantic basis. Senses are slightly more expanded than in the GL approach to account for translation variations, but closely related senses can be grouped to form the senses defined above.","Another source of knowledge for English is Corelex 4 which is just being made accessible. It contains word definitions specifically designed for the GL. Its evaluation is about to start. 3 Generative","Devices and Semantic Composition Let us now analyze from a GL point of view the meanings of the adjective bon.","In (Pustejovsky 95), to deal with the compound adjective+noun, a predicate in the telic of the noun is considered. For example, fast, modifying a noun such as typist, is represented as follows: Ae [type'(e,x) A fast(e)] where e denotes an event. This formula says that the event of typing is fa~t. A similar representation is given for long, in a long record. This approach is appropriate to represent temporal notions in a coarsegrained way, i.e. the event is said to be fast (with e.g. potential inferences on its expected duration) or long. But this approach is not viable for both, and many other adjectives with little or no temporal dimension. In:","4 available at: www.cs.brandeis.edu/paulb/CoreLex/corelex.|atnd )~e [type'(e, x) A good(e)] it is not the typing event which is 'good' but the way the typing has been performed (certainly fast, but also with no typos, good layout, etc.). A precise event should not be considered in isolation, but the representation should express that, in general, someone types well, allowing exceptions (some average or bad typing events). This involves a quantification, more or less explicit, over typing events of x. Finally, bon being polysemous, a single representation is not sufficient to accomodate all the senses.","As introduced in section 1, the semantic representation framework we consider here is the LCS. The nature of its primitives and its low-level granularity seem to be appropriate for our current purpose. Underdetermined structures are represented by a typed ,k-calculus. 3.1 sense 1: Bon = that works well This first sense applies to any noun of type tool, machine or technique: a good car, a good screwdriver. The semantic representation of bon requires a predicate from the telic role of the Qualia structure of the noun. It is the set (potentially infinite) of those predicates that characterizes the polymor= phism. We have here a typical situation of selective binding (Pustejovsky 91), where the representation of the adjective is a priori largely underspecified. Let us assume that any noun which can be modified by bon has a telic role in which the main function(s) of the object is described (e.g. execute programmes for a computer, run for a car 5), then the semantics of the compound adjective + noun can be defined as follows: Let N be a noun of semantic type a., and of Qualia: [..., Telic: T, ...] where T denotes the set of predicates associated with the telic role of the noun N. Let Y the variable associated with N and let us assume that T is a list of predicates of the form Fi(_,-). Then the LCS-based representation of bon is: A Y : a, )~ Fi, [~tate BE+cm, r,+,dent([thin9 Y ],","[+p~op ABILITY - TO(Fi(Y, _)) = high ])] . which means that the entity denoted by the noun works well, expressed by the evaluation function ABILITY-TO and the value 'high'. This type of low-level function abounds in the LCS, this principle is introduced in (Jackendoff 97). Note that tile second argument of the predicate Fi does not need to be explicit (we use the Prolog notation '_' for these positions).","The Qualia allows us to introduce in a direct way a pragmatic or interpretative dimension via the instanciation of Fi (_, _).","5Less prototypical predicates can also be considered, e.g. comfort or security for a car, which are properties probably described in the constitutive role of the Qualia of car. 1146","The constant 'high' can be replaced by a more accurate representation, e.g. 'above average', but the problem of evaluating a functionality remains open. More generally, the introduction of low level functions, such as ABILITY-TO, and specific values, such as 'low', should be introduced in a principled way, following the definition of ontologies of different domains, e.g. action, intensities, etc. This is quite challenging, but necessary for any accurate semantic framework.","Note finally that instead of quantifying over events, bon is described as a state: the functionalities of the object remain good, even when it is not used effectively. If several functionalities are at stake, we may have a conjunction or a more complex combination of functions Fi.","From a compositional point of view, the combination Adjective + Noun is treated as follows, where R is the semantic representation of the adjective, T, the contents of the telic role of the Qualia of the noun N of type o, r, a particular element of T, and Y, the variable associated with the noun: sem-composition (Adj (R),Noun (Qualia(T)) =",")~Y : c~, 3F/(Y, _) E T, (N(Y) A R(Y)(Fi(Y,_))).","The open position in R(Y) is instanciated by ~3-reduction. The selection of Fi is simple: for basic tools, there is probably only one predicate in the Qualia (screw-driver -+ screw), for more complex nouns, there is a,, ambiguity which is reflected by the non-deterruilfistic choice of Fi, but probably or-ganized with preferences, which should be added in the Qualia. [t is the constraint on the type of Y that restricts the application of that semantic composition rule. This notation is particularly simple and convenient.","Metaphors are treated in a direct way: the constraint on the type of Y can be enlarged to: )~Y : ~ A o' , metaphor(13, ~) and the remainder of the semantic composition rule and semantic formula remains unchanged. We have, for example: metaphor(communication - act, tool) (joke). metaphor(communication - path, tool) (road). which is paraphrased as 'communication path viewed as a tool'.","We have evaluated that, in French, there are about 12 frequent forms of metaphors for this sense. The study of this first sense suggests that the introduction of a hierarchy of preferences would be a useful extension to the Telic role, reflecting forms of prototypicality among predicates. 3.2 Sense 2: Bon restricted to cognitive or moral qualities Another seuse o[' bon modifies nouns of type profession or human. The treatment is the same as in the above section, but the selection of the predicate(s) r = Fi(X,Y) in the telic of the noun's qualia must be restricted to properties related to the moral behavior (makes-charity, has-compassion, has-integrity) when the noun is a person; and to some psychological attitudes and cognitive capabilities when the noun denotes a profession (e.g. a good composer). Alternatively, some of these properties could be found in the constitutive role (approximately the part-of relation), if properties can be parts of entities.","The typing of the predicates in the Qualia roles can be done in two ways, (1) by means of labels identifying the different facets of a role, as in (Bergler 91) for report verbs, but these facets are often quite ad'hoc and hard to define, or (2) by means of types directly associated with each predicate. These types can, for example, directly reflect different verb semantic classes as those defined in (Levin 93) or (Saint-Dizier 96) on a syntactic basis, or the major ontological classes of WordNet or EuroWordNet and their respective subdivisions. This solution is preferable, since it does not involve ally additional development of the Telic role, but simply the adjunc-tion of types from a separate, pre-defined ontology. The WordNet or EuroWordNet types also seem to be quite easy to handle and well-adapted to the phenomena we model. This remains to be validated on a large scale.","An LCS representation for this sense of bon is, as-suming the following types for Fi: )~ Y : human, F, : action - related- to-profession v moral - behavior, Y : a. [..,a,¢ BE+char,+ia~,,([,h,,,9 Y ], [+prop ABILITY - TO{F~(Y, _)) = high ])] .","When several predicates are at stake, a set of Fi(Y,-) can be considered in the representation, or the statement is ambiguous.","Metonymies such as a good scalpel are resolved by the general rule: 'tools for professions'. This information could be in a knowledge base or, alternatively, it can be infered from the Telic role of the tool: any instrument has a predicate in its telic role that describes its use: the type of the first argument of the predicate is directly related to the profession that uses it. For example, scalpel has ill its telic role: cut(X : surgeon V biologist, Y : body). When the profession is identified, the standard procedure for determining the meaning of the compound can be applied. Metonymies using the part-of relation are quite simple to resolve using the constitutive role, as in the GL. 3.3 Sense 3: Bon as all intensifier Another main role of bon is to emphasize a quality of the object denoted by the noun. As shown in section 2, there is a certain action associated with the telic of the modified noun that produces a certain pleasure. 1147 For example, watching a good film entails a certain pleasure.","Let us consider again a noun N of type a (e.g. edible object) associated with the variable Y. The entity (human) undergoing the pleasure is not explicit in the NP, it is represented by X, and included in the scope of a A-abstraction. Let Fi(X, Y) be the predicate selected in the telic role of N. The LCS representation is then: AX : human, Y: a, Fi(X,Y) [e,~¢,u CAUSE([ .... , F,(X,"]},{"title":"Y)],","paragraphs":["[state BE+p~u([th,n9 X ],","L~t,ee AT+,su([+pt,c¢ pleasure 1)1)1)]. We have here another form of representation for bon, where Fi is a CAUSE.","The term 'pleasure' is an element of an ontology describing e.g. mental attitudes and feelings. It is relatively generic and can be replaced by a more precise term, via selective projection (see below for sense 5), depending on the nature of the pleasure.","An alternative representation describes a path to-wards the value 'pleasure', giving an idea of progression: XX :human, Y :a, Fi(X,Y) [ .... , CAUSE([ ..... t F,(X, Y)],"]},{"title":"[ .... , GO+~..~([,~,.9 X ],","paragraphs":["[p~th TOW ARDS+p~u ([+,,l~ pleasure ])])])].","Notice that this sense of bon does not imply an idea of quantity: a good meal does not entail that the meal is big, a good temperature does not entail that the temperature is high, but rather mikl. The semantic composition rule is similar as in 3.1.","The metonymy 'container for containee\" (a good bottle) is resolved by a type shifting on Y. Y lnay be of type fl iff: 3 Z : a, Y : container A container- for(Y, Z). Inferences are identical for e.g. a good CD. 3,4 Sense 5: Bon = exact or eorreet We have here a situation of selective projection: the exact meaning of bon is projected from the type of the modified noun and the type of the predicate selected in the noun's Telic role.","For example, if the noun is of type bank - note V ticket and the type of the predicate selected in the noun's Telic role is pay V give - access - to, then the meaning of bon is 'valid': XX : bank -- note V ticket, [,t~t¢ BE+¢ha~,+,a,,t([,hina X 1,"]},{"title":"L~,o- AT+~h.r,+,a~,.

It turns out, so far, that these elements can be represented by LCS primitives and a few functions and values, assumed to belong to general-purpose, and often commonly-admitted, ontologies. This remains an assumption since this type of ontological knowledge is still under development, but the elements used are relatively simple and standard. Besides ontologies, and not very far from them, we also find information contained in the noun's Qualias, but in a less structured way, making selection more difficult.","Core meaning definition requires a good analysis of a word-sense and of its behavior in different con-texts. This is however not so difficult to elaborate once the formalism is stabilized. Also, we noted that semantically close words share a lot, making descriptions easier. This is in particular true for verbs. Besides adjectives, we have also studied a number of different types of verbs, as e.g. the verb couper (cut), often used as an example in the literature.

A similar treatment is observed for other types of metaphors, with elliptic forms, such as couper l'eau/ l'dlectricitd/les crddits, also viewed as flows.

If, conversely, we have une viande bonne d, ddguster, then, since d~guster is of type 'eat.enjoy' (a dotted type in the GL), sense 2 is selected.

In un bon couteau pour sculpter (a good knife to carve), by default, the action that the knife performs well is that protypically found in its telic role. But, if a less prototypical action is found explicitly in thesentence, then this latter is prefered and incorporated into the semantic representation instead of the default case. Indeed, the telic role describes prototypical actions, since the others are often unpredictable. The default meaning of bon is kept and 'frozen' until the whole sentence has been parsed. If there is no contracdiction with that sense, then it is assigned to the adjective, otherwise, it is discarded in favor of the sense explicitly found in the sentence.","Finally, we consider the expressions Y makes a good X, Y is a good X as collocations where good is not fully treated compositionally. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented an analysis of adjectival modification within the GL perspective, with the illustration of the French adjective bon. We have proposed several extensions to the Telic role to be able to account for the representation of the different forms of sense variations. In particular, we have shown how types can be added, and how predicates from the telic participate to the construction of the semantic representation of the compound noun + adjective.","Coercions and the treatment of metaphors and metonymies are generally assumed to be general principles, however, they are in fact more specialized than they seem at first glance (e.g. une bonne toque/ plume = a good cook/ writer is quite specific, or very constrained). It is then necessary to introduce narrow selectional restrictions on their use. Also, the similarities, quite important, outlined between the different cases presented here and observed for other families of adjectives suggest that there is a common typology for adjectival modification. What then would be a general formalism ? How much are these rules stlbject to linguistic variation ?","Acknowledgements I thank James Pustejovsky, Federica Busa and Franqoise Gayral for discussions which helped improving this work.
