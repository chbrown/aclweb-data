We conclude that verb sense and discourse type play an important role in the frequencies observed in different experimental and corpus based sources of verb subcategorization frequencies. 1 Introduction The probabilistic relation between verbs and their arguments plays an important role in modern statistical parsers and supertaggers (Charniak 1995, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi and Srinivas 1994, Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell 1997, Stolcke et al. 1997), and in psychological theories of language processing (Clifton et al. 1984, Ferfeira & McClure 1997, Gamsey et al. 1997, Jurafsky 1996, MacDonald 1994, Mitchell & Holmes 1985, Tanenhaus et al. 1990, Trueswell et al. 1993). These probabilities are computed in very different ways by the two sets of researchers. Psychological studies use methods such as sentence completion and sentence production for collecting verb argument structure probabilities. In sentence completion, subjects are asked to complete a sentence fragment. Garnsey at al. (1997) used a proper name followed by a verb, such as \"Debbie remembered .\" In sentence subjects are asked to write any sentence containing a given verb. An example of this type of study is Connine et al. (1984). An alternative to these psychological methods is to use corpus data. This can be done automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al. 1993), from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al.'s (1993) Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and Grishman 1994). The advantage of any of these corpus methods is the much greater amount of data that can be used, and the much more natural contexts. This seems to make it preferable to data generated in psychological studies. Recent studies (Merlo 1994, Gibson et al. 1996) have found differences between corpus frequencies and experimental measures. This suggests that corpus-based frequencies and experiment-based frequencies may not be interchangeable. To clarify the nature of the differences between various corpora and to find the causes of these differences, we analyzed 1122 psychological sentence production data (Connine etal. 1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ from Penn Treebank - Marcus et al. 1993), and conversational data (Switchboard - Godfrey et al. 1992). We found that the subcategorization frequencies in each of these sources are different. We performed three experiments to (1) find the causes of general differences between corpora, (2) measure the size of these differences, and (3) find verb specific differences. The rest of this paper describes our methodology and the two sources of subcategorization probability differences:"]},{"title":"discourse influence and semantic influence. 2 Methodology","paragraphs":["For the sentence production data, we used the numbers published in the original Connine et al. paper as well as the original data, which we were able to review thanks to the generosity of Charles Clifton. The Connine data (CFJCF) consists of examples of 127 verbs, each classified as belonging to one of 15 subcategorization frames. We added a 16th category for direct quotations (which appeared in the corpus data but not the Connine data). Examples of these categories, taken from the Brown Corpus, appear in figure 1 below. There are approximately 14,000 verb tokens in the CFJCF data set. For the BC,"]},{"title":"WSJ,","paragraphs":["and SWBD data, we counted subcategorizations using tgrep scripts based on the Penn Treebank. We automatically extracted and categorized all examples of the 127 verbs used in the Cormine study. We used the same verb subcategorization categories as the Connine study.

Unlike the Connine data, where all verbs were equally represented, the frequencies of each verb in the corpora varied. For each calculation where individual verb frequency could affect the outcome, we normalized for frequency, and eliminated verbs with less than 50 examples. This left 77 out of 127 verbs in the Brown Corpus, 74 in the Wall Street Journal, and only 30 verbs in Switchboard. This was not a problem with the Connine data where most verbs had approximately 100 tokens. 3 Experiment 1 The purpose of the first experiment is to analyze the general (non-verb-specific) differences between argument structure frequencies in the data sources. In order to do this, the data for each verb in the corpus was normalized to remove the effects of verb frequency. The average frequency of each subcategorization frame was calculated for each corpus. The average frequencies for each of the data sources were then compared. 3.1 Results We found that the three corpora consisting of connected discourse (BC, WSJ, SWBD) shared a common set of differences when compared to the CFJCF sentence production data. There were three general categories of differences between the corpora, and all can be related to discourse type. These categories are:","(1) passive sentences","(2) zero anaphora","(3) quotations 3.1.1 Passive Sentences The CFJCF single sentence productions had the smallest number of passive sentences. The connected spoken discourse in Switchboard had more passives, followed by the written discourse in the Wall Street Journal and the Brown Corpus. Data Source CFJCF Switchboard 2.2% Wall Street Journal 6.7% Brown Corpus","% passive sentences 0.6% 7.8% Passive is generally used in English to emphasize the undergoer (to keep the topic in subject position) and/or to de-emphasize the identity of the agent (Thompson 1987). Both of these reasons are affected by the type of discourse. If there is no preceding discourse, then there is no pre-existing topic to keep in subject position. In addition, with no context for the sentence, there is less likely to be a reason to de-emphasize the agent of the sentence. 3.1.2 Zero Anaphora The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly mentioning understood arguments) is caused by two factors. Generally, as the amount of surrounding context increases (going from single sentence to connected discourse) the need to overtly express all of the arguments with a verb decreases. Data Source % [0] subcat frame CFJCF 7% Wall Street Journal 8% Brown 13 % Switchboard 18 % Verbs that can describe actions (agree, disappear, escape, follow, leave, sing, wait) were typically used with some form of argument in single sentences, such as: \"I had a test that day, so I really wanted to escape from school.\" (CFJCF data). Such verbs were more likely to be used without any arguments in connected discourse as in: \"She escaped , crawled through the usual mine fields, under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a river, and we finally picked her up in Linz.\" (Brown Corpus) In this case, the argument of \"escaped\", (\"imprisonment\") was understood from the previous sentence. Verbs of propositional attitude (agree, guess, know, see, understand) are typically used transitively in written corpora and single-sentence production: \"I guessed the right answer on the quiz.\" (CFJCF). In spoken discourse, these verbs are more likely to be used metalinguistically, with the previous 1124 discourse contribution understood as the argument of the verb: \"I see.\" (Switchboard) \"I guess.\" (Switchboard)"]},{"title":"3.1.3 Quotaa'ons","paragraphs":["Quotations are usually used in narrative, which is more likely in connected discourse than in an isolated sentence. This difference mainly effects verbs of communication (e.g. answer, ask, call, describe, read, say, write). Data Source CFJCF Switchboard 0% Brown 4% Wall Street Journal 6% Percent Direct Quotation","0% These verbs are used in corpora to discuss details of the contents of communication: \"Turning to the reporters, she asked, \"Did you hear her?\"'(Brown) In single sentence production, they are used to describe the (new) act of communication itself • \"He asked a lot of questions at school.\" (CFJCF) We are currently working on systematically identifying indirect quotes in the corpora and the CFJCF data to analyze in more detail how they fit in to this picture. 4 Experiment 2 Our first experiment factors were the suggested that discourse","primary cause of subcategorization differences. One way to test this hypothesis is to eliminate discourse factors and see if this removes subcategorization differences. We measure the difference between the way a verb is used in two different corpora by counting the number of sentences (per hundred) where a verb in one corpus would have to be used with a different subcategorization in order for the two corpora to yield the same subcategorization frequencies. This same number can also be calculated for the overall subcategorization frequencies of two corpora to show the overall difference between the two corpora.

This indicates that 43% of the overall cross-verb differences between these two corpora are caused by discourse effects.

We are currently extending our study to see if verb senses have constant subcategorization frequencies across corpora. This would be useful for word sense disambiguation and for parsing. If the verb sense is known, then a parser could use this information to help look for likely arguments. If the subcatagorization is known, then a disambiguator could use this information to find the sense of the verb. These could be used to bootstrap each other relying on the heuristic that only one sense is used within any discourse (Gale, Church, & Yarowsky 1992)."]},{"title":"6 Evaluation","paragraphs":["We had previously hoped to evaluate the accuracy of our treebank induduced subcategorization probabilities by comparing them with the COMLEX hand-coded probabilities (Macleod and 1126 Grishman 1994), but we used a different set of subcategorization frames than COMLEX. Instead, we hand checked a random sample of our data for errors. to find arguments that were located to the left of the verb. This is because arbitrary amounts of structure can intervene, expecially in the case of traces. The error rate in our data is between 3% and 7% for all verbs excluding 'say' type verbs such as 'answer', 'ask', 'call', 'read', 'say', and 'write'. The error rate is given as a range due to the subjectivity of some types of errors. The errors can be divided into two classes; errors which are due to mis-parsed sentences in Treebank ~, and errors which are due to the inadequacy of our search strings in indentifying certain syntactic 9atterns.","Treebank-based errors PP attachment 1% verb+particle vs verb+PP 2% NP/adverbial distinction 2% misc. miss-parsed sentences 1%","Errors based on our search strinl~s missed traces and displaced arguments 1% \"say\" verbs missing quotes 6%","Error rate by category In trying to estimate the maximum amount of error in our data, we found cases where it was possible to disagree with the parses/tags given in Treebank.

The error rate for corpora available in Treebank 2 form would have been lower had we used all available information. Six percent of the data (overall) was improperly classified due to the failure of our search patterns to identify all of the quote-type arguments which occur in 'say' type verbs. The identification of these elements is particularly problematic due to the asyntactic nature of these arguments, ranging from a sound (He said 'Argh!') to complex sentences. The presence or absense of quotation marks was not a completely reliable indicator of these arguments. This type of error affects only a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27% of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified, always by failing to find a quote-type argument of the verb. Using separate search strings for these verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these searches. Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on fiat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). 7 Conclusion We find that there are significant differences between the verb subcategorization frequencies generated through experimental methods and corpus methods, and between the frequencies found in different corpora. We have identified two distinct sources for these differences. Discourse influences are caused by the changes in the ways language is used in different discourse types and are to some extent predictable from the discourse type of the corpus in question. Semantic influences are based on the semantic context of the discourse. These differences may be predictable from the relative frequencies of each of the possible senses of the verbs in the corpus. An extensive analysis of the frame and sense frequencies of different verbs across different corpora is needed to verify this. This work is presently being carried out by us and others (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe 1998). It is certain, however, that verb sense and 1127 discourse type play an important role in the frequencies observed in different experimental and corpus based sources of verb subcategorization frequencies"]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This project was supported by the generosity of the NSF via NSF 1RI-9704046 and NSF 1RI-9618838 and the Committee on Research and Creative Work at the graduate school of the University of Colorado, Boulder.
