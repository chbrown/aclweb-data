We see verb classes as the key to making generalizations about regular extensions of meaning. Current approaches to English classification, Levin classes and WordNet, have limita-tions in their applicability that impede their utility as general classification schemes. We present a refinement of Levin classes, intersective sets, which are a more fine-grained classification and have more coherent sets of syntactic frames and associated semantic components. We have preliminary indications that the membership of our intersective sets will be more compatible with WordNet than the original Levin classes. We also have begun to examine related classes in Portuguese, and find that these verbs demonstrate similarly coherent syntactic and semantic properties. 1","Introduction The difficulty of achieving adequate handcrafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applica-tions that can be contained within well-defined subdomains. The only escape from this limitation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisi-tion. However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computational lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of DARPA grant N66001-94C-6043, ARO grant DAAH04-94G-0426, and CAPES grant 0914/95-2. One of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy. What constitutes a clear separation into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished? The answer to this question is the key to breaking the bottleneck of semantic representation that is currently the single greatest limitation on the general application of natural language processing techniques.","In this paper we specifically address questions of polysemy with respect to verbs, and how regular extensions of meaning can be achieved through the adjunction of particular syntactic phrases. We base these regular extensions on a fine-grained variation on Levin classes, intersective Levin classes, as a source of semantic components associated with specific adjuncts. We also examine similar classes in Portuguese, and the predictive powers of alternations in this language with respect to the same semantic components. The difficulty of determining a suitable lexical representation becomes multiplied when more than one language is involved and attempts are made to map between them. Preliminary investigations have indicated that a straightforward translation of Levin classes into other languages is not feasible (Jones et al., 1994), (Nomura et al., 1994), (Saint-Dizier, 1996). However, we have found interesting parallels in how Portuguese and English treat regular sense extensions. 2 Classifying verbs Two current approaches to English verb classifications are WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Levin classes (Levin, 1993). WordNet is an on-line lexical database of English that currently contains approximately 120,000 sets of noun, verb, adjective, and adverb synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. A synset (syn-293 onym set) contains, besides all the word forms that can refer to a given concept, a definitional gloss and - in most cases - an example sentence. Words and synsets are interrelated by means of lexical and semantic-conceptual links, respectively. Antonymy or semantic opposition links individual words, while the super-/subordinate relation links entire synsets. WordNet was de-signed principally as a semantic network, and contains little syntactic information.","Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning preserving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993). The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class membership. The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the underlying semantics. Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes.","The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary, and they are supposed to reflect underlying semantic components that constrain allowable arguments. For example, break verbs and cut verbs are similar in that they can all participate in the transitive and in the middle construction, John broke the window, Glass breaks easily, John cut the bread, This loaf cuts easily. However, only break verbs can also occur in the simple intransitive, The window broke, *The bread cut. In addition, cut verbs can occur in the conative, John valiantly cut/hacked at the frozen loaf, but his knife was too dull to make a dent in it, whereas break verbs cannot, *John broke at the window. The explanation given is that cut describes a series of actions directed at achieving the goal of separating some object into pieces. It is possible for these actions to be performed without the end result being achieved, but where the cutting manner can still be recognized, i.e., John cut at the loaf. Where break is concerned, the only thing specified is the resulting change of state where the object becomes separated into pieces. If the result is not achieved, there are no attempted breaking actions that can still be recognized. 2.1 Ambiguities in Levin classes It is not clear how much WordNet synsets should be expected to overlap with Levin classes, and preliminary indications are that there is a wide discrepancy (Dorr and Jones, 1996), (Jones and Onyshkevych, 1997), (Doff, 1997). However, it would be useful for the WordNet senses to have access to the detailed syntactic information that the Levin classes contain, and it would be equally useful to have more guidance as to when membership in a Levin class does in fact indicate shared semantic components. Of course, some Levin classes, such as braid (bob, braid, brush, clip, coldcream, comb, condition, crimp, crop, curl, etc.) are clearly not intended to be synonymous, which at least partly explains the lack of overlap between Levin and WordNet.","The association of sets of syntactic frames with individual verbs in each class is not as straightforward as one might suppose. For in-stance, carry verbs are described as not taking the conative, *The mother carried at the baby, and yet many of the verbs in the carry class (push, pull, tug, shove, kick) are also listed in the push/pull class, which does take the conative. This listing of a verb in more than one class (many verbs are in three or even four classes) is left open to interpretation in Levin. Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved, or is one sense primary, and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed? The grounds for deciding that a verb belongs in a particular class because of the alternations that it does not take are elusive at best. 3 Intersective Levin classes We augmented the existing database of Levin semantic classes with a set of intersective classes, which were created by grouping to-gether subsets of existing classes with overlapping members. All subsets were included which shared a minimum of three members. If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes, we assumed this might be due to homophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship involving coherent sets of verbs. This filter allowed us to reject the potential intersective class that would have resulted from combining the re-move verbs with the scribble verbs, for example. The sole member of this intersection is the verb 294"]},{"title":"draw.","paragraphs":["On the other hand, the"]},{"title":"scribble","paragraphs":["verbs do form an intersective class with the performance verbs, since"]},{"title":"paint","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"write","paragraphs":["are also in both classes, in addition to"]},{"title":"draw.","paragraphs":["The algorithm we used is given in Figure 1. 1.

A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class. Simultaneously, the verb was removed from the membership lists of those existing classes. 3.1 Using intersective Levin classes to isolate semantic components Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components, and could be divided into smaller subclasses.

Similarly, draw and yank can be viewed as carry verbs although they are not listed as such. The list of members for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that define the class. Since intersective classes were built using membership lists rather than the set of defining alternations, they were similarly incomplete. This is an obvious shortcoming of the current implementation of intersective classes, and might affect the choice of 3 as a relevance cut-off in later implementations. 295 (verb of exerting force, no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied) 3.

WordNet does not currently provide a consistent treatment of regular sense extension (some are listed as separate senses, others are not mentioned at all). It would be straightforward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically, and in-clude corresponding syntactic information. 3.3","Sense extension for manner of","motion Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (meander verbs). Roll and run verbs have semantic components describing a manner of motion that typically, though not necessarily, involves change of location. In the absence of a goal or path adjunct they do not specify any direction of motion, and in some cases (e.g., float, bounce) require the adjunct to explicitly specify any displacement at all. The two classes differ in that roll verbs relate to manners of motion characteristic of inanimate entities, while run verbs describe manners in which animate entities can move. Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basic in-transitive. When a roll verb occurs in the transitive (Bill moved the box across the room), the subject physically causes the object to move, whereas the subject of a transitive run verb merely induces the object to move (the coach ran the athlete around the track). Some verbs can be used to describe motion of both animate and inanimate objects, and thus appear in both roll and run verb classes. The slide class parti-tions this roll/run intersection into verbs that can take the transitive alternation and verbs that cannot (drift and glide cannot be causative, because they are not typically externally controllable). Verbs in the slide/roll/run intersection are also allowed to appear in the dative alternation (Carla slid the book to Dale, Carla slid Dale the book), in which the sense of change of location is extended to change of possession.","When used intransitively with a path prepositional phrase, some of the manner of motion verbs can take on a sense of pseudo-motional existence, in which the subject does not actually move, but has a shape that could describe a path for the verb (e.g., The stream twists through the valley). These verbs are listed in the intersective classes with meander verbs of existence.","\"Slide\" Verbs","R n Verbs"]},{"title":"?","paragraphs":["\"Meander Verbs\" Figure 3: Intersections between roll and run verbs of motion and meander verbs of existence 4 Cross-linguistic verb classes The Portuguese verbs we examined behaved much more similarly to their English counterparts than we expected. Many of the verbs participate in alternations that are direct translations of the English alternations. However, there are some interesting differences in which sense extensions are allowed. 4.1 Similar sense extensions We have made a preliminary study of the Portuguese translation of the carry verb class. As in English, these verbs seem to take different alternations, and the ability of each to participate in an alternation is related to its semantic content. Table i shows how these Portuguese verbs naturally cluster into two different subclasses, based on their ability to take the conative and apart alternations as well as path prepositions. These subclasses correspond very well to the English subclasses created by the intersective class.","The conative alternation in Portuguese is mainly contra (against), and the apart alternation is mainly separando (separating).

Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes, each verb must be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alternations of a class. This might be approximated by automatically extracting the syntactic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus data, rather than manual analysis of each verb, as was done in this study.","We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations, which have several of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English. Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions.","There are still many questions that require further investigation. First, since our experiment was based on a translation from English to Portuguese, we can expect that other verbs in Portuguese would share the same alternations, so the classes in Portuguese should by no means be considered complete. We will be using resources such as dictionaries and on-line corpora to investigate potential additional members of our classes.

In pursuing this goal, we are currently implementing features for motion verbs in the English Tree-Adjoining Grammar, TAG (Bleam et al., 1998). TAGs have also been applied to Portuguese in previous work, resulting in a small Portuguese grammar (Kipper, 1994). We in-tend to extend this grammar, building a more robust TAG grammar for Portuguese, that will allow us to build an English/Portuguese transfer lexicon using these features.","References","Tonia Bleam, Martha Palmer, and Vijay Shanker. 1998.
