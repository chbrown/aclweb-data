These resources include Lexicons, Lexical Databases, Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs), Ontologies, etc. Many researchers believe that for effective NLP it is necessary to build a LKB which contain class/subclass relations and mechanisms for the inheritance of properties as well as other inferences. The work presented here attempts to lay out some solutions to overcome or alleviate the \"lexical bottleneck\" problem (Briscoe 91) providing a methodology to build large scale LKBs from conventional dictionaries, in any language. Starting with the seminal work of (Amsler 81) many systems have followed this approach (e.g., Bruce et al. 92; Richardson 97). Why should we propose another one?","Regarding the resources used, we must point out that most of the systems built until now refer to English only and use rather rich, well structured, controlled and explicitly semantically coded dictionaries (e.g. LDOCE 87). This is not the case for most of the available sources for languages other than English. Our aim is to use conventional MRDs, with no explicit semantic coding, to obtain a comparable accuracy.","The system we propose is capable of 1) performing fully automatic extraction (with a counterpart in terms of both recall and precision fall) of taxonomic links of dictionary senses and 2) ranking the extracted relations in a way that selective manual refinement is allowed.","Section 2 shows that applying a conventional pure descriptive approach the resulting taxonomies are not useful for NLP. Our approach is presented in the rest of the paper. Section 3 deals with the automatic selection of the main semantic primitives present in Diccionario General Ilustrado de la Lengua Espafiola (DGILE 87), and for each of these, section 4 shows the method for the selection of its most representative genus terms. Section 5 is devoted to the automatic acquisition of large and accurate taxonomies from DGILE. Finally, some conclusions are drawn. 2"]},{"title":"Acquiring taxonomies from","paragraphs":["MRDs","A straightforward way to obtain a LKB acquiring taxonomic relations from dictionary definitions can be done following a purely bottom up strategy with the following steps: 1) parsing each definition for obtaining the genus, 2) performing a genus disambiguafion procedure, and 3) building a natural classification of the concepts as a concept taxonomy with several tops. Following this purely descriptive methodology, the semantic primitives of the LKB could be obtained by collecting those dictionary senses appearing at the top of the complete taxonomies derived from the dictionary. By characterizing each of these tops, the complete LKB could be produced. For DGILE, the complete noun taxonomy was derived following the automatic method described by (Rigau et al. 97) 1. 1This taxonomy contains 111,624 dictionary senses and has only 832 dictionary senses which are tops of the taxonomy (these top dictionary senses have no 1103","However, several problems arise a) due to the source (i.e, circularity, errors, inconsistencies, omitted genus, etc.) and b) the limitation of the genus sense disambiguation techniques applied: i.e, (Bruce et al. 92) report 80% accuracy using automatic techniques, while (Rigau et al. 97) report 83%. Furthermore, the top dictionary senses do not usually represent the semantic subsets that the LKB needs to characterize in order to represent useful knowledge for NLP systems. In other words, there is a mismatch between the knowledge directly derived from an MRD and the knowledge needed by a LKB.","To illustrate the problem we are facing, let us suppose we plan to place the FOOD concepts in the LKB. Neither collecting the taxonomies derived from a top dictionary sense (or selecting a subset of the top dictionary senses of DGILE) closest to FOOD concepts (e.g., substancia -substance-), nor collecting those subtaxonomies starting from closely related senses (e.g., bebida -drinkable liquids- and alimento -food-) we are able to collect exactly the FOOD concepts present in the MRD. The first are too general (they would cover non-FOOD concepts) and the second are too specific (they would not cover all FOOD dictionary senses because FOODs are described in many ways).","All these problems can be solved using a mixed methodology. That is, by attaching selected top concepts (and its derived taxonomies) to prescribed semantic primitives represented in the LKB. Thus, first, we prescribe a minimal ontology (represented by the semantic primitives of the LKB) capable of representing the whole lexicon derived from the MRD, and second, following a descriptive approach, we collect, for every semantic primitive placed in the LKB, its subtaxonomies. Finally, those subtaxonomies selected for a semantic primitive are attached to the corresponding LKB semantic category.","Several prescribed sets of semantic primitives have been created as Ontological Knowledge Bases: e.g. Penman Upper Model (Bateman 90), CYC (Lenat & Guha 90), WordNet (Miller 90). Depending on the application and theoretical tendency of the LKB different sets of semantic primitives can be of interest. For instance, WordNet noun top unique beginners are 24 semantic categories. (Yarowsky 92) uses the 1,042 major categories of Roget's thesaurus, (Liddy & Paik 92) use the 124 major subject areas of LDOCE, hypernyms), and 89,458 leaves (which have no hyponyms). That is, 21,334 definitions are placed between the top nodes and the leaves.","1104 (Hearst & Schfitze, 95) convert the hierarchical structure of WordNet into a fiat system of 726 semantic categories.","In the work presented in this paper we used as semantic primitives the 24 lexicographer's files (or semantic files) into which the 60,557 noun synsets (87,641 nouns) of WordNet 1.5 (WN1.5) are classified 2. Thus, we considered the 24 semantic tags of WordNet as the main LKB semantic primitives to which all dictionary senses must be attached.

Rather than collect evidence from a blurred corpus (words belonging to a Roget's category are used as seeds to collect a subcorpus for that category; that is, a window context produced by a seed can be placed in several subcorpora), we collected evidence from dictionary senses labelled by a conceptual distance method (that is, a definition is placed in one semantic file only).","This task is divided into three fully automatic consecutive subtasks. First, we tag a subset (due to the difference in size between the monolingual and the bilingual dictionaries) of DGILE dictionary senses by means of a process that uses the conceptual distance formula; second, we collect salient words for each semantic file; and third, we enrich each DGILE dictionary sense with a semantic tag collecting evidence from the salient words previously computed. 3.1 Attach WordNet synsets to"]},{"title":"DGILE headwords.","paragraphs":["For each DGILE definition, the conceptual distance between headword and genus has been computed using WN1.5 as a semantic net.
