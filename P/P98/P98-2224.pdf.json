The reason is as follows: there is no composing rule that strongly restricts the positions of elements and the semantic relations between elements. In other words, there are many ways of composing diagrams to explain an idea. For this reason, it is difficult to interpret the PBF diagrams only by using the pattern (layout) information. For example, \"daenkei (ellipsoidal shape)\", \"hishinkei (lanceolate shape)\", and \"shinkei (cordate shape)\" in Figure 3 represent the properties of the plant part, on the contrary, \"taika (follicle)\" and \"mikanjyoka (hespidium)\" in Figure 4 represent the types of the plant part. In spite of the semantic difference, all these words are located under the corresponding sketches, respectively. 2.2 Related Work There are a few research topics related to diagram understanding. (Plant 89) (Futrelle 90) recognized the semantic structure of diagrams as the extension of diagram analysis. But they analyzed diagrams"]},{"title":"1375","paragraphs":["by using knowledge about diagrams which is quite separate from natural language information. On the contrary, (Nakamura 93) analyzed diagrams in the encyclopedia dictionary by using its explanation texts and the thesaurus information. But it is difficult to analyze the PBF diagrams in the same way as (Nakamura 93) did. The reasons are as follows:","• It is certain that the explanation texts in the","PBF are closely related to the PBF diagrams.","However, these texts do not describe the con-","tents of diagrams but the features of plants.","That is, there is no explanation text for the","PBF diagrams.","• Words in the PBF diagrams are generally tech-","nical terms which are not registered in the","common thesaurus. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework to analyze the PBF diagrams by using many kinds of clue expressions in the PBF explanation texts. 3 Information for PBF Diagram Understanding 3.1 Layout Information For analyzing the PBF diagrams, we utilize two kinds of layout information. These are:","• type of relationships between diagram elements","• similarity of spatial relationships between di-","agram elements Every word in the PBF diagrams is related to the other elements (sketches or other words). The relationships between words and the corresponding elements are classified into 2 types: connection is the relationship between the word","and its corresponding element. These are con-","nected together by a symbol. For example, the","relationship between \"takuyou (stipules)\" and","the \"leaf\" sketch in Figure 2 is connection. adjacency is the relationship between the word","and its corresponding element. These are ad-","jacent to each other and not connected by","a symbol. For example, the relationship be-","tween \"natsumikan\" and the right sketch in","the Figure 4 is adjacency. A word connected by a symbol represents a name of the plant part. Consequently, in this case, the spatial relationship between the word and the corresponding element is not important for the semantic interpretation. For example, the semantic interpretation of \"mitsusen (nectary)\" in Figure 2 would remain unchanged even if \"mi~susen\" was located on the right of the \"leaf\" sketch.","On the contrary, a word which is not connected by a symbol may represent any type of information. Consequently, in this case, the spatial relationship between the word and the corresponding element is important for the semantic interpretation. For example, it is inadequate to replace the position between \"mikanjyoka\" and \"natsumikan\" in Figure 4. It is because the replacement breaks the similarity of the spatial relationship which \"mikanjyoka (hespidium)\" and \"taika (follicle)\" have. In this way, words in the PBF diagrams which represent the same kind of information, often have the same spatial relationship. From this, we utilize the similarity of the spatial relationships for the propagation of the semantic interpretation in this way: suppose that words A and B have the same spatial relationship. If A is given the semantic interpretation but B is not, the semantic interpretation of A is given to B. 3.2 Natural Language Information As mentioned previously, the PBF texts do not explain the PBF diagrams but describe many kinds of plants. The explanation texts, however, include many clues which are useful to classify the words in the PBF diagrams into the five semantic categories. In order to realize the semantic analysis, we utilize two kinds of natural language information for diagram understanding. These are: • titles of the PBF articles. • typical expressions which show implicitly the","semantic interpretation of words in the PBF","diagram. Titles of the PBF articles represent names of the species. Typical expressions which we utilize for analyzing the diagrams are such as: (a) A + ha + predicative noun (b) A + ga + aru (exist) (c) A + ga + verbalized noun + suru (d) ha + A (A is a predicative noun) (e) A (A is a verbalized noun) + suru where A is a word in the diagram, \"ha\" and \"ga\" are Japanese postpositions, and \"suru\" accompanies a noun and verbalizes it. These five expression patterns are useful to interpret the words in the PBF diagrams. For example, words which represent the names of plant parts are found in expressions (a), (b), and (c), as shown in text (S-l) --. (S-3), but not in expressions (d) and (e). (S-I) ha (leaf) ha daenkei (ellipsoidal shape) (S-2) kibu ni (at the base) ha milsusen (nectary)","ga aru (exist) (S-3) rimen ni (in the back) ha myaku (vein) ni","sotte (along) ke (hair) ga missei (glow tightly)","suru On the contrary, words which represent the properties are found in the expressions (d) and (e), as shown in texts (S-4) and (S-5), but not in expressions (a), (b), and (c). 1376"]},{"title":"meshibe","paragraphs":["(pistil) /~ oshibe oshibe"]},{"title":"[ ~-meshibe ~ ryoseibana mebana obana ( hermaphrocllte~ (#emale'~ f mill, \"~1 flower","paragraphs":["/ \\flower J \\flowerJ","hono (flower) Figure 6: A diagram of flower mtbene ,be"]},{"title":"male \\(hermaphr°dlte~flower ,","paragraphs":[",flower(female~fl"]},{"title":"(flower) hana (flower)","paragraphs":["Figure 7: ID number of each word and sketch in Figure 6","ID Number Word01 • Word02 Word03 Word04 Writing","Corresponding element Writing meshibe oshibe ryoseibana mebana obana","type of correspondence meshibe Sketch01 connection","oshibe ryoseibana Sketch01 Sketch01 Sketch02 meshibe connection adjacency connection position bottom Word05 mebana Sketch02 adjacency bottom Word06 Sketch03 Word07 adjacency adjacency oshibe obana Sketch03","above right bottom (a) layout information of Figure 6 expression pattern I Title (a) ] (b) [ (c) [ (d) [ /e ) 0 46 23 0 0 0 0 194 37 5 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 26 2 0 1 0 0 41 1 0 3 0 (Note) expression pattern (a) A + ha + predicative noun (b) A q- ga + aru (c) A + ga -t- verbalized noun ÷ suru (d) ha + A (A is a predicative noun) (e) A (A is a verbalized noun) + suru (b) natural language information of Figure 6 Figure 8: An example of the layout and natural language information (S-4) kajitsu (fruit) ha kyukei (spherical shape) (S-5) kajyo (inflorescence) ha tyousei (terminal)"]},{"title":"SUr/L","paragraphs":["4 Process of PBF Diagram Understanding","4.1 Representation of Layout Information","Layout information is represented by hand in the","following way.","Step 1. give ID number to all words and sketches in the diagram.","Step 2. describe the following kinds of information for each word in the diagram.","1.

For example, Figure 8 (a) shows that \"ryoseibana (hermaphrodite flower)\" in Figure 6 has Word03 as the ID number, corresponds with Sketch01 (a sketch in the left of Figure 6), and is located under Sketch01. Moreover, by checking the information on the position, words which have the same spatial relationship can be detected. For example, Figure 8 (a) shows that there are words under the left sketch, under the central sketch, and in the above right and under the right sketch. Using this information, Word03 (\"ryoseibana\"), Word05 (\"mebana\"), and Word07 1377 Word01 Word02 Word03 Word04 Word05 Word06 Word07 Figure 9: 6 Writing meshibe oshibe ryoseibana meshibe mebana oshibe obana name of plant parts Rule 1 name of plant parts Rule 1 type of plant parts Rule 5 name of plant parts Rule 1 type of plant parts Rule 5 name of plant parts Rule 4 type of plant parts Rule 5 Results of the semantic analysis for Figure (\"obana\") are detected as the words which have the same spatial relationship with the corresponding sketch. 4.2 Extraction and Representation of","Natural Language Information Natural language information, which is useful to interpret the words in the PBF diagrams, such as, titles and expression patterns, is extracted and represented in the following way: Step 1. Extract titles from the explanation texts.","Step 2. Japanese morphological analysis. We used JUMAN(Kurohashi 97) as a Japanese morphological analyzer.","Step 3. Extract the following expression patterns by pattern matching from the results of the Japanese morphological analysis. (a) A + ha + predicative noun (b) A + ga + aru (exist) (c) A + ga + verbalized noun + sum (d) ha + A (A is a predicative noun) (e) A (A is a verbalized noun) + suru where A is a word in a diagram. Step 4. Describe the results of Step 1 and 3 as the","natural language information. Figure 8 (b) shows the natural language information of Figure 6. The number of each expression pattern in Figure 8 (b) shows the frequency of it in the PBF explanation texts. 4.3 Semantic Analysis by Integration of","Layout Information and Natural","Language Information","In this section, we describe the process of semantic analysis for the PBF diagrams by using the integration of layout and natural language information. The semantic analysis is realized by applying the following rules in order: (Figure 9 shows the results of the semantic analysis for Figure 6)","Rule 1. [Rule for names of plant parts by using symbols] A word which is connected to the other element by a symbol is interpreted as a name of the plant part. For example, \"meshibe\" (Word01 and Word04) and \"oshibe\" (Word02) in Figure 6, each of which is connected with its corresponding sketch by an arrow, are interpreted as the name of the plant part by this rule.","Rule 2. [Rule for names of plant species] A word is interpreted as a name of the plant species, when it is: (a) a title of the PBF articles, or (b) written in Katakana letters 1 For example, \"ka~snra\" and \"natsumikaa\" in Figure 4 are interpreted as the name of the species by this rule. It should be noted that \"katsura\", that is a wild kind, is one in the titles of the PBF articles. On the contrary, \"natsumikan\", that is a cultivated kind, is not a title in the PBF. It is because the subject of the PBF which we used is wild flowers in Japan. As a result of this, \"katsura\" and \"natsumikan\" are interpreted by the condition above (a) and (b) in this rule, respectively.","Rule 3. [Rule for properties of plant parts] A word in a diagram is interpreted as a property of the plant part when it is found in the expression pattern (d) and (e) described in Section 3.2, such as: (d) ha + A (A is a predicative noun) (e) A (A is a verbalized noun) + suru and never found in the rest of the expression patterns in Section 3.2. For example, \"daenkei (ellipsoidal shape)\", \"hishinkei (lanceolate shape)\", and \"shinkei (cordate shape)\" in Figure 3 are interpreted as the properties of the plant part by this rule.","Rule 4. [Rule for names of plant parts by using the expression patterns] A word in a diagram is interpreted as a name of the plant part when it is found in the expression patterns (a), (b), and (c) described in Section 3.2, such as: (a) A + ha + predicative noun (b) A + ga + aru (exist) (c) A + ga + verbalized noun + sum and never found in the rest of expression patterns in Section 3.2. For example, \"oshibe\" (Word06) in Figure 6 is interpreted as the name of the plant part by this rule.","1In Japanese PBF, names of species are generally written in Katakana letters.
