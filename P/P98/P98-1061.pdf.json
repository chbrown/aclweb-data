This means that in conventional parsing algorithms some of the computation associated with different structures is duplicated. In this paper we describe a precompilation technique for such grammars which allows some of this computation to be shared. In our approach the elementary structures of the grammar are transformed into finite state automata which can be merged and minimised using standard algorithms, and then parsed using an automaton-based parser. We present algorithms for constructing automata from elementary structures, merging and minimising them, and string recognition and parse recovery with the resulting grammar."]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["Introduction It is well-known that fully lexicalised grammar formalisms such as LTAG (Joshi and Schabes, 1991) are difficult to parse with efficiently. Each word in the parser's input string introduces an elementary tree into the parse table for each of its possible readings, and there is often a substantial overlap in structure between these trees. A conventional parsing algorithm (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) views the trees as in-dependent, and so is likely to duplicate the processing of this common structure. Parsing could be made more efficient (empirically if not for-mally), if the shared structure could be identified and processed only once. Recent work by Evans and Weir (1997) and Chen and Vijay-Shanker (1997) addresses this problem from two different perspectives.

In the following sections we outline the basic approach, and describe informally our improvements to the previous account. We then give a formal account of the optimisation process and a possible parsing algorithm that makes use of it 1 . 2 Automaton-based parsing Conventional LTAG parsers (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985; Schabes and Joshi, 1988; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) maintain a parse table, a set of items corresponding to complete and partial constituents. Parsing proceeds by first seeding the table with items anchored on the input string, and then repeatedly scanning the table for parser actions. Parser actions introduce new items into the table licensed by one or more items already in the table. The main types of parser actions are:","1. extending a constituent by incorporating a complete subconstituent (on the left or","1However, due to lack of space, no proofs and only minimal"]},{"title":"informal","paragraphs":["descriptions are given in this paper. 372 right);","2. extending a constituent by adjoining a surrounding complete auxiliary constituent;","3. predicting the span of the foot node of an auxiliary constituent (to the left or right). Parsing is complete when all possible parser actions have been executed. In a completed parse table it is possible to trace the sequence of items corresponding to the recognition of an elementary tree from its lexical anchor upwards. Each item in the sequence corresponds to a node in the tree (with the sequence as a whole corresponding to a complete traversal of the tree), and each step corresponds to the parser action that licensed the next item, given the current one. From this perspective, parser actions can be restated relative to the items in such a sequence as: 1. substitute a complete subconstituent (on the left or right); 2. adjoin a surrounding complete auxiliary constituent; 3. predict the span of the tree's foot node (to the left or right). The recognition of the tree can thus be viewed as the computation of a finite state automaton, whose states correspond to a traversal of the tree and whose input symbols are these relao tivised parser actions. This perspective suggests a re-casting of the conventional LTAG parser in terms of such automata 2. For this automaton-based parser, the grammar structures are not trees, but automata corresponding to tree traversals whose inputs are strings of relativised parser actions. Items in the parse table reference automaton states instead of tree addresses, and if the automaton state is final, the item represents a complete constituent. Parser actions arise as before, but are executed by relativising them with respect to the incomplete item participating in the action, and passing this relativised parser action as the next input symbol for the automaton referenced by that item. The resulting state of that automaton is then used as the referent of the newly licensed item. On a first pass, this re-casting is exactly that: it does nothing new or different from the original","2Evans and Weir (1997) provides a longer informal introduction to this approach. parser on the original grammar. However there are a number of subtle differences3:","• the automata are more abstract than the trees: the only grammatical information they contain are the input symbols and the root node labels, indicating the category of the constituent the automaton recognises;","• automata for several trees can be merged together and optimised using standard well-studied techniques, resulting in a single automaton that recognises many trees at once, sharing as many of the common parser actions as possible. It is this final point which is the focus of this paper. By representing trees as automata, we can merge trees together and apply standard optimisation techniques to share their common structure. The parser will remain unchanged, but will operate more efficiently where structure has been shared. Additionally, because the automata are more abstract than the trees, capturing precisely the parser's view of the trees, sharing may occur between trees which are structurally quite different, but which happen to have common parser actions associated with them. 3 Merging and minimising automata Combining the automata for several trees can be achieved using a variety of standard algorithms (Huffman, 1954; Moore, 1956). However any transformations must respect one important feature: once the parser reaches a final state it needs to know what tree it has just recognised 4. When automata for trees with different root categories are merged, the resulting automaton needs to somehow indicate to the parser what trees are associated with its final states. In Evans and Weir (1997), we combined automata by introducing a new initial state with e-transitions to each of the original initial states,","3A further difference is that the traversal encoded in the automaton captures part of the parser's control strategy. However for simplicity we assume here a fixed parser control strategy (bottom-up, anchor-out) and do not pursue this point further - Evans and Weir (1997) offers some discussion.","4For recognition alone it only needs to know the root category of the tree, but to recover the parse it needs to identify the tree itself. 373 and then determinising the resulting automaton to induce some sharing of structure. To recover trees, final automaton states were annotated with the number of the tree the final state is associated with, which the parser can then readily access. However, the drawback of this approach is that differently annotated final states can never be merged, which restricts the scope for structure sharing (minimisation, for example, is not possible since all the final states are distinct). To overcome this, we propose an alternative approach as follows:","• each automaton transition is annotated with the set of trees which pass through it: when transitions are merged in automaton optimisation, their annotations are unioned;","• the parser maintains for each item in the table the set of trees that are valid for the item: initially this is all the valid trees for the automaton, but gets intersected with the annotation of any transition followed; also if two paths through the automaton meet (i.e., an item is about to be added for a second time), their annotations get unioned. This approach supports arbitrary merging of states, including merging all the final states into one. The parser maintains a dynamic record of which trees are valid for states (in particular final states) in the parse table. This means that we can minimise our automata as well as determinising them, and so share more structure (for example, common processing at the end of the recognition process as well as the beginning). 4","Recognition and parse recovery We noted above that a parsing algorithm needs to be able to access the tree that an automaton has recognised. The algorithm we describe below actually needs rather more information than this, because it uses a two-phase recognition/parse-recovery approach. The recognition phase only needs to know, for each complete item, what the root label of the tree recognised is. This can be recovered from the 'valid tree' annotation of the complete item itself (there may be more than one valid tree, corresponding to a phrase which has more than one parse which happen to have been merged together). Parse recovery, however, involves running the recogniser 'backwards' over the completed parse table, identifying for each item, the items and actions which licensed it. A complication arises because the automata, especially the merged automata, do not directly correspond to tree structure. The recogniser returns the tree recognised, and a search of the parse table reveals the parser action which completed its recognition, but that information in itself may not be enough to locate exactly where in the tree the action took place. However, the additional information required is static, and so can be pre-compiled as the automata themselves are built up. For each action transition (the action, plus the start and finish states) we record the tree address that the transition reaches (we call this the action-site, or just a-site for short). During parse recovery, when the parse table indicates an action that licensed an item, we look up the relevant transition to discover where in the tree (or trees, if we are traversing several simultaneously) the present item must be, so that we can correctly construct a derivation tree. 5","Technical details 5.1 Constructing the automata We identify each node in an elementary tree 7 with an elementary address"]},{"title":"7/i.","paragraphs":["The root of 7 has the address 7/e where e is the empty string.

This involves retracing the steps of the recognition process in reverse. At each point, we look for a rule that would have caused the inclusion of item in I. Each of these rules involves some transition (q, a, ql) • 5k for some k where a is one of the parser actions, and from this transition we consult the set of elementary addresses in a-sites(q, a, q~) to establish how to build the derivation tree. We eventually reach items added during the initialization phase and the process ends. Given the way our parser has been designed, some search will be needed to find the items we need. As usual, the need for such search can be reduced through the inclusion of pointers in items, though this is at the cost of increasing parsing time. There are various points in the following description where nondeterminism exists. By exploring all possible paths, it would be straightforward to produce an AND/OR derivation tree that encodes all derivation trees for the input string. We use the procedure der((T, q, If, r, l', r']), r) which completes the partial derivation tree r by backing up through the moves of the automata in which q is a state.

(1998) report preliminary results using this technique on a wide-coverage DTG (a variant of LTAG) grammar. Table 1 gives statistics for three common verbs in the grammar: the total number of trees, the size of the merged automaton (before any optimisation has occurred) and the size of the minimised automaton. The final column gives the average of the number of trees that share each state in the automaton. These figures show substantial optimisation is possible, both in the space requirements of the grammar and in the sharing of processing state between trees during parsing. As mentioned earlier, the algorithms we have presented assume that elementary trees have one anchor and one spine. Some trees, how-ever, have secondary anchors (for example, a subcategorised preposition). One possible way of including such cases would be to construct automata from secondary anchors up the secondary spine to the main spine. The automata for both the primary and secondary anchors associated with a lexical item could then be merged, minimized and used for parsing as above. Using automata for parsing has a long history dating back to transition networks (Woods, 1970). More recent uses include Alshawi (1996) and Eisner (1997). These approaches differ from the present paper in their use of automata as part of the grammar formalism itself. Here, automata are used purely as a stepping-stone to parser optimisation: we make no linguistic claims about them. Indeed one view of this work is that it frees the linguistic descriptions from overt computational considerations. This work has perhaps more in common with the technology of LR parsing as a parser optimisation technique, and it would be interesting to compare our approach with a direct application of LR ideas to LTAGs.
