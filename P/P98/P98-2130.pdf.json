Introduction","paragraphs":["Many authors have developed dependency theories that cover cross-linguistically the most significant phenomena of natural language syntax: the approaches range from generative formalisms (Sgall et al. 1986), to lexically-based descriptions (Mel'cuk 1988), to hierarchical organizations of linguistic knowledge (Hudson 1990) (Fraser, Hudson 1992), to constrained categorial grammars (Milward 1994). Also, a number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al. 1994) (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996), including a stochastic treatment (Eisner 1996) and an object-oriented parallel parsing method (Neuhaus, Hahn 1996). However, dependency theories have never been explicitly linked to formal models. Parsers and applications usually refer to grammars built around a core of dependency concepts, but there is a great variety in the description of syntactic constraints, from rules that are very similar to CFG productions (Gaifman 1965) to individual binary relations on words or syntactic categories (Covington 1990) (Sleator, Temperley 1993).","know","S UB/ SCOMP","I ~likes","SUB¢ ~OBJ John beans Figure 1.

Dependency syntax is attractive because of the immediate mapping of dependency trees on the predicate-arguments structure and because of the treatment of free-word order constructs (Sgall et al. 1986) (Mercuk 1988). Desirable properties of lexicalized formalisms (Schabes 1990), like finite ambiguity and decidability of string acceptance, intuitively hold for dependency syntax.","On the contrary, the formal studies on dependency theories are rare in the literature. Gaifman (1965) showed that projective dependency grammars, expressed by dependency rules on syntactic categories, are weakly equivalent to context-free grammars. And, in fact, it is possible to devise O(n 3) parsers for this formalism (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996), or other projective variations (Milward 1994) (Eisner 1996). On the controlled relaxation of projective constraints, Nasr (1995) has introduced the condition of pseudo° projectivity, which provides some controlled looser constraints on arc crossing in a dependency tree, and has developed a polynomial parser based on a graph-structured stack. Neuhaus and Broker (1997) have recently showed that the general recognition problem for non-projective dependency grammars (what they call"]},{"title":"discontinuous DG)","paragraphs":["is NP-complete. They have devised a discontinuous DG with exclusively lexical categories (no traces, as most dependency theories do), and dealing with free word order constructs through a looser subtree ordering. This formalism, considered as the most straightforward extension to a projective formalism, permits the reduction of the vertex cover problem to the dependency recognition problem, thus yielding the NP-completeness result.","However, even if banned from the dependency literature, the use of non lexical categories is only a notational variant of some graph structures already present in some formalisms (see, e.g., Word Grammar (Hudson 1990)). This paper introduces a lexicalized dependency formalism, which deals 787 with long distance dependencies, and a polynomial parsing algorithm. The formalism is projective, and copes with long-distance dependency phenomena through the introduction of non lexical categories. The non lexical categories allow us to keep inalterate the condition of projectivity, encoded in the notion of derivation. The core of the grammar relies on predicate-argument structures associated with lexical items, where the head is a word and dependents are categories linked by edges labelled with dependency relations. Free word order constructs are dealt with by constraining displacements via a set data structure in the derivation relation. The introduction of non lexical categories also permits the resolution of the inconsistencies pointed out by Neuhaus and Broker in Word Grammar (1997).","The parser is an Earley type parser with a polynomial complexity, that encodes the dependency trees associated with a sentence.","The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a formal dependency system that describes the linguistic knowledge. Section 3 presents an Earley-type parser: we illustrate the algorithm, trace an example, and discuss the complexity results. Section 4 concludes the paper."]},{"title":"2.

Intuitively, a dependency rule constrains one node (head) and its dependents in a dependency tree: the d-quad sequence states the order of elements, both the head (# position) and the dependents (d-quads). The grammar is lexicalized, because each dependency rule has a lexical anchor in its head (x:X). A d-quad <rjYjujxj> identifies a dependent of category Yi, co-rm-ect6d with the head via a dependency relation r i. Each element of the d-quad sequence is possibly fissociated with a u-index (uj) and a set of u-triples (x j). Both uj and xjcan be mill elements, i.e. 0 and ~, respectively. A u-triple (x-component of the d-quad) <u, R, Y> bounds the area of the dependency tree where the trace can be located. Given the constraints I and II, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the u-indices and the u-triples of the d-quads.

Now we introduce a notion of derivation for this formalism. As one dependency rule can be used more than once in a derivation process, it is necessary to replace the u-indices with unique symbols (progressive integers) before the actual use. The replacement must be consistent in the u and the x components. When all the indices in the rule are replaced, we say that the dependency rule (as well as the u-triple) is instantiated.

Parsing issues In this section we describe an Earley-style parser for the formalism in section 2.

Dependency tree of the sentence \"Beans I know John likes\", given the grammar G1. 789 from the grammar. The selection is carried out by matching the head of the rules with the words of the sentence. The second step follows Earley's phases on the dependency rules, together with the treatment of u-indices and u-triples. This off-line technique is not uncommon in lexicalized grammars, since each Earley's prediction would waste much computation time (a grammar factor) in the body of the algorithm, because dependency rules do not abstract over categories (cf. (Schabes 1990)).","In order to recognize a sentence of n words, n+l sets Si of items are built. An item represents a subtree of the total dependency tree associated with the sentence. An item is a 5-tuple <Dotted-rule, Position, g-index, v-index, T-stack>. Dotted-rule is a dependency rule with a dot between two d-quads of the d-quad sequence. Position is the input position where the parsing of the subtree represented by this item began (the leftmost position on the spanned string). It-index and v-index are two integers that correspond to the indices of a word object in a derivation. T-stack is a stack of sets of u-triples to be satisfied yet: the sets of u-triples (including empty sets, when applicable) provided by the various items are stacked in order to verify the consumption of one u-triple in the appropriate subtree (cf. the notion of derivation above). Each time the parser predicts a dependent, the set of u-triples associated with it is pushed onto the stack. In order for an item to enter the completer phase, the top of T-stack must be the empty set, that means that all the u-triples associated with that item have been satisfied. The sets of u-triples in T-stack are always inserted at the top, after having checked that each u-triple is not already present in T-stack (the check neglects the u-index). In case a u-triple is present, the deeper u-triple is deleted, and the T-stack will only contain the u-triple in the top set (see the derivation relation above). When satisfying a u-triple, the T-stack is treated as a set data structure, since the formalism does not pose any constraint on the order of consumption of the u-triples.","Following Earley's style, the general idea is to move the dot rightward, while predicting the dependents of the head of the rule. The dot can advance across a d-quadruple <rjYiui'q> or across the special symbol #. The d-q-ua-d-irhmediately following the dot can be indexed uj. This is acknowledged by predicting an item (representing the subtree rooted by that dependent), and inserting a new progressive integer in the fourth component of the item (v-index). xj is pushed onto T-stack: the substructure rooted by a node of category Yi must contain the trace nodes of the type licensed by the u-triples. The prediction of a trace occurs as in the case 2) of the derivation process.

Each item is a 5-tuple <Dotted-rule, Position, Ix-index, v-index, T-stack>: Dotted rules are in a number which is a constant of the grammar, but in off-line parsing this number is bounded by O(n). Position is bounded by O(n). Ix-index and v-index are two integers that keep trace of u-triple satisfaction, and do not add an own contribution to the complexity count. T-stack has a number of elements which depends on the maximum length of the chain of predictions. Since the number of rules is O(n), the size of the stack is O(n). The elements of T-stack contain all the u-triples introduced up to an item and which are to be satisfied (deleted) yet. A u-triple is of the form <u,R,Y>: u is an integer that is ininfluent, Ra D, Ya C. Because of the PUSH-UNION operation on T-stack, the number of possible u-triples scattered throughout the elements of T-stack is IDIICI. The number of different stacks is given by the dispositions of IDllCI u-triples on O(n) elements; so, O(nlOllCl). Then, the number of items in a set of items is bounded by O(n 2+ IDIICI) and there are n sets of items (O(n 3+ IDI ICI)).","The time complexity of the parser is O(n 7+3 IDI ICI). Each of the three phases executes an INSERT of an item in a set. The cost of the INSERT operation depends on the implementation of the set data structure; we assume it to be linear (O(n 2+ IDIICI)) to make easy calculations.

The total complexity of the algorithm is O(n 7+3 IDttCt).","We are conscious that the (grammar dependent) exponent can be very high, but the treatment of the set data structure for the u-triples requires expensive operations (cf. a stack). Actually this formalism is able to deal a high degree of free word order (for a comparable result, see (Becker, Rambow 1995)). Also, the complexity factor due to the cardinalities of the sets D and C is greatly reduced if we consider that linguistic constraints restrict the displacement of several categories and relations. A better estimation of complexity can only be done when we consider empirically the impact of the linguistic constraints in writing a wide coverage grammar. 4. Conclusions","The paper has described a dependency formalism and an Earley-type parser with a polynomial complexity.","The introduction of non lexical categories in a dependency formalism allows the treatment of long distance dependencies and of free word order, and to aovid the NP-completeness. The grammar factor at the exponent can be reduced if we furtherly restrict the long distance dependencies through the introduction of a more restrictive data structure than the set, as it happens in some constrained phrase structure formalisms (Vijay-Schanker, Weir 1994).","A compilation step in the parser can produce parse tables that account for left-corner information (this optimization of the Earley algorithm has already been proven fruitful in (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996))."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Becker T., Rambow O.,"]},{"title":"Parsing non-immediate dominance relations,","paragraphs":["Proc.
