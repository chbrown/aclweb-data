But for unrestricted, extended spontaneous discourses, highly natural accentuation is often achieved only by costly human post-editing. A better understanding of the effects of discourse context on accentual variation is needed not only to fully model this fundamental prosodic feature for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems, but also to further the integration of prosody into speech understanding and concept-to-speech (CTS) synthesis systems at the appropriate level of linguistic representation.","This paper presents an empirically motivated theory of the discourse focusing function of accent. The theory describes for the first time the interacting contributions to accent prediction made by factors related to the local and global attentional status of discourse referents in a discourse model (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). The ability of the focusing features to predict accent for a blind test corpus is examined using machine learning. Because attentional status is a property of referring expressions, a novel approach to accent prediction is proposed to allow for the integration of word-based and constituent-based linguistic features in the models to be learned.","The task of accent assignment is redefined as the prediction of patterns of deviation from citation form accentuation. Crucially, these deviations are captured at the constituent level. This task redefinition has two novel properties: (1) it bootstraps directly on knowledge about citation form or so-called \"context-independent\" prosody embodied in current TTS technology; and (2) the abstraction from word to constituent allows for the natural integration of focusing features into the prediction methods.","Results of the constituent-based accent prediction experiments show that for two speakers from a corpus of spontaneous direction-giving monologues, accent assignment can be improved by up to 4%-6% relative to a hypothetical baseline system that would produce only citation-form accentuation, giving error rate reductions of 11%-25%."]},{"title":"2 Accent and attention","paragraphs":["Much theoretical work on intonational meaning has focused on the association of accent with NEW information, and lack of accent with GIVEN information, where given and new are defined with respect to whether or not the information is already repre-sented in a discourse model. While this association reflects a general tendency (Brown, 1983), empirical studies on longer discourses have shown this simple dichotomy cannot explain important sub-classes of expressions, such as accented pronouns, cf. (Terken, 1984; Hirschberg, 1993).","We propose a new theory of the relationship between accent and attention, based on an enriched taxonomy of given/new information status provided by both the LOCAL (centering) and GLOBAL (focus stack model) attentional state models in Grosz and Sidner's discourse modeling theory (1986)."]},{"title":"939","paragraphs":["Analysis of a 20-minute spontaneous story-telling monologue t identified separate but interacting contributions of grammatical function, form of referring expression and accentuation 2 in conveying the attentional status of a discourse referent. These interactions can be formally expressed in the framework of attentional modeling by the following principles of interpretation:","• The LEXICAL FORM OF A REFERRING EXPRESSION indicates the level of attentional processing, i.e., pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al., 1995).","• The GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION of a referring expression reflects the local attentional status of the referent, i.e., subject position generally holds the highest ranking member of the forward-looking centers list (Cf list), while direct object holds the next highest ranking member of the Cf list (Grosz et al., 1995; Kameyama, 1985).","• The ACCENTING of a referring expression serves as an inference cue to shift attention to a new backward-looking center (Cb), or to mark the global (re)introduction of a referent; LACK OF ACCENT serves as an inference cue to maintain attentional focus on the Cb, Cf list members or global referents (Nakatani, 1997).","The third principle concerning accent interpretation defines for the first time how accent serves uniformly to shift attention and lack of accent serves to maintain attention, at either the local or global level of discourse structure. This principle describing the discourse focusing functions of accent directly explains 86.5% (173/200) of the referring expressions in the spontaneous narrative, as shown in Table 1.

Ripper (Cohen, 1995), is used to acquire accent classification systems from a training corpus of correctly classified examples, each defined by a vector of feature values, or predictors. 3 3.2 Citation-based Accent Classification The accentuation of baseNPs is coded according to the relationship of the actual accenting (i.e. accented versus unaccented) on the words in the baseNP to the accenting predicted by a TTS system that received each sentence in the corpus in isola-tion. The actual accenting is determined by prosodic labeling using the ToBI standard (Pitrelli et al., 1994). Word accent predictions are produced by the Bell Laboratories NewTTS system (Sproat, 1997). NewTTS incorporates complex nominal accenting rules (Sproat, 1994) as well as general, word-based accenting rules (Hirschberg, 1993). It is assumed","ZRipper is similar to CART (Breiman et al., 1984), but it directly produces IF-THEN logic rules instead of decision trees and also utilizes incremental error reduction techniques in combination with novel rule optimization strategies. for the purposes of this study that NewTTS generally assigns citation-style accentuation when passed sentences in isolation.","For each baseNP, one of the following four accenting patterns is assigned:","• CITATION FORM: exact match between actual and \"ITS-assigned word accenting.","• SUPRA: one or more accented words are predicted unaccented by TFS; otherwise, \"ITS predictions match actual accenting.","• REDUCED: one or more unaccented words are predicted accented by TTS; otherwise, \"FrS predictions match actual accenting.","• SHIFT: at least one accented word is predicted unaccented by \"ITS, and at least one unaccented word is predicted accented by \"ITS.

The citation form accent percentages serve as the baseline for the accent prediction experiments; correct classification rates above 75.8% and 60.2% for H1 and H3 respectively would represent performance above and beyond the 941 state-of-the-art citation form accentuation models, gained by direct modeling of cases of supra, reduced or shifted constituent-based accentuation. 3.3 Predictors 3.3.1 Lexical features The use of set features, which are handled by Ripper, extends lexical word features to the constituent level. Two set-valued features, BROAD CLASS SE-QUENCE and LEMMA SEQUENCE, represent lexical information. These features consist of an ordered list of the broad class part-of-speech (POS) tags or word lemmas for the words making up the baseNP. For example, the lemma sequence for the NP,"]},{"title":"the Harvard Square T stop,","paragraphs":["is {the, Harvard, Square, T, stop}. The corresponding broad class sequence is {determiner, noun, noun, noun, noun}. Broad class tags are derived using Brill's (1995) part-of-speech tagger, and word lemma information is produced by NewTTS (Sproat, 1997).","POS information is used to assign accenting in nearly all speech synthesis systems. Initial word-based experiments on our corpus showed that broad class categories performed slightly better than both the function-content distinction and the POS tags themselves, giving 69%-81% correct word predictions (Nakatani, 1997). 3.3.2 Syntactic constituency features The CLAUSE TYPE feature represents global syntactic constituency information, while the BASENP TYPE feature represents local or NP-internal syntactic constituency information.

As for baseNP types, the baseNP type of baseNPs not dominated by any NP node is SIMPLE-BASENP. BaseNPs that occur in complex NPs (and are thus dominated by at least one NP node) are labeled according to whether the baseNP contains the head word for the dominating NP. Those that are dominated by only one NP node and contain the head word for the dominating NP are HEAD-BASENPS; all other NPs in a complex NP are CHILD-BASENPS. Conjoined noun phrases involve additional categories of baseNPs that are collapsed into the CONJUNCT-BASENP category.

Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). The consensus labels for segment-initial boundaries provide a linear segmentation of a discourse into discourse segments. Coreferential relations are coded by two labelers using DTT (Discourse Tagging Tool) (Aone and Bennett, 1995). To compute coreference chains, only the relation of strict coference is used. Two NPs, npl and np2, are in a strict coreference relationship, when np2 occurs after npl in the discourse and realizes the same discourse entity that is realized by npl. Reference chains are then automatically computed by linking noun phrases in strict coference relations into the longest possible chains.","Given a consensus linear segmentation and reference chains, global focusing status is determined. For each baseNP, if it does not occur in a reference chain, and thus is realized only once in the dis-942 course, it is assigned the SINGLE-MENTION focusing status.

The exception seems to be the rule that adverbial noun phrases belong to the supra accent class. However, new interactions of local focusing features (grammatical function and form of expression) with lexical information are discovered by Ripper. It also appears that as suggested by earlier experiments,","5In the rules themselves, written in Prolog-style notation, the tilde character is a two-place operator, X -,~ Y, signifying that Y is a member of the set-value for feature X. lexical features trade-off for one other as well as with form of expression information. In comparing the first rules in each set, for example, the clauses broad class seq ,,~ det and lemma seq ,~ the substitute for one another. However, in the first rule set the less specific broad class constraint must be combined with another abstract constraint, form of expr=proper name, to achieve a similar description of a rule for reduced accentuation on common place names, such as the Harvard Square T stop. 5 Conclusion Accent prediction experiments on noun phrase constituents demonstrated that deviations from citation form accentuation (supra, reduced and shift classes) can be directly modeled. Machine learning experiments using not only lexical and syntactic features, but also discourse focusing features identified by a new theory of accent interpretation in discourse, showed that accent assignment can be improved by up to 4%-6% relative to a hypothetical baseline system that would produce only citation-form accentuation, giving error rate reductions of 11%-25%. In general, constituent-based accentuation is most accurately learned from lexical information readily available in TTS systems. For CTS systems, comparable performance may be achieved using only higher level attentional features. There are several other lessons to be learned, conceming individual speaker, domain dependent and domain independent effects on accent modeling.","First, it is perhaps counterintuitively harder to predict deviations from citation form accentuation for speakers who exhibit a great deal of non-citation-style accenting behavior, such as speaker H3. Accent prediction results for H1 exceeded those for H3, although about 15% more of H3's tokens exhibited non-citation form accentuation. Finding the appropriate parameters by which to describe the prosody of individual speakers is an important goal that can be advanced by using machine learning techniques to explore large spaces of hypotheses.","Second, it is evident from the strong performance of the word lemma sequence models that deviations from citation-form accentuation may often be expressed by lexicalized rules of some sort. Lexical-ized rules in fact have proven useful in other areas of natural language statistical modeling, such as POS tagging (Brill, 1995) and parsing (Collins, 1996). The specific lexicalized rules learned for many of the models would not have followed from any theoretical or empirical proposals in the literature. It may be that domain dependent training using au-944 tomatic learning is the appropriate way to develop practical models of accenting patterns on different corpora. And especially for different speakers in the same domain, automatic learning methods seem to be the only efficient way to capture perhaps idiolectical variation in accenting.","Finally, it should be noted that notwithstanding individual speaker and domain dependent effects, domain independent factors identified by the new theory of accent and attention do contribute to experimental performance. The two local focusing features, grammatical function and form of referring expression, enable improvements above the citation-form baseline, especially in combination with lexical information. Global focusing information is of limited use by itself, but as may have been hypothesized, contributes to accent prediction in combination with local focus, lexical and syntactic features.
