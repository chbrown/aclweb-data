The constructed graph is visualized with words that represent the topics of the threads, and words that represent new information in each article. The threading technique is suitable for Webcasting (push) applications. A threading server determines relationships among articles from various news sources, and creates files containing their threading information. This information is represented in eXtended Markup Language (XML), and can be visualized on most Web browsers. The XML-based representation and a current prototype are described in this paper. 1 Introduction The vast quantity of information available today makes it difficult to search for and understand the information that we want. If there are many related documents about a topic, it is important to capture their relationships so that we can obtain a clearer overview. However, most information resources, including newspaper articles do not have explicit relationships. For example, although documents on the Web are connected by hyperlinks, relationships cannot be specified.","Webcasting (\"push\") applications such as Pointcast i constitute a promising solution to the problem of information overloading, but the articles they provide do not have links, or else must be manually linked at a high cost in terms of time and effort.","This paper describes methods for relating newspaper articles automatically, and its application for a Webcasting application. A set of article on a par-I htt p://www.pointcast.com ticular topic is ordered chronologically, and the results are represented as a directed graph. There are various ways of relating documents and visualizing their structure. For example, USENET articles can be accessed by means of newsreader software. In the system, a label (title) is attached to each posted message, specifying whether it deals with a new topic or is a reply to a previous message. A chain of articles on a topic is called a"]},{"title":"thread.","paragraphs":["In this case, the relationships between the articles are explicitly defined. This post/reply-based approach makes it possible for a reader to group all the messages on a particular topic. However, it is difficult to capture the story of the thread from its thread structure, since appropriate titles are not added to the messages.","This paper aims to provide ways of relating multiple news articles and representing their structure in a way that is easy to understand and computationally inexpensive. A set of relationships is defined here as a directed graph. A node indicates an article, and an arc from node X to Y indicates that the article X is followed by Y (or that X is adjacent to Y). An article contains both known and unknown (new) information. Known information consists of words shared by the beginning and ending points of an arc. When node X is adjacent to Y, the words are represented by (X fq Y). The known information is called"]},{"title":"genus words","paragraphs":["in this paper.

In this paper, genus and differentiae words are used to calculate the similarities between two articles, and to visualize topics in a set of articles.","Since articles are ordered chronologically, there are some time constraints on the connectivity of nodes. A graph is created by constructing an adjacency matrix for nodes, which in turn is created from a similarity matrix for nodes.","Some potential features of articles in a set can be determined by analyzing some formal aspects of the 1307 d2 d3"]},{"title":"od5 .od6","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Example of a Directed Graph G corresponding graph.

An efficient algorithm for finding such paths is described, later in the paper.","Application of the threading method to documents on the Web would be very useful because, although such documents are connected by hyperlinks, their relationships cannot be specified. In this paper, generated threads by this method are represented in eXtended Markup Language (XML) (XML, 1997), which is the proposed standard for exchange of information on the Web. XML-based threads can be used by webcasting or push services, since various tools for parsing and visualizing threads are available.","In Section 2, a directed graph structure for articles is defined, and the procedure for constructing a directed graph is described in Section 3.

The contribution of reference nodes is not clear in V (d6, ds, and d9 have max in-degrees). Nodes that have high in-degree have two characteristics. The first is that when the articles contain multiple topics, they have many in-bound arcs, each representing a different topic. The second is that when the articles are closely related for a particular topic, the in-degrees of related nodes increase, since these articles are connected to each other. 4.2 Path A path from one node to another node shows the \"story flow\" of articles. Multiple paths between two nodes show different stories about the nodes. For example, there are three paths between dl, which is a first node, and dl0. The shortest path (dl, d2,, dT, dl0) gives a simple outline of the articles. The longest path (d,, d2, d7,"]},{"title":"ds,","paragraphs":["dg, dl0) contains all related information on the topic.

Furthermore, we can abstract articles by reducing cycles to single nodes. 5 XML-based Representation for Threads It is important that the threading information be exchangeable when we apply our method to Web documents. Extended Markup Language (XML) is a proposed standard (XML, 1997) specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In XML, tags and","3Formally, it is called a semi-cycle, since the graph is directed. 1311 attributes can be defined, whereas in HTML they are fixed. XML documents can be used to exchange information that has various data structure. For example, Channel Definition Format (CDF)(CDF, 1997) is a standard to offer frequently updated collections of information (channels) on Web. A CDF document can contains a collection of articles that have tree structure. In this paper, graph structures of created threads are represented in XML. Figure 10 shows a part of the thread in Figure 8.","The <thread> tag shows the beginning of the thread. It contains a set of deceptions for articles, each marked <article>. Each instance of the <article> tag has a reference to its source document, an identifying id, genus and differentia words, and other information on the article. The tag <follows> is used to denote arcs from the article to related articles.","The XML documents can be separate from the source articles. They can be provided as part of a \"push\" service for Internet users, offering a solution to the problem of information overloading. In such a service,"]},{"title":"gatherer","paragraphs":["collects articles from Web sites and"]},{"title":"threader","paragraphs":["makes threads for them. The results are stored in XML, and then pushed to subscribers who can capture the flow of topics by following the threads. In another scenario, when a user gets an article, and wants to see its origin or the next related article, he or she gets the thread containing the article by consulting the threading server. The advantage of using XML is that it will be supported by various tools, including Web browsers. Now we are prototyping the threading service system by using a XML processor developed at our laboratory. Figure 12 shows a Java applet for viewing threads, which can run on major Web browsers. A XML document is parsed and visualized as tree-like structure. 6 Related Work There have been several studies how to relate articles (McKeown"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1995; Yamamoto"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1995; Mani"]},{"title":"et al.,","paragraphs":["1997).
