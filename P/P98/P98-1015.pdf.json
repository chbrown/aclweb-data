Within complex nominals, however, few overt clues are available. Systems that analyze such nominals must compensate for the lack of surface clues with other information. One way is to load the system with lexical semantics for nouns or adjectives. This merely shifts the problem elsewhere: how do we define the lexical semantics and build large semantic lexicons? Another way is to find constructions"]},{"title":"similar","paragraphs":["to a given complex nominal, for which the relationships are already known. This is the way we chose, but it too has drawbacks. Similarity is not easily assessed, similar analyzed constructions may not exist, and if they do exist, their analysis may not be appropriate for the current nominal.","We present a semi-automatic system that identifies semantic relationships in noun phrases without using precoded noun or adjective semantics. Instead, partial matching on previously analyzed noun phrases leads to a tentative interpretation of a new input. Processing can start without prior analyses, but the early stage requires user interaction. As more noun phrases are analyzed, the system learns to find better interpretations and reduces its reliance on the user. In experiments on English technical texts the system correctly identified 60-70% of relationships automatically."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Any system that extracts knowledge from text cannot ignore complex noun phrases. In technical domains especially, noun phrases carry much of the information. Part of that information is contained in words; cataloguing the semantics of single words for computational purposes is a difficult task that has received much attention. But part of the information in noun phrases is contained in the relationships between components.","We have built a system for noun modifier relationship (NMR) analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases. Syntactic analysis finds noun phrases in a sentence and provides a flat list of premodifiers and postmodifying prepositional phrases and appositives. The NMR analyzer first brackets the flat list of premodifiers into modifier-head pairs. Next, it assigns NMRs to each pair. NMRs are also assigned to the relationships between the noun phrase and each postmodifying phrase. 2"]},{"title":"Background 2.1 Noun Compounds","paragraphs":["A head noun along with a noun premodifier is often called a noun compound.

Our experiments have found no opaque or exocentric compounds in the test texts."]},{"title":"96 2.2 Semantic Relations in Noun Phrases","paragraphs":["Most of the research on relationships between nouns and modifiers deals with noun compounds, but these relationships also hold between nouns and adjective premodifiers or postmodifying prepositional phrases. Lists of semantic labels have been proposed, based on the theory that a compound expresses one of a small number of covert semantic relations.","Levi (1978) argues that semantics and word formation make noun-noun compounds a heterogeneous class. She removes opaque compounds and adds nominal non-predicating adjectives. For this class Levi offers nine semantic labels. According to her theory, these labels represent underlying predicates deleted during compound formation. George (1987) disputes the claim that Levi's non-predicating adjectives never appear in predicative position.","Warren (1978) describes a multi-level system of semantic labels for noun-noun relationships. Warren (1984) extends the earlier work to cover adjective premodifiers as well as nouns. The similarity of the two lists suggests that many adjectives and premodifying nouns can be handled by the same set of semantic relations."]},{"title":"2.3 Recognizing Semantic Relations","paragraphs":["Programs that uncover the relationships in modifier-noun compounds often base their analysis on the semantics of the individual words (or a composition thereof). Such systems assume the existence of some semantic lexicon.","Leonard's system (1984) assigns semantic labels to noun-noun compounds based on a dictionary that includes taxonomic and meronymic (partwhole) information, information about the syntactic behaviour of nouns and about the relationships between nouns and verbs. Finin (1986) produces multiple semantic interpretations of modifier-noun compounds. The interpretations are based on precoded semantic class information and domaindependent frames describing the roles that can be associated with certain nouns. Ter Stal's system (1996) identifies concepts in text and unifies them with structures extracted from a hand-coded lexicon containing syntactic information, logical form templates and taxonomic information.","In an attempt to avoid the hand-coding required in other systems, Vanderwende (1993) automatically extracts semantic features of nouns from online dictionaries. Combinations of features imply particular semantic interpretations of the relationship between two nouns in a compound."]},{"title":"3 Noun Modifier Relationship Labels","paragraphs":["Table 1 lists the NMRs used by our analyzer.

The paraphrases serve as definitions in this section and to help with interpretation during user interactions (as illustrated in section 6). In the analyzer, awkward paraphrases with adjectives could be improved by replacing adjectives with their WordNet pertainyms (Miller, 1990), giving, for example, \"charity benefits from charitable donation\" instead of \"charitable benefits from charitable donation\"."]},{"title":"Agent:","paragraphs":["compound is performed by modifier student protest, band concert, military assault"]},{"title":"Beneficiary:","paragraphs":["modifier benefits from compound student price, charitable donation"]},{"title":"Cause:","paragraphs":["modifier causes compound exam anxiety, overdue fine"]},{"title":"Container:","paragraphs":["modifier contains compound printer tray, flood water, film music, story idea"]},{"title":"Content:","paragraphs":["modifier is contained in compound paper tray, eviction notice, oil pan"]},{"title":"Destination:","paragraphs":["modifier is destination of compound game bus, exit route, entrance stairs 97"]},{"title":"Equative:","paragraphs":["modifier is also head composer arranger, player coach","Instrument: modifier is used in compound electron microscope, diesel engine, laser printer","Located: modifier is located at compound building site, home town, solar system"]},{"title":"Location:","paragraphs":["modifier is the location of compound lab printer, internal combustion, desert storm"]},{"title":"Material:","paragraphs":["compound is made of modifier carbon deposit, gingerbread man, water vapottr","Object: modifier is acted on by compound engine repair, horse doctor"]},{"title":"Possessor:","paragraphs":["modifier has compound national debt, student loan, company car","Product: modifier is a product of compound automobile factory, light bulb, colour printer","Property: compound is modifier blue car, big house, fast computer"]},{"title":"Purpose:","paragraphs":["compound is meant for modifier concert hall soup pot, grinding abrasive"]},{"title":"Result:","paragraphs":["modifier is a result of compound storm cloud, cold virus, death penalty"]},{"title":"Source:","paragraphs":["modifier is the source of compound foreign capital, chest pain, north wind"]},{"title":"Time:","paragraphs":["modifier is the time of compound winter semester, late supper, morning class"]},{"title":"Topic:","paragraphs":["compound is concerned with modifier computer expert, safety standard, horror novel"]},{"title":"4 Noun Modifier Bracketing","paragraphs":["Before assigning NMRs, the system must bracket the head noun and the premodifier sequence into modifier-head pairs. Example (2) shows the bracketing for noun phrase (1). (1) dynamic high impedance microphone (2) (dynamic ((high impedance) microphone)) The bracketing problem for noun-noun-noun compounds has been investigated by Liberrnan & Sproat (1992), Pustejovsky et al. (1993), Resnik (1993) and Lauer (1995) among others. Since the NMR analyzer must handle premodifier sequences of any length with both nouns and adjectives, it requires more general techniques. Our semi-automatic bracketer (Barker, 1998) allows for any number of adjective or noun premodifiers.","After bracketing, each non-atomic element of a bracketed pair is considered a subphrase of the original phrase. The subphrases for the bracketing in (2) appear in"]},{"title":"(3), (4) and (5).","paragraphs":["(3) high impedance (4) high_impedance microphone (5) dynamic high_impedance_microphone Each subphrase consists of a modifier (possibly compound, as in (4)) and a head (possibly compound, as in (5)). The NMR analyzer assigns an NMR to the modifier-head pair that makes up each subphrase.","Once an NMR has been assigned, the system must store the assignment to help automate future processing. Instead of memorizing complete noun phrases (or even complete subphrases) and analyses, the system reduces compound modifiers and compound heads to their own local heads and stores these reduced pairs with their assigned NMR. This allows it to analyze different noun phrases that have only reduced pairs in common with previous phrases. For example, (6) and (7) have the reduced pair (8) in common. If (6) has already been analyzed, its analysis can be used to assist in the analysis of (7)--see section 5.1. (6) (dynamic ((high impedance) microphone)) (7) (dynamic (cardioid (vocal microphone))) (8) (dynamic microphone) 5 Assigning NMRs Three kinds of construction require NMR assignments: the modifier-head pairs from the bracketed premodifier sequence; postmodifying prepositional phrases; appositives.","These three kinds of input can be generalized to a single form--a triple consisting of modifier, head and marker (M, H, Mk). For premodifiers, Mk is the symbol nil, since no lexical item links the premodifier to the head. For postmodifying prepositional phrases Mk is the preposition. For appositives, Mk is the symbol appos. The (M, H, Mk) triples for examples (9), (10) and (11) appear in Table 2.

Appositives are automatically assigned Equative."]},{"title":"5.1 Distance Between Triples","paragraphs":["The distance between two triples is a measure of the degree to which their modifiers, heads and markers match. Table 3 gives the eight different values for distance used by NMR analysis.","The analyzer looks for previous triples at the lower distances before attempting to find triples at higher distances. For example, it will try to find identical triples before trying to find triples whose markers do not match.","Several things about the distance measures require explanation. First, a preposition is more similar to a nil marker than to a different preposition. Unlike a different preposition, the nil marker is not known to be different from the marker in an overtly marked pair.","Next, no evidence suggests that triples with matching M are more similar or less similar than triples with matching H (distances 3 and 6).","Triples with matching prepositional marker (distance 4) are considered more similar than triples with matching M or H only. A preposition is an overt indicator of the relationship between M and H (see Quirk, 1985: chapter 9) so a correlation is more likely between the preposition and the NMR than between a given M or H and the NMR.","If the current triple has a prepositional marker not seen in any previous triple (distance 5), the system finds candidate NMRs in its NMR marker dictionary. This dictionary was constructed from a list of about 50 common atomic and phrasal prepositions. The various meanings of each preposition were mapped to NMRs by hand. Since the list of prepositions is small, dictionary con' struction was not a difficult knowledge engineering task (requiring just twenty hours of work of a secondary school student)."]},{"title":"5.2 The Best NMRs","paragraphs":["The lists of candidate NMRs consist of all those NMRs previously assigned to (M, H, Mk) triples at a minimum distance from the triple under analysis. If the minimum distance was 3 or 6, there may be two candidate lists: LM contains the NMRs previously assigned to triples with matching M, L,-with matching H. The analyzer at-tempts to choose a set R of candidates to suggest to the user as the best NMRs for the current triple,","If there is one list L of candidate NMRs, R contains the NMR (or NMRs) that occur most frequently in L For two lists LM and L,, R could be found in several ways, We could take R to contain the most frequent NMRs in LM u L,. This absolute frequency approach has a bias towards NMRs in the larger of the two lists.","Alternatively, the system could prefer NMRs with the highest relative frequency in their lists. If there is less variety in the NMRs in LM than in LH, M might be a more consistent indicator of NMR than H. Consider example (12).
