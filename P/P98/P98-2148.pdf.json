The prediction unit in this model is all attribute of \"bunsetsu\". This is represented by the product of the head of content words and that of function words. The relation between the attributes of \"bunsetsu\" is ruled by a context-free grammar. The word sequences axe predicted from the attribute using word n-gram model. The spell of Unknow word is predicted using character n-grain model. This model is robust in that it can compute the probability of an arbitrary string and is complete in that it models from unknown word to dependency at the same time. 1","Introduction An effectiveness of stochastic language modeling as a methodology of natural language processing has been attested by various applications to the recognition system such as speech recognition and to the analysis system such as paxt-of-speech (POS) tagger. In this methodology a stochastic language model with some parameters is built and they axe estimated in order to maximize its prediction power (minimize the cross entropy) on an unknown input. Considering a single application, it might be better to estimate the parameters taking account of expected accuracy of recognition or analysis. This method is, however, heavily dependent on the problem and of_ fers no systematic solution, as fax as we know. The methodology of stochastic language modeling, however, allows us to separate, from various frameworks of natural language processing, the language description model common to them and enables us a systematic improvement of each application.","In this framework a description on a language is represented as a map from a sequence of alphabetic characters to a probability value. The first model is C. E. Shannon's n-gram model (Shannon, 1951). The parameters of the model are estimated from the frequency of n character sequences of the alphabet (n-gram) on a corpus containing a large number of sentences of a language. This is the same model as 0 This work is done when the auther was at Kyoto Univ. used in almost all of the recent practicM applications in that it describes only relations between sequential elements. Some linguistic phenomena, however, axe better described by assuming relations between sepaxated elements. And modeling this kind of phenomena, the accuracies of various application axe generally augmented.","As for English, there have been researches in which a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) (Fujisaki et ~1., 1989) is used for model description. Recently some researchers have pointed out the importance of the lexicon and proposed lexicalized models (Jelinek et al., 1994; Collins, 1997). In these models, every headword is propagated up through the derivation tree such that every parent receives a headword from the head-child. This kind of specialization may, however, be excessive if the criterion is predictive power of the model. Research ~med at estimating the best specialization level for 2-gram model (Mori et aL, 1997) shows a class-based model is more predictive than a word-based 2-gram model, a completely lexicalized model, comparing cross entropy of a POS-based 2-graxa model, a word-based 2-gram model and a class-based 2-graxa model, estimated from information theoretical point of view. As for a parser based on a class-based SCFG, Chaxniak (1997) reports better accuracy than the above lexicalized models, but the clustering method is not clear enough and, in addition, there is no report on predictive power (cross entropy or perplexity). Hogenhout and Matsumoto (1997) propose a word-clustering method based on syntactic behavior, but no language model is discussed. As the experiments in the present paper attest, word-class relation is dependent on language model.","In this paper, taking Japanese as the object language, we propose two complete stochastic language models using dependency between bugsetsu, a sequence of one or more content words followed by zero, one or more function words, and evaluate their predictive power by cross entropy. Since the number of sorts of bunsetsu is enormous, considering it as a symbol to be predicted would surely invoke the data-sparseness problem. To cope with this problem we 898 use the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model (Brown et al., 1992). Each bunsetsu is represented by the class calculated from the POS of its last content word and that of its last function word. The relation between bunsetsu, called dependency, is described by a stochastic context-free grammar (Fu, 1974) on the classes. From the class of a bunsetsu, the content word sequence and the function word sequence are independently predicted by word n-gram models equipped with unknown word models (Mori and Yamaji, 1997).","The above model assumes that the syntactic be-havior of each bunsetsu depends only on POS. The POS system invented by grammarians may not always be the best in terms of stochastic language modeling. This is experimentally attested by the paper (Mori et al., 1997) reporting comparisons between a POS-based n-gram model and a class-based n-gram model induced automatically. SVe now propose, based on this report, a word-clustering method on the model we have mentioned above to successfully improve the predictive power. In addition, we discuss a parsing method as an application of the model.","We also report the result of experiments conducted on EDR corpus (Jap, 1993) The corpus is divided into ten parts and the models estimated from nine of them axe tested on the rest in terms of cross entropy. As the result, the cross entropy of the POS-based dependency model is 5.3536 bits axtd that of the class-based dependency model estimated by our method is 4.9944 bits. This shows that the clustering method we propose improves the predictive power of the POS-based model notably. Additionally, a parsing experiment proved that the parser based on the improved model has a higher accuracy than the POS-based one."]},{"title":"2 Stochastic Language Model based on Dependency","paragraphs":["In this section, we propose a stochastic language model based on dependency. Formally this model is based on a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG). The terminal symbol is the attribute of a bunsetsu, represented by the product of the head of the content part and that of the function part. From the attribute, a word sequence that matches the bun. setsu is predicted by a word-based 2-gram model, and unknown words axe predicted from POS by a character-based 2-gram model. 2.1 Sentence Model A Japanese sentence is considered as a sequence of units called bunsetsu composed of one or more content words and function words. Let Cont be a set of content words, Func a set of function words and Sign a set of punctuation symbols. Then bunsetsu is defined as follows: Bnst = Cont+ Func * U Cont+ Func* Sign, where the signs \"+\" and \"*\" mean positive closure and Kleene closure respectively. Since the relations between bunsetsu known as dependency are not always between sequential ones, we use SCFG to describe them (Fu, 1974). The first problem is how to choose terminal symbols. The simplest way is to select each bunsetsu as a terminal symbol. In this case, however, the data-sparseness problem would surely be invoked, since the number of possible bunsetsu is enormous. To avoid this problem we use the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model (Brown et al., 1992). All bunsetsu axe grouped by the attribute defined as follows: attrib(b) (1)"]},{"title":"= qast(co.t(b)), last(f..c(b)), Zast(sig.(b))),","paragraphs":["where the functions cont, func and sign take a bun~etsu as their argument and return its content word sequence, its function word sequence and its punctuation respectively. In addition, the function last(m) returns the POS of the last element of word sequence m or NULL if the sequence has no word. Given the attribute, the content word sequence and the function word sequence of the bunsetsu axe independently generated by word-based 2-gram models (Mori and Yamaji, 1997). 2.2 Dependency Model In order to describe the relation between bunsetsu called dependency, we make the generally accepted assumption that no two dependency relations cross each other, and we introduce a SCFG with the attribute of bunsetsu as terminals. It is known, as a characteristic of the Japanese language, that each bunsetsu depends on the single bunsetsu appearing just before it. We say of two sequential bunsetsu that the first to appear is the anterior and the second is the posterior. We assume, in addition, that the dependency relation is a binary relation - that each relation is independent of the others. Then this relation is representing by the following form of rewriting rule of CFG: B =~ AB, where A is the attribute of the anterior bunsetsu and B is that of the posterior.","Similarly to terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols can be defined as the attribute of bunsetsu. Also they can be defined as the product of the attribute and some additional information to reflect the characteristics of the dependency. It is reported that the dependency is more frequent between closer bunsetsu in terms of the position in the sentence (Maruyama and Ogino, 1992). In order to model these characteristics, we add to the attribute of bunsetsu an"]},{"title":"899","paragraphs":["(verb. ending, period. 2.0) (noun, NULL. comma, O, 0) kyou/noun ./sign (today) (noun. postp..

Generally there axe one or more solutions for any input. A syntactic analyzer chooses the structure which seems the most similar to the human decision. There are two kinds of analyzer: one is called a rule-based analyzer, which is based on rules described according to the intuition of grarnmarians; the other is called a corpus-based analyzer, because it is based on a large number of analyzed examples. In this section, we describe a stochastic syntactic analyzer, which belongs to the second category. 4.1 Stochastic Syntactic Analyzer A stochastic syntactic analyzer, based on a stochastic language model including the concept of dependency, calculates the syntactic tree (see Figure 1) with the highest probability for a given input x according to the following formula: rh = argmax"]},{"title":"P(Tia~)","paragraphs":["U~(T)=Z 901 Table 1: Corpus.

In this section, we present the experimental results and discuss them. 5.1 Conditions on the Experiments As a syntactically annotated corpus we used EDR corpus (Jap, 1993). The corpus was divided into ten parts and the models estimated from nine of them were tested on the rest in terms of cross entropy (see Table 1). The number of characters in the Japanese writing system is set to 6,879. Two parameters which have not been determined yet in the explanation of the models (dmaz and v,naz) axe both set to 1. Although the best value for each of them can also be estimated using the average cross entropy, they are fixed through the experiments. 5.2 Evaluation of Predictive Power For the purpose of evaluating the predictive power of the models, we calculated their cross entropy on the test corpus. In this process the annotated tree is used as the structure of the sentences in the test corpus. Therefore the probability of each sentence in the test corpus is not the summation over all its possible derivations. In order to compare the POS-based dependency model and the class-based dependency model, we constructed these models from the same learning corpus and calculated their cross entropy on the same test corpus. They are both interpolated with the SCFG with uniform distribution.

This result indicates that the best word-class relation for the dependency model is quite different from the best word-class relation for the n-gram model. Comparing the number of the terminals and non-terminals, the best word-class relation for n-gram model is exceedingly specialized for a dependency model.
