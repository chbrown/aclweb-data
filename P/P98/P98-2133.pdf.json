However, one can claim that HPSG may not be so inefficient; it is just that an efficient implementation of HPSG has not been seriously pursued till now.","We set a goal for the performance of our HPSG parser: 100 milliseconds of average parsing time on a sentence in real-world corpora. If our HPSG parser accomplished this goal, it would be capable to parse about 1,000,000 sentences in a day, and could be used for applications such as knowledge acquisition from corpora. 1.1 Existing Systems"]},{"title":"for Typed Feature","paragraphs":["Structures"]},{"title":"(TFSs)","paragraphs":["Since Typed Feature Structures (TFSs) (Carpenter, 1992) are the basic data structures in HPSG, the efficiency of handling TFSs has been considered as the key to improve the efficiency of an HPSG parser. There are two representative systems that handle TFSsl: ALE (Carpenter and Penn, 1994), a TFS interpreter written in Prolog, and ProFIT ° This research is partially funded by the project of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS-RFTF96P00502). I LIFE (Ai't-kaci et al., 1994) is also famous, but we do not discuss it because it does not follow Carpenter's TFS definition. Moreover, our separate experiments show that LIFE is more than 10 times slower than emulator-based LiLFeS. As for AMALIA (Wintner, 1997), we cannot make experiments since it is not freely distributed. His experiments in his dissertation shows that AMALIA is 15 time faster than ALE at maximum; it is close to emulator-based LiLFeS, and is outperformed by native-code compiler of LiLFeS. (Erbach, 1995), a TFS-to-Prolog-term compiler.","However, as the comparison of these systems with our system (Section 3.2) shows, neither of these two systems is able to achieve the efficiency we established as our goal. Moreover, these two systems have serious disadvantages as a framework for practical applications. The ProHT approach, for example, tends to consume too much memory for execution. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to combine them with other techniques like parallel parsing, etc., because these two systems have been embedded in Prolog. 1.2 Our"]},{"title":"Approach","paragraphs":["One of the promising directions of improving the","efficiency of handling TFSs while retaining a ne-","cessary amount of flexibility is to take up the idea","of AMAVL proposed in (Carpenter and Qu, 1995)","to design a general programming system based on","TFS. LiLFeS is a logic programming system thus","designed and developed by our group, based on","AMAVL implementation. LiLFeS can be char-","acterized as follows.","• Architecture based on an AMAVL implementation, which compiles a TFS into a sequence of abstract machine instructions, and performs unification of the TFS by emulating the execution of those instructions. Although the proposal of such an AMAVL was already made in 1995, no serious implementation has been reported. We believe that LiLFeS is the first serious treatment of the proposal.","• Rich language specification: We have adopted a language syntax similar to Prolog. LiLFeS as a programming language has almost the full capabilities of ordinary Prolog systems. Furthermore, we provide efficient built-in predicates that are often required in NLP applications, such as TFS copy, equivalence check, and associative arrays.","• Independent language system: In order to develop an efficient and portable language system, we chose not to develop the language depending on an existing high-level language such as Prolog. Instead, we programmed the LiLFeS system from scratch. The independence also allows us to provide various built-in predicates in efficient ways. 1.3 Structure of This"]},{"title":"Paper","paragraphs":["Section 2 describes LiLFeS as a programming 807 my_list <- [bot]. e list <- [my_list]. ne list <- [my list]","- + [FI-RST\\ bot, REST\\ my list].","append(e_list, X, X).","append( (FIRST\\ A & REST\\ X), Y, (FIRST\\ A & REST\\ Z) ) :-","append( X, Y, Z )."]},{"title":"Figure 2 Sample LiLFeS Program","paragraphs":["language.

Types and features must be defined before being used in TFS terms.","Figure 2 show the definition of the predicate append in LiLFeS. The first paragraph contains the type definitions of my_list, e list, and ne list. The type ne.__list, for e~ample, is a sub-iype of the type my_list, and has two appropriate features, FIRST and REST. The value of the feature REST is restricted to the type my__list or one of its subtypes. The type bot is the universal type that subsumes all types.","The rest of the program is definite clauses.

The first data cell contains the type of the node, and the rest of the data cells contain pointers to the values of the corresponding features.","The merit of this representation is that feature names need not be represented in the TFS representation on memory. The requirements on a TFS guarantee that the kinds and number of features are statically defined and constant for a given type, therefore we can determine the offset of the pointer to a given feature only by referring to the type of the given node. 3.2 TFS as an Instruction"]},{"title":"Sequence","paragraphs":["Unification is an operation defined between two TFSs. However, in most cases, one of the two TFSs is known in advance at compile-time. We can therefore compile the TFS into a sequence of specialized codes for unification, as illustrated in Figure 1, rather than using a general unification routine. The compiled unification codes are specialized for given specific TFSs and therefore much more efficient than a general unifier. This is because any general unifier has to traverse both TFSs each time unification occurs at run-time.","Many studies have been reported for compiling unification of Prolog terms (for example, WAM (A'ft-Kaci, 1991)). However, the TFS unification is much more complex than Prolog-term unification, because (1) unification between different types may succeed due to the existence of a type hierarchy, and (2) features must be merged in the fixed-offset TFS representation on memory.","AMAVL compiles a type hierarchy and prepares for the complex situations described above. A TFS itself is compiled into a sequence of four kinds of instructions: ADDNEW (the unification of TFS types), UNIF\"fVAR (creation of structuresharing), PUSH (feature traversing) and pop (end of PUSH block). These instructions refer to the compiled type hierarchy, if necessary.","These operations are implemented following the 808 Table I Components Lines I WAM/AMAVL Emulator 5,434 LiLFeS-to-WAM/AMAVL Compiler 6,091 Built-in Functions 9,530 TFS Display Routine 2~320 Others (Class Library etc.) 2r374 Total 25,749 Source Code Lines of the LiLFeS System original proposal of AMAVL.

In this section we describe the current status of the LiLFeS system and applications running on it. Thereafter, we discuss the performance of LiLFeS in our experiments. 4.1 Current Status of the LiLFeS System The LiLFeS system is developed as a combination of AMAVL/WAM emulator, TFS compiler, and built-in support functions. They are all written in C++ with the source code of more than 25,000 lines (See Table 1). The source code can be compiled by GNU C++, and we have confirmed operation on Sun SunOS4/Solaris, DEC Digital UNIX, and Microsoft Windows. We have several practical applications on the LiLFeS system. We currently have several different parsers for HPSG and HPSG grammars of Japanese and English, as follows: • A underspecified Japanese grammar developed","by our group (Mitsuisi, 1998). Lexicon con-","sists of TFSs each of which has more than 100 nodes. The grammar can produce parse trees","for 88% of the corpus of the real world texts","(EDR Japanese corpus), 60% of which are given correct parse trees 4. This grammar is used for the experiments in the next section. • XHPSG, An HPSG English grammar (Tateisi,","1997). The grammar is converted from the XTAG grammar (XTAG group, 1995), which has more than 300,000 lexical entries. • A na'fve parser using a CYK-like algorithm. Although using a simple algorithm, the parser utilizes the full capabilities provided by LiLFeS, such as built-in predicates (TFS copy, array op-4 The grammar does not contain semantic analysis such as coreference resolution.

This algorithm compiles an HPSG grammar into 2 parts: its CFG skeletons and a remaining part, and parses a sentence in two phases. Although the parser is not a complete implementation of the algorithm, its efficiency benefits from its 2-phase parsing, which reduces the amount of unification.","These parsers and grammars are used for the per-","formance evaluations in the next section. 4.2 Performance Evaluation We evaluated the performance of the LiLFeS system over three aspects: Parsing performance of LiLFeS, comparison to other TFS systems, and comparison to different Prolog systems.","Table 2 shows the performance of HPSG parsers on a real-world corpus. However, even with the sophisticated algorithm, the parsing speed is 3.5 times slower than intended. To achieve our goal, we need a drastic improvement of a performance. We therefore performed the following experiments to find out the problem.","Table 3 shows the performance comparison to other TFS systems, ALE and ProFIT. Two grammars are used in the experiments: \"Simple\" is a small HPSG-like grammar written by our group, while \"HPSG\" is the small-lexicon HPSG grammar distributed with the ALE package. In the \"Simple\" experiments, the LiLFeS system is far more efficient than ALE, but is outperformed by ProFIT. However, in the \"HPSG\" experiment, which has to handle much more complex TFSs than \"Simple\" experiments, LiLFeS is clearly better than ProFIT.","On the contrary, with simple data LiLFeS is relatively inefficient. Experiments in Table 4, which show comparisons to Prolog systems, show that the performance of LiLFeS is significantly worse than that of those Prolog systems. To summarize, the performance of LiLFeS is far more impressive when it has to handle complex TFSs. This fact indicates that the TFS engine in LiLFeS is efficient but that the other parts, i.e. the 809 Simple Simple HPSG 1 answer 64 answers"]},{"title":"\"------.._","paragraphs":["Grammar System LiLFeS system (emulator-based) 5.70 322.4 ALE on SICStus WAM emulation 225.60 10560 ALE on SICStus native-code ProFIT on SICStus WAM emulation ProFIT on SICStus native-code 67.05 2.94 1.48 3046 127.51 64.08 2.56* 37.71\" 26.69\" 8.08 9.78 (Unit: seconds)","parse-tree Simple: a simple HPSG-like grammar, parsed I000 times by a bottom-up parser, 9-word sentence results in","HPSG: a toy HPSG grammar distributed with ALE, parsed by a parser distributed with ProFIT,","14-word sentence results in 134 parse-trees","*: ALE built-in parser is used instead of parser written in definite clauses","t: The parser program is translated to avoid the \"call\" built-in, which contains some problems in the LiLFeS implementation","(Environment: Sun UltraSparc 1/167MHz with 128MB memory)"]},{"title":"Table 3 Performance Comparison to Other TFS Systems","paragraphs":["System LiLFeS (emulator-based) SICStus WAM emulation SICStus native-code Aquarius Prolog fib(30): Naive calculation of Fibonacci (Unit: seconds","fib(30) rev(1000) 10 times 106.4 48.7","5.21 4.84","1.12 2.02","1.27 0.953 30)= 1346269","rev(1000): Naive reverse of 1000-element list","(Environment: Sun UltraSparc 1/167MHz with 128MB memory)"]},{"title":"Table","paragraphs":["4 Performance Comparison to Prolog Systems analysis will help to further optimize in the compilation process.

Aquarius Prolog adopts an execution model with an instruction set that is fine-grained and close to an instruction set of a real machine. As a result, the output code can be optimized up to the real-machine instruction level. In particular, we fully redesigned the AMAVL instructions as fine-grained instructions, which allow extensive optimizations on compiled TFS code.","• Static code analysis.

However, we can estimate the result from the experiment result on emulator-based LiLFeS (350 milliseconds with sophisticated algorithm) and speed ratio between emulator-based LiLFeS and native-code compiler (3 to 5 times speed-up).
