Basically, the interactive disambiguation is executed when its accuracy is higher than the accuracy of the automatic disambiguation. First of all, let us consider the case where an input sentence contains one ambiguous word that has ~, meanings. Figure 2 shows the tree of candidates for this case.

The autonmtic disambiguation corresponds to showing only one explanation to users in the interactive disanabiguation. Therefore the condition of executing the interactive disambiguatiou can be defined as the exceptional case of the limitation. 3.2 The Accuracy at a Node In the case that the number of alnbiguous words is one as Figure 2, the accuracy of the deeper nodes be-low the root node needs not to be decided because they are leaf nodes. When more than two ambiguous words exist in an input sentence, a node may often have one that is not a leaf one. To calculate the accuracy of such a node, it is necessary to determine what kind of disambiguation will be executed at the deeper nodes. For instance, the disambiguation system has to fix each accuracy of node 'see_l' and 'see_2' in Figure 1 to calculate the accuracy of the root node. Therefore, the definition of the accuracy at any node i is the recursive one. The accuracy of the interactive disambiguation Pintr(i) and that of the automatic disambiguation P~,to(i) at node i is defined as follows: 1424"]},{"title":"Ptntr(i) = ~ pd(,nlM ) x P,(m) (1) rnEM .

So it. is desirable that tile disambiguation system shows fewer exl)lanation to users, if possible.

Ill this section, we describe a procedure to decide the order of disambiguation where the accuracy is maximum.","The accuracy of the analyzed result may be different in each order of disambiguation, This is the reason that the disambiguation of one ambiguous word leads to constrain the meaning of other ambiguous ones. Therefore, the contents of the interaction may differ from each order of disambiguation. The order with the maximum accuracy is obtained in the following procedure:","1. Calculating each occurrence probal)ility of candidate for tile analyzed result by the automatic disambiguation method.","2. Obtaining the accuracy in each order of (lisam-biguation based on the method described in the previous sections.","3.
