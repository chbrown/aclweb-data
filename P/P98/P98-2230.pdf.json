As with the pure statistical translation model described by Wu (1996) (in which a bracketing transduction grammar models the channel), alternative hypotheses compete probabilistically, exhaustive search of the translation hypothesis space can be performed in polynomial time, and robustness heuristics arise naturally from a language-independent inversion-transduction model. However, unlike pure statistical translation models, the generated output string is guaranteed to conform to a given target grammar. The model employs only (1) a translation lexicon, (2) a context-free grammar for the target language, and (3) a bigram language model. The fact that no explicit bilingual translation rules are used makes the model easily portable to a variety of source languages. Initial experiments show that it also achieves significant speed gains over our earlier model. 1","Motivation Speed of statistical machine translation methods has long been an issue. A step was taken by Wu (Wu, 1996) who introduced a polynomial-time algorithm for the runtime search for an optimal translation. To achieve this, Wu's method substituted a language-independent stochastic bracketing transduction grammar (SBTG) in place of the simpler word-alignment channel models reviewed in Section 2. The SBTG channel made exhaustive search possible through dynamic programming, instead of previous \"stack search\" heuristics. Translation accuracy was not compromised, because the SBTG is apparently flexible enough to model word-order variation (between English and Chinese) even though it eliminates large portions of the space of 1408","word alignments. The SBTG can be regarded as","a model of the language-universal hypothesis that","closely related arguments tend to stay together (Wu,","1995a; Wu, 1995b). In this paper we introduce a generalization of","Wu's method with the objectives of 1. increasing translation speed further, 2. improving meaning-preservation accuracy, 3. improving grammaticality of the output, and 4. seeding a natural transition toward transduc-","tion rule models,","under the constraint of • employing no additional knowledge resources","except a grammar for the target language.","To achieve these objectives, we: • replace Wu's SBTG channel with a full","stochastic inversion transduction grammar or","SITG channel, discussed in Section 3, and • (mis-)use the target language grammar as a","SITG, discussed in Section 4.","In Wu's SBTG method, the burden of generating grammatical output rests mostly on the bigram language model; explicit grammatical knowledge cannot be used. As a result, output grammaticality cannot be guaranteed. The advantage is that language-dependent syntactic knowledge resources are not needed.","We relax those constraints here by assuming a good (monolingual) context-free grammar for the target language. Compared to other knowledge resources (such as transfer rules or semantic on-tologies), monolingual syntactic grammars are relatively easy to acquire or construct. We use the grammar in the SITG channel, while retaining the bigram language model. The new model facilitates explicit coding of grammatical knowledge and finer control over channel probabilities. Like Wu's SBTG model, the translation hypothesis space can be exhaustively searched in polynomial time, as shown in Section 5. The experiments discussed in Section 6 show promising results for these directions."]},{"title":"2 Review: Noisy Channel Model","paragraphs":["The statistical translation model introduced by IBM (Brown et al., 1990) views translation as a noisy channel process. The underlying generative model contains a stochastic Chinese (input) sentence generator whose output is \"corrupted\" by the translation channel to produce English (output) sentences. Assume, as we do throughout this paper, that the input language is English and the task is to translate into Chinese. In the IBM system, the language model employs simple n-grams, while the translation model employs several sets of parameters as discussed below. Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere (Brown et al., 1993).","Translation is performed in the reverse direction from generation, as usual for recognition under generative models.

The language model allows sentences of arbitrary order and the translation model allows arbitrary word-order permutation.

On the other hand, if the target CFG contains productions with long right-hand-sides, then merely inverting the subconstituent order will probably be in-sufficient. In such cases, a more complex transformation heuristic would be needed.","Objective 3 (improving grammaticality of the output) can be directly tackled by using a tight tar-","4Except for unary productions, which yield only one bilingual production. get grammar. To see this, consider using a mirrored Chinese CFG to parse English sentences with the language 1 side of the ITG. Any resulting parse tree must be consistent with the original Chinese grammar. This follows from the fact that both the straight and inverted versions of a production have language 2 (Chinese) sides identical to the original monolingual production: inverting production orientation cancels out the mirroring of the right-hand-side symbols. Thus, the output grammaticality depends directly on the tightness of the original Chinese grammar.","In principle, with this approach a single target grammar could be used for translation from any number of other (fixed word-order) source languages, so long as a translation lexicon is available for each source language.","Probabilities on the mirrored ITG cannot be reliably estimated from bilingual data without a very large parallel corpus. A straightforward approximation is to employ EM or Viterbi training on just a monolingual target language (Chinese) corpus. 4.2 Part-of-Speech Mapping The second problem is that the part-of-speech (PoS) categories used by the target (Chinese) grammar do not correspond to the source (English) words when the source sentence is parsed. It is unlikely that any English lexicon will list Chinese parts-of-speech.","We employ a simple part-of-speech mapping technique that allows the PoS tag of any corresponding word in the target language (as found in the translation lexicon) to serve as a proxy for the source word's PoS. The word view, for example, may be tagged with the Chinese tags nc and vn, since the translation lexicon holds both viewyy/~ ~nc and viewvB/~vn.","Unknown English words must be handled differently since they cannot be looked up in the translation lexicon. The English PoS tag is first found by tagging the English sentence. A set of possible corresponding Chinese PoS tags is then found by table lookup (using a small hand-constructed mapping table). For example, NN may map to nc, loc and pref, while VB may map to vi, vn, vp, vv, vs, etc. This method generates many hypotheses and should only be used as a last resort. 4.3 Word Skipping Regardless of how constituent-order transposition is handled, some function words simply do not occur in both languages, for example Chinese aspect 1411 markers. This is the rationale for the singletons mentioned in Section 3.","If we create an explicit singleton hypothesis for every possible input word, the resulting search space will be too large. To recognize singletons, we instead borrow the word-skipping technique from speech recognition and robust parsing. As formalized in the next section, we can do this by modifying the item extension step in our chart-parser-like algorithm. When the dot of an item is on the rightmost position, we can use such constituent, a subtree, to extend other items. In chart parsing, the valid subtrees that can be used to extend an item are those that are located on the adjacent right of the dot position of the item and the anticipated category of the item should also be equal to that of the subtrees. If word-skipping is to be used, the valid subtrees can be located a few positions right (or, left for the item corresponding to inverted production) to the dot position of the item. In other words, words between the dot position and the start of the subtee are skipped, and considered to be singletons.","Consider Sentence 5 again. Word-skipping handled the the which has no Chinese counterpart. At a certain point during translation, we have the following item: VP--+[is/x~]veNP. With word-skipping, it can be extended to VP --+[is/x~]vNPe by the subtree (son/~ of/~ Stephen/~)Np, even the subtree is not adjacent (but within a certain distance, see Section 5) to the dot position of the item. The the located on the adjacent to the dot position of the item is skipped.","Word-skipping provides us the flexibility to parse the source input by skipping possible singleton(s), if when we doing so, the source input can be parsed with the highest likelihood, and grammatical output can be produced."]},{"title":"5 Translation Algorithm","paragraphs":["The translation search algorithm differs from that of Wu's SBTG model in that it handles arbitrary grammars rather than binary bracketing grammars. As such it is more similar to active chart parsing (Earley, 1970) rather than CYK parsing (Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967). We take the standard notion of items (Aho and Ullman, 1972), and use the term anticipation to mean an item which still has symbols right of its dot. Items that don't have any symbols right of the dot are called subtree.","As with Wu's SBTG model, the algorithm maximizes a probabilistic objective function, Equation (2), using dynamic programming similar to that for HMM recognition (Viterbi, 1967). The presence of the bigram model in the objective function necessitates indexes in the recurrence not only on subtrees over the source English string, but also on the delimiting words of the target Chinese substrings.","The dynamic programming exploits a recursive formulation of the objective function as follows. Some notation remarks: es..t denotes the subsequence of English tokens e,+l, e~+2, • •., et. We use C(s..t) to denote the set of Chinese words that are translations of the English word created by taking all tokens in es..t together. C(s, t) denotes the set of Chinese words that are translations of any of the English words anywhere within es..t. K is the maximium number of consecutive English words that can be skipped. 5 Finally, the argmax operator is generalized to vector notation to accommodate multiple indices. 1.

The asymptotic time complexity for our algorithm is thus bounded by O(Tr). However, note that in theory the complexity upper bound rises exponentially rather than polynomially with the size of the grammar, just as for context-free parsing (Barton et al., 1987), whereas this is not a problem for Wu's SBTG algorithm. In practice, natural language grammars are usually sufficiently constrained so that speed is actually improved over the SBTG algorithm, as discussed later.","The dynamic programming is efficiently implemented by an active-chart-parser-style agenda-based algorithm, sketched as follows:","1.

The translation lexicon was partly constructed by training on government transcripts from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, and partly entered by hand. The corpus was sentence-aligned statistically (Wu, 1994); Chinese words and collocations were extracted (Fung and Wu, 1994; Wu and Fung, 1994); then translation pairs were learned via an EM procedure (Wu and Xia, 1995). Together with hand-constructed entries, the resulting English vocabulary is approximately 9,500 words and the Chinese vocabulary is approximately 14,500 words, with a many-to-many translation mapping averaging 2.56 Chinese translations per English word. Since the lexicon's content is mixed, we approximate translation probabilities by using the unigram distribution of the target vocabulary from a small monolingual corpus. Noise still exists in the lexicon.","The Chinese grammar we used is not tight-- it was written for robust parsing purposes, and as such it over-generates. Because of this we have not yet been able to conduct a fair quantitative assessment of objective 3. Our productions were constructed with reference to a standard grammar (Beijing Language and Culture Univ., 1996) and totalled 316 productions. Not all the original productions are mirrored, since some (128) are unary productions, and others are Chinese-specific lexical constructions like S ~ ~-~ S NP ~ S, which are obviously unnecessary to handle English. About 27.7% of the non-unary Chinese productions were mirrored and the total number of productions in the final ITG is 368.","For the experiment, 222 English sentences with a maximum length of 20 words from the parallel corpus were randomly selected. Some examples of the output are shown in Figure 2. No morphological processing has been used to correct the output, and up to now we have only been testing with a bigram model trained on extremely small corpus.","With respect to objective 1 (increasing translation speed), the new model is very encouraging.

Approximately 13% of the test corpus could not be parsed in the grammatical channel model. As mentioned earlier, this figure is likely to vary widely depending on the characteristics of the target grammar. Of course, one can simply back off to the SBTG model when the grammatical channel rejects an input sentence.","With respect to objective 2 (improving meaning-preservation accuracy), the new model is also promising. Table 2 shows that the percentage of meaningfully translated sentences rises from 26% to 32% (ignoring the rejected cases). 7 We have judged only whether the correct meaning is conveyed by the translation, paying particular attention to word order and grammaticality, but otherwise ignoring morphological and function word choices. 7 Conclusion Currently we are designing a tight generationoriented Chinese grammar to replace our robust parsing-oriented grammar. We will use the new grammar to quantitatively evaluate objective 3. We are also studying complementary approaches to the English word deletion performed by word-skipping--i.e., extensions that insert Chinese words suggested by the target grammar into the output.","The framework seeds a natural transition toward pattern-based translation models (objective 4).

This provides a smooth evolution from a purely statistical model toward a hybrid model, as more linguistic resources become available.","We have described a new stochastic grammatical channel model for statistical machine translation that exhibits several nice properties in comparison with Wu's SBTG model and IBM's word alignment model. The SITG-based channel increases translation speed, improves meaning-preservation accuracy, permits tight target CFGs to be incorporated for improving output grammaticality, and suggests a natural evolution toward transduction rule models. The input CFG is adapted for use via production mirroring, part-of-speech mapping, and word-skipping. We gave a polynomial-time translation algorithm that requires only a translation lexicon, plus a CFG and bigram language model for the target language. More linguistic knowledge about the target language is employed than in pure statistical translation models, but Wu's SBTG polynomial-time bound on search cost is retained and in fact the search space can be significantly reduced by using a good grammar. Output always conforms to the given target grammar. Acknowledgments Thanks to the SILC group members: Xuanyin Xia, Daniel Chan, Aboy Wong, Vincent Chow & James Pang.","References","Alfred V.
