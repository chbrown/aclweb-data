The proposal results in a lexicalized, declarative, and formally precise description of word order; features which lack previous proposals for dependency grammars. Contrary to other lexicalized approaches to word order, our proposal does not require lexical ambiguities for ordering alternatives. 1 Introduction Recently, the concept of valency has gained considerable attention. Not only do all linguistic theories refer to some reformulation of the traditional notion of valency (in the form of 0grid, subcategorization list, argument list, or extended domain of locality); there is a growing number of parsers based on binary relations between words (Eisner, 1997; Maruyama, 1990).","Given this interest in the valency concept, and the fact that word order is one of the main difference between phrase-structure based approaches (henceforth PSG) and dependency grammar (DG), it is valid to ask whether DG can capture word order phenomena without recourse to phrasal nodes, traces, slashed categories, etc. A very early result on the weak generative equivalence of context-free grammars and DGs suggested that DGs are incapable of describing surface word order (Gaifman, 1965). This result has recently been critizised to apply only to impoverished DGs which do not properly represent formally the expressivity of contemporary DG variants (Neuhaus & Br6ker, 1997).","Our position will be that dependency relations are motivated semantically (Tesni~re, 1959), and need not be projective (i.e., may cross if projected onto the surface ordering).

In Sec. 3, word order domains will be defined, and Sec. 4 introduces a modal logic to describe dependency structures. Sec. 5 applies our approach to the German clause and Sec. 6 relates it to some PSG approaches. 2 Word Order in DG A very brief characterization of DG is that it recognizes only lexical, not phrasal nodes, which are linked by directed, typed, binary relations to form a dependency tree (Tesni~re, 1959; Hudson, 1993). The following overview of DG flavors shows that various mechanisms (global rules, general graphs, procedural means) are generally employed to lift the limitation of projectivity and discusses some shortcomings of these proposals.

This abstract representation of the sentence is mapped via"]},{"title":"ordering rules","paragraphs":["to the concrete surface realization. Recently, Kruijff (1997) has given a categorialstyle formulation of these ordering rules. He assumes associative categorial operators, per-muting the arguments to yield the surface ordering. One difference to our proposal is that 174 we argue for a representational account of word order (based on valid structures representing word order), eschewing the non-determinism in-troduced by unary operators; the second difference is the avoidance of an underlying structure~ which stratifies the theory and makes incremental processing difficult. Meaning-Text Theory (Melc'fik, 1988) assumes seven strata of representation. The rules mapping fi'om the unordered dependency trees of surface-syntactic representations onto the an-notated lexeme sequences of deep-morphological representations include global ordering rules which allow discontinuities. These rules have not yet been formally specified (Melc'~tk & Pertsov, 1987p.1870. Word Grammar (WG, Hudson (1990)) is based on general graphs instead of trees. The ordering of two linked words is specified together with their dependency relation, as in the proposition \"object of verb follows it\". Extraction of, e.g., objects is analyzed by establish-ing an additional dependency called visitor between the verb and the extractee, which requires the reverse order, as in \"visitor of verb precedes it\". This results in inconsistencies, since an extracted object must follow the verb (being its object) and at the same time precede it (being its visitor). The approach compromises the semantic motivation of dependencies by adding purely order-induced dependencies. WG is similar to our proposal in that it also distinguishes a propositional meta language describing the graph-based analysis structures. Dependency Unification Grammar (DUG, Hellwig (1986)) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses. 'Using morphosyntactic features with special interpretations, a word defines abstract positions into which modifiers are mapped. Partial orderings and even discontinuities can thus be described by allowing a modifier to occupy a position defined by some transitive head. The approach requires that the parser interpretes several features specially, and it cannot restrict the scope of discontinuities. Slot Grammar (McCord, 1990) employs a number of rule types, some of which are exclusively concerned with precedence. So-called head/slot and slot/slot ordering rules describe the precedence in projective trees, referring to arbitrary predicates over head and modifiers. Extractions (i.e., discontinuities) are merely handled by a mechanism built into the parser. 3","Word Order Domains Summarizing the previous discussion, we require the following of a word order description for DG:","• not to compromise the semantic motivation of dependencies,","• to be able to restrict discontinuities to certain constructions and delimit their scope,","• to be lexicalized without requiring lexical ambiguities for the representation of ordering alternatives,","• to be declarative (i.e., independent of an analysis procedure), and • to be formally precise and consistent.","The subsequent definition of an order domain structure and its linking to the dependency tree satisify these requirements. 3.1 The Order Domain Structure A word order domain is a set of words, general-izing the notion of positions in DUG. The cardinality of an order domain may be restricted to at most one element, at least one element, or - by conjunction - to exactly one element. Each word is associated with a sequence of order domains, one of which must contain the word itself, and each of these domains may require that its elements have certain features. Order domains can be partially ordered based on set inclusion: If an order domain d contains word w (which is not associated with d), every word w ~ contained in a domain d ~ associated with w is also contained in d; therefor, d ~ C d for each d ~ associated with w. This partial ordering induces a tree on order domains, which we call the order domain structure.","Take the example of German \"Den Mann hat der Junge gesehen\" (\"the manAGe - has - the boyNoM - seen\"). Its dependency tree is shown in Fig.l, with word order domains indicated by dashed circles. The finite verb, \"hat\", defines a sequence of domains, <dl, d2, d3>, which roughly correspond to the topological fields in the German main clause. The nouns \"Mann\" 175 ' ,, subj_~.~_~. \", :d3', ,' 'C. \"derJunge; '.ge~ehen.,,, ,:.den Mann-., \"'. .\" ' Figure 1: Dependency Tree and Order Domains for \"Den"]},{"title":"Mann hat der Junge gesehen\"","paragraphs":["dl d,4 hat d 5 d 6 Mann Junge gesehen Figure 2: Order Domain Structure for"]},{"title":"\"Den Mann hat der Junge gesehen\"","paragraphs":["aud"]},{"title":"\"Junge\"","paragraphs":["and the participle"]},{"title":"\"gesehen\"","paragraphs":["each define one order domain"]},{"title":"(d4,cl5,d6,","paragraphs":["resp.).

In PS-based accounts, the construction is represented by phrasal categories, and extraction is limited by bounding nodes (e.g., Haegeman (1994), Becker et al. (1991)). In dependency-based accounts, the construction is represented by the dependency relation, which is typed or labelled to indicate constructional distinctions which are configurationally defined in PSG. Given this correspondence, it is natural to employ dependencies in the description of discontinuities as fol-","3Note that each phrasal level in PS-based trees defines a scope for linear precedence rules, which only apply to sister nodes. 176 lows: For each modifier of a certain head, a set of dependency types is defined which may link the direct head and the positional head of the modifier (\"gesehen\" and \"hat\", resp.). If this set is empty, both heads are identical and a contiguous attachment results.

Dependencies and the mapping from dependency tree to order domain structure are described by modal operators, while simple properties such as word class, features, and cardinality of order domains are described by modal propositions. 4.1 Model Structures In the following, we assume a set of words, l/Y, ordered by a precedence relation, -<, a set of dependency types, T), a set of atomic feature values .4, and a set of word classes, C.

We will generalize this field structure to verb-initial and verb-final clauses as well, without going into the linguistic motivation due to space limits.","The formula in Fig.4 states that all finite verbs (word class Vfin 6 C) define three order domains, of which the first requires exactly one element with the feature initial [1], the second allows an unspecified number of elements with features middle and norel [2], and the third allows at most one element with features final and norel [3]. The features initial, middle, and final 6 .4 serve to restrict placement of certain phrases in specific fields; e.g., no reflexive pronouns can appear in the final field. The norel 6 .4 feature controls placement of a relative NP or PP, which may appear in the initial field only in verb-final clauses. The order types are defined as follows: In a verb-second clause (feature V2), the verb is placed at the beginning (<.) of the middle field (middle), and the element of the initial field cannot be a relative phrase (o~norel in [4]). In a verb-final clause (VEnd), the verb is placed at the end (>.) of the middle field, with no restrictions for the initial field (relative clauses and non-relative verb-final clauses are subordinated to the noun and conjunction, resp.) [5]. In a verb-initial clause (Vl), the verb occupies the initial field [6].","The formula in Fig.5 encodes the hierarchical structure from Fig.1 and contains lexical restrictions on placement and extraction (the surface is used to identify the word). Given this, the order type of \"hat\" is determined as follows: The participle may not be extraposed (~final in [10]; a restriction from the lexical entry of \"hat\"), it must follow \"hat\" in d2. Thus, the verb cannot be of order type VEnd, which would require it to be the last element in its domain (>. in [5]). \"Mann\" is not adjacent to \"gesehen\", but may be extracted across the dependency vpart (${vpart} in [11]), allowing its insertion into a domain defined by \"hat\". It cannot precede \"hat\" in d2, because \"hat\" must either begin d2 (due to <. in [4]) or itself go into dl. But dl allows only one phrase (single), leaving only the domain structure from Fig.2, and thus the order type V2 for \"hat\". 178 6 Comparison to PSG Approaches One feature of word order domains is that they factor ordering alternatives from the syntactic tree, much like feature annotations do for morphological alternatives. Other lexicalized grammars collapse syntactic and ordering information and are forced to represent ordering alternatives by lexical ambiguity, most notable L-TAG (Schabes et al., 1988) and some versions of CG (Hepple, 1994). This is not necessary in our approach, which drastically reduces the search space for parsing.","This property is shared by the proposal of Reape (1993) to associate HPSG signs with sequences of constituents, also called word order domains. Surface ordering is determined by the sequence of constituents associated with the root node. The order domain of a mother node is the sequence union of the order domains of the daughter nodes, which means that the relative order of elements in an order domain is retained, but material from several domains may be interleaved, resulting in discontinuities. Whether an order domain allows interleaving with other domains is a parameter of the constituent. This approach is very similar to ours in that order domains separate word order from the syntactic tree, but there is one important difference: Word order domains in HPSG do not completely free the hierarchical structure from ordering considerations, because discontinuity is specified per phrase, not per modifier. For example, two projections are required for an NP, the lower one for the continuous material (determiner, adjective, noun, genitival and prepositional attributes) and the higher one for the possibly discontinuous relative clause. This de-pendence of hierarchical structure on ordering is absent from our proposal.","We may also compare our approach with the projection architecture of LFG (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982; Kaplan, 1995). There is a close similarity of the LFG projections (c-structure and f-structure) to the dimensions used here (order domain structure and dependency tree, respectively). C-structure and order domains represent surface ordering, whereas f-structure and dependency tree show the subcategorization or valence requirements. What is more, these projections or dimensions are linked in both accounts by'an element-wise mapping. The difference between the two architectures lies in the linkage of the projections or dimensions: LFG maps f-structure off c-structure. In contrast, the dependency relation is taken to be primi-tive here, and ordering restrictions are taken to be indicators or consequences of dependency relations (see also BrSker (1998b, 1998a)). 7 Conclusion We have presented an approach to word order for DG which combines traditional notions (semantically motivated dependencies, topological fields) with contemporary techniques (logical description language, model-theoretic semantics). Word order domains are sets of partially ordered words associated with words. A word is contained in an order domain of its head, or may float into an order domain of a transitive head, resulting in a discontinuous dependency tree while retaining a projective order domain structure. Restrictions on the floating are expressed in a lexicalized fashion in terms of dependency relations. An important benefit is that the proposal is lexicalized without reverting to lexical ambiguity to represent order variation, thus profiting even more from the efficiency considerations discussed by Schabes et al. (1988).","It is not yet clear what the generative capacity of such lexicalized discontinuous DGs is, but at least some index languages (such as anbnc n) can be characterized. Neuhaus & BrSker (1997) have shown that recognition and parsing of such grammars is A/'7~-complete. A parser operating on the model structures is described in (Hahn et al., 1997).","References","Becket, T., A. Joshi & O. Rainbow (1991). Long-Distance scrambling and tree-adjoining grammar.
