Some students wrote fancy invitation cards. Some other students bought exotic food. But Peter didn't like it. There are two conceivable readings for (1). Either (a) it refers to the party or (b) Peter only disliked the food. Discourse grammars like Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) offer an explanation for this phenomenon. SDRT -- an extension ofDRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) -- describes a complex propositional structure of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) connected via discourse relations. The hierarchical ordering imposed by relations like narration or elaboration can be used to make predictions about possible attachment sites within the already processed discourse as well as suitable antecedents of anaphora.","The next section discusses the question of whether the SDRT formalisation used for discourse structure should also capture the ambiguities, as expressed in (1), for instance, via an underspecified representation. Section 3 introduces a tree logic proposed by Kallmeyer called TDG. Following Schilder (1997), this formalism is employed for the representation of the discourse structure. Section 4 presents the conjoined version of SDRT and TDG. This is a novel combination of the discourse grammar and a tree logic indicating the hierarchical discourse structure. Finally, a USDRT formalisation of the discourse example discussed is given. 2 From DRT to SDRT One obvious shortcoming DRT is that it lacks the rhetorical information that structures the text. This rhetorical information, expressed by discourse relations such as narration or background, has a crucial effect on anaphora resolution, lexical disambigua-tion, and spatial-temporal information. SDRT extends DRT in order to amend this insufficiency.","Following Asher (1996) DRSs and SDRSs will be labelled ({K1,..., Kn}). Formally, an SDRS is recursively defined as a pair of sets containing labelled DRSs or SDRSs, and the discourse relations holding between them. Definition 1 (SDRS) Let K1 : ~l,...Kn : C~n be a labelled DRSs or SDRSs and R a set of discourse relations. The tuple <U, Con) is an SDRS if (a) U is a labelled DRS and Con = O or (b) U = {K1..., Kn} and Con is a set of SDRS conditions. An SDRS condition is a discourse relation suchas D(K1,... ,Kn), where D 6 R. For the basic case (i.e. (K, 0)) K labels a DRS representing the semantic context of a sentence. A discourse relation introduces furthermore a hierarchical ordering indicated by a graph representation. The nodes represent the labelled SDRSs and the edges are discourse relations. Apart from the discourse relations, which impose a hierarchical ordering, 'topic' relations add more structure to this graph. If a sentence a is the topic of another sentence/3, this is formalised as a ~ /~.l This symbol also occurs in the graph, indicating a further SDRS condition. The graph representation illustrates the hierarchical structure of the discourse and in particular the open attachment site for newly processed sentences. Basically the constituents on the so-called 'right frontier' of the discourse structure are assumed to be available for further attachment (Webber, 1991).","Assuming a current label (i.e. the one added after processing the last clause/sentence), a notion of","I A further SDRS condition is Focus Background Pair (FBP) which is introduced by background. 1188"]},{"title":"D-Subordination","paragraphs":["is defined by Asher (1996, p. 24).

All readings have to be generated. (b) The formalism is not monotonic. Updates may overwrite preceed-ing constituents. As it can be seen from figure 2 a new SDRS K~ substituted K2. 4 (c) The constituent graph contains a set of different SDRS con- ' ditions (i.e. discourse relations, ~, and FBP). It is not clear how these different conditions interact and it seems difficult to predict their effect on the discourse structure. Note that the update on narration requires a common topic which connects the two SDRSs according to the axioms stipulated within SDRT. However the ~ relation is not shown in the constituent graph.","I will develop further ideas introduced by underspecified semantic formalisms which have been proposed in recent years (e.g. (Reyle, 1995)) in order to provide an underspecified representation for discourse structure. I will employ a first order tree logic by Kallmeyer (1996) to define an underspecifled SDRT, in the following sections."]},{"title":"3 Tree Descriptions","paragraphs":["Tree Description Grammars (TDGs) were inspired by so-called quasi-trees (Vijay-Shanker, 1992). The grammar formalism is described as a constraintbased TAG-like grammar by Kallmeyer (1996). The logic used for TDGs is a quantifier-free first order","41t may be possible that the topic relation is transitive to-gether with the d-subordination. However, this would contradict with the definition of D-Freedom (i.e. ~3K' (K' ~1. K)) logic consisting of variables for the nodes, four binary relations and the logical connectives -% A, V. 5 Definition 2 (TDG) A Tree Description Grammar (TDG) is a tuple G = (N,T, <1, <*, -.<, ~, S), such that: (a) N and T are disjoint finite sets for the nonterminal and terminal symbols. (b) <~ is the parent relation (i.e. immediate dominance) which is irreflexive, asymmetric and intransitive. (c) <~* is the dominance relation which is the transitive closure of ,~. (d) -.4 is the linear precedence relation which is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive. (e) ~ is the equivalence relation which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. (f) S is the start description. The tree descriptions are formulae in TDGs reflect-ing the dominance relations between subtrees. Such formulae have to be negation-free and at least one k E K must dominate all other k' E K. In order to combine two tree descriptions an adjunction operation is used which simply conjoins the two tree descriptions. Graphically, this operation can take place at the dotted lines indicating the dominance relation (i.e. <~*).The straight line describes the parent relation (,~). No adjunction can take place here.

Note that also a precedence relation is used to specify the ordering between daughter nodes. Definition 3 (USDRS) Let S be a set of DRSs, L a set of labels, R a set of discourse relations. Then U is a USDRS confined to the tuple (S, L, R) where U is a finite set consisting of the following two kinds of conditions: 1. structural information (a) immediate dominance relation: K1 <~ K2, where K1,K2 EL (b) dominance relation: K1 <3\" K2, where K1,K2 eL (c) precedence relation: K1 -< K2, where KI,K2 eL (d) equivalence relation: K1 .~ K2, where KI,K2 eL 2. content information (a) sentential: sl : drs, where Sl 6 L, drs 6 S (b) segmental: K1 : P(sl,...,Sn), where P is an n-place discourse relation in R, and gl,Sl,...,Sn 6 L Generally speaking, a discourse relation P provides the link between DRSs or SDRSs. Similar to the standard SDRT account, this relation has to be derived by considering world knowledge as well as additional discourse knowledge, and is derived within DICE. I do not consider any changes of the standard theory in this respect. The structural information, however, is encoded by the tree descriptions as introduced in section 3. The most general case describing two situations connected by a (not yet known) discourse relation is formalised as shown in figure 5. 6 The description formula for this tree is K-r <~* K~I A KT1 <~ Kat A KR1 <1 KRI' AKm <1 K~i A K~I <~* sl A K~I <~* s2. Comparing this representation with the SDRT constituent graph, the following similarities and differences can be observed. First of all, the question of where the open attachment sites are found is easily observable in the structural restriction given by the","6The dashed line describes the underspecification with respect to the precedence relation (-<).

Graphically, the open nodes are indicated by the dotted lines. Secondly, a topic node is introduced, immediately dominating the discourse segment. No distinction between D-Subordination and D-Freedom has to be made, because the topic is open for further attachment as well. This is the main change to the discourse structure proposed by Schilder (1997). This account encodes the topic information in an additional feature called PROM1. However, it gives no formal definition of this term. I stick therefore to the topic definition Asher gives. But instead a uniform treatment of the hierarchical ordering can be given by the tree logic used. Thirdly, the discourse segment is dominated by the discourse relation that possesses two daughter nodes. The structure is flexible enough to allow further attachment here. No overwriting of a derived structure, as for the SDRT account, is necessary.","If a discourse relation is derived, further constraints are imposed on the discourse structure. Basically, two cases can be distinguished: (a) A subordinating structure is triggered by discourse relations like narration or result. Consequently, the second situation becomes the topic (i.e. K~I : /3) and the precedence relation between K~I and K~I is introduced. In addition, the open attachment site on the right frontier gets closed (i.e. K~ 1 ~ K2). (b) A subordinated structure which comes with discourse relations like elaboration or background contains the first situation as a topic (i.e. K~I : a). For this structure a precedence relation between K~I and K~I also holds, but instead of the right frontier, the left frontier is closed (i.e. K~ 1 ~ K1).","Generally speaking, the analysis proposed for (2) follows the SDRT account, especially regarding the derivation of the discourse relations. The first two sentences are connected via elaboration. However, the analysis differs with respect to the obtained discourse structure.
