In many cases the three parsers will not be able to find a path through the WHG that can be assigned a complete and spanning syntactic-semantic analysis.

However, the parsers will usually be able to deliver a collection of partial analyses -- each covering a part of a path through the WHG.","The goal of the"]},{"title":"robust semantic processing","paragraphs":["component in Verbmobil-2 is to collect these partial analyses and try to put them together on the basis of heuristic rules to produce deep linguistic analyses even if the input is not completely analysable.","We speak of robust semantic processing since we are dealing with VITs which primarily represent semantic content and apply rules which refer to semantic properties and semantic structures.","The task splits into three subtasks:"]},{"title":"1.

These subtasks are discussed in the following subsections. Section 5.4 contains examples of the problems mentioned and outlines their treatment in the approach described."]},{"title":"5.1 Storing Partial Analyses","paragraphs":["The first task of the robust semantic processing is to manage a possibly large number of partial analyses, each spanning a certain sub-interval of the input utterance.","The basic mode of processing -- store competing analyses and combine them to larger analyses, while avoiding unnecessary redundancy -- resembles that of a chart parser. Indeed we use a chart-like data structure to store the competing partial analyses delivered by the parsers and new hypotheses obtained by combining existing ones. All the advantages of the chart in chart parsing are preserved: The chart allows the storage of competing hypotheses, even from different sources, without redundancy.","Since the input to the parsers consists of WHGs rather than strings, the analyses entered cannot refer to the string positions they span. Rather they have to refer to a time interval. This means also that the chart cannot be indexed by string positions, but is indexed by the time frames the speech recognizer uses. This makes necessary slight modifications to the chart handling algorithms."]},{"title":"5.2 Combining Partial Analyses","paragraphs":["We use a set of heuristic rules to describe the conditions under which two or more partial analyses should be combined, an analysis should be left out or modified. Each rule specifies the conditions under which it should be applied, the operations to be performed, and what the result of the rule applica-tion is. Rules have the following format (in PROLOG notation):","[Condl ..... CondN] ---> [Opl ..... OpN] & Result.","The left hand side consists of a list of conditions on partial analyses, Cond2 being a condition (or a list of conditions) on the first partial analysis (VIT), etc., where the order of conditions parallels the expected temporal order of the analyses. When these conditions are met, the rule fires and the operations Op 1 etc. are performed on the input VITs. One VIT, Result, is designated as the result of the rule. After applying the rule, an edge annotated with this VIT is entered into the chart, spanning the minimum time frame that includes the spans of all the analyses on the left hand side. Examples for rules are given in 5.4."]},{"title":"5.3 Choosing a Result","paragraphs":["When no more analyses are produced by the parsers and all applicable rules have been applied, the last step is to choose a 'best' sequence of analyses from the chart which covers the whole input and deliver it to the transfer module. In the ideal case, there will be an analysis spanning the whole input.","Currently, we employ a simple search which takes into account the acoustic scores of the WHG paths the analyses are based on, together with the length and coverage of the individual analyses.","The length is defined as the length of the temporal interval an analysis spans; an analysis with a greater length is preferred. The coverage of an analysis is 1405 the sum of the lengths of the component analyses it consists of. Note that the coverage of an analysis will be less than its length iff some material inside the interval the analysis spans has been left out in the analysis; hence length and coverage are equal for the analyses produced by the parsers, l Analyses with greater coverage are preferred. 5.4 Examples The examples in this section are taken from the Verbmobil corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues. The problems we address here appeared in WHGs produced by a speech recognizer on the original audio data. 5.4.1 Missing preposition Since function words like prepositions are usually short, speech recognizers often have trouble recognizing them. Consider an example where the speaker uttered Mir wtire es am liebsten in den niichsten zwei Wochen ('During the next two weeks would be most convenient for me'). However, the WHG contains no path which includes the preposition in in an appropriate position. Consequently, the parsers delivered analyses for the segments Mir ware es am liebsten and den niichsten zwei Wochen.","These fragments are handled by two rules. The first turns a temporal NP like the second fragment into a temporal modifier, expressing that something is standing in an underspecified temporal relation to the temporal entity the NP denotes:","[temporal_np(Vl) ] ---> [typeraise to mod(VI,V2)] & V2. Then a very general rule can apply that modifier to the proposition expressed by the first fragment:","[type(Vl,prop) ,type(V2,mod)] ---> [apply(V2,Vl,V3)] & V3. 5.4.2 Self-Correction of a Modifier Here the speaker uttered Wir treffen uns am Montag, nein, am Dienstag ('We will meet on Monday, no, on Tuesday'). The parsers deliver three fragments, the first being a proposition containing a modifier, the second an interjection marking a correction, and the third a modifier of the same type as the one in the proposition. Under these conditions, we replace the modifier inside the proposition with the one uttered after the correction marker:","~The chunk parser may be an exception here since it sometimes leaves out words it cannot integrate into an analysis. [ [type (Vl,prop), has mod (Vi,Mi,ModType) ] , correction_marker (_) , [ type (V2, mod), has_mod (V2, M2, ModType) ] ] ---> [replace_mod(Vi,Mi,M2,V3)] & V3. 5.4.3 Self-Correction of a Verb In this case, the speaker uttered Am Montag treffe... habe ich einen Terrain., i. e. decided to continue the utterance in a different way than originally intended. The parsers deliver fragments for, among others, the substrings am Montag, treffe, habe, ich, and einen Terrain (all the partial analyses received from the parsers and built up by robust semantic processing are shown in the chart 2 in Figure 2).","Robust semantic processing then builds analyses by applying modifiers to verbal predicates (e. g., analyses 71,108) and verbal functors to possible arguments (e. g., 20, 106, 47). The latter is done by the following two rules:","[ type (Vl, Type) , unbound_arg (V2, Type) ]","---> [apply(V2,Vi,V3)] & V3.","[ unbound_arg (VI, Type ) , type (V2, Type ) ]","---> [apply(Vl,V2,V3)] & V3. Note that einen Termin is not considered to be a possible argument of the verb treffe since that would violate the verb's sortal selection restrictions.","After all partial analyses produced by the parsers have been entered into the chart and all applicable rules have been applied, there is still no spanning analysis (all analyses in Figure 2 are there, except the spanning one numbered 105). In such a case, the robust semantic processing component proceeds by extending active edges over passive edges which end in a chart node in which only one passive edge ends, or all passive edges ending there correspond to partial analyses still missing arguments.","In this example, this applies to the node in which edges 1 and 71 end, which both are missing the two arguments of the transitive verb treffe. Application of the proposition modification rule mentioned in Section 5.4.1 to the modifyer PP am Montag has led to an active edge still looking for a proposition. This is now being extended to end at the same node as the two passive edges missing arguments.",":The analyses in the chart are numbered; the numbers in square brackets indicate the immediate constituents an analysis has been built from by robust semantic processing. I. e., analyses with an empty list of immediate constituents have been produced by a parser. 1406 105: am montafl, +habe+ich+einen temlin IGZt47] ~ 107: te~rfe.lch i 1 ,lS27: habe.ich n terrain 120,4S1 [ Figure 2: The chart for Am Montag treffe ... habe ich einen Termin. There, it finds an edge corresponding to a proposition, namely edge 47, which had been built up earlier. The result is passive edge 105 spanning the whole input and expressing the right interpretation. 6 Related Work An approach similar to the one described here was developed by Ros6 (Rosr, 1997). However, that approach works on interlingual representations of utterance meanings, which implies the loss of all linguistic constraints on the combinatorics of partial analyses. Apart from that, only the output of one parser is considered. 7","Conclusion and Outlook We have described a model for the combination of partial parsing results and how it can be applied in order to improve the robustness of a speech processing system. A prototype version was integrated into the Verbmobil system in autumn 1997 and is currently being extended.","We are working on improving the selection of resuits by using a stochastic model of V1T sequence probabilities, on the extension of the rule set to cover more spontaneous speech phenomena of German, English and Japanese, and on refining the mechanism for extending active edges to arrive at a spanning analyses.","References","John Bear, John Dowding, and Elizabeth Shriberg. 1992.
