We show that the chunk parses produced by this parsing system can be use-fully applied to the task of reranking Nbest lists from a speech recognizer, using a combination of chunk-based n-gram model scores and chunk coverage scores. The input for the system is Nbest lists generated from speech recognizer lattices. The hypotheses from the Nbest lists are tagged for part of speech, \"cleaned up\" by a preprocessing pipe, parsed by a part of speech based chunk parser, and rescored using a backpropagation neural net trained on the chunk based scores. Finally, the reranked Nbest lists are generated. The results of a system evaluation are promising in that a chunk accuracy of 87.4% is achieved and the best performance on a randomly selected test set is a decrease in word error rate of 0.3 percent (absolute), measured on the new first hypotheses in the reranked Nbest lists. 1","Introduction In the area of parsing spontaneous speech, most work so far has primarily focused on dealing with texts within a narrow, well-defined domain. Full scale parsers for spontaneous speech face severe difficulties due to the intrinsic nature of spoken language (e.g., false starts, hesitations, ungrammaticalities), in addition to the well-known complexities of large coverage parsing systems in general (Lavie, 1996; Light, 1996).","An even more serious problem is the imperfect word accuracy of speech recognizers, particularly when faced with spontaneous speech over a large vocabulary and over a low bandwidth channel. This is particularly the case for the SWITCHBOARD database (Godfrey et al., 1992) which we mainly used for development, testing, and evaluation of our system. Current state-of-the-art recognizers exhibit word error rates (WER 1) for this corpus of approx-IThe word error rate (WEFt in %) is defined as follows: imately 30%-40% (Finke et al., 1997). This means that in fact about every third word in an input utterance will be misrecognized. Thus, any parser which is too restrictive with respect to the input it accepts will likely fail to find a parse for most of these utterances.","When the domain is restricted, sufficient coverage can be achieved using semantically guided approaches that allow skipping of unparsable words or segments (Ward, 1991; Lavie, 1996).","Since we cannot build on semantic knowledge for constructing parsers in the way it is done for limited domains when attempting to parse spontaneous speech in"]},{"title":"unrestricted domains,","paragraphs":["we argue that more shallow approaches have to be employed to reach a sufficient reliability with a reasonable amount of effort.","In this paper, we present a chunk based partial parser, following ideas from (Abney, 1996), which is used to to generate shallow syntactic structures from speech recognizer output. These representations then serve as the basis for scores used in the task of reranking Nbest lists.","The organization of this paper is as follows: In section 2 we introduce the concept of chunk.parsing and how we interpret and use it in our system. Section 3 deals with the issue of reranking Nbest lists and the question of why we consider it appropriate to use chunk representations for this task. In section 4, the system architecture is described, and then the results from an evaluation of the system are presented and discussed (sections 5 and 6). Finally, we give the results of a small study with human subjects on an analogous task (section 7), before point-ing out directions for future research (section 8) and summarizing our work (section 9). 2","Chunk Parsing There have been recent developments which encourage the investigation of the possibility of parsing speech in unrestricted domains. It was demonstrated that parsing natural language 2 can be han-WER ----- 100.0. substitutiona-~d~leticms-~insertions","correctt ~ubstitutiollsJrd¢|¢tion$","2mostly of the written, but also of the spoken type 1453 dled by very simple, even finite-state approaches if one adheres to the principle of \"chunking\" the input into small and hence easily manageable constituents (Abney, 1996; Light, 1996).","We use the notion of a chunk similar to (Abney, 1996), namely a contiguous, non-recursive phrase. Chunk phrases mostly correspond to traditional no-tions of syntactic constituents, such as NPs or PPs, but there are exceptions, e.g. VCs (\"verb complex phrases\"), which are not used in most traditional linguistic paradigms. 3 Unlike in (Abney, 1996), our goal was not to build a multi-stage, cascaded system to result in full sentence parses, but to confine ourselves to parsing of \"basic chunks\".","A strong rationale for following this simple approach is the nature of the ill-formed input due to (i) spontaneous speech dysfluencies, and (ii) errors in the hypotheses of the speech recognizer.","To get an intuitive feel about the output of the chunk parser, we present a short example here: 4 [conj BUT] [np HE] [vc DOESN'T REALLY LIKE] [np HIS HISTORY TEACHER] [advp VERY MUCH] 3 Reranking of Speech Recognizer Nbest Lists State-of-the-art speech recognizers, such as the JANUS recognizer (Waibel et al., 1996) whose output we used for our system, typically generate lattices of word hypotheses. From these lattices, Nbest lists can be computed automatically, such that it is ensured that the ordering of hypotheses in these lists corresponds to the internal ranking of the speech recognizer.","As an example, we present a reference utterance (i.e., \"what was actually said\") and two hypotheses from the Nbest list, given with their rank: KEF: YOU WEREN'T BORN JUST TO SOAK UP SUN","1: YOU WF.JtEN'T BORN JUSTICE SO CUPS ON 190: YOU WEREN'T BORN JUST TO SOAK UP SUN","This is a typical example, in that it is frequently the case that hypotheses which are ranked further down the list, are actually closer to the true (reference) utterance (i.e., the WER would be lower). 5 So, if we had an oracle that could tell the speech recognizer to always pick the hypothesis with the lowest WER from the Nbest list (instead of the top","3A VC-chunk is a contiguous verbal segment of an utterance, whereas a VP usually comprises this verbal segment and its arguments together.","4conj=conjunction chunk, np=noun phrase chunk, vc=verb complex chunk, advp--adverbial phrase chunk","5In this case, hypothesis 190 is completely correct; generally it is not the case, particularly for longer utterances, to find the correct hypothesis in the lattice. ranked hypothesis), the global performance could be improved significantly. 6","In the speech recognizer architecture, the search module is guided mostly by very local phenomena, both in the acoustic models (a context of several phones), and in the language models (a context of several words). Also, the recognizer does not make use of any syntactic (or constituent-based) howledge.","Thus, the intuitive idea is to generate representations that allow for a discriminative judgment between different hypotheses in the Nbest list, so that eventually a more plausible candidate can be identified, if, as it is the case in the following example, the resulting chunk structure is more likely to be well-formed than that of the first ranked hypothesis:","1: [np YOU] [vc ~.J~.$I'T BORN] [np JUSTICE]","[advp SO] [np CUPS] [advp ON]","190: [np YOU] [vc WFJtEN'T BORN]","[advp JUST] [vc TO SOAK UP] [np SUN]","We use two main scores to assess this plausibility: (i) a chunk coverage score (percentage of input string which gets parsed), and (ii) a chunk language model score, which is using a standard n-gram model based on the chunk sequences. The latter should give worse scores in cases like hypothesis (1) in our example, where we encounter the vc-np-advp-np-advp sequence, as opposed to hypothesis (190) with the more natural vc-advp-vc-np sequence. 4 System Architecture 4.1 Overview","Figure 1 shows the global system architecture. The Nbest lists are generated from lattices that are produced by the JANUS speech recognizer (Walbel et al., 1996). First, the hypothesis duplicates with respect to silence and noise words are removed from the Nbest lists 7, next the word stream is tagged with Brill's part of speech (POS) tagger (Brill, 1994), Version 1.14, adapted to the SWITCHBOARD Corpus. Then, the token stream is \"cleaned up\" in the preprocessing pipe, which then serves as the input of the POS based chunk parser. Finally, the chunk representations generated by the parser are used to compute scores which are the basis of the rescoring component that eventually generates new reranked Nbest lists.","In the following, we describe the major components of the system in more detail. 6On our data, from WER.--43.5~ to WER=30.4%, using the top 300 hypotheses of each utterance (see Table I). 7since we are ignoring these pieces of information in later stages of processing 1454 input utlemnces speech recognizer"]},{"title":"t wordlattices ] duplicate filter I","paragraphs":[".........................

Multiple word repeti-tions and non-content interjections or adverbs (e.g., \"actually\") are removed from the input, some short forms are expanded (e.g., \"we'll\" -+ \"we will\"), and frequent word sequences are combined into a single token (e.g., % lot of\" --~ \"a_lot_of\"). Longer turns are segmented into short clauses, which are defined as consisting of at least a subject and an inflected verbal form. 4.3 Chunk Parser The chunk parser is a chart based context free parser, originally developed for the purpose of semantic frame parsing (Ward, 1991). For our purposes, we define the chunks to be the relevant concepts in the underlying grammar. We use 20 different chunks that consist of part of speech sequences (there are 40 different POS tags in the version of Brill's tagger that we are using). Since the grammar is non-recursive, no attachments of constituents are made, and, also due to its small size, parsing is extremely fast (more than 2000 tokens per second), s The parser takes the POS sequence from the tagged input, parses it in chunks, and finally, these POS-chunks are combined again with the words from the input stream. 4.4 Nbest Rescorer The rescorer's task is to take an Nbest list generated from the speech recognizer and to label each element in this list (=hypothesis) with a new score which should correspond to the true WER of the respective hypothesis; these new scores are then used for the reranking of the Nbest list. Thus, in the optimal case, the hypothesis with lowest WER would move to the top of the reranked Nbest list.","The three main components of the rescorer are:","1. Score Calculation: There are three types of scores used:","(a) normalized score from the recognizer (with respect to the acoustic and language models used internally): highest score = lowest rank number in the original Nbest list","(b) chunk coverage scores: derived from the relative coverage of the chunk parser for each hypothesis: highest score = complete coverage, no skipped words in the hypothesis","(c) chunk language model score: this is a standard n-gram score, derived from the sequence of chunks in each hypothesis (as opposed to the sequence of words in the recognizer): high score = high probability for the chunk sequence; the chunk language model was computed on the chunk parses of the LDC 9 SWITCHBOARD transcripts (about 3 million words total; we computed standard 3-gram and 5-gram backoff models).","2. Reranking Neural Network: We are using a standard three layer backpropagation neural network. The input units are the scores described here, the output unit should be a good predictor of the true WER of the hypothesis. For training of the neural net, the data was split randomly into a training and a test set.","3. Cutoff Filter: Initial experiments and data analysis showed clearly that in short utterances (less than 5-10 words) the potential reduction in WER is usually low: many of these utterances are (almost) correctly recognized in the SDEC Alpha, 200MHz 9Linguistic Data Consortium 1455 data set Utts. true opt.

In total, 374 utterances were used that were randomly split to form a training and test set. For these utterances, Nbest lists of length 300 were created from speech recognizer lattices. 11 The word error rates (WER) of these sets are given in Table 1. While the true WER corresponds to the WER of the first hypothesis (--top ranked), the optimal WER is computed under the assumption that an oracle would always pick the hypothesis with the lowest WER in every Nbest list. The difference between the average true WER and the optimal WER is 13.1%; this gives the maximum margin of improvement that reranking can possibly achieve on this data set. Another interesting figure is the expected WER gain, when a random process would rerank the Nbest lists and just pick any hypothesis to be the (new) top one. For the test set, this expected WER gain is -4.9% (i.e., the WER would drop by 4.9%). 5.2 Global System Speed The system runtime, starting from the POS-tagger through all components up to the final evaluation of WER gain for the 103 utterances of the test set (ca. 8400 hypotheses, 145000 tokens) is less than 10 minutes on a DEC Alpha workstation (200 MHz, 192MB RAM), i.e., the throughput is more than 10 utterances per minute (or 840 hypotheses per minute). 5.3 Part Of Speech Tagger We are using Brill's part of speech tagger as an important preprocessing component of our system (Brill, 1994).

The tagset was slightly modified and adapted, to accommodate phenomena of spoken language (e.g., hesitation words, fillers), and to facilitate the task of the segmentation module (e.g., by tagging clausal and non-clausal coordinators differently). After the adaptive training, the POS accuracy is 91.2% on general SWITCHBOARD 12 and 88.3% on a manually tagged subset of the training data we used for our experiments. 13","Fortunately, some of these tagging errors are irrelevant with respect to the POS based chunk grammar: the tagger's performance with respect to this grammar is 92.8% on general SWITCHBOARD, and 90.6% for the manually tagged subset from our training set. 5.4 Chunk Parser The evaluation of the chunk parser's accuracy was done on the following data sets: (i) 20 utterances (5 references and 15 speech recognizer hypotheses) (20utts); (ii) the same data, but with manual corrections of POS tags and short clause segment boundaries (20utts-corr).","For each word appearing in the chunk parser's output (including the skipped words14), it was determined, whether it belonged to the correct chunk, or whether it had to be classified into one of these three error categories:","• \"missing\": either not parsed or wrongfully in-corporated in another chunk; • \"wrong\": belongs to the wrong type of chunk;","• \"superfluous\": parsed as a chunk that should not be there (because it should be a part of another chunk) 12The original.LDC transcripts not used in our rescoring evaluations. 13These numbers are significantly lower than those achievable by taggers for written language~ we conjecture that one reason for this lower performance is due to the more refined tagset we use which causes a higher amount of ambiguity for some frequent words. 14Skipped words are words that could not be parsed into any chunks. 1456 data set eval21 test best expected","performance WER gain +2.0 +0.5 +0.3 -4.9 Table 3: WER gain: best results in neural net experiments for two test sets (in absolute"]},{"title":"%)","paragraphs":["The results of this evaluation are given in Table 2.

We ran experiments to test various combinations of the following parameters: type of chunk language model (3-gram vs. 5-gram); chunk score parameters (e.g., penalty factors for skipped words, length normalization parameters); hypothesis length cutoffs (for the cutoff filter); number of hidden units; number of training epochs.","The net with the best performance on the test set has one hidden unit, and is trained for 10 epochs.

In this way we get rid of the skipping penalties we were using so far and which blurred the statistical nature of the model.","• identifying good reranking candidates: So far, the only and exclusive heuristics we are using for determining when to rerank and when not to, is to use the length-cutoff filter to exclude short utterances from being considered in the final reranking procedure. (Chase, 1997) showed that there are a number of potentially useful \"features\" from various sources within the recognizer which can predict, at least to a certain extent, the \"confidence\" that the recognizer has about a particular hypothesis. Hypotheses 1458 which have a higher WER on average also exhibit a higher word gain potential, and therefore these predictions appear to be promising indeed."]},{"title":"• adding argument structure representations:","paragraphs":["The chunk representation in our system only gives an idea about which constituents there are in a clause and what their ordering is.
