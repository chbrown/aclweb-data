Our unsupervised approach uses a heuristic based on attachment proximity and trains from raw text that is annotated with only part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms, as opposed to attachment information. It is therefore less resource-intensive and more portable than previous corpus-based algorithm proposed for this task. We present results for prepositional phrase attachment in both English and Spanish. 1 Introduction Prepositional phrase attachment is the task of deciding, for a given preposition in a sentence, the attachment site that corresponds to the interpretation of the sentence.

Previous work has framed the problem as a classification task, in which the goal is to predict N or V, corresponding to noun or verb attachment, given the head verb v, the head noun n, the preposition p, and optionally, the object of the preposition n2. For example, the"]},{"title":"(v, n,p,","paragraphs":["n2) tuples corresponding to the example sentences are 1. bought shirt with pockets 2. washed shirt with soap The correct classifications of tuples 1 and 2 are N and V, respectively.","(Hindle and Rooth, 1993) describes a partially supervised approach in which the FIDDITCH partial parser was used to extract"]},{"title":"(v,n,p)","paragraphs":["tuples from raw text, where p is a preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the head verb v and the head noun n.

Later work, such as (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Merlo et al., 1997; Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997; Franz, 1997), trains and tests on quintuples of the form"]},{"title":"(v,n,p, n2,a)","paragraphs":["extracted from the Penn treebank(Marcus et al., 1994), and has gradually improved on this accuracy with other kinds of statistical learning methods, yielding up to 84.5% accuracy(Collins and Brooks, 1995). Recently, (Stetina and Nagao, 1997) have reported 88% accuracy by using a corpus-based model in conjunction with a semantic dictionary.","While previous corpus-based methods are highly accurate for this task, they are difficult to port to other languages because they require resources that are expensive to construct or simply nonexistent in other languages. We present an unsupervised algorithm for prepositional phrase attachment in English that requires only an part-of-speech tagger and a morphology database, and is therefore less resource-intensive and more portable than previous approaches, which have all required either treebanks or partial parsers. 3 Unsupervised Prepositional Phrase Attachment The exact task of our algorithm will be to construct a classifier"]},{"title":"cl","paragraphs":["which maps an instance of an ambiguous prepositional phrase (v, n, p, n2) to either N or V, corresponding to noun attachment or verb attachment, respectively. In the full natural language parsing task, there are more than just two potential attachment sites, but we limit our task to choosing between a verb v and a noun n so that we may compare with previous supervised attempts on this problem. While we will be given the candidate attachment sites during testing, the training procedure assumes no a priori information about potential attachment sites. 3.1 Generating Training Data From Raw Text We generate training data from raw text by using a part-of-speech tagger, a simple chunker, an extraction heuristic, and a morphology database. The order in which these tools are applied to raw text is shown in Table 1. The tagger from (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) first annotates sentences of raw text with a sequence of part-of-speech tags. The chunker, implemented with two small regular expressions, then replaces simple noun phrases and quantifier phrases with their head words. The extraction heuristic then finds head word tuples and their likely attachments from the tagged and chunked text. The heuristic relies on the observed fact that in English and in languages with similar word order, the attachment site of a preposition is usually located only a few words to the left of the preposition. Finally, numbers are replaced by a single token, the text is converted to lower case, and the morphology database is used to find the base forms of the verbs and nouns.","The extracted head word tuples differ from the training data used in previous supervised attempts in an important way. In the supervised case, both of the potential sites, namely the verb v and the noun n are known before the attachment is resolved. In the unsupervised case discussed here, the extraction heuristic only finds what it thinks are"]},{"title":"unambiguous","paragraphs":["cases of prepositional phrase attachment. Therefore, there is only one possible attachment site for the preposition, and either the verb v or the noun n does not exist, in the case of noun-attached preposition or a verb-attached preposition, respectively. This extraction heuristic loosely resembles a step in the bootstrapping procedure used to get training data for the classifier of (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). In that step, unambiguous attachments from the FIDDITCH parser's output are initially used to resolve some of the ambiguous attachments, and the resolved cases are iteratively used to disambiguate the remaining unresolved cases. Our procedure differs critically from (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) in that we do not iterate, we extract unambiguous attachments from unparsed input sentences, and we totally ignore the ambiguous cases.

We will report accuracies (in Sec-tion 5) on both cases where p = of and where p ~ of. Also, the heuristic excludes examples with the verb to be from the training set (but not the test set) since we found them to be unreliable sources of evidence. 1081 3.2 Accuracy of Extraction Heuristic Applying the extraction heuristic to 970K unannotated sentences from the 1988 Wall St. Journal 1 data yields approximately 910K unique head word tuples of the form (v,p, n2) or (n,p, n2). The extraction heuristic is far from perfect; when applied to and compared with the annotated Wall St. Journal data of the Penn treebank, only 69% of the extracted head word tuples represent correct attachments. 2 The extracted tuples are meant to be a noisy but abundant substitute for the information that one might get from a treebank. Tables 2 and 3 list the most frequent extracted head word tuples for unambiguous verb and noun attachments, respectively. Many of the frequent noun-attached (n,p, n2) tuples, such as hum to num, 3 are incorrect. The prepositional phrase to hum is usually attached to a verb such as rise or fall in the Wall St. Journal domain, e.g., Profits rose ,{6 ~ to 52 million. 1This data is available from the Linguistic Data Con-","sortium, http ://www.

We therefore must use any information in the unambiguous cases to resolve the ambiguous cases. A natural way is to use a classifier that compares the probability of each outcome:","cl(v,n,p, n2) = N if p = of arg maxae{N,V} Pr(v,n,p, a) otherwise"]},{"title":"(1)","paragraphs":["We do not currently use n2 in the probability model, and we omit it from further discussion.","We can factor Pr(v,n,p, a) as follows: Pr(v,n,p,a) = Pr(v)Pr(n) Pr(a[v,n) Pr(p[a, v, n) The terms Pr(n) and Pr(v) are independent of the attachment a and need not be computed in d (1), but the estimation of Pr(a[v,n) and Pr(pla, v,n ) is problematic since our training data, i.e., the head words extracted from raw text, occur with either n or v, but never both n, v. This leads to make some heuristically motivated approximations. Let the random variable ¢ range over {true, false}, and let it de-note the presence or absence of any preposition that is unambiguously attached to the noun or verb in question.

Furthermore, we do not use the second noun n2, whereas the best supervised methods use this information.

We used the Spanish tagger and morphological analyzer developed at the Xerox Research Centre Europe 4 and we modified the extraction heuristic to account for the new tagset, and to account for the Spanish equivalents of the words of (i.e., de or del) and to be (i.e., set). Chunking was not performed on the Spanish data. We used 450k sentences of raw text from the Linguistic Data Consortium's Spanish News Text Collection to extract a training set, and we used a non-overlapping set of 50k sentences from the collection to create test sets. Three native Spanish speakers were asked to extract and annotate ambiguous in-stances of Spanish prepositional phrase attachments. They annotated two sets (using the full sentence context); one set consisted of all ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments of the form (v,n,p, n2), and the other set consisted of cases where p = con.

Since only a small part of the extraction heuristic is specific to English, and since part-of-speech taggers and morphology databases are widely available in other languages, our approach is far more portable than previous approaches for this problem. We successfully demonstrated the portability of our approach by applying it to the prepositional phrase attachment task in the Spanish language. 8","Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Lauri Kartunnen for lending us the Spanish natural language tools, and Mike Collins for helpful discussions on this work.
