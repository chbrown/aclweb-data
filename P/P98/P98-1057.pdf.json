One active research area concerns the de-sign of non-commutative versions of linear logic (Abrusci, 1991; Rdtor6, 1993) which can be sensitive to word order while retaining the hypothetical reasoning capabilities of standard (commutative) linear logic that make it so well-adapted to handling such phenomena as quantifier scoping (Dalrymple et al., 1995).","Some connections between the Lambek calculus and group structure have long been known (van Benthem, 1986), and linear logic itself has some aspects strongly reminiscent of groups (the producer/consumer duality of a formula A with its linear negation Aa-), but no serious attempt has been made so far to base a theory of linguistic description solely on group structure.","This paper presents such a model, G-grammars (for \"group grammars\"), and argues that:","• The standard group-theoretic notion of conjugacy, which is central in G-grammars, is well-suited to a uniform description of commutative and non-commutative aspects of language;","• The use of conjugacy provides an elegant approach to long-distance dependency and scoping phenomena, both in parsing and in generation;"]},{"title":"•","paragraphs":["G-grammars give a symmetrical account of the semantics-phonology relation, from which it is easy to extract, via simple group calculations, rewriting systems computing this relation for the parsing and generation modes."]},{"title":"2 Group Computation","paragraphs":["A MONOID AI is a set M together with a product M × 31 --+ ,ll, written (a, b) ~+ ab, such that: • This product is associative;","• There is an element 1 E M (the neutral element) with la = al = a for all a 6 M. * This paper is an abridged version of Group Theory and Grammatical Description, TR-MLTT-033, XRCE, April 1998; available on the CMP-LG archive at the address: http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cmp-Ig/9805002.","A GROUP is a monoid in which every element a has an inverse a -1 such that a- l a = aa -1 -- l.","A PREORDER on a set is a reflexive and transitive relation on this set. When the relation is also symmetrical, that is, R(x, Y) ~ R(y, x), then the preorder is called an EQUIVALENCE RELATION. When it is antisymmetrical, that is that is, R(x, Y) A R(y, x) ~ x = Y, it is called a PARTIAL ORDER.","A preorder R on a group G will be said to be COM-PATIBLE with the group product iff, whenever R(x, Y) and R( x', y'), then R( xx', yy'). Normal submonoids of a group. We consider a compatible preorder notated x -4 y on a group G. The following properties, for any x, y E G, are immediate: x -+ y ¢:~ x y- l -41; x -4 y ¢0 y-l -4 x-1; x-41 ¢:v 1-4x-~; x-41 :::¢, yxy-l -41, foranyyEG. Two elements x, x' in a group G are said to be CONJU-GATE if there exists y 6 G such that x' = yxy -1. The fourth property above says that the set A,/ of elements x 6 G such that x -41 is a set which contains along with an element all its conjugates, that is, a NORMAL subset of G. As M is clearly a submonoid of G, it will be called a NORMAL SUBMONOID of G.","Conversely, it is easy to show that with any normal submonoid M of G one can associate a preorder compatible with G. Indeed let's define x-+ y as xy -1 6 M. The relation --~ is clearly reflexive and transitive, hence is a preorder. It is also compatible with G, for if xl --)- yl and x2 -4 y_~, then xly1-1, x2yg. -1 and yl(x~y2-1)y1-1 are in M; hence XlX2y~.-ly1-1 : xlyl-lylx~.y2-1y1-1 is in M, implying that XlX2 -4 yly:, that is, that the preorder is compatible.","If S is a subset of G, the intersection of all normal submonoids of G containing S (resp. of all subgroups of G containing S) is a normal submonoid of G (resp. a","J ln general M is not a subgroup of G. It is iff x ~ y implies Y --+ x, that is, if the compatible preorder --~ is an equivalence relation (and, therefore, a CONGRUENCE) on G. When this is the case, M is a NORMAL SUBGROUPof G. This notion plays a pivotal role in classical algebra. Its generalization to submonoids of G is basic for the algebraic theory of computation presented here."]},{"title":"348","paragraphs":["normal subgroup of G) and is called the NORMAL SUBMONOID CLOSURE NM(S) of S in G (resp. the NORMAL SUBGROUP CLOSURE NG(S) of S in G).

We start by introducing a grammar, which we will call a G-GRAMMAR (for \"Group Grammar\"), for a fragment of English (see Fig. 1).","A G-grammar is a group computation structure with acceptors over a vocabulary V = Vlog U ~/pho~ consisting of a set of logical forms l/~og and a disjoint set of phonological elements (in the example, words) l/~ho,,. Examples of phonological elements are john, saw, ever).,, examples of logical forms j, s (j, 1), ev (re,x, sra(w,y, s (x,y)) ); these logical forms can be glossed respectively as \"john\", \"john saw louise\" and \"for every man x, for some woman y, x saw y\".","The grammar lexicon, or set of relators, R is given as a list of\"lexical schemes\". An example is given in Fig. 1. Each line is a lexical scheme and represents a set of relators in F(V). The first line is a ground scheme, which corresponds to the single relator j john-1, and so are the next four lines. The fifth line is a non-ground scheme, which corresponds to an infinite set of relators, obtained by instanciating the term meta-variable A (notated in uppercase) to a logical form. So are the remaining lines. We use Greek letters for expression meta-variables such as a, which can be replaced by an arbitrary expression of F(V); thus, whereas the term meta-variables A, B ..... range over logical forms, the expression meta-variables ,~, fl ..... range over products of logical forms and phono-349 logical elements (or their inverses) in F(V). 4","The notation p [x] is employed to express the fact that a logical form containing an argument identifier x is equal to the application of the abstraction P to x. The meta-variable X in p [X] ranges over such identifiers (x, y, z .... ), which are notated in lower-case italics (and are always ground). The meta-variable p ranges over logical form abstractions missing one argument (for instance Az. s ( j, z) ). When matching meta-variables in logical forms, we will allow limited use of higher-order unification. For instance, one can match P [X] to -~ (j ,x) by takingP = Az.s(j, z) and X = x.","The vocabulary and the set of relators that we have just specified define a group computation structure GCS = (I,, _R). We will now describe a set of acceptors A for this computation structure.

It is often easier to use the preorder --+. If, for a, b, c 6 F(V), abc is a relator, then abc --+ 1, and therefore b --+ a-lc -1. Taking this remark into account, it is possible to write the relators of our G-grammar as the \"rewriting rules\" of Fig. 2; we use the notation ----\" instead of --+ to distinguish these rules from the parsing rules which will be introduced in the next section.","The rules of Fig. 2 have a systematic structure. The left-hand side of each rule consists of a single logical form, taken from the corresponding relator in the G-grammar; the right-hand side is obtained by \"moving\" all the renmining elements in the relator to the right of the arrow.","Because the rules of Fig. 2 privilege the rewriting of a logical form into an expression of F(V), they are called generation-oriented rules associated with the G-grammar.","Using these rules, and the fact that the preorder is compatible with the product of F(V), the fact that s ( j, 1 ) louise-lsaw-ljohn - 1 is a public result can be obtained in a simpler way than previously.
