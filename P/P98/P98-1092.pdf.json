Three types of syntactic variations were studied : permutation, expansion and substitution. These syntactic variations yield other relations of formal and conceptual nature. Basing on a distinction of the variation relations according to the grammatical function affected in a term - head or modifier - term variants are first clustered into connected components which are in turn clustered into classes. These classes relate two or more components through variations involving a change of head word, thus of topic. The graph obtained reveals the global organisation of research topics in the corpus. A clustering method has been built to compute such classes of research topics."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["The importance of terms in various natural language tasks such as automatic indexing, computer-aided translation, information retrieval and technology watch need no longer be proved. Terms are meaningful textual units used for naming concepts or objects in a given field. Past studies have focused on building term extraction tools : TERMINO (David S. & Plante P. 1991), LEXTER (Bourigault D. 1994), ACABIT (Daille 1994), FASTR (Jacquemin 1995), TERMS (Katz S.M. & Justeson T.S. 1995). Here, term extraction and the identification of syntactic variation relations are considered for topic detection. Variations are changes affecting the structure and the form of a term producing another textual unit close to the initial one e.g. dna amplification and amplification fingerprinting of dna. Variations can point to terminological evolution and thus to that of the underlying concept. Topic is used in its grammatical sense, i.e. the head word in a noun phrase. In the above term, fingerprinting is the topic (head word) and dna amplification its properties (modifiers). However, a topic cannot appear by chance in specialised litterature, so this grammatical definition needs to be backed up by empirical evidence such as recurrence of terms sharing the same head word. We constituted a test corpus of scientific abstracts and titles in English from the field of plant biotechnology making up ---29000 words. These texts covered publications made over 13 years (1981-1993). We focused on three syntactic variation types occurring frequently amongst terms : permutation, substitution and expansion (§2). Tzoukermann E. Klavans J. and Jacquemin C. (1997) extracted morpho-syntactic term variants for NLP tasks such as automatic indexing. They accounted for a wide spectrum of variation producing phenomena like the morpho-syntactic variation involving derivation in tree cutting and trees have been cut down 1. We focused for the moment on terms appearing as noun phrases (NP). Although term variants can appear as verb phrases (VP), we believe that NP variants reflect more terminological stability thus a real shift in topic (root hair --~ root hair deformation) than their VP counterpart (root hair","the root hair appears deformed). Also, our application - research topic identification - being quite sensitive, requires a careful selection of term variants types depending on their interpretability. Examples taken from Tzoukermann et al. (1997). 564 This is to avoid creating relations between terms which could mislead the end-user, typically a technological watcher, in his task.

Based on these three features, morphological make-up, syntactic structure and length, clauses are processed in order to extract complex terms rather than atomic ones. The motivation behind this approach is that complex terms reveal the association of concepts, hence they are more relevant for the application we are considering. A fine-grained term extraction strategy would isolate the concepts and thus lose the information given by their associations in the corpus. For this reason, we could not consider the use of an existing term extraction tool and thus had to carry out a manual simulation of the term extraction phase. NP splitting rules take into account the lexical nature of the constituent words and their raising properties (i.e. derived nouns as opposed to non-derived ones). Furthermore, following the empirical approach successfully implemented by Bourigault (1994), we split complex NPs only after a search has been performed in the corpus for occurrences of their sub-segments in unambiguous situations, i.e. when the sub-segments are not included in a larger segment. This favours the extraction of pre-conceived textual units possibly corresponding to domain terms. However morpho-syntactic features alone cannot verify the terminological status of the units extracted since they can also select non terms (see Smadja 1993).

The statistical criterion consisted in eliminating terms starting with the and appearing only once. These two criteria enabled us to eliminate 30% (1304) candidates and to retain 70% (3159) which we consider to be likely terminological units. We are aware that this filtering procedure remains approximate and cannot eliminate bad candidates like book review whose morphological and lexical make-up correspond to those of terms. But we also observe that such bad candidates are naturally filtered out in later stages as they rarely possess variants and thus will not appear as research topics (see §4)."]},{"title":"2 Identifying syntactic variants","paragraphs":["Given the two syntactic structures under which a term can appear - compound or syntagmatic - we first pre-processed the terms by transforming those in a syntagmatic structure into their compound version. This transformation is based on the following noun phrase formation rule for English :","DAM1 h p m Mz---~ D A m M2 Ml h where D, A and M are respectively strings of determiner, adjective and words whose place can be empty, h is a head noun, m is a word and p is a preposition. Thus, the compound version of the specific nodulation of alfalfa will give the specific alfalfa nodulation. This transformation does not modify the original structure under which a term occurred in the corpus. It only serves to furnish input data to the syntactic variation identification programs. This transformation which is equivalent to permutation (§2.1)is the linguistic relation which once accounted for, reveals the formal nature of the other types of syntactic variations. Also, it enables us to detect variants in the two syntactic structures thus accounting for syntactic variants such as defined in Tzoukermann et al. (1997). In what follows, t~ and t2 are terms."]},{"title":"2.1 Permutation (Perm)","paragraphs":["It marks the transformation of a term, from a syntagmatic structure to a compound one : tI=ANMI hpmM2 t2=AmM2NMI h 2 It apparently refers to a breed (line) of cattle. where tl is really found in the corpus, N is a string of words that is either empty or a noun. 37 terms were concerned by this relation. Some examples are given in Table 1. 2.2 Substitution (Sub) It marks the replacing of a component word in tl by another word in t2 in terms of equal length. Only one word can be replaced and at the same position to ensure the interpretability of the relation. We distinguished between modifier and head substitution. • Modifier substitution (M-Sub) :","t2 is a substitution of t~ if and only if :","t~ = M 1 m M 2 h and t2 = M~ m' M 2 h","with m' ~ m • Head substitution (H-Sub) :","t2 is a substitution of tl if and only if :","tz= Mmh andt2= Mmh'","with h' ~ h Tzoukermann et al. (1997) considered chemical treatment against disease and disease treatment as substitution variants whereas, in our study, after transformation, they would be a case of left-expansion (L-Exp). Examples of head and modifier substitutions are given in Table 2. 1543 terms shared substitution relations : 1084 in the modifier substitution and 872 in the head substitution. The same term can occur in both categories. 2.3 Expansion (Exp) Expansion is the generic name designating three elementary operations of word adjunction in an existing term. Word adjunction can occur in three positions : left, right or within. Thus we have left expansion, right expansion and insertion respectively. • Left expansion (L-Exp) :","tz is a left-expansion of t~ if and only if :","tl = Mh and t2 = M' m' M h • Right expansion (R-Exp) :","t2 is a right-expansion of t~ if and only if :","tl =M h and t2 = M h M' h' • Insertion (Ins) :","t2 is an insertion of t~ if and only if :","tl =Ml mMzh","t2 =M1 mm'M'MEh 566 Examples of each sub-type of expansion are given in Table 3. Some terms combine the two types of expansion - left and right expansions (noted LR-Exp), for example root of bragg ---> root exudate of soyabean cultivar bragg. These complex expansion variants were also identified. A total of 1014 terms were involved in the expansion variation relations. Altogether, 82% (2593 out of 3159) terms were involved in the three types of syntactic variations studied showing the importance of the phenomena amongst terms.","Syntagmatic structure accession of azolla-anabaena avirulent strain of pseudomonas syringae curling of root hair excision of nodule the specific nodulation of alfalfa","Compound structure azolla-anabaena accession avirulent pseudomonas syringae strain root hair curling / root-hair curling nodule excision the specific alfalfa nodulation Table 1.

An efficient algorithm has been implemented in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1997) which seeks growing series of 568 such classifications. These series represent more or less fine-grained structurings of the corpus. A more formal description of the CPCL method can be found in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1998). Table 4 shows a component and a class.

External links between classes are given by bold lines for R-Exp and LR-Exp, dotted lines portray head-substitution H-Sub. Only one term from each class is shown for legibility reasons. We observe that classes like 17, 19, 18 and 9 have a lot of external links and seem to be at the core of research topics in the corpus. Classes like 12, 3 and 13 share strong external links with a single class which could indicate privileged thematic relations. The unique link between class 3 and 19 is explained by the fact that 3 represented an emerging topic 4 at the time the corpus was constituted (1993) : the research done around a new gene type (the klebsiella pneumoniae nifb gene). So it was relevant that this class be strongly linked to class 19 without being central. Also, class 10 represented an emerging topic in 1993 : the research for retrotransposable elements which enables the passing from one gene to another. Research topics evolution and transformation can be traced through a chronological analysis of clustered term variants (see Ibekwe-SanJuan 1998). The results obtained can support scientific and technological watch activities."]},{"title":"Concluding remarks","paragraphs":["Syntactic variation relations are promising linguistic phenomena for tracking topic evolution in texts. However, being that clustering is based on syntactic variation relations, the CPCL method cannot detect topics related through semantic or pragmatic relations. For instance, the topic depicted by class 8 (glycine max) should have been related to topic 20 (lucerne plant) from a semantic viewpoint. Their separation was caused by the absence of syntactic variations between the constituent terms. Such relations can be brought to light only if further knowledge (semantic) is incorporated into the relations used for clustering. In the future, we will test our clustering method on another corpus of a larger size and extend our study to other variation phenomena as possible topic shifting devices. 4 The interpretations given here are based on an oral communication with a domain information specialist. 569"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements Thanks to the reviewers for their constructive comments which I hope, helped improve this paper.
