The parameters of the model are computed using simple estimates (which makes training much faster than when one uses Maximum Entropy) to directly minimize the error rate on training data.","The results obtained so far not only show good performance on disambiguation of most of the individual morphological categories, but they also show a significant improvement on the overall prediction of the resulting combined tag over a HMM-based tag n-gram model, using even substantially less training data."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["1.1 Orthogonality of morphological","categories of inflective languages The major obstacle in morphological 1 tagging of highly inflective languages, such as Czech or Russian, is - given the resources possibly available - the tagset size. Typically, it is in the order of thousands. This is due to the (partial) \"orthogonality \"2 of simple morphological categories, which then multiply when creating a \"flat\" list of tags. However, the individual categories contain only a very small number of different values; e.g., number has five (Sg, P1, Dual, Any, and \"not applicable\"), case nine etc.","The \"orthogonality\" should not be taken to mean complete independence, though. Inflectional languages (as opposed to agglutinative languages such as Finnish or Hungarian) typically combine several certain categories into one morpheme (suffix or end-ing). At the same time, the morphemes display a high degree of ambiguity, even across major POS categories.","For example, most of the Czech nouns can form singular and plural forms in all seven cases, most adjectives can (at least potentially) form all (4) genders, both numbers, all (7) cases, all (3) degrees of comparison, and can be either of positive or negative polarity. That gives 336 possibilities (for adjectives), many of them homonymous on the surface. On the other hand, pronouns and numerals do","1 This type of tagging is sometimes called morpho-syntactic tagging. However, to stress that we are not dealing with syntactic categories such as Object or Attribute (but rather with morphological categories such as Number or Case) we will use the term \"morphological\" here.","2By orthogonality we mean that all combinations of values of two (or more) categories are systematically possible, i.e. that every member of the cartesian product of the two (or more) sets of values do appear in the language. not display such an orthogonality, and even adjectives are not fully orthogonal - an ancient \"dual\" number, happily living in modern Czech in the feminine, plural and instrumental case adds another 6 sub-orthogonal possibilities to almost every adjective. Together, we employ 3127 plausible combinations (including style and diachronic variants). 1.2 The individual categories There are 13 morphological categories currently used for morphological tagging of Czech: part of speech, detailed POS (called \"subpart of speech\"), gender, number, case, possessor's gender, possessor's number, person, tense, degree of comparison, negativeness (affirmative/negative), voice (active/passive), and variant/register.","The P0S category contains only the major part of speech values (noun (N), verb (V), adjective (A), pro-noun (P), verb (V), adjective (A), adverb (D), numeral (C), preposition (R), conjunction (J), interjection (I), particle (T), punctuation (Z), and \"undefined\" (X)). The \"subpart of speech\" (SUBPOS) contains details about the major category mad has 75 different values. For example, verbs (POS: V) are divided into simple finite form in present or future tense (B), conditional (c), infinitive (f), imperative (i), etc. 3","All the categories vary in their size as well as in their unigram entropy (see Table 1) computed using the standard entropy definition Hp = - ~ p(y)log(p(y)) (1) yEY where p is the unigram distribution estimate based on the training data, and Y is the set of possible values of the category in question.

The morphological analyzer used for this purpose (Hajji, in prep.), (Haji~, 1994) covers about 98% of running unrestricted text (newspaper, magazines, novels, etc.). It is based on a lexicon containing about 228,000 lemmas and it can analyze about 20,000,000 word forms. 2","The Training Data Our training data consists of about 130,000 tokens of newspaper and magazine text, manually double-tagged and then corrected by a single judge.","Our training data consists of about 130,000 tokens of newspaper and magazine text, manually tagged using a special-purpose tool which allows for easy disambiguation of morphological output. The data has been tagged twice, with manual resolution of discrepancies (the discrepancy rate being about 5%, most of them being simple tagging errors rather than opinion differences).","One data item contains several fields: the input word form (token), the disambiguated tag, the set of all possible tags for the input word form, the disambiguated lemma, and the set of all possible lemmas with links to their possible tags. Out of these, we are currently interested in the form, its possible tags and the disambiguated tag. The lemmas are ignored for tagging purposes. 4","The tag from the \"disambiguated tag\" field as well as the tags from the \"possible tags\" field are further divided into so called subtags (by morphological category). In the set \"possible tags field\",","4In fact, tagging helps in most cases to disambiguate the lemmas. Lemma disambiguation is a separate process following tagging. The lemma disambiguation is a much simpler problem - the average number of different lemmas per token (as output by the morphological analyzer) is only 1.15.

Some errors might be eliminated if features asking questions about the disambiguated context are being used. The disambiguated tags concentrate - or transfer - in-formation about the more distant context. It would avoid \"repeated\" learning of the same or similar features for different but related disambiguation problems. The final effect on the overall accuracy is yet to be seen. Moreover, the transition function assumed by the Viterbi algorithm must be reasonably defined (approximated).","• Final re-estimation using maximum entropy. Let's imagine that after selecting all the features using the training method described here we recompute the feature weights using the usual maximum entropy objective function. This will produce better (read: more principled) weight estimates for the features already selected, but it might help as well as hurt the performance.","• Improved feature pool. This is, according to our opinion, the source of major improvement. The error analysis shows that in many cases the","9No overtraining occurred here either, but the results for thresholds 2-4 do not differ significantly. l°For English, using the Penn 23\"eebank data, we have always obtained better accuracy using the VTC method (and redefinition of the tag set based on 4 categories). 489 Threshold: 128 16 8 4 2 Features learned: 23 213 772 1529 4571 Category POS SUBPOS GENDER NUMBER CASE POSSGENDER POSSNUMBER PERSON TENSE GRADE NEGATION VOICE VAR Overall Sep VTC 1.50 1.32 1.24 1.40 4.50 4.06 3.46 2.94 11.10 10.52 O.08 0.10 0.14 0.04 0.28 0.18 0.36 0.18 0.88 1.00 0.62 0.26 0.38 0.18 0.26 0.18 16.50 13.22 Sep VTC 0.86 0.78 0.78 0.84 3.00 2.80 2.62 2.40 7.74 7.66 0.08 0.12 0.04 0.04 0.14 0.16 0.16 0.14 0.70 0.30 0.34 0.36 0.16 0.14 0.24 0.22 12.20 9.58 Sep VTC 0.66 0.60 0.70 0.64 2.40 2.14 1.86 1.72 5.30 5.34 0.08 0.04 0.04 0.00 0.16 0.10 0.10 0.12 0.44 0.30 0.28 0.26 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.14 8.42 6.98 Sep VTC 0.44 0.42 0.36 0.48 2.14 1.80 1.72 1.56 4.82 4.80 0.04 0.06 0.02 0.02 0.14 0.12 0.10 0.12 0.22 0.18 0.24 0.24 0.10 0.12 0.12 0.14 7.62 6.22 Sep VTC 0.36 0.44 0.30 0.48 2.08 1.90 1.80 1.50 4.88 4.84 0.02 0.04 0.00 0.00 0.12 0.06 0.I0 0.08 0.22 0.16 0.26 0.24 0.08 0.08 0.12 0.04 7.66 6.20 Table 5: Resulting Error Rate in % (newspaper, training size: 160,000, test size: 5000 tokens) context to be used for disambiguation has not been used by the tagger simply because more sophisticated features have not been considered for selection. An example of such a feature, which would possibly help to solve the very hard and relatively frequent problem of disambiguat-ing between nominative and accusative cases of certain nouns, would be a question \"Is there a noun in nominative case only in the same clause?\" - every clause may usually have only one noun phrase in nominative, constituting its subject. For such feature to work we will have to correctly determine or at least approximate the clause boundaries, which is obviously a nontrivial task by itself. 7","Acknowledgements Various parts of this work has been supported by the following grants: Open Foundation RSS/HESP 195/1995, Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (GA(~R) 405/96/K214, and Ministry of Education Project No. VS96151.
