We primarily show how incremental translation is achieved in the context of an example-based framework. We then examine the type of translation examples required for a simultaneous interpretation to create naturally communicative dialogs. Finally, we propose a scheme for automatic simultaneous interpretation exploiting this example-based incremental translation mechanism. Preliminary experimentation analyzing the performance of our example-based incremental translation mechanism leads us to believe that the proposed scheme can be utilized to achieve a practical simultaneous interpretation system. Introduction Speech-to-speech translation necessitates quick and perspicuous responses to natural communication. Furthermore, since dialogues continuously expand, it is essential to incrementally translate inputs to avoid interrupting the coherency of communications. Therefore, a high degree of incrementality and acceptability in translation such as simultaneous interpretation is essential. To satisfy these requirements, an incremental translation system, which functions as a simultaneous interpreter, is seen as an efficient solution in this field.","The main characteristic of incremental translations is the translation process. This is activated synchronously with the input, in contrast with conventional sentence-by-sentence-based translation which cannot start processing until the end of an input (Kitano, 1994). However, in incremental translation, we believe that the following issues must be resolved to achieve actual simultaneous interpretation : • How to define Information Units (IUs)","(Halliday, 1994) to determine appropriate","components for translation - Since","differences exist among the word order of","various languages, especially between","linguistically distant languages such as English","and Japanese, appropriate transfer units,","equally effective for both the source and target","languages, have to be defined.","• How to determine plausible translation for each IU - In terms of the information content, the greater the number of words contained in IUs, the less semantic ambiguity in translation, or the later the response is obtained. Because of time restrictions, deterministic processing by exploiting specious measures (e.g. linguistical or statistical plausibility) is required for each IU translation in order to shorten the length of IUs.","* How to install simultaneous interpreters' know-how (i.e. empirical knowledge) - In practical simultaneous interpretation, human translators generally use strong sentence planning using particular empirical know-how. The exploitation of this kind of knowledge is essential for achieving practical simultaneous interpretation (Kitano, 1994).","Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT)","(Furuse, 1994a) (Mima, 1997) has been proposed,","and an efficient method of spoken dialog","translation. TDMT has the following key features:","• Utilization of Constituent Boundary Patterns (CB-Patterns) (Fumse, 1994b) (Furuse, 1996) - CB-Patterns based on meaningful information units are applied to parse an input incrementally and produce translations based on the synchronization of the source and target language structure pairs (Abeillr, 1990) (Shieber, 1990).

Accordingly, TDMT has the advantage of having both the capability to define effective IU and an efficient deterministic processing scheme in incremental spoken-language translation.","Additionally, in exploiting the empirical \"knowledge that is required in practical simultaneous interpretation, we can assume that the empirical knowledge is described within the linguistic resource of simultaneous interpretation corpora. (Harbusch, 1992) proposed a method of default handling in incremental generation based on this observation.","in this paper, we describe the achievement of practical simultaneous interpretation using a TDMT. Furthermore, we discuss what kind of empirical knowledge is required for realizing efficient simultaneous interpretation, in terms of a simultaneous translator's knowledge, as well as proposing a method to exploit this empirical knowledge in an example-based framework in order to produce consistent translations.","A preliminary experiment analyzing our proposed scheme indicates that it should be able to be used in achieving simultaneous interpretation systems.","The next section of the paper briefly explains incremental translation using TDMT. Section 2 discusses the type of empirical knowledge necessary in simultaneous interpretation using some examples. Section 3 describes our proposed scheme for exploiting simultaneous interpretation examples. Section 4 presents a preliminary experiment for analyzing our proposed scheme to confirm its feasibility. Section 5 examines some related research in the field of incremental translation. Finally, a summary of our approach concludes this paper. 1 Incremental Translation Using Transfer-Driven Machine Translation 1.1 Constituent Boundary Pattern In TDMT, translation is performed by applying stored empirical transfer knowledge, which describes the correspondence between source language expressions and target language expressions at various linguistic levels. The source and target expressions from the transfer knowledge in TDMT are expressed as CB-Patterns, which represent meaningful units for linguistic structure and transfer. The efficient application of transfer knowledge source components to an input string plays a key role in our basic incremental translation scheme. A pattern is defined as a sequence that consists of variables and constituent boundaries such as surface functional words.","The transfer knowledge is compiled from actual translation examples in every source pattern. 1.2 Incremental Pattern Application The incremental application of CB-Pattems is based on the idea of incremental chart parsing (Furuse, 1996) (Amtrup, 1995) with notions of linguistic levels.","The procedure for the application of CB-Patterns is as follows: (a) Determination of possible pattern applications. (b) Translation candidate determination and","structural disambiguation of patterns by","semantic distance calculation. Our scheme determines the best translation and structure parallel with an input sequence and can restrain the number of competing structures (possible translation candidates) at the possible utterance point in the input by performing (a) in parallel with (b), thus reducing the translation costs in time. The structure selected in (b) has its result transferred with head word-information using semantic distance calculations when combined incrementally with other structures. The output sentence is generated as a translation result from the structure for the whole input, which is composed of best-first substructures.","In order to limit the combinations of patterns and control the appropriate timing of each partial utterance during pattern application, we distinguish pattern levels, and specify the linguistic sublevel permitted for use in the assigned variables for each linguistic level. This is because if any combinations of patterns are permitted, it is obvious that the possibility of combinations are easily exploded. Table 1 shows examples of the relationship between linguistic levels. Every CB-pattern is categorised as one of the linguistic levels, and a variable on a given level is instantiated by a string on the linguistic levels in the second column of Table 1.","For instance, in the noun phrase \"X"]},{"title":"of","paragraphs":["Y\", the variables X and Y cannot be instantiated by a 856 simple sentence pattern, but can be instatiated by NP such as a noun phrase pattern or a compound noun pattern.","Moreover, these levels give a guideline to the timing of utterance production (i.e. the timing of when an utterance is said). For example, each simple sentence level pattern has utterance markers (Table 2, where '/' indicates the utterance markers) for possible insertion of an utterance during left-to-right application of the pattern. Thus, redundant or incomplete partial matchings can be eliminated and an appropriate trigger of utterance can be obtained.","(Furuse, 1996) provides further details of the algorithm for incremental CB-Parsing."]},{"title":"Table 1 Possible linguistic sublevels in variables","paragraphs":["Linguistic level Simple sentence Verb phrase (VP) Noun phrase (NP) compound noun (CN) Sublevels of variables VP, NP ....

We can observe the following Japanese-to-English transfer knowledge about \"X no Y'\" from such translation examples as the source-target pairs of : \"hoteru no jasho'\" --~ \"the address of the hotel\", \"eigo no paNfuretto'\" ~ \"the pamphlet written in English\", etc.","X no Y =>","Y' ofX' ((hoteru ,jasho) .... ),","'hotel' 'address'","Y' written in X' ((eigo, paNfuretto) .... ),","'English' 'pamphlet'","Y' for X' ((asu, tenk~) .... ),","'tomorrow' 'weather' Within this pattern, X' is the target word corresponding to X, and a corresponding English word is written below each Japanese word. For example, \"hoteru'\" means 'hotel', and \"jasho \" means 'address'.","This transfer knowledge expression indicates that the Japanese pattern \"X no Y\" corresponds to many possible English expressions. (hoteru, jasho) are sample bindings for \"X no Y\", where X = hoteru, and Y = jasho.","TDMT makes the most of an example-based framework, which produces an output sentence by mimicking the closest translation example to an input sentence. The semantic distance from the input is calculated for all examples. Then the example closest to the input is chosen, and the target expression of that example is extracted.","Suppose that the input is \"nihoNgo no paNfuretto\", where nihoNgo means 'Japanese', and the input is closest to (eigo, paNfuretto); \"the pamphlet written in Japanese\" can be gained by choosing Y' written in X' as the best target expression.","Furthermore, ambiguity in the combination of patterns, which have not been constrained by the linguistic levels, is also dissolved incrementally by using the total sum of the semantic distances of patterns contained (Furuse, 1996).","The distance between an input and a translation example is measured based on the semantic distance between the words contained, and the semantic distance between words is calculated in terms of a thesaurus hierarchy. (Sumita, 1991) provides further details of the semantic distance caluculation."]},{"title":"2 Exploitation of a Simultaneous Interpreter's Empirical Knowledge","paragraphs":["In practical simultaneous interpretation, human translators generally use strong sentence planning such as transformation between the active and the passive voice, transformation from a lengthy interrogative sentence to a tag question, and topicalization transformation. Moreover, the input is produced and modified in a step-by-step manner, so that it can be temporarily incomplete - although as a whole sentence it may become sufficient. Thus, the consistency of translations has to be adjusted appropriately when a contradiction occurs between a previously uttered part of the translation and the part currently being translated.","As a consequence of under specification, simultaneous interpretation is essentially based on 857 working with empirical knowledge - e.g. simultaneous interpreters' translation examples.","In this section, we first describe the kinds of examples that are required to achieve simultaneous interpretation using some sample sentences."]},{"title":"2.1 Empirical Knowledge • Transformation to a tag question","paragraphs":["Let us consider the following Japanese utterance: (El) Nani-mo moNdai-wa ari-maseN -<pause>-","de-sh~-ka.

Thus, although a translation of the whole sentence of (El) is \"Is everything all right', in some cases, \"Everything is all right' could be uttered after the pause in the incremental framework. In this case, the meaning of the previously uttered part is no longer consistent with the current translation.

In addition, an expression \"X wa gozai-masu\" in (E2) has possible translations as \"'we have X'\" or \"X' is available\". Thus, although the whole translation should ideally read as \"We have twin rooms, but none are available today\", \"A twin room is available\" might be selected as a part of the translation in some cases. Although one solution could be to restate previously uttered phrases such I In this paper, sample Japanese is Romanized in italic based on the Hepburn system with the corresponding English words following in parentheses. as: \"no, sorry, we do have twin rooms, but none ..... \", such restatements should not be used frequently.

In addition, trans(S%) returns word sequence indicating translation of S%., trans(STi, E) also returns word sequence indicating the translation of S% using example E, and i indicates the current processing part.

Hence, as the above algorithm shows, exploitation of SI-examples can be combined smoothly with the conventional example-based framework.","Let us explain the algorithm in terms of sentence (E3) as an example. First, assuming that trans(STl) = \"Sono-resutoraN-wa &puN-shite I-masu\" (the-restaurant open), the most similar example of ST~ is normally: [TE4] (X as only as Y) ---) (Y' nomi X' I-masu) Thus, trans(ST2, TE4) can be \"yoru nomi &puNshite l-masu'\" (evening only open) and as the phrase \"yoru nomi ...\" is, in this case, not contextually continuous, and the next example should be extracted from the similar example list {SE}. Then, the example is [TE3], since trans(ST2, TE3) -- \"&ouN-shite l-masu, ga, yoru nomi-desu\", in terms of the contextual order of the words, this translation can be continuous.

We prepared 774 and 689 examples for the expressions respectively, and conducted the experiment in increments of 100 examples (Furuse, 1994a). The examples were extracted by random sampling.
