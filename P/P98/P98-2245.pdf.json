We used WordNet as a mediator between a conventional dictionary and a thesaurus. Prelimi-nary results support our hypothesised structural relationship, which enables the integration, of the resources. These results also suggest that we can combine the resources to achieve an overall balanced degree of sense discrimination. 1 Introduction It is generally accepted that applications such as word sense disambiguation (WSD), machine translation (MT) and information retrieval (IR), require a wide range of resources to supply the necessary lexical semantic information. For instance, Calzolari (1988) proposed a lexical database in Italian which has the features of both a dictionary and a thesaurus; and Klavans and Tzoukermann (1995) tried to build a fuller bilingual lexicon by enhancing machine-readable dictionaries with large corpora.","Among the attempts to enrich lexical information, many have been directed to the analysis of dictionary definitions and the transformation of the implicit information to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993). Nonetheless, dictionaries are also infamous of their non-standardised sense granularity, and the taxonomies obtained from definitions are inevitably ad hoc. It would therefore be a good idea if we can unify our lexical semantic knowledge by some existing, and widely exploited, classifications such as the system in Roget's Thesaurus (Roget, 1852), which has remained intact for years and has been used in WSD (Yarowsky, 1992).","While the objective is to integrate different lexical resources, the problem is: how do we reconcile the rich but variable information in dictionary 1487 senses with the cruder but more stable taxonomies like those in thesauri?","This work is intended to fill this gap. We use WordNet as a mediator in the process. In the following, we will outline an algorithm to map word senses in a dictionary to semantic classes in some established classification scheme. 2 Inter-relatedness of the Resources The three lexical resources used in this work are the 1987 revision of Roget's Thesaurus (ROGET) (Kirkpatrick, 1987), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and WordNet 1.5 (WN) (Miller et al., 1993). Figure 1 shows how word senses are organised in them. As we have mentioned, instead of directly mapping an LDOCE definition to a ROGET class, we bridge the gap with WN, as indicated by the arrows in the figure. Such a route is made feasible by linking the structures in common among the resources.","Words are organised in alphabetical order in LDOCE, as in other conventional dictionaries. The senses are listed after each entry, in the form of text definitions. WN groups words into sets of synonyms (\"synsets\"), with an optional textual gloss. These synsets form the nodes of a taxonomic hierarchy. In ROGET, each semantic class comes with a number, under which words are first assorted by part of speech and then grouped into paragraphs according to the conveyed idea.","Let us refer to Figure 1 and start from word x2 in WN synset X. Since words expressing every aspect of an idea are grouped together in ROGET, we can therefore expect to find not only words in synset X, but also those in the coordinate WN synsets (i.e. M and P, with words ml, m2, pl, P2, etc.) and the superordinate WN synsets (i.e. C and A, with words cl, c2, etc.) in the same ROGET paragraph. In other words, the thesaurus class to which x2 belongs should include roughly X U M U P U C U A. Meanwhile, the LDOCE definition corresponding to the sense of synset X (denoted by D~) is expected to be similar to the textual gloss of synset X (denoted by"]},{"title":"GI(X)).","paragraphs":["In addition, given that it is not unusual for A 120.

Our algorithm offers a systematic way of linking existing resources by defining a mapping chain from LDOCE to ROGET through WN. It is based on shallow process-ing within the resources themselves, exploiting their inter-relatedness, and does not rely on extensive statistical data. It therefore has an advantage of being immune to any change of sense discrimination with time, since it only depends on the organisation but not the individual entries of the resources.

We are also aware that definitions can take other forms which may involve part-of relations, membership, and so on, though we did not deal with them in this study. 4","Testing and Results The algorithm was tested on 12 nouns, listed in Table 1 with the number of senses in the various lexical resources.","The various types of possible mapping errors are summarised in Table 2."]},{"title":"Incorrectly Mapped","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Unmapped-a","paragraphs":["are both \"misses\", whereas"]},{"title":"Forced Er- ror","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Unmapped-b","paragraphs":["are both \"false alarms\".

Looking at the unsuccessful cases, we see that there are relatively more \"false alarms\" than \"misses\", showing that errors mostly arise from the inadequacy of individual resources because there are no targets rather than from partial failures of the process. Moreover, the number of \"misses\" can possibly be reduced if more definition patterns are considered.","Clearly the successful mappings are influenced by the fineness of the sense discrimination in the resources. How finely they are distinguished can be inferred from the similarity score matrices. Reading the matrices row-wise shows how vaguely a certain sense is defined, whereas reading them column-wise reveals how polysemous a word is.","While the links resulting from the algorithm can be right or wrong, there were some senses of the test words which appeared in one resource but had no counterpart in the others, i.e. they were not at-tached to any links. Thus 18.9% of the LDOCE senses, 11.1% of the WN synsets and 58.1% of the ROGET classes were among these unattached senses. Though this implies the insufficiency of using only one single resource in any application, it also suggests there is additional information we can use to overcome the inadequacy of individual resources. For example, we may take the senses from one resource and complement them with the unattached senses from the other two, thus resulting in a more complete but not redundant sense discrimination. 6","Future Work This study can be extended in at least two paths. One is to focus on the generality of the algorithm by testing it on a bigger variety of words, and the other on its practical value by applying the resultant lexical information in some real applications and check-ing the effect of using multiple resources. It is also desirable to explore definition parsing to see if mapping results will be improved.","References","R. Amsler. 1981. A taxonomy for English nouns and verbs.
