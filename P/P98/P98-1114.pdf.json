In this paper, we report the results of our Kana-to-Kanji conversion experiments which embody the homophone processing based on large scale collocation data. It is shown that approximately 135,000 collocations yield 9.1% raise of the conversion accuracy compared with the prototype system which has no collocation data."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Word processors or computers used in Japan ordinarily employ Japanese input method through key-board stroke combined ~ with Kana (phonetic) to Kanji (ideographic, Chinese) character conversion technology. The Kana-to-Kanji conversion is per-formed by the morphological analysis on the input Kana siring with no space between words. Word- or phrase-segmentation is carried out by the analysis to identify the substring of the input which has to be converted from Kana to Kanji. Kana-Kanji mixed string, which is the ordinary form of Japanese written text, is obtained as the final result. The major issue of this technology lies in raising the accuracy of the segmentation and the homophone processing to select the correct Kanji among many homophonic candidates. The conventional methodology for processing"]},{"title":"ho- mophones","paragraphs":["have used the function that gives the priority to the word which was used lastly or to the high frequency word. In fact, however, this method sometimes tends to cause inadequate conversion due to the lack of consideration of the semantic consistency of the word concurrence. While it is difficult to employ the syntactic or semantic processing in earnest for the word processor from the cost vs. performance viewpoints, for example, the following trials to improve the conversion accuracy have been reported: Employing the case-frame to check the semantic consistency of combination of words [Oshima, Y. et al., 1986]. Employing the neural net-work to describe the consistency of the concurrence of words [Kobayashi, T. et al.,1992], Making a concurrence dictionary for the specific topic or field, and giving the priority to the word which is in the dictionary when the topic is identified [Yamamoto, K. et al., 1992]. In any of these studies, however, many problems are left unsolved in realizing its practical system. Besides these semantic or quasi-semantic gadgets, we think it much more practical and effective to use surface level resources, namely, to use extensively the collocation. But how many collocations contribute to the accuracy of Kana-to-Kanji conversion is not known yet. In this paper, we present some results of our experiments of Kana-to-Kanji conversion, focusing on the usage of large scale collocation data. In chapter 2, descriptions of the collocations used in our system and their classification are given. In chapter 3, the technological framework of our Kana-to-Kanji conversion systems is outlined. In chapter 4, the method and the results of the experiments are given along with some discussions. In chapter 5, coneluding remarks are given."]},{"title":"2. Collocation Data","paragraphs":["Unlike the recent works on the automatic extraction of collocations from corpus [Church, K. W, et al, 1990, Ikehara, S. et al, 1996, etc.], our data have been collected manually through the intensive investigation of various texts, spending years on it. This is because no stochastic framework assures the 694 accuracy of the extraction, namely the necessity and sufficiency of the data set. The collocations which are used in our Kana-to-Kanji conversion system consist of two kinds: (1) idiomatic expressions, whose meanings seem to be difficult to compose from the typical meaning of the individual component words [Shudo, K. et al., 1988]. (2) stereotypical expressions in which the concurrence of component words is seen in the texts with high frequency. The collocations are also classified into two classes by a grammatical criterion: one is a class of functional collocations, which work as functional words such as particles (postpositionals) or auxiliary verbs, the other is a class of conceptual collocations which work as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. The latter is further classified into two kinds: uninterruptible collocations, whose concurrence relationship of words are so strong that they can be dealt with as single words, and interruptible collocations, which are occasionally used separately.

More refmed rules are used in the actual segmentation process. The interruptible conceptual collocation is not treated as a single unit but as a string ofbunsetsus in the segmentation process. Each collocation in the dictionary which is composed of multiple number of bunsetsus is marked with the boundary between bunsetsus. The system first tries to segment the input Kana string into e-bunsetsus. Every possible segmentation is evaluated by its cost. A segmentation which is assigned the least cost is chosen as the solution. The boundary between e-bunsetsus in examples in this paper is denoted by \"/\". ex. two results of e-bunsetsu-segmentation: , hitoh.a/kigqkikunikositagotol, taarimasen (there is nothing like being watchful) hitohdv'Mga/Idkimi/ko3itcv;kotoha/arimasen In the above examples, JKT~/~I] < kiga/kiku: is uninterruptible conceptual collocation and IS-/il~ I., Lx/II~|~/~ ~) ~'t~ A~ ni/kosita/kotoha/arimasen: is a functional collocation.
