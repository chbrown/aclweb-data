Although there was a lot of work on DR acquisition, such as Byrd & al (1987), Neff & Boguraev (1989), Bl~isi & Koch (1992), etc, it is still desirable to develop general, powerful, and easy-to-use methods and tools for this. Production of new dictionaries, even only crude drafts, from available ones, has been much less treated, and it seems that no general computational framework has been proposed (see eg, Byrd & al (1987), Tanaka & Umemura (1994), Don\" & al (1995)).","This paper deals with two problems: acquiring textual DRs by converting them into structured forms, and producing new lexical sets from those acquired. These two can be considered as two main activities of a more general notion: the accumulation of lexical sets. The term \"lexical set\" (LS) is used here to be a generic term for more specific ones such as \"lexicon\", \"dictionary\", and \"lexical database\".","Lexical data accumulated will be represented as objects of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) (Steel 1990). This object-oriented highlevel programming environment facilitates any further manipulations on them, such as presentation (eg in formatted text), exchange (eg in SGML), database access, and production of new lexical structures, etc; the CLOS object form is thus a convenient pivot form for storing lexical units. This environment also helps us develop our methods and tools easily and efficiently.","In this paper, we will also discuss some other relevant issues: complexity measures for dictionaries, heuristic decisions in acquisition, the idea of virtual accumulation, abstraction levels on LSs, and a design for organization and exploitation of large lexical systems based on the notions of accumulation."]},{"title":"1 Acquisition","paragraphs":["Our method combines the use of a context-free syntax-directed translator and text modification techniques."]},{"title":"1.1 A syntax-directed translator for acquisition","paragraphs":["Transforming a DR into a structured form comprises parsing the source text and building the output structures. Our approach is different from those of other tools specialized for DR acquisition, eg Neff & Boguraev (1989) and Bl~.si & Koch (1992), in that it does not impose beforehand a default output construction mechanism, but rather lets the user build the output as he wants. This means the output structures are not to be bound tightly to the parsing grammar. Particularly, they can be different from the logic structure of the source, as it is sometimes needed in acquisition. The user can also keep any presentation information (eg typographic codes) as needed; our approach is thus between the two extremes in acquisition approaches: one is keeping all presentation information, and one is transferring it all into structural representation.","Our tool consists of a syntax-directed translation (SDT) formalism called h-grammar, and its running engine. For a given dictionary, one writes an h-grammar describing the text of"]},{"title":"330","paragraphs":["its entry and the construction of the output. An h-grammar is a context-free grammar augmented with variables and actions. Its rules are of the form:","A(ail ai2 ...; aol ao2 ...)->","B(bil bi2 ...; bol bo2 ...)","C(cil ci2 ...; col co2 ...) .... A is a nonterminal; B, C .... may be a nonterminal, a terminal, the null symbol §, or an action, ail, ai2 .... are"]},{"title":"input variables,","paragraphs":["which will be initialized when the rule is called, aol, ao2 ..... bol, bo2 ..... col, co2 .... are"]},{"title":"output variables.","paragraphs":["bil, bi2 ..... cil, ci2 .... are"]},{"title":"input expressions","paragraphs":["(in LISP syntax), which may contain variables. When an item in the right-hand side of the rule is expanded, its input expressions are first computed. If the item is a nonterminal, a rule having it as the left-hand side is chosen to expand. If it is a terminal, a corresponding token is looked for in the parsed buffer and returned as the value of its (unique) output variable. If it is an action which is in fact a LISP function, the function is applied to the values of its input expressions, and the result values are assigned to its output variables (here we use the multiple-value function model of CLOS). Finally, the values of the output variables of the left-hand side nonterminal (aol, ao2 .... ) are collected and returned as the result of its expanding.","With some predefined action functions, output structures can be constructed freely, easily, and flexibly. We usually choose to make them CLOS objects and store them in"]},{"title":"LISPO","paragraphs":["form. This is our text representation for CLOS objects, which helps to read, verify, correct, store and transfer the result easily. Finally, the running engine has several operational modes, which facilitate debugging the h-grammars and treating errors met in parsing. 1.2 Text modification in acquisition In general, an analyzer, such as the h-grammar tool above, is sufficient for acquisition. However, in practice, some precedent modification on the source text may often simplify much the analyzing phase. In contrast with many other approaches, we recognize the usefulness of text modification, and apply it systematically in our work. Its use can be listed as follows:","(1)"]},{"title":"Facilitating parsing.","paragraphs":["By inserting some specific marks before and/or after some elements of the source, human work in grammar writing and machine work in parsing can be reduced significantly.","(2)"]},{"title":"Obtaining the result immediately without parsing.","paragraphs":["In some simple cases, using several replacement operations in a text editor, we could obtain easily the LISPO form of a DR.

The main type of modification needed is replacement using a strong string pattern-matching (or precisely, regular expression) mechanism.

An advanced word processor such as Microsoft Word"]},{"title":"TM,","paragraphs":["version 6, seems capable of satisfying those demands.","For sources produced with formatting from a specific editing environment (eg Microsoft Word, HTML editors), making modification in the same or an equivalent environment may be very profitable, because we can exploit format-based operations (eg search/replace based on format) provided by the environment. 1.3 Some related issues"]},{"title":"1.3.1 Complexity measures for dictionaries","paragraphs":["Intuitively, the more information types a dictionary has, the more complex it is, and the harder to acquire it becomes.

For large texts which often contain many errors and ambiguities like DRs, precise analysis design may become too complicated, even impossible. 331 Imagine, eg, some pure text dictionary where the sense numbers of the entries are made from a number and a point, eg '1.', '2.'; and, moreover, such forms are believed not to occur in content strings without verification (eg, because"]},{"title":"the","paragraphs":["dictionary is so large).

The produced LSs surely need more correction but they can serve at least as somewhat prepared materials, eg, dictionary drafts.

As an example, an English-French-UNL 2 (EFU) dictionary draft was produced from an English-UNL (EU) dictionary, a French-English-Malay (FEM), and a French-English (FE). The FEM is extracted and inverted to give an English-French dictionary (EF-1), the FIE is inverted to give another (EF-2). The EFU is produced then by paralleling the EU, EF-1, and EF-2. This draft was used as the base for compiling a French-UNL dictionary at GETA (Boitet & al 1998).

Virtual production may not be suitable, however, for some production categories such as inversion. 3.2 Abstraction of LSs The framework of accumulation, real and virtual, presented so far allows us to design a very general and dynamic model for lexical systems. The model is based on some abstraction levels of LSs as follows.","(1) A"]},{"title":"physical support","paragraphs":["is a disk file, database, Web page, etc. This is the most elementary level. 2 UNL: Universal Networking Language (UNL 1996). 333","(2) A LS support makes up the contents of a LS. It comprises a set of physical supports (as a long dictionary may be divided into several files), and a number of access ways which determine how to access the data in the physical supports (as a database may have several index). The data in its physical supports may not be in the standard form; in this case it will be equipped with a standardizing function on accessed data.","(3) A lexical set (LS) comprises a set of LS supports. Although having the same contents, they may be different in physical form and data format; hence this opens the possibility to query a LS from different supports.","Virtual LSs are \"sets\" that do not have \"real\" supports, their entries are produced from some available sets when required, and there are no insert, delete activities for them.","(4) A lexical group comprises a number of LSs (real or virtual) that a user uses in a work, and a set of operations which he may need to do on them. A lexical group is thus a workstation in a lexical system, and this notion helps to view and develop the system modularly, combinatorially, and dynamically.","Based on these abstractions, a design on the organization for lexical systems can be proposed. Fundamentally, a lexical system has real LSs as basic elements. Its performance is augmented with the use of virtual LSs and lexical groups. A catalogue is used to register and manage the LSs and groups.
