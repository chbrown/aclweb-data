They occur in languages such as German and Dutch and constitute a problem for NLP because they are lexemes whose forms cannot always be recognized by dictionary lookup on the basis of a text word. Conventional solutions take a mixed lexical and syntactic approach. In this paper, we propose the solution offered by Word Manager, consisting of string-based recognition by means of rules of types also required for periphrastic inflection and clitics. In this way, separable verbs are dealt with as part of the domain of reusable lexical resources. We show how this solution compares favourably with conventional approaches. 1.

Anna glaubt, dass Bernard aufh6rt.","('Anna believes that Bernard stops')","b. Claudia h6rt jetzt auf.","('Claudia stops now PRT')","c. Daniel versucht aufzuh6ren.","('Daniel tries to_stop') In subordinate clauses as in (1 a), the particle auf and the inflected part of the verb h6rt are written together. In main clauses such as (lb), the inflected form h6rt is moved by verb-second, leaving the particle stranded. In infinitive clauses with the particle zu ('to'), zu separates the two components of the verb and all three elements are written together. In analysis, the problem of separable verbs is to combine the two parts of the verb in contexts such as (lb) and (lc). Such a combination is necessary because syntactic and semantic properties of aufh6ren are the same, irrespective of whether the two parts are written together or not, but they cannot be deduced from the syntactic and semantic properties of the parts. Therefore, a solution to the problem of separable verbs will treat (lb) as if it read (2a) and (lc) as (2b):","(2) a. Claudia aufh6rt jetzt. b. Daniel versucht zu aufh6ren. The problem arises in a very similar fashion in Dutch, as the Dutch translations (3) of the sentences in (1) show. The only difference is that the infinitive in (3c) is not written together.","(3) a. Anna gelooft dat Bernard ophoudt. b. Claudia houdt nu op. c. Daniel probeert op te houden. On the other hand, the problem of separable verbs in German and Dutch differs from the corresponding one in English, because English verbs such as look up are multi-word units in all contexts. A treatment of these cases which is in line with the solution proposed here is described by Tschichold (forthcoming). As suggested by the English translation, separable verbs in German and Dutch are lexemes. Therefore, an important issue in evaluating a mechanism for dealing with them is how it fits in with the reusability of lexical resources. Given the importance of the orthographic component in the problem, it ~s not surprising that it is hardly if ever treated in the linguistic literature. 471"]},{"title":"2. Previous Approaches","paragraphs":["In existing systems or resources for NLP, separable verbs are usually treated as a lexicographic and syntactic problem. Two typical approaches can be illustrated on the basis of Celex and Rosetta. Celex (http://www.kun.nl/celex) is a lexical database project offering a German dictionary with 50'000 entries and a Dutch dictionary with 120'000 entries. In these dictionaries separable verbs are listed with a feature conveying the information that they belong to the class of separable verbs and a bracketing structure showing the decomposition into a prefix and a base, e.g. (auf)(h6ren). Celex dictionaries are reusable, but the rule component for the interpretation of the information on separable verbs, i.e. the mechanism for going from (lb-c) to (2), remains to be developed by each NLP-system using the dictionaries. Rosetta is a machine translation system which includes Dutch as one of the source and target languages. Rosetta (1994:78-79) describes how separable verbs are treated. For the verb ophouden illustrated in (3), there are three lexical entries, ophouden for the continuous forms as in (3a), and houden and op for the discontinuous forms as in (3b-c). When a form of houden is found in a text, it is multiply ambiguous, because it can be a form of the simple verb houden ('hold') or of one of the separable verbs ophouden ('stop'), aanhouden ('arrest'), afhouden ('withhold'), etc. The entry for houden as part of ophouden contains the information that it must be combined with a particle op. At the same time, op is ambiguous between a reading as preposition or particle. In syntax, there is a rule combining the two elements in a sentence such as (3b). It is clear that, while this approach may work, it is far from elegant. It creates ambiguity and redundancies, because ophouden written together is treated in a different entry from op + houden as a discontinuous unit. These properties make the resulting dictionaries less transparent and do not favour reusability. It should be pointed out that Celex and Rosetta were not chosen because their solution to the problem of separable verbs is worse than others. They are representative examples of currently used strategies, chosen mainly because they are relatively well-documented."]},{"title":"3. The Word Manager Approach","paragraphs":["Word Manager TM (WM) is a system for morphological dictionaries. It includes rules for inflection and derivation (WM proper) and for clitics and multi-word units (Phrase Manager, PM). We will use WM here as a name for the combination of the two components. A general description of the design of WM, with references to various publications where the formalism is discussed in more detail, can be found in ten Hacken & Domenig (1996). The German WM dictionary consists of a comprehensive set of inflectional and word formation rules describing the full range of morphological processes in German. In the last two years we have specified more than 100'000 database entries by classification of lexemes in terms of inflection rules (for morphologically simple entries) and by the application of word formation rules (for morphologically complex entries). In addition, the PM module contains a set of rules for clitics and multi-word units which covers German periphrastic inflection patterns and separable verbs. The rule types invoked in the treatment of separable verbs in WM include Inflection Rules (IRules), Word Formation Rules (WFRules), Periphrastic Inflection (PIRules), and Clitic Rules (CRules). We will describe each of them in turn."]},{"title":"3.1.

Word Formation","paragraphs":["Word Formation Rules consist of a source definition and a target definition. The source definition determines what (kind of) formatives are taken to form a new word. The target definition specifies how the source formatives are combined, and which inflection rule the new word is assigned to. Separable verbs are the result of WFRules which are remarkable because of their target. The target specification is as in Fig. 2. This specification departs from the usual specification of a target in a WFRule in two respects.

Periphrastic Inflection","paragraphs":["The mechanism for periphrastic inflection in WM consists of two parts. PIClasses are used to identify the components and PIRules to turn them into a single word form. The PIRule for separable verbs in German is given in Fig. 3. The rule in Fig, 3 consists of a name and a body, which in turn consists of input and output specifications separated by \"=\". The input specifies a finite verb form (infinitive and participles are excluded by \"\"̂) and a detachable prefix. The output combines them in the position of the verb, with the form prefix + verb, and with the features percolated from the verb (person, 473 Separable (Cat V)(̂Mod Inf)(̂Mod Part) + %separable = ...","...

(CElement zu), %separable + (Cat V) (Mod Inf) (Temp Pres) Fig. 4: CRule for the infinitive of separable verbs in number, etc.). This yields (2a) as a step in the analysis of (lb). The possibilities for specifying the relative position of the two elements to be combined are the same as the possibilities for multi-word units in general. In the PIClass for German it is specified that the finite verb always precedes the particle when the two are separated. In Dutch this is not the case, as illustrated by (3c), so that a different specification is required."]},{"title":"3.4. Clitic Rules","paragraphs":["The clitic rule mechanism is used to analyse aufzuh6ren in (lc) and produce zu aufh6ren as in (2b). The CRule used is given in Fig. 4. Again input and output are separated by \"=\". The input consists of the concatenation of three elements: a detachable prefix, infinitival zu, and an infinitive. Graphic concatenation is indicated by \"+\". The CElement zu is defined elsewhere as a form of the infinitival z u, rather than the homonymous preposition, in order not to lose information. The output consists of two words, as indicated by the comma, the second of which concatenates the prefix and the verb."]},{"title":"3.5. Recognition and Generation","paragraphs":["In recognition, the input is the largest domain over which components of multi-word units (MWUs) can be spread. In practice, this coincides with the sentence. Since WM does not contain a parser, larger chunks of input will result in spurious recognition of potential MWUs. Let us assume as an example that the sentences in (1) are given as input. WM. The first component to act is the clitics component. It leaves everything unchanged except (lc), which is replaced by (2b): aufzuh6ren => zu at!f176ren. Then the rules of WM proper are activated. They replace each word form by a set of analyses in terms of a string and feature set. In (1 a), att.flliJrt is analysed as third person singular or second person plural of the present tense of aufhOren, in (lb) hOrt and attfare analysed separately, and in (Ic) aufiti~ren, which was given the feature infinitive by the CRule in Fig. 4, only as infinitive, not as any of the homonymous forms in the paradigm. The next step is periphrastic inflection. It applies to (la) and (lc) vacuously, but combines hOrt and auf in (lb), producing the feature description corresponding to (2b): hOrt auf => aufhOrt. Finally, the idiom recognition component (not treated here) applies vacuously. A general remark on recognition is in order here. The rule components of PM, i.e. clitics, periphrastic inflection and idiom recognition add their results to the set of intermediate representations available at the relevant point. Thus, after the clitic component, attfz.uhiSren continues to exist alongside zu auJh6ren in the analysis of (lc). Since the former cannot be analysed by WM proper, it is discarded. Likewise, hgrt will survive in (lb) after periphrastic inflection and indeed as part of the final result. This is necessary in examples such as (4):","(4) Der Hund h6rt auf den Namen Wurzel. ('The dog answers to the name [of] Wurzel') Since rules in WM are not inherently directional, it is also possible to generate all forms of a lexeme such as aufhOren in the way they may occur in a text. The client 474 application required for this task can also include codes indicating places in the string where other material may intervene, because this information is available in the relevant PIClass of the database."]},{"title":"4.
