This paper presents a trainable approach to making these attachments through transformation sequences and error-driven learning. Our approach is broad coverage, and accounts for roughly three times the attachment cases that have previously been handled by corpus-based techniques. In addition, our approach is based on a simplified model of syntax that is more consistent with the practice in current state-of-the-art language processing systems. This paper sketches syntactic and algorithmic details, and presents experimental results on data sets derived from the Penn Treebank. We obtain an attachment accuracy of 75.4% for the general case, the first such corpus-based result to be reported. For the restricted cases previously studied with corpus-based methods, our approach yields an accuracy comparable to current work (83.1%). 1 Introduction Determining the attachments of prepositions and subordinate conjunctions is an important problem in parsing natural language. It is also an old problem that continues to elude a complete solution. A classic example of the problem is the sentence \"I saw a man with a telescope\" , where who had the telescope is ambiguous.","Recently, the preposition attachment problem has been addressed using corpus-based methods (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi * This paper reports on work performed at the MITRE Corporation under the support of the MITRE Sponsored Research Program. Useful advice was provided by Lynette Hirschman and David Palmer. The experiments made use of Morgan Pecelli's noun/verb group annotations and some of David Day's programs. et al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Merlo et al., 1997). The present paper follows in the path set by these authors, but extends their work in significant ways. We made these extensions to solve this problem in a way that can be directly applied in running systems in such application areas as information extraction or conversational interfaces.","In particular, we have sought to produce an attachment decision procedure with far broader coverage than in earlier approaches. Most research to date has focussed on a subset of the attachment problem that only covers 25% of the problem instances in our training data, the so-called binary VNP subset. Even the broader V[NP]* subset addressed by (Merlo et al., 1997) only accounts for 33% of the problem instances. In contrast, our approach attempts to form attachments for as much as 89% of the problem instances (modulo some cases that are either pathological or accounted for by other means).","Work to date has also been concerned primarily with reproducing the structure of Treebank annotations. In other words, the underlying syntactic paradigm has been the traditional notion of full sentential parsing. This approach differs from the parsing models currently being explored by both theorists and practitioners, which include semi-parsing strategies and finite-state approximations to context-free grammars.","Our approach to syntax uses a cascade of rule sequence processors, each of which can be thought of as approximating some aspect of the underlying grammar by finite-state transduc-tion. We have thus had to extend previous work at the conceptual level as well, by recasting the preposition attachment problem in terms of the vocabulary of finite-state approximations (noun groups, etc.), rather than the traditional syntactic categories (noun phrases, etc.). 1436","Much of the present paper is thus concerned with describing our extensions to the preposition attachment problem. We present the problem scope of interest to us, as well as the data annotations required to support our in-vestigation. We also present a decision procedure for attaching prepositions and subordinate conjunctions. The procedure is trained through error-driven transformation learning (Brill, 1993), and we present a number of training experiments and report on the performance of the trained procedure. In brief, on the restricted VNP problem, our procedure achieves nearly the same level of test-set performance (83.1%) as current state-of-the-art systems (84.5% (Collins and Brooks, 1995)). On the unrestricted data set, our procedure achieves an attachment accuracy of 75.4%."]},{"title":"2 Syntactic Considerations","paragraphs":["Our outlook on the attachment problem is in-fluenced by our approach to syntax, which simplifies the traditional parsing problem in several way s . As with many approaches to processing unrestricted text, we do not attempt as a primary goal to derive spanning sentential parses. Instead, we approximate spanning parses through successive stages of partial parsing. For the purpose of the present paper, we need to mostly be concerned with the level of analysis of core noun phrases and verb phrases. By core phrases, we mean the kind of non-recursive simplifications of the NP and VP that in the literature go by names such as noun/verb groups (Appelt et al., 1993) or chunks, and base NPs (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).","The common thread between these approaches and ours is to approximate full noun phrases or verb phrases by only parsing their non-recursive core, and thus not attaching modifiers or arguments. For English noun phrases, this amounts to roughly the span between the determiner and the head noun; for English verb phrases, the span runs roughly from the auxiliary to the head verb. We call such simplified syntactic categories groups, and consider in particular noun, verb, adverb and adjective groups.","For noun groups in particular, the definition we have adopted also includes a limited number of constructs that encompass some depthbounded recursion. For example, we also include in the scope of the noun group such complex determiners as partitives (\"five of the suspects\") and possessives (\"John's book\"). These constructs fall under the scope of our noun group model because they are easy to parse with simple finite-state cascades, and because they more intuitively match the notion of a core phrase than do their individual components. Our model of noun groups also includes an extension of the so-called named entities familiar to the information extraction community (Def, 1995). These consist of names of persons and or-ganizations, location names, titles, dates, times, and various numeric expressions (such as money terms). Note in particular that titles and organization names often include embedded prepositional phrases (e.g., \"Chief of Staff\"). For such cases, as well as for partitives, we consider these embedded prepositional phrases to be within the noun group's scope, and as such are excluded from consideration as attachment problems. Also excluded are the auxiliary to's in verb groups for infinitives.","Once again, distinguishing syntax groups from traditional syntactic phrases (such as NPs) is of interest because it singles out what is usually thought of as easy to parse, and allows that piece of the parsing problem to be addressed by such comparatively simple means as finite-state machines or transformation sequences. What is then left of the parsing problem is the difficult stuff: namely the attachment of prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and other constructs that serve in modificational, adjunctive, or argument-passing roles. This part of the problem is harder both because of the ambiguous attachment location, and because the right combination of knowledge required to reduce this ambiguity is elusive. 3 The Attachment Problem Given these syntactic preliminaries, we can now define attachment problems in terms of syntax groups. In addition to noun, verb, adjective and adverb groups, we also have I-groups. An I-group is a preposition (including multiple word prepositions) or subordinate conjunction (including wh-words and \"that\"). Once again prepositions that are embedded in such constructs as titles and names are not considered I-groups for our purposes. Each I-group in a sen-1437 tence is viewed as attaching to one other group within that sentence. 1 For example, the sentence \"I had sent a cup to her.\" is viewed as [I]ng [had sent]vg,~ [a cup]ng [tO]lg,~, [her]ng. where ~ indicates the attaching I-group and ,~ indicates the group attached to.","Generally, coordinations of groups (e.g., dogs and cats) are left as separate groups. However, prenominal coordination (e.g. dog and cat food) is deemed as one large noun group.","Attachments not to try: Our system is designed to attach each I-group in a sentence to one other group in the sentence on that I-group's left. In our sample data, about 11% of the I-groups have no left ambiguity (either no group on the left to attach to or only 1 group). A few (less than 0.5%) of the I-groups have no group to its right. All of these I-groups count as attachments not handled by our system and our system does not attempt to resolve them.","Attachments to try: The rest of the I-groups each have at least 2 groups on their left and 1 group on their right from the I-group's sentence, and these are the I-groups that our system tries to handle (89% of all the problems in the data). 4 Properties of Attachments to Try In order to understand how our technique handles the attachments that follow this pattern, it is helpful to consider the properties of this class of attachments. What we detail here is a specific analysis of our test data (called 7x9x). Our training sample is similar.","In 7x9x, 2.4% of the attachments turn out to be of a form that guarantees our system will fail to resolve them. 83% of these unresolvable \"attachments\" are about evenly divided between right attachments and left attachments to a coordination of groups (which in our framework is split into 2 or more groups). A right attachment example is that \"at\" attaches to \"lost\" in \"that at home, they lost a key.\" A coordination attachment example is \"with\" attaching to the coordination \"cats and dogs\" in \"cats and dogs with tags\". The other 17% were either lexemes erroneously tagged as prepositions/subordinate conjunctions or past participles, or were wh-words that are actually part","1Sentential level attachments are deemed to be to the main verb in the sentence attached to. of a question (and not acting as a subordinate conjunction).","In 7x9x, 67.7% of attachments are to the adjacent group on the I-group's immediate left. Our system uses as a starting point the guess that all attachments are to the adjacent group.","The second most likely attachment point is the nearest verb group to the I-group's left. A surprising 90.3% of the attachments are to either this verb group or to the adjacent group. 2 In our experiments, limiting the choice of possible attachment points to these two tended to improve the results and also increased the training speed, the latter often by a factor of 3 to 4.","Neither of these percentages include attachments to coordinations of groups on the left, which are unhandleable. Including these attachments would add ,,~1% to each figure.","The attachments can be divided into six categories, based on the contents of the I-group being attached and the types of groups surround-ing that I-group. The categories are:","vnpn The I-group contains a preposition. Next to the preposition on both the left and the right are noun groups. Next to the left noun group is a verb group. A member of this category is the [to]~g in the sentence \"[I],~g [had sent]~g [a cup]ng [tO]/g [her]ng.\"","vnpfi Like vnpn, but next to the preposition on the right is not a noun group.","~npn Like vnpn, but the left neighbor of the left noun group is not a verb group. ~¢npfi Another variation on vnpn.","xfipx The I-group contains a preposition. But its left neighbor is not a noun group. The x's stand for groups that need to exist, but can be of any type.","xxsx The I-group has a subordinate conjunction (e.g. which) instead of a preposition. 3","Table 1 shows how likely the attachments in 7x9x that belong to each category are * to attach to the left adjacent group (A)","2This attachment preference also appears in the large data set used in (Merlo et al., 1997).","aA word is deemed a preposition if it is among the 66 prepositions listed in Section 6.2's It data set.

Some earlier work (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) also handled the subset of vnp5 category problems where the attachment is either to the nearest verb or noun group on the left.","Some later work (Merlo et al., 1997) dealt with handling from 1 to 3 prepositional phrases in a sentence. The work dealt with prepositions in \"group\" sequences of VNP, VNPNP and VNPNPNP, where the prepositions attach to one of the mentioned noun or verb groups (as opposed to an earlier group on the left).

So in Penn Treebank, they handle 1.28 times more attachments than the other work mentioned in this paper. This other work handles less than 25% of the attachments in our sample data."]},{"title":"5 Processing Model","paragraphs":["Our attachment system is an extension of the rule-based system for VNPN binary prepositional phrase attachment described in (Brill and Resnik, 1994). The system uses transformation-based error-driven learning to automatically learn rules from training examples.","One first runs the system on a training set, which starts by guessing that each I-group attaches to its left adjacent group. This training run moves in iterations, with each iteration producing the next rule that repairs the most remaining attachment errors in the training set. The training run ends when the next rule found repairs less than a threshold number of errors.","The rules are then run in the same order on the test set (which also starts at an all adjacent attachment state) to see how well they do.","The system makes its decisions based on the head (main) word of each of the groups examined. Like the original system, our system can look at the head-word itself and also all the semantic classes the head-word can belong to. The classes come from Wordnet (Miller, 1990) and consist of about 25 noun classes (e.g., person, process) and 15 verb classes (e.g., change, communication, status). As an extension, our system also looks at the word's part-of-speech, possible stem(s) and possible subcategorization/complement categories. The latter consist of over 100 categories for nouns, adjectives and verbs (mainly the latter) from Comlex (Wolff et al., 1995). Example categories include intransitive verbs and verbs that take 2 prepositional phrases as a complement (e.g.,"]},{"title":"fly","paragraphs":["in"]},{"title":"\"I fly from here to there.\").","paragraphs":["In addition, Comlex gives our system the possible prepositions (e.g."]},{"title":"from","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"to","paragraphs":["for the verb"]},{"title":"fly)","paragraphs":["and particles used in the possible subcategorizations.","The original system chose between two possible attachment points, a verb and a noun. Each rule either attempted to move left (attach to the verb) or move right (attach to the noun). Our extensions include as possible attachment points every group that precedes the attaching I-group and is in the I-group's sentence. The rules now can move the attachment either left or right from the current guess to the nearest group that matches the rule's constraints.","In addition to running the training and test with ALL possible attachment points (every 1439 preceding group) available, one can also restrict the possible attachment points to only the group Adjacent to the I-group and the nearest Verb group on the left, if any (V-A). One uses the same attachment choice (ALL versus V-A) in the training run and corresponding test run. 6","Experiments 6.1 Data preparation Our experiments were conducted with data made available through the Penn Treebank an-notation effort (Marcus et al., 1993). However, since our grammar model is based on syntax groups, not conventional categories, we needed to extend the Treebank annotations to include the constructs of interest to us.","This was accomplished in several steps. First, noun groups and verb groups were manually annotated using Treebank data that had been stripped of all phrase structure markup. 5 This syntax group markup was then reconciled with the Treebank annotations by a semi-automatic procedure. Usually, the procedure just needs to overlay the syntax group markup on top of the Treebank annotations. However, the Treebank annotations often had to be adjusted to make them consistent with the syntax groups (e.g., verbal auxiliaries need to be included in the relevant verb phrase). Some 4-5% of all Treebank sentences could not be automatically reconciled in this way, and were removed from the data sets for these experiments.","The reconciliation procedure also automatically tags the data for part-of-speech, using a high-performance tagger based on (BriU, 1993). Finally, the reconciler introduces adjective, adverb, and I-group markup. I-groups are created for all lexemes tagged with the IN, TO, WDT, WP, WP$ or WRB parts of speech, as well as multi-word prepositions such as"]},{"title":"according to.","paragraphs":["The reconciled data are then compiled into attachment problems using another semi-automatic pattern-matching procedure. 8% of the cases did not fit into the patterns and required manual intervention.","We split our data into a training set (files 2000, 2013, and 200-269) and a test set (files 270-299).

In our terms, the task is to determine the attachment of certain vnpn category I-groups.

(Collins and Brooks, 1995) also reports a result of 81.9% for a word only version of the system (Brill and Resnik, 1994) that we extend (differ-ence with our result is statistically significant at the 4% level).

The results report the number of RULES the training run produces, as well 1440 as the percent CORrect and Error Reduction in the test. One source of variation is whether ALL or the V-A Attachment Points are used. The other source is the TRaining SET used.","The set lt- is the set It (Section 6.2) with the entries from Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal files 270 to 299 (the files used to form the test set) removed. About 600 entries were removed. Several adjustments were made when using lt-: The part-of-speech treatment in Section 6.2 was used. Because It- only gives two possible attachment points (the adjacent noun and the nearest verb), only V-A attachment points were used. Finally, because It- is much slower to train on than 0x6x, training used a 3 improvement threshold. For 0x6x, a 2 improvement threshold was used.","Set It2 is the data used in (Merlo et al., 1997) and has about 26000 entries. The set It2- is the set lt2 with the entries from Penn Treebank files 270-299 removed. Again, about 600 entries were removed. Generally, It2 has no information on the word(s) to the right of the preposition being attached, so this field was ignored in both training and test. In addition, for similar reasons as given for lt-, the adjustments made when using It- were also made when using lt2-.","If one removes the lt2- results, then all the COR results are statistically significantly different from the starting 67.7% score and from each other at a 1% level or better. In addition, the lt2- and lt- results are not statistically significantly different (even at the 20% level).","lt2- has more data points and more categories of data than lt-, but the lt- run has the best overall score. Besides pure chance, two other possible reasons for this somewhat surprising result are that the It2- entries have no information on the word(s) to the right of the preposition being attached (lt- does) and both datasets contain entries not in the other dataset.","When looking at the It- run's remaining errors, 43% of the errors were in category Vnpn, 21% in vnpn, 16% in xfipx, 13% in xxsx, 4% in ~npfi and 3% in vnpfi. 6.4","Afterwards The lt- run has the best overall score. However, the It- run does not always produce the best score for each category. Below are the scores (number correct) for each run that has a best score (bold face) for some category: Category 0x6x V-A lt-- lt2-vnpn 345 vnpfi 35 ~npn 441 ~Ynpfi 32 554 xfipx XXSX 236 397 374 39 34 454 458 29 36 551 557 229 224 The location of most of the best subscores is not surprising. Of the training sets, lt- has the most vnpn entries, 6 It2- has the most ~np-type entries and 0x6x has the most xxsx entries. The best vnpfi and xfipx subscore locations are somewhat surprising. The best vnpfi subscore is statistically significantly better than the It2-vnpfi subscore at the 5% level. A possible explanation is that the vnpfi and vnpn categories are closely related. The best xfipx subscore is not statistically significantly better than the lt-xfipx subscore, even at the 25% level. Besides pure chance, a possible explanation is that the xfipx category is related to the four np-type categories (where lt2- has the most entries).","The fact that the subscores for the various categories differ according to training regimen suggests a system architecture that would exploit this. In particular, we might apply different rule sets for each attachment category, with each rule set trained in the optimal configuration for that category. We would thus expect the overall accuracy of the attachment procedure to improve overall. To estimate the magnitude of this improvement, we calculated a post-hoc composite score on our test set by combining the best subscore for each of the 6 categories. When viewed as trying to improve upon the It- subscores, the new ~npfi subscore is statistically significantly better (4% level) and the new xxsx subscore is mildly statistically significantly better (20% level). The new ~npn and xfipx subscores are not statistically significantly better, even at the 25% level. This combination yields a post-hoc improved score of 76.5%. This is of course only a post-hoc estimate, and we would need to run a new independent test to verify the actual validity of this effect. Also, this estimate is only mildly statistically significantly better (13% level) than the existing 75.4% score.","6For vnpn, the lt- score is statistically significantly better than the It2- score at the 2% level. 1441 7 Discussion This paper presents a system for attaching prepositions and subordinate conjunctions that just relies on easy-to-find constructs like noun groups to determine when it is applicable. In sample text, we find that the system is applicable for trying to attach 89% of the prepositions/subordinate conjunctions that are outside of the easy-to-find constructs and is 75.4% correct on the attachments that it tries to handle. In this sample, we also notice that these attachments very much tend to be to only one or two different spots and that the attachment problems can be divided into 6 categories. One just needs those easy-to-find constructs to determine the category of an attachment problem.","The 75.4% results may seen low compared to parsing results like the 88% precision and recall in (Collins, 1997), but those parsing results include many easier-to-parse constructs.
