Increasingly, tools are also becoming available for acquiring subcategorization information from corpora, i.e. for inferring the subcategorization frames of a given lemma (e.g. Manning 1993). None of these resources provide immediate access to corpus evidence, nor do they provide information on the relative frequency of the patterns that are listed for a given lemma. There is a need for a tool that can (1) find evidence for subcategorization patterns and (2) determine their frequencies in large corpora: 1. Statistical approaches to NLP rely on information not just on the range of combinatory possibilities of words, but also the relative frequencies of the expected patterns. 2. Dictionaries that list subcategorization frames often list expected patterns, rather than actual ones. Lexicographers and lexicologist need access to the evidence for this information. 3. Frequency information has come to be the focus of much psycholinguistic research on sentence processing (see for example MacDonald 1997). While information on word frequency is readily available (e.g. Francis and Kucera (1982)), there is as yet no easy way of obtaining information from large corpora on the relative frequency of complementation patterns. None of these points argue against the use-fulness of the available resources, but they show that there is a gap in the available information. To address this need, we have developed a tool for extracting evidence for subcategorization patterns from the 100 mio. word British National Corpus (BNC). The tool is used as pan of the lexicon-building process in the FrameNet project, an NSF-funded project aimed at creating a lexical database based on the principles of Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982). 428 1 Infrastructure 1.1 Tools We are using the 100 mio. word British National Corpus, with the following corpus query tools: • CQP (Corpus Query Processor, Christ (1994)), a general corpus query processor for complex queries with any number and combination of annotated information types, including part-of-speech tags, morphosyntactic tags, lemmas and sentence boundaries. • A macroprocessor for use with CQP that allows the user to specify which subcorpora are to be created for a given lemma. The corpus queries are written in the CQP corpus query language, which uses regular expressions over part-of-speech tags, lemmas, morphosyntactic tags, and sentence boundaries. For details, see Christ (1994a). The queries essentially simulate a chunk parser, using a regular grammar. 1.2 Coverage A list of the verb frames that are currently searchable is given in figure 1 below, along with an example of each pattern. The categories we are using are roughly based on those used in the COMLEX syntactic dictionary (Macleod et al. 1995). intransitive 'worms wiggle' np 'kiss me' np_np 'brought her flowers' np_pp 'replaced it with a new one' np_Pvping 'prevented him from leaving' np_pwh 'asked her about what it all meant' np_vpto 'advised her to go' np_vping 'kept them laughing' np_sfin 'told them (that) he was back' np_wh 'asked him where the money Was' np_ap 'considered him foolish' np_sbrst 'had him clean up' ap 'turned blue' figure 1: searchable In our queries for nouns and adjectives as targets, we are able to extract prepositional, clausal, infinitival, and gerundial complements. In addition, the tool accomodates searches for compounds and for possessor phrases (my neighbor's addiction to cake, my milk allergy). Even though these categories are not tied to the syntactic subcategorization frames of the target lemmas, they often instantiate semantic arguments, or, more specifically, Frame elements (Fillmore 1982, Baker et al. forthcoming). 1.3 Method 1.3.1 Overview We start by creating a subcorpus containing all concordance lines for a given lemma. We call this subcorpus a lemma-subcorpus. The extraction of smaller subcorpora from the lemma subcorpus then proceeds in two stages. During the first stage, syntactic patterns involving 'displaced' arguments (i.e. 'left isolation' or 'movement' phenomena) are extracted, such as passives, tough movement and constructions involving WH-extraction. The result of this procedure is a set of subcorpora that are homogeneous with respect to major constituent order. Following this, the remainder of the lemma-subcorpus is partitioned into subcorpora based on the subcategorization properties of the lemma in question.

However, the information that the target verb subcategorizes for a gerund dramatically reduces the number of such errors. The same mechanism is used for addressing the problems associated with prepositional phrase attachment. The general principle is that prepositional phrases in certain contexts are considered to be embedded in a preceding noun phrase , unless the user specifies that a given preposition is subcategorized for by the target lemma.

The tool facilitates the (manual) discovery of evidence for new subcategorization frames, however, as potential complement patterns are saved in separate subcorpora. Indeed, this is one of the ways in which the tool is being used in the context of the FrameNet project. Some of the technical limitations of the existing tools result from the fact that we are working with an unparsed corpus. Thus, many types of 'null' or 'empty' constituents 3 are not recognized by the queries. Ambiguities in prepositional phrase attachment are another major source of errors. For instance, of the concordance lines supposedly instantiating a [_NP PPwith] frame for the verb heal, several in fact contained embedded PPs (e.g. [_NP], as in heal [children with asthma], rather than [_NP PPwith], as in healing [arthritis] [with a crystal ball]), Finally, the search results can only be as accurate as the part-of-speech tags and other an-notations in the corpus."]},{"title":"7 Future directions","paragraphs":["Future versions of the tool will include searches for predicative (vs. attributive) uses for adjectives and nouns.
