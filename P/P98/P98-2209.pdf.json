To address this challenge, MIKE employs importance scores that intuitively capture the amount of information communicated to the audience. We describe how a principle of maximizing the total gain of importance scores during a game can be used to incorporate content selection into the surface generation module, thus accounting for issues such as interruption and abbreviation.","Sample commentaries produced by MIKE are presented and used to evaluate different methods for content selection and generation in terms of efficiency of communication. 1 Introduction Timeliness, or reactivity, plays an important role in actual language use. An expression should not only be appropriately planned to communicate relevant content, but should also be uttered at the right moment to describe the action and further to carry on the discourse smoothly. Content selection and its generation are inseparable here. For example, people often start talking before knowing all that they want to say. It is also relatively common' to fill gaps in commentary by describing what was true inthe past. An extreme instance is when an utterance needs to be interrupted to describe a more important event that suddenly occurs.","It might be expected that dialogue systems should have addressed such real-time issues, but in fact these studies appear to have been much more focused on content planning. The reason for this lies in the nature of dialogue. Although many human-human conversations involve a lot of time pressure, slower conversations can also be successful provided the planning is sufficiently incorporated. For example, even if one conversation participant spends time before taking a turn, the conversation partner can just wait until hearing a contribution.","In contrast, reactivity is inevitable in live commentary generation, because the complexity and the rapid flow of the situation severely restrict what to be said, and when. If too much time is spent think-ing, the situation will unfold quickly into another phase and important events will not be mentioned at the right time.","MIKE is an automatic narration system that generates spoken live commentary of a simulated soccer game in English, French, or Japanese. We chose the game of soccer firstly because it is a multi-agent game in which various events happen simultaneously in the field. Thus, it is a suitable domain to study real-time content selection among many heterogeneous facts. A second reason for choosing soccer is that detailed, high-quality logs of simulated soccer games are available on a real-time basis from Soccer Server(Noda and Matsubara, 1996), the official soccer simulation system for the RoboCup (Robotic Soccer World Cup) initiative.","The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. First, we describe our principle for real time content selection and explain its background. Then, after briefly explaining MIKE'S overall design, §4 explains how our principles are realized within our implementation. §6 discusses some related works, and §5 presents some actual output by MIKE and evaluates it in terms of efficiency of communication. 2 Principles of Content Selection in the Real Time Discourse 2.1 Maximization of Total Information A discourse is most effective when the amount of information transmitted to the listener is maximal.","In the case O f making discourse about a static subject whose situation does not change, the most important contents can be selected and described in 1282 the given time.","In the case of making discourse on adynamic subject, however, content selection suddenly becomes very complex. Above all, the importance of the contents changes according to the dynamic discourse topic, and also according to the dynamic situation of the subject. Additionally, past events become less importarit with time. Under this condition, the basic function of content selection is to choose the most important content at any given time. This control, however, is not enough, because any content will take time to be uttered and during that time, the situation of the subject might change rapidly. Therefore, it should always be possible to change or rearrange the content being uttered.","Examples of such rearrangements are:","• interruption. When the situation of the sub-","ject changes suddenly to a new one, more in-","formation can be given by rejecting the current","utterance and switching to new one.","• abbreviation. When many important facts","arise, the total information can be augmented","by referring to each facts quickly by abbreviat-","ing each one.","• repetition. When nothing new comes up in","the subject, the important facts already uttered","can be repeated to reinforce the information","given to the listener.","As a consequence, creating a system which in-volves real time discourse concerns 1.assessing the dynamic importance of contents, 2.controlling the content selection with this importance so that the total information becomes maximal using the rearrangement functions.","In §4, we discuss how we implemented these principles in MIKE to produce a real time narration. 2.2"]},{"title":"What, How","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"When-to-Say","paragraphs":["The previous section pointed out that contents should be uttered at the right time; that is, real time discourse systems should effectively address the problem of"]},{"title":"when-to-say","paragraphs":["any piece of information.

Here we simply give a brief overview. 3.1 MIKE's Structure","MIKE, 'Multi-agent Interactions Knowledgeably Explained', is designed to produce simultaneous commentary for the Soccer Server, originally proposed as a standard evaluation method for multi-agent systems(Noda and Matsubara, 1996). The Soccer Server provides a real-time game log 1 of a very high quality, sending information on the positions of the players and the ball to a monitoring program every 100msec. Specifically, this information consists of:","• player location and orientation,","• ball location,","• game score and play modes (such as throw ins,","goal kicks,"]},{"title":"etc ).","paragraphs":["From this low-level input, the current implementa-tion of MIKE can generate the range of comments shown in Figure 1.","1The simulator and the game logs are available at http ://ci. etl. go. j p/'noda/s occer/server. 1283 I SoccerServer 1 Figure 2: MIKE's structure Table 1: fragments of commentary Local","Event Kick Pass Dribble ShootPredict","State Nark PlayerPassSuccessRate ProblematicPlayer PlayerActive Examples of"]},{"title":"Propositions,","paragraphs":["the internal Global ChangeForm SideChange TeamPassSuccessRate AveragePassDistance Score Time","MIKE'S architecture -- a role-sharing multi-agent system 2 __ is shown in Figure 2. Here, the ovals represent concurrently running modules and the rectangles represent data.","All communication among modules is mediated by the internal symbolic representation of commentary","2In natural language processing, the multi-agent approach dates back to Hearsay-II (Erraan et al., 1980), which was the first to use the blackboard architecture. The core organization of MIKE, however, is more akin to a subsumption architecture (Brooks, 1991), because the agents are regarded as behavior modules which are both directly connected to the external environment (through sensor readings from the shared memory) and can directly produce system behavior (by suggest-ing commentary). However, MIKE does not exactly fit the subsumption architecture model because the agents can also communicate with each other: there are some portions of the shared memory that are global and some that are exported to only a limited number of agents. This division of shared memory leads to more possibilities for inter-agent communication. • Logical consequences:","(PassSuccessRate player percentage) (PassPattern player Goal)","---* (active player) • Logical subsumption:","(Pass playerl player2) (Kick playerl) -~ (Delete @2) • State change:","(Form team forml)(F0rm team form2) --+ (Delete earlier-prop) • Second order relation:","(PassSuccessRate player percentage) (PlayerOnVoronoiLine playr) --*","(Reason @1 @2) Figure 3: Categories and examples of inference rules fragments, which we call"]},{"title":"propositions.","paragraphs":["A proposition is represented with a tag and some attributes. For example, a kick by player No.5 is represented as (Kick 5), where Kick is the tag and 5 is the at-tribute. So far, MIKE has around 80 sorts of tags, categorized in two ways: as being local or global and as being state-based or event-based. Table 1 shows some examples of categorized proposition tags.","Some of the important modules in MIKE'S architecture can be summarized as follows.","There are six Soccer Analyzers that try to interpret the game. Three of these analyze events (shown in the figure as the 'kick analysis', 'pass work', and 'shoot' modules). The other three carry out state-based analysis (shown as the 'basic strategy', 'formation', and 'play area' modules). The modules analyze the data from the Soccer Server, communicate with each other via the shared memory, and then post the results as propositions into the Pool.","The Real Time Inference Engine processes the propositions. Prpositions deposited in the Pool are bare facts and are often too detailed to be used as comments. MIKE therefore uses forward chaining rules of the form"]},{"title":"precedents---, antecedents","paragraphs":["to draw further inferences. The types of rules used for this process are shown in Figure 3. Currently, MIKE has about 110 such rules.","The Natural Language Generator selects the proposition from the Pool that best fits the current state of the game (considering both the situation on the field and the comment currently being made). It then translates the proposition into NL. So far, MIKE just carries out this final step with the simple mechanism of template-matching. Several templates are prepared for each proposition tag, and the out-1284 importance"]},{"title":"i","paragraphs":["initial value <: - .

English is produced by Dectalk(DEC, 1994), French by Proverbe Speech Engine Unit(Elan, 1997), Japanese by Fujitsu Japanese Synthesizer(Fujitsu, 1995). 4 Implementation of Content Selection 4.1 Importance of a Proposition The Soccer Analyzers attach an importance score to a proposition, which intuitively captures the amount of information that the proposition would transmit to an audience.","The importance score of a proposition is planned to change over time as follows (Figure 4). After being posted to the Pool, the score decreases over time while it remains in the Pool waiting to be uttered. When the importance score of a proposition reaches zero, it is deleted. This decrease in importance models the way that an event's relevance decreases as the game progresses.","The rate at which importance scores decrease can be modeled by any monotonic function. For simplicity, MIKE'S function is currently linear. Since it seems sensible that local propositions should lose their score more quickly than global ones, several functions with different slopes are used, depending on the degree to which a proposition can be considered local or global. When a proposition is used for utterance or inference, the score is reduced in order to avoid the redundant use of the same proposition, but not set to zero, thus leaving a small chance for other inferences.","There is also an initialization process for the importance scores as follows. First, to reflect the situation of the game, the local propositions are modified by a multiplicative factor depending on the state of the game. This factor is designed so that local propositions are more important when the ball is near the goal. Global propositions are always initialized with the default value.","Secondly, to reflect the topic of the discourse, MIKE has a feedback control which enables each Soccer Analyzer module to take into account MIKE's past and present utterances. The NL generator broadcasts the current subject to the agents and they assign greater initial importance scores to propositions with related subjects. For example, when MIKE is talking about player No.5, the Analyzers assign a higher importance to propositions relating to this player No.5. 4.2 Maximization of the Importance Score As the importance score is designed to intuitively reflect the information transmitted to the audience, the natural application of our content selection principles described in §2 is simply to attempt to maximize the total importance of all the propositions that are selected for utterance.","MIKE has the very basic function of uttering the most important content at any given time. That is, MIKE repeatedly selects the proposition with the largest importance score in the Pool.","The NL Generator translates the selected proposition into a natural language expression and sends it to the TTS-administrator module. Then the NL Generator has to wait until the Text-to-Speech software finishes the utterance before sending out the next expression. During this time lag, however, the game situation might rapidly unfold and numerous further propositions may be posted to the Pool. It is to cope with this time lag that MIKE implements a alternative function, that allows a more flexible selection of propositions by modeling the processes of interruption, abbreviation, and repetition, Interruption If a proposition with a much larger importance score than the one currently being uttered is inserted into the Pool, the total importance score may become larger by immediately interrupting the current utterance and switching to the new one. For example, the left of Figure 5 shows (solid line) the change of the importance score with time when an interruption takes place (the dotted line. represents the importance score without interruption). The left part of the solid line is lower than the dotted, because the first utterance conveys less of its importance score (information) when it is not completely uttered. The right part of the dotted line is lower than that of the solid, because the importance of the second utterance decreases over time when waiting 1285 interruption abbreviation : with interruption"]},{"title":"°'1 l","paragraphs":["-- w thou - ~! interruplion i t","time Important proposition posted at this point total importance score using interruption i without abbreviation -~ with abbreviation t time Two important propositions at this point _ _ _ total importance total importance total importance score not using score using score not using interruption abbreviation abbreviation Figure 5: Change of importance score on interruption and abbreviation to be selected.","Thus, the sum of the importance of the uttered propositions can no longer be used to access the system's performance. Instead, the area between the lines and the horizontal axis indicates the total importance score over time. Whether or not to make interruption should be decided by comparing two areas made by the solid and dotted, and the larger area size is the total importance score gain. Further, this selection decides what to be said and how at the same time.","Note that interruptions raise the importance score gain by reacting sharply to the sudden increase of the importance score."]},{"title":"Abbreviation","paragraphs":["If the two most important propositions in the Pool are of similar importance, it is possible that the amount of communicated information could be maximized by quickly uttering the most important proposition and then moving on to the second before loses importance due to some development of the game situation. In the Figure 5, we have illustrated this in the same way we did for the case of interruption. The left hand side of the solid line is lower than that of the dotted because an abbreviated utterance (which might not be grammatically correct, or whose context might not be fully given) transmits less information than a more complete utterance. As the second proposition can be uttered before losing its importance score, however, the right hand part of the solid line is higher than that of the dotted.

This indicates that the commentary with rearrangements is more timely than the commentary that repeatedly selects the most important proposition. For instance, the peaks caused by a goal around time 2200 spread out for the dotted line, which is not the case for the solid line. Also, the peaks are higher for the solid line than dotted.","• The area covered by the solid line is larger than that by the dotted, meaning that the total importance score is greater with rearrangements. During this whole game, the total importance score with rearrangements amounted 9.90% more than that without. Decrease of Delayed Utterances As a further experiments, we manually annotated each statement in the Japanese output for the RoboCup'9? quater-final with it optimal time for utterance. We then calculated the average delay in the appearance of these statements in MIKE'S commentary both with and without rearrangements. We found that adding the rearrangements decreased this delay from 2.51sec to 2.16sec , a improvement at about 14%. 6 Related Works (Suzuki et al., 1997) have proposed new interac-tion styles to replace conventional goal-oriented dialogues. Their multi-agent dialogue system that chats with a human considers topics and goals as being situated within the context of interactions among participants. Their model of context handling is an adaptation of a subsumption architecture. One important common aspect between their system and MIKE is that the system itself creates topics.","The SOCCER system described in (Andr~ et al., 1994), combines a vision system with an intelligent multimedia generation system to provide commentary on 'short sections of video recordings of real soccer games'. The system is built on VITRA, which uses generalized simultaneous scene descrip-tion to produce concurrent image sequence evaluation and natural language processing. The vision system translates TV images into information and the intelligent multimedia generation module then takes this information and presents it by combining media such as text, graphics and video."]},{"title":"7 Conclusions and Future Work","paragraphs":["We have described how MIKE, a live commentary generation system for the game of soccer, deals with the issues of real time content selection and realiza-tion.","MIKE uses heterogeneous modules to recognize various low-level and high-level features from basic input information on the positions of the ball and the players.

The effect of using the rearrangements was shown compared and found to increase the total importance scores by 10%, to decrease delay of the commentary by 14%.","An important goal for future work is parameter learning to allow systematic improvement of MIKE'S performance. Although the parameters used in the system should ideally be extracted from the game log corpus, this opportunity is currently very limited; only the game logs of RoboCup'97 (56 games) and JapanOpen-98 (26 games) is open to public. Additionally, no model commentary text corpus is available. One way to surmount the lack of appropriate corpora is to utilize feedback from an actual audience. Evaluations and requests raised by the audience could be automatically reflected in parameters such as the initial values for importance scores, rates of decay of these scores, the coefficients in the formulae used for controlling inferences.","Another important research topic is the incorporation of more sophisticated natural language generation technologies in MIKE to produce a more lively, diverse output. At the phrase generation level, this includes the generation of temporal expressions, anaphoric references to preceding parts of the commentary, embedded clauses. At the more surface level, these are many research issues related to text-to-speech technology, especially prosody control."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["E. Andre, G. Herzog, and T.
