Beesley@xrce. xerox, com Abstract This paper examines the phenomenon of consonant spreading in Arabic stems. Each spreading involves a local surface copying of an underlying consonant, and, in certain phonological contexts, spreading alternates productively with consonant lengthening (or gemination). The morphophonemic triggers of spreading lie in the patterns or even in the roots themselves, and the combination of a spreading root and a spreading pattern causes a consonant to be copied multiple times. The interdigitation of Arabic stems and the realization of consonant spreading are formalized using finite-state morphotactics and variation rules, and this approach has been successfully implemented in a large-scale Arabic morphological analyzer which is available for testing on the Internet. 1 Introduction Most formal analyses of Semitic languages, including Arabic, defend the reality of abstract, unpronounceable morphemes called ROOTS, consisting usually of three, but sometimes two or four. consonants called RADICALS. The classic examples include ktb (~. ,D ~)1, appearing in a number of words having to do with writ-ing, books, schools, etc.; and drs (~9 z), appearing in words having to do with studying, learning, teaching, etc. Roots combine nonconcatenatively with PATTERNS to form STEMS, a process known informally as INTERDIGITA-TION or INTERCALATION. We shall look first at Arabic stems in general before examining GEMINATION and SPREADING, related phenomena wherein a single underlying radical is real-","~The Arabic-script examples in this paper were produced using the ArabTeX package for TEX and DTEX by Prof. Dr. Klaus Lagally of the University of Stuttgart.","daras","duris","darn'as","duruus","diraasa(t)","darraas","madrasa(t)","madaaris","madrasiyy","tadriis 'study' 'be studied' 'teach' 'lessons' 'study' 'eager student' 'school' 'schools' 'scholastic' 'instruction' verb","verb","verb","noun","noun","noun","noun","noun","adj-like","noun Figure 1: Some stems built on root drs ized multiple times in a surface string. Semitic morphology, including stem interdigitation and spreading, is adequately and elegantly formalizable using finite-state rules and operations. 1.1 Arabic Stems The stems in Figure 12 share the drs root morpheme, and indeed they are traditionally or-ganized under a drs heading in printed lexicons like the authoritative Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic of Hans Wehr (1979).","A root morpheme like drs interdigitates with a pattern morpheme, or, in some analyses. with a pattern and a separate vocalization morpheme, to form abstract stems. Because interdigitation involves pattern elements being in-serted between the radicals of the root morpheme, Semitic stem formation is a classic example of non-concatenative morphotactics. Separating and identifying the component morphemes of words is of course the core task of morphological analysis for any language, and analyzing Semitic stems is a classic challenge","2The taa~ marbuu.ta, notated here as (t), is the feminine ending pronounced only in certain environments. Long consonants and long vowels are indicated here with gemination. 117 for any morphological analyzer. 1.2","Interdigitation as Intersection Finite-state morphology is based on the claim that both morphotactics and phonological/orthographical variation rules, i.e. the relation of underlying forms to surface forms, can be formalized using finite-state automata (Kaplan and Kay, 1981; Karttunen, 1991; Kaplan and Kay, 1994). Although the most accessible computer implementations (Koskenniemi, 1983; Antworth, 1990; Karttunen, 1993)of finite-state morphotactics have been limited to building words via the concatenation of morphemes, the theory itself does not have this limitation. In Semitic morphotactics, root and pattern morphemes (and, according to one's theory, perhaps separate vocalization morphemes) are naturally formalized as regular languages, and stems are formed by the intersection, rather than the concatenation, of these regular languages. Such analyses have been laid out else-where (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley, 1998a; Beesley, 1998b) and cannot be repeated here. For present purposes, it will suffice to view morphophonemic (underlying) stems as being formed from the intersection of a root and a pattern, where patterns contain vowels and C slots into which root radicals are, intuitively speak-ing, \"plugged\", as in the following Form I per- ~ct active and passive verb examples. Root: d r s k t b q t i Pattern: CaCaC CaCaC CaCaC Stem: daras katab qatal Root: d r s k t b q t 1 Pattern : CuCiC CuCiC CuCiC Stem: duris kutib qutil Prefixes and suffixes concatenate onto the stems in the usual way to form complete, but still morphophonemic, words; and finite-state variation rules are then applied to map the morphophonemic strings into strings of surface phonemes or orthographicM characters. For an overview of this approach, see Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaehen (1992).","Following Harris (1941) and Hudson (1986), and unlike McCarthy (1981), we also allow the patterns to contain non-radical consonants as in the following perfect active Form VII, Form VIII and Form X examples. Form VII Form VIII Form X Root: k t b k t b kt b Pattern: nCaCaC CtaCaC staCCaC Stem : nkat ab ktatab staktab In this formalization, noun patterns work exactly like verb patterns, as in the following examples: Root: k t b k t b kt b Pattern: CiCaaC CuCuC maCCuuC Stem: kitaab kutub maktuub Gloss : \"book\" \"books\" \"letter\" Where such straightforward intersection of roots and patterns into stems would appear to break down is in cases of gemination and spreading, where a single root radical appears multiple times in a surface stem. 2 Arabic Consonant Gemination and Spreading 2.1","Gemination in Forms II and V Some verb and noun stems exhibit a double realization (a copying) of an underlying radical, resulting in gemination 3 or spreading at the surface level. Looking at gemination first, it is best known from verb stems known in the European tradition as Forms II and V, where the middle radical is doubled. Kay's (1987) pattern notation uses a G symbol before the C slot that needs to be doubled. 4","3Gemination in Arabic words can alternatively be analyzed as consonant lengthening, as in Harris (1941) and as implied by Holes (1995). This solution is very attractive if the goal is to generate fully-voweled orthographical surface strings of Arabic, but for the phonological examples in this paper we adopt the gemination representation as used by phonologists like McCarthy (1981).","4 Kay's stem-building mechanism, using a multi-tape transducer implemented in Prolog, sees G on the pattern tape and writes a copy of the middle radical on the stem tape without consuming it. Then the following C does the same but consumes the radical symbol in the usual way. Kay's analysis in fact abstracts out the vocaliza-118 Root: k t b d r s Pattern: CaGCaC CaGCaC Stem: kattab darras In the same spirit, but with a different mechanism, our Form II and Form V patterns contain an X symbol that appears after the consonant slot to be copied. Root: k t b d r s Pattern: CaCXaC CaCXaC Stem: katXab darXas","As in all cases, the stem is formed by straightforward intersection, resulting in abstract stems like darXas. The X symbol is subsequently realized via finite-state variation rules as a copy of the preceding consonant in a phonological grammar (/darras/) or, in an orthographical system such as ours, as an optionally written shadda diacritic (~r,~.~). Finite-state rules to effect such limited local copying are trivially written, s 2.2 Gemination/Spreading in Form IX Spreading, which appears to involve consonant copying over intervening phonemes, is not so different from gemination; and indeed it is common in \"spreading\" verb stems for the spreading to alternate productively with gemination. The best known example of Arabic consonant spreading is the verbal stem known as Form IX (the same behavior is also seen in Form XI, Form XIV, Form QIV and in several noun forms). A typical example is the root dhm (~, 0 z), which in Form IX has the meaning \"become black\".","Spreading is not terribly common in Modern Standard Arabic, but it occurs in enough verb and noun forms to deserve, in our opinion, full treatment. In our lexicon of about 4930 roots, tion, placing it on a separate transducer tape, but this difference is not important here. For extensions of this multi-tape approach see Kiraz (1994; 1996). The current approach differs from the multi-tape approaches in formalizing roots, patterns and vocalizations as regular languages and by computing (\"linearizing\") the stems at compile time via intersection of these regular languages (Beesley, 1998a; Beesley, 1998b).","5See, for example, the rules of Antworth (1990) for handling the limited reduplication seen in Tagalog. by d & .~ ,4. hmr"]},{"title":"-J i* C hwl ~ 3 C","paragraphs":["dhm ~, 0 .~ rbd ~ ~. 3 rfd. 0~, ~..)~ zrq ~ .~ .3 zwr .~ .~ .) smr .~ ~. swd ~ .~ J'qr .9 ~ j"]},{"title":"J'mt. 3, j","paragraphs":["s.fr .~ J u\" s.hb ~. o o\""]},{"title":"\"C","paragraphs":["~gbr A '-?. t qtm i* ,D kmd ~ ~. 2 'become white' 'turn red' 'blush' 'be cross-eyed' 'squint' 'become green' 'be moist' 'become black' 'become ashen' 'glower' 'drip' 'scatter' 'break up' 'be blue in color' 'alienate' 'become brown' 'become black' 'be of fair complexion' 'turn gray' 'turn yellow/pale' 'become reddish' 'be crooked' 'be bent' 'be dust-colored' 'be dark-colored' 'become smutty/dark' Figure 2: Roots that combine with Form IX patterns 20 have Form IX possibilities (see Figure 2).

In fact, both forms do occur in full surface words as shown in Figure 3, and the difference is productively and straightforwardly phonological. For perfect endings like +a ('he') and +at ('she'), the final consonant is geminated (or \"lengthened\", depending on your formal point of view). If, however, the suffix begins with a consonant, as in +tu (T) or +ta ('you, masc. sg.'), then the separated or true spreading occurs.","From a phonological view, and reflecting the"]},{"title":"119","paragraphs":["dhamm+a ~.~.~] 'he turned black' dhaniam+tu -~2~.~!

The same holds for root shb (,.?. ~ ~,,), which takes both Form IX (s.habaX) and Form XI (shaabaX), both meaning \"become reddish\". In our lexicon, one root q% (~r' ~. d) takes form XIV, with patterns like the perfect active CCanCaX and imperfect active CCanCiX (\"be pigeon-breasted\"). Other similar Form XIV examples probably exist but are not reflected in the current dictionary.","Aside from the verbal nouns and participles of Forms IX, XI and XIV, other noun-like patterns also involve the spreading of the final radical. These include CiCCiiX and CaCaaCiiX, taken by roots nhr (.; ~ ~3), meaning \"skilled/experienced\", and r~d (~ [_~) meaning \"coward/cowardly\".

While not especially common, there are more roots that take middle-radical-spreading noun patterns than take the better-known Form IX verb patterns. 3","Biliteral Roots As pointed out ill McCarthy (1981, p. 396-7), the gemination vs. spreading behavior of Form IX stems is closely paralleled by Form I stems involving traditionally analyzed \"biliteral\" or ':geminating\" roots such as tm (also characterized as tmm) and sm (possibly smm) and many others of the same ilk. As shown in Figure 4, these roots show Form I gemination with suffixes beginning with a vowel vs. full spreading when the suffix begins with a consonant. However Form IX is handled, these parallels strongly suggest that the exact same underlying forms and variations rules should also handle the form I of biliteral roots.","However, the Form I perfect active pattern, in the current notation, is simply CaCaC (or Root: k t b k t b Pattern: CaCaC CaCaC Lexicah katab+a katab+tu Surface: katab a katab tu Orthography: \"3 Figure 5: Ordinary Form I behavior Root: t m X t m X Pattern: CaCaC CaCaC Lexical: tamaX+a tamaX+tu Surface: tamma tamamtu • O~\" Orthography: 5/ Figure 6: Biliteral tm formalized as tmX idiosyncratically for some roots, CaCuC or CaCiC). As shown in Figure 5, there is no evidence, for normal triliteral roots like ktb, that any kind of copying is specified by the Form I pattern itself.","Keeping CaCaC as the Form I perfect active pattern, the behavior of biliteral roots falls out effortlessly if they are formalized not as srn and tin, nor as smm and tram, but as smX and tmX, with the copying-trigger X as the third radical of the root itself. Such roots intersect in the normM way with triliteral patterns as in Figure 6, and they are mapped to appropriate surface strings using the same rules that realize Form IX stems. 4 Rules The TWOLC rule (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) that maps an X, coming either fl'om roots like tmX or from patterns like Form IX CCaCaX. into a copy of the previous consonant is the following, where Cons is a grammar-level variable ranging freely over consonants, LongVowel is a grammar-level variable ranging freely over long vowels and diphthongs, and C is an indexed local variable ranging over the enumerated set of consonants.","X:C <=> :C \\:Cons+ _ ~+: Cons ; :C LongVowel _ ; :C X::_ ; where C in (b t 0 j h x d 6 r z"]},{"title":"sf d;6 xfqk","paragraphs":["imnhwy); 121","The rule, which in fact compiles into 27 rules, one for each enumerated consonant, realizes underlying X as surface C if and only if one of the following cases applies: 6","* First Context: X is preceded by a surface C and one or more non-consonants, and is followed by a suffix beginning with a consonant.

The current dictionaries contain 4930 roots, each one hand-coded to indicate the subset of patterns with which it legally combines (Buckwalter, 1990). Roots and patterns are intersected (Beesley, 1998b) at compile time to yield 90,000 stems. Various combinations of prefixes and suffixes, concatenated to the stems, yield over 72,000,000 abstract words. Sixty-six finite-state variation rules map these abstract strings into fully-voweled orthographical strings, and additional trivial rules are then applied to optionally delete short vowels and other diacritics, allowing the system to analyze unvoweled, partially voweled, and fully-voweled orthographical strings.","The full system, including a Java interface that displays both input and output in Arabic script, is available for testing on the Internet at http ://www. xrce. xerox, com/research/ mltt/arabic/. 122 References Evan L.
