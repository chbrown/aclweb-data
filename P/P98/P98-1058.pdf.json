A A-structure can be considered as a A-term up to consistent renaming of bound variables (a-equality); a constraint of CLLS is an underspecified description of a A-structure. CLLS solves a capturing problem omnipresent in underspecified scope representations. CLLS features constraints for dominance, lambda binding, parallelism, and anaphoric links. Based on CLLS we present a simple, integrated, and underspecified treatment of scope, parallelism, and anaphora. 1 Introduction A central concern of semantic underspecification (van Deemter and Peters, 1996) is the underspecification of the scope of variable binding operators such as quantifiers (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Alshawi, 1990; Reyle, 1993). This immediately raises the conceptual problem of how to avoid variable-capturing when instantiating underspecified scope representations. In principle, capturing may occur in all formalisms for structural underspecification which represent binding relations by the coordination of variables (Reyle, 1995; Pinkal, 1996; Bos, 1996; Niehren et al., 1997a).

This illustrates that in cases of parallelism, like in corrections, different variables in parallel quantified structures have to be matched against each other, which requires some form of renaming to be done on them. While this is unproblematic for fully specified structures, it presents serious problems with underspecified structures like (2) and (4), as there the names of the vari-353 ables are crucial for insuring the right bindings.

CLLS subsumes dominance constraints (Backofen et al., 1995) as known from syntactic processing (Marcus et al., 1983) with tree-adjoining grammars (Vijay-Shanker, 1992; Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 1994).

Thus, the coverage of CLLS is comparable to Crouch (1995) and Shieber et al. (1996). We illustrate CLLS at a benchmark case for the interaction of scope, anaphora, and ellipsis (8).

A-structures are particular predicate logic tree structures we will introduce. We first exemplify the expressiveness of CLLS. 2.1 Elements of CLLS A A-structure is a tree structure extended by two additional relations (the binding and the linking relation). We represent A-structures as graphs. Every A-structure characterizes a unique A-term or a logical formula up to consistent renaming of bound variables (a-equality).

Intuitively, this means they are interpreted as if names, or variables with their binding relations, would be copied down the link chain. It is crucial though not to use such copied structures right away: the link relation gives precise control over strict and sloppy interpretations when anaphors interact with parallelism. E.g., (16) is the source clause of the manypronouns-puzzle, a problematic case of interaction of ellipsis and anaphora. (Xu, 1998), where our treatment of ellipsis and anaphora was developed, argues that link chains yield the best explanation for the distribution of strict/sloppy readings involving many pronouns. The basic idea is that an elided pronoun can either be linked to its parallel pronoun in the source clause (referential parallelism) or be linked in a structurally parallel way (structural parallelism). This analysis agrees with the proposal made in (Kehler, 1993; Kehler, 1995). It covers a series of problematic cases in the literature such as the many-pronouns-puzzle, cascaded ellipsis, or the five-reading sentence (17): (17) John revised his paper before the teacher","did, and so did Bill The precise interaction of parallelism with binding and linking relations is spelled out in sec. 2.2. 2.2 Syntax and Semantics of CLLS We start with a set of labels E= {@2, lam I ' var 0 ' ana 0 ' before 2, maryO, readO,,, .}, ranged over by ]ji, with arity i which may be omitted.

A (finite) tree structure, underlying L, is given by a set of nodes u, u', ... connected by paths ~r, ~ff, ... (possibly empty words over positive in-tegers), and a labelling ]junction I from nodes to labels. The number of daughters of a node matches the arity of its label. The relationship Y:fL(Vl, ..., Yn) holds iff l(v)=]j and v.i = vi for i = 1..n, where v.~r stands for the node that is reached from v by following the path 7r (if defined). To express that a path lr is defined on a node v in L we write v.rSL. We write ~r<r' for ~r being an initial segment of 7d. The dominance relation v<~v' holds if 37r v.Tr = v'. If ~r is non-empty we have proper dominance v<+v '. A A-structure L is a tree structure with two (partially functional) binary relations AL(')= \", for binding, and anteL(')=', for anaphor-to-antecedent linking. We assume that the following conditions hold: (1) binding only holds between variables (nodes labelled var) to A-binders (nodes labelled lain); (2) every variable has exactly one binder; (3) variables are dominated by their binders; (4) only anaphors (nodel labelled ana) are linked to antecendents; (2) every anaphor has exactly one antecendent; (5) antecedents are terminal nodes; (6) there are no cyclic link chains; (7) if a link chain ends at a variable then each anaphor in the chain must be dominated by the binder of that variable. The not so straight forward part of the semantics of CLLS is the notion of parallelism, which we define for any given A-structure L as follows:","iff there is a path ~r0 such that: 1. rr0 is the \"exception path\" from the top node of the parallel structures the the two exception positions: v{=Vl.~ro A v~=v2.~ro","2. the two contexts, which are the trees below Vl and v2 up-to the trees below the exception positions v{ and v~, must have the same structure and labels: Vr -~0<r ~ ((v,.~$L ~ v2.rSL)A (Vl.Tr.~L =:~ l(Vl.Tr ) ---- l(v2.Tr))))","3. there are no 'hanging' binders from the contexts to variables outside them: VvVv' * + ' * ' AL(v')=v) ~(Vl<~LV<~ L Vl <~LV A","4. binding is structurally isomorphic within the two contexts: 356 V rr V rr' -~ir o < ~r A vl .

In the case (8), both anaphora and quantification interact with ellipsis. (8) Mary read a book she liked before Sue did. (8) has three readings (see (Crouch, 1995) for a discussion of a similar example). In the first, the indefinite NP a book she liked takes wide scope over both clauses (a particular book liked by Mary is read by both Mary and Sue). In the two others, the operator before outscopes the indefinite NP. The two options result from the two possibilities of reconstructing the pronoun she in the ellipsis interpretation, viz., 'strict' (both read some book that Mary liked) and 'sloppy' (each read some book she liked herself). The constraint for (8), displayed in (18), is an underspecified representation of the above three readings. It can be derived in a compositional fashion along the lines described in (Niehren et al., 1997b). Xs and Xt represent the semantics of the source and the target clause, while X16 and X21 stand for the semantics of the parallel elements (Mary and Sue) respectively.

The two solutions this gives rise to are drawn in (20) and (21). Here X1 and the interpretation of the indefinite NP directly below enter into the parallelism as a whole, as these nodes lie below the source node Xs. Thus, there are two anaphoric nodes: X12 in the source and its 'copy' II12 in the target semantics. For the copy to be parallel to XI2 it can either have a link to X12 to have a same referential value (strict reading, see (20)) or a link to X21 that is structurally parallel to the link from X12 to X16, and hence leads to the node of the parallel element Sue (sloppy reading, see (21)). 357"]},{"title":"(20) ~x, I\"\" ~\"r, ary.,, X~6\"~. ' ~/sue * _X","paragraphs":["4 Related Work CLLS allows a uniform and yet internally structured approach to semantic ambiguity. We use a single constraint formalism in which to describe different kinds of information about the meaning of an utterance. This avoids the problems of order dependence of processing that for example Shieber et al. (1996) get by interleaving two formalisms (for scope and for ellipsis resolution). Our approach follows Crouch (1995) in this respect, who also includes parallelism constraints in the form of substitution expressions directly into an underspecified semantic formalism (in his case the formalism of Quasi Logical Forms QLF). We believe that the two approaches are roughly equivalent empirically. But in contrast to CLLS, QLF is not for-malised as a general constraint language over tree-like representations of meaning. QLF has the advantage of giving a more direct handle on meanings themselves - at the price of its relatively complicated model theoretic semantics. It seems harder though to come up with solutions within QLF that have an easy portability across different semantic frameworks. We believe that the ideas from CLLS tie in quite easily with various other semantic formalisms, such as UDRT (Reyle, 1993) and MRS (Copestake et al., 1997), which use dominance relations similar to ours, and also with theories of Logical Form associated with GB style grammars, such as (May, 1977). In all these frameworks one tends to use variable-coordination (or coindex-ing) rather than the explicit binding and linking relations we have presented here. We hope that these approaches can potentially benefit from the presented idea of rubber bands for binding and linking, without having to make any dramatic changes. Our definition of parallelism implements some ideas from Hobbs and Kehler (1997) on the be-havior of anaphoric links. In contrast to their proposal, our definition of parallelism is not based on an abstract notion of similarity. Furthermore, CLLS is not integrated into a general theory of abduction. We pursue a more modest aim at this stage, as CLLS needs to be connected to \"material\" deduction calculi for reasoning with such underspecified semantic representation in order to make progress on this front. We hope that some of the more ad hoc features of our definition of parallelism (e.g. axiom 5) may receive a justification or improvement in the light of such a deeper understanding. Context Unification. CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (CU) (Niehren et al., 1997a), but it leads to a more direct and more structured encoding of semantic constraints than CU could offer. There are three main differences between CU and CLLS. 1) In CLLS variables are interpreted over nodes rather than whole trees. This gives us a direct handle on occurrences of semantic material, where CU could handle occurrences only indirectly and less efficiently. 2) CLLS avoids the capturing problem. 3) CLLS provides explicit anaphoric links, which could not be adequately modeled in CU. The insights of the CU-analysis in (Niehren et al., 1997b) carry over to CLLS, but the awkward second-order equations for expressing dominance in CU can be omitted (Niehren and Koller, 1998). This omission yields an enormous simplification and efficiency gain for processing. Tractability. The distinguishing feature of our approach is that we aim to develop efficiently treatable constraint languages rather than to apply maximally general but intractable formalisms. We are confident that CLLS can be implemented in a simple and efficient manner. First experiments which are based on high-level concurrent constraint programming have shown promising results. 358 5 Conclusion In this paper, we presented CLLS, a first-order language for semantic underspecification. It represents ambiguities in simple underspecified structures that are transparent and suitable for processing. The application of CLLS to some difficult cases of ambiguity has shown that it is well suited for the task of representing ambiguous expressions in terms of underspecification.
