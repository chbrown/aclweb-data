It is an alternative to an existing algorithm that is shown to be incorrect. Furthermore, the new algorithm is much simpler, being very close to traditional LR parsing for context-free grammars. The construction of derived trees and the computation of features also become straightforward. 1 Introduction The efficiency of LR(k) parsing techniques (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen, 1990) appears to be very attractive from the perspective of natural language processing. This has stimulated the computational linguistics community to develop extensions of these techniques to general context-free grammar parsing. The best-known example is generalized LR parsing (Tomita, 1986).","A first attempt to adapt LR parsing to tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs) was made by Schabes and Vijay-Shanker (1990). The description was very complicated however, and not surprisingly, no implementation of the algorithm seems to have been made up to now. Apart from presentational difficulties, the algorithm as it was published is also incorrect. Brief indications of the nature of the incorrectness have been given before by Kinyon (1997). There seems to be no straightforward way to correct the algorithm.","We therefore developed an alternative to the algorithm from Schabes and Vijay-Shanker (1990). This alternative is novel in presentational aspects, and is fundamentally different in that it incorporates reductions of subtrees.","The new algorithm has the benefit that many theoretically and practically useful properties carry over from the context-free case. For example, by making a straightforward translation from TAGs to linear indexed grammars, one may identify computations of the parser with rightmost derivations in reverse. Also the extensions needed for construction of parse trees (or \"derived trees\" as they are often called for TAGs) and the computation of features are almost identical to the corresponding extensions for context-free LR parsing.","Section 2 discusses our notation. The algorithm for constructing the LR table is given in Section 3, and the automaton that operates on these tables is given in Section 4. Section 5 first explains why the algorithm from Schabes and Vijay-Shanker (1990) is incorrect, and then provides an example of how our new algorithm works. Some extensions are discussed in Section 6, and the implementation in Section 7. 2 Notation For a good introduction to TAGs, the reader is referred to Joshi (1987). In this section we merely summarize our notation.","A tree-adjoining grammar is a 4-tuple (Z, NT, I, A), where ~ is a finite set of terminals, I is a finite set of initial trees and A is a finite set of auxiliary trees. We refer to the trees in I U A as elementary trees. The set NT, a finite set of nonterminals, does not play any role in this paper.","Each auxiliary tree has a distinguished leaf, call the foot. We refer to the foot of an auxiliary tree t as Ft. We refer to the root of an elementary tree t as Rt. The set of all nodes of an elementary tree t is denoted by At(t), and we define the set of all nodes in the grammar by At = U, ruAAt(t).","For each non-leaf node N we define children(N) as the list of children nodes. For other nodes, the function children is undefined. The dominance relation <J* is the reflexive and 946 transitive closure of the parent relation <~ defined by N <~ M if and only if children(N) = aMf~, for some ~, f~ E A/'*.","Each leaf N in an elementary tree, except when it is a foot, is labelled by either a terminal from Z or the empty string e. We identify such a node N labelled by a terminal with that terminal. Thus, we consider 2: to be a subset of Af, I","For now, we will disallow labels to be e, since this causes a slight technical problem. We will return to this issue in Section 6,","For each node N that is not a leaf or that is a foot, we define Adjunct(N) as the set of auxiliary trees that can be adjoined at N. This set may contain the element nil to indicate that adjunction at that node is not obligatory.","An example of a TAG is given in Figure 1. There are two initial trees, al and a2, and one auxiliary tree fL For each node N, Adjunct(N) has been indicated to the right of that node, unless Adjunct(N) = {nil}, in which case that information is omitted from the picture. 3 Construction of the LR table For technical reasons, we assume an additional node for each elementary tree t, which we denote by T. This node has only one child, viz. the actual root node Rt. We also assume an additional node for each auxiliary tree t, which we denote by _L. This is the unique child of the actual foot node Ft. The domain of the function children is extended to include foot nodes, by defining children(Ft) = _L, for each t E A.","For the algorithm, two kinds of tree need to be distinguished: elementary trees and subtrees of elementary trees. A subtree can be identified by a pair (t, N), where t is an elementary tree and N is a node in that tree; the pair indicates the subtree of t rooted at N. The set of all trees needed by our algorithm is given by: T = IUAU{(t,N) I tEIUA, NEAf(t)} From here on, we will use the symbol t exclusively to range over I U A, and r to range over T in general.","1With this convention, we can no longer distinguish between different leaves in the grammar with the same terminal label. This merging of leaves with identical labels is not an inherent part of our algorithm, but it simplifies the notation considerably.","For each ~ E T, we may consider a part of the tree consisting of a node N in ~- and the list of its children nodes 7. Analogously to the notation for context-free parsing, we separate the list of children nodes into two lists, separated by a dot, and write N --~ a • f~, where a/~ = 7, to indicate that the children nodes in a have already been matched against a part of the input string, and those in fl have as yet not been processed.","The set of such objects for an elementary tree t is given by:"]},{"title":"Pt","paragraphs":["="]},{"title":"{(T~.fl) I afl=Rt}U","paragraphs":["{(N --~ a • f~) I N E Af(t), children(N) = aft} For subtrees (t, M) we define:","P(t,M) = {(N ~ (~ • t~) I M <F N, children(N) = a/3} Such objects are attached to the trees ~ E T to which they pertain, to form the set of items:","Items = {[T,g--~ a • fl] I r e T,(Y-+ (~ . fl) E P~ } A completed item is an item that indicates a completely recognized elementary tree or subtree. Formally, items are completed if they are of the form [t,T ~ Rt •] or of the form [(t,N),N -+ a •].","The main concept needed for the construction of the LR table is that of LR states. These are particular elements from 2 Items to be defined shortly.","First, we introduce the function closure from 2 Items to 2 Items and the functions goto and goto± from 2 Items x J~f to 2 Items.

A cross-section can also be seen as the yield of the subtree after removal of a certain number of its subtrees.","For convenience, each node of an auxiliary tree (or subtree thereof) that dominates a foot node is paired with a stack of nodes. The intuition behind such a stack of nodes [N1,..., Arm] is that it indicates a path, the so called spine, through the derived tree in the direction of the foot nodes, where each Ni, with 1 <_ i < m, is a node at which adjunction has taken place. Such stacks correspond to the stacks of linear indexed grammars.","The set of all stacks of nodes is denoted by A/'*.

At reductions, such information is gathered and combined, and the resulting data is attached to the new element from Iv[ that is pushed onto the stack. This can be used for computation of derived trees or derivation trees, and for computation of features. Since this technique is almost identical to that for the context-free case, it suffices to refer to existing literature, e.g. Aho et al. (1986, Section 5.3).","We have treated a classical type of TAG, which has adjunction as the only operation for composing trees. Many modern types of TAG also allow tree substitution next to adjunction. Our algorithm can be straightforwardly extended to handle tree substitution. The main changes that are required lie in the closure function, which needs an extra case (much like the corresponding operation in context-free LR parsing), in adding a third type of goto function, and in adding a fourth step, consisting of reduction of initial trees, which is almost identical to the reduction of auxiliary trees. The main difference is that all Xj are elements from Af; the X that is pushed can be a substitution node or a nonterminal (see also Section 7).","Up to now we have assumed that the grammar does not assign the empty string as label to any of the leaves of the elementary trees.
