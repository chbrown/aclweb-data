It describes a scheme to detect complex verb predicates based on verb form subcategorization and grammatical knowledge. The extracted verb and tense information is presented and the role of different context factors is discussed. 1 Introduction A problem for translation is its context dependence. For every ambiguous word, the part of the context relevant for disambiguation must be identified (disambiguation strategy), and every word potentially occurring in this context must be assigned a bias for the translation decision (disambigt, ation information). Manual construction of disambiguation components is quite a chore. Fortunately, the task can be (partly) automated if the tables associating words with biases are learned from a corpus. Statistical approaches also support empirical evaluation of different disambiguation strategies. The paper studies disambiguation strategies for tense translation between German and English. The experiments are based on a corpus of appointment scheduling dialogues counting 150,281 German and 154,773 English word tokens aligned in 16,857 turns. The dialogues were recorded, transcribed and translated in the German national Verbmobil project that aims to develop a tri-lingual spoken language translation system. Tense is interesting, since it occurs in nearly every sentence. Tense can be ex- * This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework of the Verbmobil Project under Grant 01 IV 101 U.

I 'd like to myself weigh down I'd like to make a complaint. For translation, the discontinuous words must be amalgamated into single semantic items. Single words or pairs of lemma and part of speech tag (L-POS pairs) are not appropriate. To verify this claim, we aligned the L-POS pairs of the Verbmobil corpus using the completely language-independent method of Dagan et al. (1993). Below find the results for sehen 1 (see) in order of frequency and some frequent alignments for reflexive pronouns.","sehen:VVFIN be:VBZ (aussehen)","sehen:VVFIN do:VBP (do-support)","sehen:VVFIN have:VBP (perfect)","sehen:VVFIN see:VB 72 44 39 35 176 wir:PRF meet:VB (sich treffen) 33 wir:PRF we:PP 30 sich:PRF spell:VBN (sich schreiben) 16 ich:PRF forward:RP (sich freuen auf) 14 wir:PRF agree:VB (sich einigen) 13 ich:PRF myself:PP","1The prefix verb aus-sehen (look, be) is very frequent in the corpus, it often occurs in questions. Present sehen was frequently translated into perfect discover. 1183 3 Partial Parsing A full syntactic analysis of the sort of unrestricted spoken language text found in the Verbmobil corpus is still beyond reach. Hence, we took a partial parsing approach. 3.1 Complex Verb Predicates Both German and English exhibit complex verb predicates (CVPs), see (2). Every verb and verb particle belongs to such a CVP and there is only one CVP per clause. (2) He would not have called me up. The following two grammar fragments describe the relevant CVP syntax for English and German. Every auxiliary verb governs only one verb, so the CVP grammar is basically 2 regular and implementable with finite-state devices.","S --+ ... VP ... VP --+ hd:V (to) VP VP --+ hd:V ...

Thus, the set sub(v) of infinite verb forms for which an auxiliary verb v subcategorizes can be specified by hand. English and German auxiliary verbs govern the following verb forms. • infinitive e.g. will • to-infinitive (T) e.g. want • past participle (P) e.g. get • P V T e.g. have • present participle V P V T e.g. be • infinitive (I) e.g. miissen • zu-infinitive (Z) e.g. scheinen • perf.part, with haben (H) e.g. bekommen • H V I e.g. werden • H V I V Z e.g. haben • perf.part, with sein V H V I V Z e.g.sein 3.3 Transducers Two partial parsers (rather: transducers) are used to detect English and German CVPs and to translate them into predicate argument structures (verb chains).

Let m = [{mor(v) : Verb vii andn = I{sub(v): Verb v }[. Then the English CVP parser needs n + 1 states to encode which verb forms, if any, are expected by a preceding auxiliary verb. Verb particles are attached to the preceding verb. The German CVP parser is more complicated, but also more restrictive as all verbs in a verb complex (VC) must be adjacent. It operates in left-headed (S) or right-headed mode (VC). In VC-mode (i.e. inside VCs) the order of the verbs put on the output tape is reversed. In S-mode, n + 1 states again record the verb form expected by a preceding finite verb Vfi n-VC-mode is entered when an infinite verb form is encountered. A state in VC-mode records the verb form expected by Vii n (n + 1), the infinite verb form of the last verb encountered (rn), and the verb form expected by the VC verb, if the VC consists of only one verb (n + 1). So there are m • (n + 1) 2 states. As soon as a non-verb is encountered in VC-mode or the verb form of the previous verb does not fit the subcategorization requirements of the current verb, a test is per-formed to see if the verb form of the last verb 1184 i00000 I00000 i0000 I000 I00 i0 1","0 pluperf.preterite perfect I I I","past perfect ¢ past -~--- A future past -G--- /, x present perfect \"~( ...... /' \"x","present -~\"-',.\" ~ \"x future perfect -~7\" .\" \"..:~ ..... ...:'*.;, ....... .-?,: ....... .*., \",. : .- ~ ......... .-:.~,-a ., % ~."]},{"title":"........\"'\" ,\"\" ~'~","paragraphs":["/' . ,' • .........

Translation pairs approximate the verb semantics better than single source or target verbs. The full verb contexts of tenses can also be used for verb classifications. Aspectual classification: The aspect of a verb often depends on its reading and thus can be better extrapolated from an aligned corpus (e.g."]},{"title":"I am having a drink (trinken)).","paragraphs":["German allows punctual events in the present, English prefers present perfect (e.g."]},{"title":"sehen, finden, fest- stellen(discover, find, see), einfallen (occur, re- member); treffen, erwischen, sehen (meet)).","paragraphs":["World knowledge: In many cases perfect maps an event to its result state. finish forget denken an sich verabreden sich vertun settle a question 4.3 Subordinating =~ fertig sein =~ nicht mehr wissen =~ have in mind =~ have an appointment","be wrong","(the question) is settled Conjunctions Conjunctions often engender different mood. • In conditional clauses English past tenses usually denote present tenses. Interpreting hypothetical past as present increases performance by about 0.3 %. 1186 * In subjunctive environments logical future is expressed by English simple present. The verbs vorschlagen (suggest) (in 11 out of 14 cases) and sagen (say) (2/5) force simple present on verbs that normally prefer a translation to future. (6) I suggest that we meet on the tenth. .

The pertaining disambiguation information learned from the corpus is put into action in the symbolic transfer component of the Verbmobil system (Dorna and Emele, 1996). The only other empirical study of tense translation (Santos, 1994) I am aware of was conducted on a manually annotated Portuguese-English corpus (48,607 English, 43,492 Portuguese word tokens and 6,334 tense translation pairs). It neither gives results for all tenses nor considers disambiguation factors. Still, it acknowledges the surprising divergence of tense across languages and argues against the widely held belief that surface tenses can be mapped directly into an interlingual representation. Although the findings reported here support this conclusion, it should be noted that a bilingual corpus can only give one of several possible translations. References Ido Dagan, Kenneth W.
