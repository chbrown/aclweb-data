Computer experiments show that it has a correct rate of over 94% for tagging ambiguous words when a small Thai corpus with 22,311 ambiguous words is used for training. This result is better than any of the results obtained using the single-neuro taggers with fixed but different lengths of contexts, which indicates that the multi-neuro tagger can dynamically find a suitable length of contexts in tagging. 1 Introduction Words are often ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). POS tagging disambiguates them, i.e., it assigns to each word the correct POS in the context of the sentence. Several kinds of POS taggers using rule-based (e.g., Brill et al., 1990), statistical (e.g., Merialdo, 1994), memory-based (e.g., Daelemans, 1996), and neural network (e.g., Schmid, 1994) models have been proposed for some languages. The correct rate of tagging of these models has reached 95%, in part by using a very large amount of training data (e.g., 1,000,000 words in Schmid, 1994). For many other languages (e.g., Thai, which we deal with in this paper), however, the corpora have not been prepared and there is not a large amount of training data available. It is therefore important to construct a practical tagger using as few training data as possible.","In most of the statistical and neural network models proposed so far, the length of the contexts used for tagging is fixed and has to be selected empirically. In addition, all words in the input are regarded to have the same relevance in tagging. An ideal model would be one in which the length of the contexts can be automatically selected as needed in tagging and the words used in tagging can be given different relevances. A simple but effective solution is to introduce a multi-module tagger composed of multiple modules (basic taggers) with fixed but different lengths of contexts in the input and a selector (a selecting rule) to obtain the final answer. The tagger should also have a set of weights reflecting the different relevances of the input elements. If we construct such a multi-module tagger with statistical methods (e.g., n-gram models), however, the size of the n-gram table would be extremely large, as mentioned in Sec. 4.4. On the other hand, in memory-based models such as IGtree (Daelemans, 1996), the number of features used in tagging is actually variable, within the maximum length (i.e., the number of features spanning the tree), and the different relevances of the different features are taken into account in tagging. Tagging by this approach, however, may be computationally expensive if the maximum length is large. Actually, the maximum length was set at 4 in Daelemans's model, which can therefore be regarded as one using fixed length of contexts.","This paper presents a multi-neuro tagger that is constructed using multiple neural networks, all of which can be regarded as single-neuro taggers with fixed but different lengths of contexts in inputs. The tagger performs POS tagging in different lengths of contexts based on longest context priority. Given that the target word is more relevant than any of the words in its context and that the words in context may have different relevances in tagging, each 802 element of the input is weighted with information gains, i.e., numbers expressing the average amount of reduction of training set information entropy when the POSs of the element are known (Quinlan 1993). By using the trained results (weights) of the single-neuro taggers with short inputs as initial weights of those with long inputs, the training time for the latter ones can be greatly reduced and the cost to train a multi-neuro tagger is almost the same as that to train a single-neuro tagger. 2 POS Tagging Problems Since each input Thai text can be segmented into individual words that can be further tagged with all possible POSs using an electronic Thai dictionary, the POS tagging tasks can be regarded as a kind of POS disambiguation problem using contexts as follows:"]},{"title":"IPT : (iptdt,... , ipt-ll, ipt_t, ipt_rl,..., ipt_rr) OPT : POS_t,","paragraphs":["(1) where"]},{"title":"ipt_t","paragraphs":["is the element related to the possible POSs of the target word,"]},{"title":"(ipt_lt,..., ipt_ll)","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"(ipt_rl,...,ipt_rr)","paragraphs":["are the elements related to the contexts, i.e., the POSs of the words to the left and right of the target word, respectively, and"]},{"title":"POS_t","paragraphs":["is the correct POS of the target word in the contexts. 3 Information Gain Suppose each element,"]},{"title":"ipt_x (x = li,t,","paragraphs":["or rj), in (1) has a weight, w_z, which can be obtained using information theory as follows.

Neuro taggers also offer fast tagging compared to other models, although its training stage is longer. 5 Experimental Results The Thai corpus used in the computer experiments contains 10,452 sentences that are randomly divided into two sets: one with 8,322 sentences for training and another with 2,130 sentences for testing. The training and testing sets contain, respectively, 22,311 and 6,717 ambiguous words that serve as more than one POS and were used for training and testing. Because there are 47 types of POSs in Thai (Charoenporn et al., 1997), n in (6), (10), and (14) was set at 47. The single neuro-taggers are 3-layer neural networks whose input length, l(IPT) (=l+ l+r), is set to 3-7 and whose size is p x 2 a x n, where p = n x I(IPT). The multi-neuro tagger is constructed by five (i.e., rn = .5) single-neuro taggers, SNTi (i = 1,...,.5), in which l(IPTi) = 2 + i.","Table 1 shows that no matter whether the information gain (IG) was used or not, the multi-neuro tagger has a correct rate of over 94%, which is higher than that of any of the single-neuro taggers. This indicates that by using the multi-neuro tagger the length of the context need not be chosen empirically; it can be selected dynamically instead. If we focus on the single-neuro taggers with inputs greater than four, we can see that the taggers with information gain are superior to those without information gain. Note that the correct rates shown in the table were obtained when only counting the ambiguous words in the testing set. The correct rate of the multi-neuro tagger is 98.9% if all the words in the testing set (the ratio of ambiguous words was 0.19) are counted. Moreover, although the overall performance is not improved 805","Table 1.

The cost to train a multi-neuro tagger was almost the same as that to train a single-neuro tagger using new learning methods in which the trai~ed results (weights) of the previous taggers are used as initial weights for the latter ones. It was also shown that while the performance of tagging can be improved only slightly, the training time can be greatly reduced by using information gain to weight input elements.
