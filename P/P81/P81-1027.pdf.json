INTRODUCTION During thc past two decades, much work in linguistics has focused on sentences as minimal units of communication, and the project of rigorously characterizing the structure of sentences in natural language has met with some succcss. Not surprisingly, however, sentcnce grammars have contributed little to the analysis of discourse, Human discourse consists not just of words in sequences, hut of words in sequences directed by a speaker to an addressee, used to represent situations and to reveal intentions. Only when the addressee has apprehcndcd both these aspects of the message communicated can the message be interpretecL The analysis of discourse that emerges from Austin (1962), grounded in a theory of action, takes this view as ccntral, and thc concept of thc speech act follows naturally. An utterance may have a conventional meaning, but the interpretation of the actual meaning of the utterance as it is used in discourse depends on evaluating thc utterance in the context of the set of intentions which represcnt the illocutionary mode of its presentation. Put another way (paraphrasing Searle (1975:3)), the speaker's intention is to produce understanding, consisting of the knowledge of conditions on the speech act being pcrformed. If we are to take scrionsly Scarle's (1969:16) assertion that \"the unit of linguistic communication is not ... the symbol, word, or sentence, ... but rather thc production or the issuance of thc symbol, word or sentence in the performance of the spcech act.\" then wc should be able to find some formal method of characterizing speech acts in discourse. Unfortunately, linguists have too often employed speech acts as taxonomic convonicnces, as in Dora (1977). Labor and Fanshel (1977), and elscwhcre, without attempting to give anything more than a descriptive definition. Only in the atlJficial intelligencc literature, notably in the work of Allcn, Bruce, Cohcn, and Pcrrauh (e.g. Allen (1979), Bruce and Newman (1978). Cohen and Perrault (1979), Cohen (1978). Perrault, Allen, and Cohcn (1978)), does onc find an attempt to dcfinc spcech acts in terms of more gcncral processes, here specifically, opcrations on planning networks. 2. TYPES OF SPEECH ACTS A great problem for the computational linguist attempting to find a formal representation for speech acts is that thc set of speech acts does not map uniformly onto the set of sentences. In terms of \"guodncss of fit\" with sentences, sevcral types of speech acts can be described. One type, the so-called pcrformatives, including ASSERT, DECLARE, etc.. can be ¢ffected in a single utterance. But even some of these can undcrgo further decomposition. For example, assuming.that the usual felicity conditions hold (of. Searte (1969:54f0), both (1) and (2) below can count as an apology, though neither sentence in (2) alone has the effect which their combination achieves. (1) 1 apologize for what I did. (2) I did a terrible thing. I'm very sorry. In (2), the first sentence contributes to the effect of an apology only to the extent that an addressee can infer that it is intended as part of an apology. The second sentence, which makes overt the expression of contrition, also exp~sses the sinccrity which is prerequisite for a felicitouS apology. But its success, too. depends on an int'crence by tile addressec that it is intended as part of an apology. If the addressee cannot make that inference -- because, for cxamplc, the address¢c hctieves that the speakcr is speaking sarcastically -- the effect of the apology is lost not only for the second sentence, but for the first as well. In this case, the illocutionary effect APOI,OGIZE can be regarded as supra-scmcntial, though, as in (1). appropriate single scntences can be used to achieve its effect. There are other types of speech acts, however, that cannot bc performed in single utterances, but require several or even many utterances. For example. DEFEND (as in a lawyer's action on ~half of his client), REFUTE (as in polemical argumentation) and PROVE (as in demonstraung effccm from specific causcs) cannot be cffected as pcrfnrmatives: one cannot make a refutation by uttering the words. I refute ,V, as one might make an assertion by uttering thc words, I a.~ert X. One might wonder whether these supra-utterance modes should count as speech acts. Certainly. the term \"spcech act'\" has ffaditionally been used in reference to single sentences or to certain classes of non-scntenciaJ expressions which have single utterance indcpcndcncc in discourse (e.g. Hello). But consider again the traditional definition, paraphrasing Scarle (1969:4gff), a speech act is the use of an utterance directed at an addreasce in the scrvicc of a set of intentions, namely,","1.) thc intention to producc a certain illocutionary effect in the","addressee,","2.) the intention to produce this effect by getting the addressee to","recognize the intention to produce the effect, and","3.) thc retention to produce this recognition by means of the addrcsaee's","knowicdge of the rules governing the utterance. There is nothing in this characterization that requires that utterance be understood as scntencc. \"ll~e crucial point is that the utterance (of whatever length) serve the set of intentions represented by 1.) - 3.). A valid speech act can bc regarded as defining an illocntionary mode which is govcrnod by conventions which constrain thc sorts of interpretations that can be givcn to utterances which occur within that mode (including our judgmcnts un their appropriateness). Thcsc convcnUons also dcfinc the conditions that must be met for thc targct cffect to bc achieved, Thus for the utterance / will be home by noon to count as a promise (and not. say. as a prediction), it must bc viewed as an utterance iasucd in the illocutionary mode of promising, wllich not only defineS ccrtain wellformcdncss conditions on the utterance itself (making statemcnt,s in the past tense -- e.g. ! war home by noon .- impossible as direct speech act promises2), but also givcs the criteria which determine whether the act is successful (including the felicity conditions, e¢.). Similarly, for a series of utterances to count as a refutation, they must be seen as operating in the illocutionary mode of rcfutation, as for example, in thc text below:","(3) You have stated that 2 + 2 = 3. But take any two individual objects and any other two individual objectx and place them in a row. Then count them. say. from left to righL What do you get? Not 3 but 4. Therefore; 2 + 2 cannot equal 3. We cannot interpret any of these utterances accurately unless we recognize that each contributes to the achievement of a focused goal, viz. a refiJtadon. Once that intention is recognized, appropriatenc-ss and well-formodness conditions can be applied to the text; and the success of the act can he measured against the set of criteria which are relevant to refutations, including the usual felicity conditions, but also specific conditions on the production of factual evidence and the demonstration of contradiction. Following this new characterization of speech acts, yet another type can be described, operating not at the uttcrancc level, or the supra-utterancc level, but at the sub-uttcrancc level. As an illustration of the phcnomcnon involvcd, consider thc following uncxccptionable utterance: (4) 1 tom the guy at the door to watch out, but he wouldn't listen. The sccond refcrence to the guy of the first clause is made via the anaphoric pronoun he. But suppose, instead, a definite referring expression wcre used. Consider thc following: (5) I told the guy at the door to watch out, but the person wouldn't listen. The person is a distinctly odd corefcrent, and seems inappropriate 3. An examination of this context reveals that the only definite 4 referring expressions which caterer felicitously are pronomin;d epithets, such as the idiot, the fool• etc.; descriptions which can be given an interpretation as derogatives, such as the saphomore; and expressions whose literal interpretation contributes some sense of explanation to the situation being represented -- viz. thaL though warned, the guY at the door didn't heed the warning -- as in the deafmute. 113 It can be shown that the principle involved is a speech act-like phenomenon. First. it can be noted that the choice nn_.~t to use the unmarked corefercnt, he. signals that the speaker has some special intention in mind. Second. following a suggestion in Balinger (1977:7ff). it can be argued that a repeated definite description functions not only to refei\" but also to characterize the referent as having the sense of the definite description. Finatly. it can be shown that all the acceptable definite descriptions in this context can be interpreted uniformly as offering an explanation 5 for the failure to listen expressed by the second clause. Note that the choice of coreferent in the case of the use of a definite referring expre~on is not. stricdy speaking, lexically governed. Furfficrmorc. the use ot̀selectional features, as in Chomsky (1965) and more recent work ,on generative grammar, cannot consWaln the context for such a choice. In short, the problem is one of interpretation, and appropriateness is governed by the intention being served by the choice of the referring expression. Consider. then, an utterance such as the following: (6) [ told the guy al the door to watch out. but the idiot wouldn't listen. The difference between (4) and (6) is not me~ly one of different lexical items (he and the idiot). Rather. the use of 1he idiot makes (6) a more complex utterance than (4), involving an embedded speuch act. namely, a characterization whose purpose is to express an attitude and thereby (indirectly) offer explanation. 3. SITUATION SEMANTICS AND DISCOURSE If speech acts or speech act-h\"ke phenomena are found at many levels of discourse, and if it is not possible to give a syntactic definition of a speech act, how can the notion of speech acts be integrated into a formal, and in particular, a computational analysis of discou~? The natural alternative to a syntactic definition is a semantic one 6. and the approach to se, manties which offers the greatest promise in treating discourse is the situation semantics being developed at Stanford by Jon Barwise and John Perry (c£ Bat'wise (forthcoming). P, arwise and Perry (1980), Barwise and Perry (forthcoming a). and Barwise and Perry (forthcoming, b)). Briefly, this new semantics is informed by the notion that the actual world can be thought of as cunsisting of situations, which in turn consist of objects having properties and standing in relationships. Any actual situation is far too rich in detail to be captured by any finite process, so in practice,, perceptions of situations, beliefs about situations, natural language descriptions-of situations, cte.. are actually situation-typeS, which arc partial functions characterizing various types of situattons. (Cf. Barwise (198I) for a more complete discussion of this point.) [n situation semantics, scntences do not map directly to troth-values, but rather are understood as designating situation-types. Totally understanding a statement would entail that one t: able to derive a situation-type which includes all the objects, properties, and relationships represented in the statement. A series of statements in discourse can be viewed as creating, modifying, embellishing, or manipulating sots of situation-types. Some utterances invoke situation-types: some ac~ as functions taking whole situation-types as argumcnLs. Fur example, an initial act of reference coupled with some proposition about the referent can be seen as initiating the construction of a situation-type around the referent: an act of coreferencèwith some promotion, can be seen as adding a new property or relationship to an individual in an existing situation-type. The discourse situation, too, can be represented as a set of situation-types. initially containing at least the speaker, the addressee, and the mutual knowledge of speaker and addressee that they arc in a discourse situation. Any utterance which occurs exploits this diacouzse situation and cannot be' interpreted independently of it. The utterance itself, however, effects a cl~ange in the discourse ~ituation. as its interpretation is added. It is in representing the effect of the utterance that the theory of speech acts has application. The dynamic proecss of diseour~¢ can bc modelled as a step by sCep modification of the discourse situation, with each step taking the set of situation-types of the discourse situation, coupled with the interpretation of the utterance, to a new set of situation-types of the diseours¢ situation. There are many interesting details to this model which must be ignored in a paper of this scope, but several ob~rvations relevant to speech acts can be made, First. this model accommodates the distinction made by most speech act th¢orist.s between what a speaker says - the locutionary act -- and what a speaker intends to communicate (or means) - the illocutionary act -/. This distinction is rcpeated and coptt)red hcre in the treatment of the actual discourse as a oair of sets of situation-types. One gives the set of situation-types of the text (written or spoken) -- s t - and can be regarded as representing the Iocutionary aspect of the act. The other gives the set of situation-types of the diseoursc situation (including author and reader or speaker and addressee) -- s d - and can be regarded as representing the state of knowledge about the discourse -- including the information revealed by infcrring the intentions of the speaker - at the time the utterance is produced. The interpretation ot̀s t relative to s d, f (<s t. Sd>), giver a new set of situation-types of the diseourse situatiun. Sd'. The illocutionary act can be thought of as difference between s d' and s d. Second. this characterization of an illocutionary act is consonant with psychological features of actual discourse, in actual interaction, what the speaker says -- the Iocutionary act - is highly volatile: the exact words of an utterance more than a few seconds past may be lost forever. What remains is the effect of those words, in particular, as composed in longerterm memory. What is remembered represents the state achieved by the discourse, and that reflects directly what the addr~r, ee has inferrred about\" the speaker's intentions. Put another way. what becomes stored as memory represents what the addressee inferred about what the speaker meant by his utterance. 8 Third. one con regard the problem of interpreting the current status of the diseuurse as similar to the problem of deriving the current state in a S'l'RIPS-like system (ct'. I-'ikes and Nilsson (1971)): the correct version must be the result of the application of a series of operations, in correct order, to all previous states. The current set of situation-types of the discourse situation can be seen as representing the accumulation of the effects that have resulted from a series of discrete operations. 4. OPERATIONS ON SITUATION-TYPES","There are various ways that a word or phrase can count as an operation on","a situation-type. For example, an utterance or part of an utterance could (a) take a whole situation-type as an argument, or (b) introduce an object and a property, or (c) intrbduec two or more objects and a relationship, or (d) introd=~-c an object or a property or a relationship into an","existing situation-type.","(a) would apply to phrases like by the way, anyway, etc., which have the effect of shifung focus or \"clearing the slate\" for a new text fragment. Cases (b) and (c) ensure that the utterance or part of utterance, it\" text initial, conuLins enough information to enable a situation-type to be derived. Case (d) accounts for those instances where a situation-type is clearly established and a single word or reference can effect a change in the situation-type. For example, the name John (used constativeiy) at the beginning of an interaction cannot count as a operation on a situation-type, as no situation-type of the diseoum: text then exists, and the name John alone cannot create one. However. the name ./ok, at'ter a question, such as Who took my book~ can count as a operation, since it. together with the interpretation of the question, serves to introduce a new object and proposes into an existing situation-type. Returning to a sentence like (6) (rcpeated below), it is possible to see that, in fact. a series of operations.are involved in deriving the final situation-type of the text. (6) ! told the guy at the door to watch ouL but the idiot wouldn'! listen. The utterance corresponding to the first grammatical clause creates the situation-type in which tllcre is the guy at the door and the speaker and the relationship of the speaker having told the guy at the door to watch out. The word but can be viewed as function mapping situation-types into situatiun-types where a relationship or property somehow implicated in the first situation-type is \"shown explicitly not to hold in the derived situation-type. 'llm balance of the second clause modifies the situation-type so that the guy at the door now has the property both of having been told by the 114 spcakcr to watch out. and of having not listened, manifesting thc violation of supposed normative behavior. \"rhc fact that the guy at the door has been referred to as the idiot has added a further property, or characterization. The situation-type of the text at the end of the utterance of the second clause includcs the speaker with die property of having told the guy at the door to watch out and having judged him as an idiot for not listening, and the guy at the door who Ilad bccn told to watch out by the speaker but who did not listcn, and who has been judged to have behaved idiotically. (There actually are othcr relationships here. but a more eomplcto description adds nothing to the general point being illustrated.) In this case, then, there are at least three steps in thc \"semantic\" parsing of the utterance: thc initial creation of the situation-type (the first clause), the interpretation of but. and the modification of the initial situation-type to accommodate the information in the second clause. 5. SPEECH ACTS AS OPERATIONS ON SFI'IJATION-TYPF~S Thus far the relationship between situation-types and speech acts has not been made expliciL Recall that speech acts can be characterized acs having both an intentional component and some representation of the conditions which must be met for the speech act to have been suecessfully performed. But more importandy, a speech act is not successfully performed until the addressee recognizes that its performance was attempted: and that recognition effects a change in the relationship between the speaker and the addressee. This change in relationship can be regarded as an effect of an operation on the set of situation-types of the discourse situation (not of the text). But a speech act. even if clearly understood as intended, is not successful unless it effects specific changes in the set of situation-types of the text, as well. Therefore. speech acts can be thought of as the effects of the application of one or more inference enabling functions to the pair of sets of situation-types giving the model of the discourse (f (<s t. Sd>)). It is possible to use situation-typeS as the basis of a definition of speech acts by requin.ng that speech acts be the result of the application of an inference enabling function to an utterance in a discourse situation such that the derived situation-typc confi)rms to one of a (finite) number of speech act-types. In othcr words, fur an utterance or a series of utteranccs to count as a speech act. the utterance or utterances must minimally","(i) perform an operation on a situation-type, and","(ii) derive a situation-type which is defined (for speaker and addressee)","as the legitimate end state of a speech act, This means that the rules governing the form of speech acts are actually rules specifying the relationships that must obtain in the situation-type which would result from the successful performance of the speech act. In short, this allows us to view speech acts as being driven by certain situation-types as goals. Simpler spcech act-types, such as performativcs, correspond neatly to various unary operations on situation-types. An asscrtion operates on the situation-type of the text by introducing objects and properties or relationships that correspond to the proposition of the assertion. But it also' introduces the speaker in an ASSERT relationship to the proposition. And given the constrainLs on truly felicitous assertions, this would also introduce the implicature that the speaker believes the proposition. In particular. following the taxonomy and characterization of illocotionary acts in II~h and Hamish (1979:39ff). an assertion has the effect, for any speaker. S. and any propositiun, P, of cre;,ting the following situation-type: s (believe. S. P) = I By accepting tile assertion -- different from accepting the truth of the assertion -- thc addressee acknowledges that the above situation-type is added to the set of situation-types giving the discourse situation. A complete deseription of the speech act-type ASSERT would consist of the fullowing set of situation-types:","ASSERT P Sl: s s(t~, S."]},{"title":"P)","paragraphs":["= I s2: s (believe. S. P) = I s 1, s 2 arc in s d' Sub-utterance speech acts can be accounted for, now. by vicwing the situation-types of the text which thcy achieve as being dependent on or coincident with the situation-types achicved by the whole of the utterance in which they are cmbeddcd. Of course, there must be an accompanying operation on the situation-type of the discourse situation rcpresenting the effect of the perceived intention to achieve the sub-uteranee speech act -- as in the marked choice of a definite referring expression instead of a simple pronoun, as in (6). Supra-utterance speech acts can also be captured in this framework. A speech act like REFUTE, for example, cannot be defined in terms of any specifiable number of steps, or any specifiable ordering of operations. Its only possible definition is in terms of a final state in which all the conditions on refutation have been satisfied. In terms of situation semantics, this corresponds to a set of situation-types -- albeit very complex -- in which all the nec~sary relationships hold. Since such complex sets of situation-types represent the accumulated effects of all the operations which have occurred, without representing the order of application of those operations, there is nothing in the definition of REFUTE that requires that a specific order of operations be carded our Someone might refi~te an argument very efficiently: someone else. only after a series of false starts or after the introduction of numerous irrelevancies. The end result would be, and should be. the same. from a speech act-theoretic point of view. This characterization of speech acts, as the end states of a derivation on a sequence of situation typeS, explains naturally some of the culture-relative characteristics of supra-utterance speech acts. To take but one example, it has been noted in Taylor (1971) that in agrarian JapaneSe society there is no notion that corresponds to NEGOTIATE. Clearly. given the manifest success of urban Japanese u} obtain lucrative foreign contracts, the absence of such a spcech act-type among rural Japanese cannot be attributed to facts of the Japanese language. What we could say, given the approach here. is that the set of situation-types which is the cnd-stata of NEGOTIATE is not. par of the inventory of distinguished speech act-types in the rural Japanese \"diseou rsc dialecL\" 6. SOME EXAMPI,F.S OF SPEECH ACT-TYPES The fullnwing sets of situatinn-types can serve as examples of the s~tes achieved by several simple, eonstativc speech act-types. As before, the taxonomic features are based on Bach and Harnish (1979), with speaker, S, addressee(s), A, and proposition, P.","INFORM P Sl: s ~(.~.~, S, P) = 1 s2: s (believe, S, P) = 1 s3: s (believe, A, P) = 1 s 1, s 2, s 3 are in s d'","REFRACT P Sl: s ~(_~t, S, P) = I s2: s (believe, S, NOT P) = 1 s3: s (belier.c, S, P) = 1 s 2 is in s d s I. s 3 are in s d'","CONTRADICT P sl: s ~(.~£, S, NOT P) = 1 s2: s (belicyc, S, NOT P) = 1 s3: s (believe, A, P) = 1 s 3 is in s d and s d' s 1, s 2 are in s d' The characterization of speech acts presentod here focuses on end-state conditions, hut clearly the starting statcs (specifically. the set of situation-types of the discourse situation and of the text from which an end-state is to be achieved) also affect speech act performance. A more complete specification of the initial and final states of the discourse pair of sets of situation-types for a variety of speech act-types, involving an elaboration of the role of inference cnahling functions and other constraints on the interpretation of uRerances~ is given in L:vans (in progress). 115 FOOTNOTES: I.
