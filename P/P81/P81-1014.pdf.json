This paper describes a technique for basing the dictionary directly on the semantic abstraction network used for the domain knowledge itself, taking advantage of the inheritance and specialization machanisms of a network formalism such as r,L-ON~ The technique creates eonsidcrable economies of scale, and makes possible the automatic description of individual objects according to their position in the semantic net. Furthermore, because the process of deciding what properties to use in an object's description is now given over to a common procedure, we can write general-purpose rules to, for example, avoid redundancy or grammatically awkward constructionS.","Regardless of its design, every system for natural !anguage production begins by selecting objects and relations from the speaker's internal model of the world, and proceeds by choosing an English phrase to describe each selected item, combining them according to the properties of the phrases and the constraints of the language's grammar and rhetoric. TO do this, the system must have a data base of some sort, in which the objects it will talk about are somewhow associated with the appropriate word or phrase (or with procedures that will construct them). 1 will refer to such a data base as a dictionary.","Evcry production system has a dictionary in one form or another, and its compilation is probably the single most tedious job that the human designer must perform. In the past. typically every object and relation has been given its own individual \"lex\" property with the literal phrase to be used; no attempt was made to share criteria or sub-phrases between properties; and there was a tacit a~umtion that the phrase would have the right form and content in any of the contexts that the object will be mentioned. (For a review of this literature, see r~a .) However, dictionaries built in this way become increasingly harder to maintain as programs become larger and their discourse more sophisticated. We would like instead some way to de the extention of the dictionary direcdy to the extention of the program's knowledge base; then, as the knowledge base expands the dictionary will expand with it with only a minimum of additional cffort.","This paper describes a technique for adapting a semantic abstraction hierarchy of thc sort providcd by ~d~-ONE ~:1.] to function directly as a dictionary for my production system MUMIII.I~ [,q'~. . Its goal is largely expositional in the sense that while the technique is fully spocificd and proto-types have been run, many implementation questions remain to be explored and it is thus premature to prescnt it as a polished system for others to use; instead, this paper is intended as a presentation of the issues--potcntial economicw---that the technique is addressing. In particular, given the intimate relationship between the choice of architecture in the network formalism used and the ability uf the dictionary to incorporate linguistically useful generalizations and utilities, this presentation may suggest additional criteria for networ k design, namely to make it easier to talk about the objects the network","The basic idea of \"piggybacking\" the dictionary onto the speaker's regular semantic net can be illustrated very simply: Consider the KL.ONE network in figure one, a fragment taken from a conceptual taxonomy for augmented transition nets (given in [klune]). The dictionary will provide the means to describe individual concepts (filled ellipses) on the basis of their links to generic concepts lempty ellipses) and their functional roles (squar~s), as shown there for the individual concept \"C205\". The default English description of C205 (i.e. \"the jump arc fi'om S/NP to S/DCL\") is created recursiveiy from dL.~riptions of the three network relations that C205 participates in: its \"supercuneept\" link to the concept \"jump-are\". and its two role-value relations: \"source-stateIC205)=S/NP\" and \"next-state(C205)=S/t:~Ct.\". Intuitively. we want to associate each of the network objects with an English phrase: the concept \"art'\" with the word \"art\"', the \"source-state\" role relation with the phrase \"C205 comes from S/NF\" (note the embedded references), and so on. The machinery that actually brings about this ~sociation is, of course, much more elaborate, involving three different recta-level networks describing the whole of the original, \"domain\" network, as well as an explicit representation of the English grammar (i.e. it Ls itsclf expressed in rd,-oN~).","role links ~ • ~ test ~ action value-.restriction links"]},{"title":"IL_","paragraphs":["value links \"The jump arc from S./NP to S/DCL\" Figure One: the speaker's original network","What does this rather expensive I computational machinery purchase?

With the relation categorized, we can associated it with an entry in the dictionary network, in this ease an instance of a \"basic-clause\" (i.e. one without any adjuncts or rom-transfomaations). We now have determined a mapping from the entries for the components of the original domain relation to linguistic roles within a clause and have. in effect, created the relation's entry which we could then compile for efficiency.","There is much more to be said about how the \"embedded entries\" can be controlled, how, for example, the planner can arrange to say either \"C205 goes to S/DCL\" or \"There is a jump arc going to S/DCL\" by dynamically specializing the description of the clause, however it would be taking us too far afield: the interested reader is referred to [thesisl. The point to be made here is just that the writer of the dictionary has an option either to write specific dictionary entries for domain relations, or to leave them to general \"macro entries\" that will build them out of the entries for the objects involved as just sketched. Using the macro entries of course meau that less effort v, ill be needed over all, but using specific entries permits one to rake advantage of special idioms or variable phrases that are either not productive enough or not easy enough to pick out in a standard recta-level description of the domain network to be worth writing macro entries for. A simple example would be a special entry for when one plans to describe an arc in terms of both its source and its nexi states: in this case there is a nice compaction available by using die verb \"connect\" in a single clause (instead of one clause for each role). Since the ~I,-O~F. formalism has no transparent means of optionally bundling two roles into one, this compound rcladon has to be given its own dictionary entry by hand. Making colnbinations linguistically","Up to this point, we have been looking at associations between \"organic\" objects or relations in the domain network and their dictionary entries for production. It is often the case however, that the speech planner will want to talk about combinations of objects or complex relations that have been assembled just for the occasion of one conversation and have no natural counterpart within the regular domain network. In a case like this there wuuld not already be an entry in the dictionary for the new relation; however, in most eases we can still produce an integrated phrase by looking at how the components of the new relation can combine linguistically.","These linguistic combinations are not so much the provence of the dictionary as of my linguistic realization component. MuMnI,E. ~.IUSIBLE has the ability to perform what in the early days of transformational generative grammar were referred to as \"gcneraliT.ed transformations\": the combining of two or more phrases into a single phrase on the basis of their linguistic descriptions. We have an example of this in the original example of the default description ofC205 as \"the jump arc fram S/N P to S/DC L\". This phrase was produced by having the default planner construct an expression indicating which network relations to combine (or more precisely, which phrases to combine, the phrases being taken from the entries of the relations), and then pass the expression to MI.MnLE which produces the \"compound\" phrase on the basis of the linguistic description of the argument phrases. The expression would look roughly like this: 1","(describe C205 as (and [np Ihejumparcl [clau:~ C205 [rcdueable-vp Comes from S/NP ] } [clause C205 [rcducable'~p goes lo S/OCL I ] MUMBLE's task is the production of an object description front the raw material of a noun phrase and two clauses. To do this, it will have to match die three phrases against one of its known linguistic combination patterns, just as the individual concept, role, and value were matched by a pattern from the Itt,.ONl.: representation formalism. In this case, it characterizes the trio as combinable through the adjunction of. the two clauses to the noun phrase as qualifiers. Additionally. the rhetorical label \"rcdueable-vp\" in the clauses indicates that their verbs can be omitted without losing significant 1.
