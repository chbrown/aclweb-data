Watson Reseorch Center","PO BOX 218 Yorktown Heights, NQW York 10598 The Transformatlonal question Answering (TqA) system was developed over a period of time beginning in the early part of the last decade and continuing to the present. Its syntactic component is a transformational grammar parser [1, 2, ~], and its semantic Gomponqnt is a Knuth attribute grammor [~, 5]. The combination of these components providQs sufficiQnt generality, conveniQnga, and efficiency to implement a broad range of linguistic models; in addition to a wide spectrum of transformational grammars, Gilder-type phrase structure grammar [6] and lexigal functional grammar [7] systems appear to be cases in point, for example. The Particular grammar Nhich was, in fact, developed, however, was closest tO those of the genQrative semantics variety of trsnsformationel grammar; both the underlying structures assigned to sQntences and the transformations employed to effect that assignmQnt traced their origins to the generative semantics model. The system ~orks by finding the undQrlying structures corresponding tO English queries through the use of the transformational parsing facility. Those underlying structures are then translated to logical forms in a domain relationol calculus by the Knuth attribute grammar component. Evaluation of logical forms with respect to a given data base completes the question-answering process. Our first logical form evaluator took the form of a toy implementation of a relational data base system in LISP. We soon reelaced the low level tuple retrieval facilities of this implementation with the RSS (Relational StorogQ System) portion of the IBM System R [8], This version of logicol form evoluation was the one employed in the field testing to be dQscribed. In a more recent version of the system, however, it has been replacod by a translation of logical forms, first to equivalent logical forms in a set domain relational calculus and then to appropriate expressions in the 5el language, SystQm RIs high level query language. The first data base to which the system was applied was one concerning business statistics such as the sales, earnings, number of employees, etc. of 60 large companies over a five-year Period. This was a toy data base, to be sure, but it was useful tO US in developing our System. A later dota base contained the basic land identification records of about 10,000 parcels of land in a city nQar our research center. It WaS developed for use by members of the city planning departmQnt and (less frequently) other departments to answQr questions concerning the information in that file. Our purpose in making the 1system available to those city employees was, of course, to provide access to o data base of real interest to a group of users and to fiQld test our system by evaluating their usa of it. Accordingly, thQ TqA system was tailored to the land usa file oppltcation and installed at City Hall at the and of 1977. It remained there during 1978 and 1979, during which time it WaS used intormittently as thQ need arose for ad hoc cuQry to supplement thQ report generation programs that were already available for the extraction of information. Total usage of the system Was less than we had expected would be the case when We made the decision to proceed with this application. This resulted from a number of factors, including a change in mission for the planning department, a reduction in the number of people in that dQpartment, a decision tO rebuild the office space during the period Of usage, and a degree of obsolescence of the data due to the length of time between uodatQS (which were to have been supplied by the planning department). During 1978 a total of 788 queries were addressed to the system, and during 1979 the total ~as 210. Damerau [9] giVQS thQ distribution of these quQries by month, and he alSO breaks thQm down by month into a number of different ¢atQgories. DamQPaU'S report of the gross performance statistics for the year 197~, ~nd a similar, as yet unpublished report of his for 1979, contain a WQaith of data that I will not attempt to include in this brief note. Even though his reports contain a large quantity of statistical performance data, honorer, there are a lot of important observations which can only bQ made from a detailed analysis of the day-by-day transcript of system usage. An analysis of sequences of related ouastions is a case in point as is an analysis of the attempts of users to phrase nQW queriQ5 in response tO failure of the system to procoss certain SQntances. A papQr in preperatlon by Plath is concerned with treating thesQ end similar issues with the care and detail which they ~arrsnto Time and SpaCQ considerations limit my contrlbution in this note tO just highlighting SOmQ of the major findings of DamQrau and Plath. Consider first a summary of the 1978 statistics:","Total Queries 788","TQrmination Conditions: Completed (AnswQr rQachQd) $13 65.1 Aborted (System crash, QtC.) 53 6.7 USQr Cancelled 21 2.7 Program Error 39 ;.9 Parsing Failure 1~7 18.7 Unknown IS 1.9","OthQr ReIQvant Events: User Comment 96 12.2 OpQrator Message qS S.7 USQP Message 11 1.~ Word not in Laxicon 119 15.1 Lexical Choice RQsOlvQd by User 119 15.1 '~Nothing in Data Base\" AnswQr 61 7.7 The pQrcQntage of successfully processed sQntQnCQS iS consistent with but slightly smallQr than that of such other invQstigators as Woods ClO], Bellard and Bierman [11], and Hershman Qt al [12]. Extreme care should bQ QxercisQd in intQrprQting any such OVQra~l numbers, however, and Qvan more garQ must be qxercisQd in comparing numbers from different studies. LQt me just mention a few considerations that must be keot in mind in interpreting the TqA results above. First of a11, our users t purposes varied tremendously from day to day and even from question to question, On one occasion, for QxamplQp a session might bQ devoted to a serious attempt to extract data needed for a federal grant proposal, and either the query comolexity might bQ relatively limited so as to minimize the changQ of error, or else the questions might be essentially repetitions of the some query, with minor variations to select different data. On another occasion, however, thQ session might be a demonstration, or i serious attempt to dQtermine th Q limits of the systemVs understanding capability, or even a frivolous OUQry tO Satisfy the user's curiosity as to the computorls response to a question outside its area of expertise. (One of our failurQs was the sQntence, \"Who killed C~ck Robin?\".) Our users varied widely in terms of their familiarity with the contents of the data base. Hone kne. anything abou~ the internal organization of information (e.g. ho, the data was arranged into relations), but some had good knowledge of just what kind of data was stored, some had limltQd knowledgQ, and some had no knowledge and even false expQctations as to what knowZQdge was included in the data base. In addition, thQy varied widely with respect to the amount of prior experiQnca they had with the systQm. Initially we provided no formal trolning in the use of the system, but some users acquired significant knowledge of the system through its sustalnQd use over a period of t~me. Something OVQr half of the total usage was mode by the individuol from the plannlng department who was responsiblQ for starting the system up and shutting it down each day. Usage was also made by other members of the planning department, bv members of OthQr departments, and by summer interns. %t should al~o be noted that the TeA system itself did not stay constant over the two-year period of tasting. AS problems werQ encountered, modifications werQ madQ tO many components of the system. %n particular, the lexicon, grammar, semantic interpretation fuzes (attribute grammar rules), and logical form evaluation functions all QVOlved OVer thQ period ~n question (continuously, ~ut at a decrQasing rata). The porsQr and the sQmantic interpreter ghonged little, if any. A rerun of all sentences, using thQ version of the grammar thor existed at the conclusion of thQ field test arogram showed that 50 ~ of thQ sentences which previously failed ware processed correctly. This is impressive when it iS observed that a large percentage of the rQmalning ~0 ~ constitute sQntQncos which are either ungrammatical (SOmQtimes sufficiently tO prQclude human comprehension) or QISQ contain references to sQmantic concepts OUtside OUr universe of (land use) discourse. On the whole, our USQrS indicated they were satisfied with the performance of thQ system. In a conferQnce with them 8t one point during the field test, they indicated thQy would prefer us to spQnd our time bringing more of thQir files on linQ (Q.g., the zoning board of aPPQalS file) rather than to spend more time 35 providing additional syntactic and associated semantic capability. Those instances whQro an unsuccessful query was followed uP by attempts to rephrase the query SO as to permit its processing showQd few instances where success was not achieved within three attempts. This data is obscured somewhat by the fact that users called us on • few occasions to get advice as to ho~ to record I query. On other occasions the terminal mQsSagQ facility WaS invoked for the PUrpose of obtaining advice, and this lof~ • record in our automatic logging facility. That facility preserved a record of aLL traffic between the uservs terminal, the computer, and our own monitoring terminal (which ~aS not always turned on or attended), and it included • time stamp for every Line displayed on the users f terminaL. A word is in order on tho real time performance of the system and on the amount of CPU time required. Oamerau [9] includes a chart which shows ham many queries required a given number of minutes of real timQ fOP complete processing. The total elapsed time for • query Was typically around three minutes (58X of the sentences ware processed in four minutes or Less). Slapsad time depended primarily on machine Load and user behavior at the terminal. The computer on ~hich the system operated was an IBM System 370/168 with an attached processor, ~ megabytes of memory and extensive peripheral storage, operating under the VR/370 operating system. There were typically in excess of ZOO users competing for PISCUPCeS on the system at the times when the TQA system was running during the L978-1979 field tests. Besides queuing for the CPU and memcry, this system dQVQLOpQd queues fop the IBM 3850 MaSS Storage System, on which tho TqA data base ~ao stored. Users had no complaint: about reel time response, but this may have been due to their Procedure for handling ad hoc quQries prior to the installation of the Tea system. That procedure caLLed for ad hoc queries to be coded in RPG by members Of the data Processing department, and the turnaround time was • matter of days rathQr than minutes. It is likely that the real time performance of the system caused users sometimes to look up data about a specific parcel in a hard copy printout rather than giving it to the system. ~ueries were most often of the type requiring statistical processing of a set of parcels or of the type requiring a search for the parcel or parcels that satisfied given search criteria. The CPU requirements of the system, broken da~n into a number Of categories, arc aLsc plotted by Oamereu [9]. The typical time tO process a sentenca l~ss ten seconds, but sentences with Large data base retrieval demands took up tO i minute. System hardware improvements made subsequent to the 1778-1777 field tests havQ cut this processing time approximately in half. Throughout our davaLopment of the TqA system, ¢onsideratton~ of speed have been secondary. He have idQntified meny areas in which racodt~g should produce I dramatic incrqasm in speed, but thio has been assigned • lesser priority than basic QnhantQmont of the SyStem and the coverage Of [ngLish provided through its transformational gremsar. Our experiment has sho~n that ~|aLd tasting of question answering systems provides certain information that is not otherwise available. The day to day usage of the system ~S different in many respects fPom usage that results from controLLed, but inevitably someNhat artificial, experiments. He did not influence our users by the wording of problems posed to them because wa gave them no problems; their requests for information were solely for their own purposes. Our sample queries that wa initially exhibited to city employees to indicate the system ~lO reedy to ba tasted wePe invariably greeted with mirth, due to the improbability that anyone would ~snt to know the"]},{"title":"information","paragraphs":["requested. (They poked fop Pmassurance that the system would also answer wreaLw questions). ~a alSO obtained valuable information on such matters aS haw Long USers persist in rephrasing queries when they encounter difficulties Of variouskinds, ho~ succaosful they are in correcting errors, and what neM errors are Likely to be lade while Correcting initial errors. ~ hope to discuss these and ether matters in more detail in the oral version of this paper. Valuable as our f|ald taste ere, they cannot provide certain information that must ba obtained from controlled experiments. Accordingly, ~a hops tO conduct a comparison of Tea with several formal query Languages in the neap fUtUrO, using the Latest enhanced version of the system and carefully controlling such factors as user training and problem stateloQnt. After teaching a course in data base management systems at queens CcLLege and the Pratt Institute, end after running informal axpQriments there comparing students f relative success in uoing TqA, ALPHA, relational algebra, qBE, and SEQUEL, I am convinced that even for educated, prsgralmlinQ-oriantad users with I fair amount Of experience in learning i formalL query Languaca, the Tea sys~ell offers.significant advantages over formal query ~anguages in retrieving data quickly and correctly. This remains to ba proved (or disproved) by conducting appropriate formal experiments.","[1J Plath, W.
