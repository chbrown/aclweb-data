Alien","Com purer Science 1)epartmen t University of Rochester Rochester, NY 14627 Ahstract","This paper considers what types of knowledge one must possess in order to reason about actions. Rather than concentrating on how actions are performed, as is done in the problem-solving literature, it examines the set of conditions under which an action can be said to have occurred. In other words, if one is told that action A occurred, what can be inferred about the state of the world? In particular, if the representation can define such conditions, it must have good models of time, belief, and intention. This paper discusses these issues and suggests a formalism in which general actions and events can be defined. Throughout, the action of hiding a book from someone is used as a motivating example. I. Introductio,","This paper suggests a formulation of events and actions that seems powerful enough to define a wide range of event and action verbs in English. This problem is interesting for two reasons• The first is that such a model is necessary to express the meaning of many sentences. The second is to analyze the language production and comprehension processes themselves as purposeful action. This was suggested some time ago by Bruce [1975] and Schmidt [1975]. Detailed proposals have been implemented recently for some aspects of language production [Cohen, 1978] and comprehension [Alien. 1979]. As interest in these methods grows (e.g., see [Grosz, 1979; Brachman, 1979]). the inadequacy of existing action models becomes increasingly obvious.","The formalism for actions used in most natural language understanding systems is based on case grammar. Each action is represented by a set of assertions about the","• semantic roles the noun phrases play with respect to the verb. Such a tbrmalism is a start, but does not explain how to represent what an action actually signifies. If one is told that a certain action occurred, what does one know about how the world changed (or didn't change!). This paper attempts to answer this question by oudining a temporal logic in which the occurrence of actions can be tied to descriptions of the world over time.","One possibility for such a mechanism is found in the work on problem-solving systems (e.g. [I:ikes and Nilsson, 197]; Sacerdoti, 1975]), which suggests one common formulation of action. An acuon is a function from one world state to a succeeding world state and is described by a set of prerequisites and effects, or by decomposition into more primitive actions. While this model is extremely useful for modeling physical actions by a single actor, it does not cover a large class of actions describable in I-ngiish. [:or instance, many actions seemingly describe nml-activity (e.g. standing still), or acting in some nonspecified manner to preserve a state (e.g. preventing your televismn set from being stolen). Furthermore, many action descriptions appear to be a composition of simpler actions that are simultaneously executed. For instance,","\"Walking to the store while juggling three bails\"","seems to be composed of the actions of \"walking to the store and \"juggling three bails.\"","It is not clear how such an action could be defined from the two simpler actions if we view actions as functions from one state to another.","The approach suggested here models events simply as partial descriptions of the world over some Lime interval. Actions are then defined as a subclass of events that involve agents. Thus, it is simple to combine two actions into a new action, The new description simply consists of the two simpler descriptions hglding over the same interval","The notions of prerequisite, result, and methods of performing actions will not arise in this study. While they are iraportant for reasoning about how to attain goals, they don't play an explicit role in defining when an action can be said to have occurred. To make this point clear, consider the simple action of turning on a light.","There are few physical activities that are a necessary part of performing this action, Depending on the context, vastly different patterns or\" behavior can be classified as the same action, l;or example, turning on a light usually involves Hipping a light switch, but in some circumstances it may involve tightening the light bulb (in the basement). or hitting the wail (m an old house). Although we have knowledge about how the action can be pertbrmed, this does nol define what the action is. The key defining characteristic of turning on the light seems to be that the agent is performing some activity which will cause the light, which is off when the action starts, to become on when the action ends. The importance of this observation is that we could recognize an observed pattern of activity as \"turning on the light\" even if we had never seen or thought about that pattern previously.","The model described here is in many ways similar to that of Jackendoff [1976]. He provides a classification of event verbs that includes verbs of change (GO verbs) and verbs that assert a state remaining constant over an interval of time (STAY verbs), and defines a representation of action verbs of both typesby introducing the notion of agentive causality and permission. However, Jackendoff does not consider in detail how specific actions might be precisely defined with respect to a world model.","The next two sections of this paper will introduce the temporal logic and then define the framework for defining events and actions. To be as precise as possible, I have remained within the notation of the first order predicate calculus• Once the various concepts are precisely defined, the next necessary step in this work is to define a computaUonally feasible representation and inference process, Some of this work has already been done. For example, a computational model of the temporal logic can be found in Allen [198.1]• Other areas axe currently under investigation. 7'7 /\"","The final section demonstrates the generality of the approach by analyzing the action of hiding a book from someone. In this study, various other important conceptual entities such as belief, intention, and causality are briefly discussed. Finally, a definition of.what it means to hide something is presented using these tools. 2. A Temporal l,ogie","Before we can characterize events and actions, we need to specify a temporal logic. The logic described here is based on temporal intervals. Events that appear to refer to a point in time (i.e., finishing a race) are considered to be implicitly referring to another event's beginning or ending. Thus the only time points we will see will be the endpoints of intervals.","The logic is a typed first order predicate calculus, in which the terms fall into the following three broad categories: - terms of type"]},{"title":"TIME-INTERVAL","paragraphs":["denodng time intervals; terms of type"]},{"title":"PROPERTY,","paragraphs":["denoting descriptions that can hold or not hold during a particular time; and terms corresponding to objects in the domain.

What's Necessary to Hide?","The remainder of this paper applies the above formalism to the analysis of the action of hiding a book from someone. Along the way, we shall need to introduce some new representational tools for the notions of belief, intention, and causality,","The definition of hiding a book should be independent of any method by which the action was performed, for, depending on the context, the actor could hide a book in many different ways. For instance, the actor could - put the book behind a desk,","- stand between the book and the other agent while they are in the same room, or","- call a friend Y and get her or him to do one of the above.","Furthermore, the actor might hide ).he book by simply not doing something s/he intended to do. I:or example, assume Sam is planning to go to lunch with Carole after picking Carole up at Carole's office, if, on the way out of Sam's office, Sam decides not to take his coat because he doesn't want Carole to see it, then Sam has hidden the coat from Carole. Of course, it is crucial here that Sam believed that he normally would have taken the coat. Sam couldn't have hidden his coat by forgetting to bring it.","This example brings up a few key points that may not be noticed from the first three examples. First' Sam must have intended to hide the coat. Without this intention (i.e., in the forgetting case), no such action occurs. Second, Sam must have believed that it was likely that Carole would see the coat in the future course of events. Finally, Sam must have acted in such a way that he then believed that Carole would not see the coat in the future course of events. Of course, in this case, the action Sam performed was \"not bringing the coat,\" which would normally not be considered an action unless it was intentionally not done.","I claim that these three conditions provide a reasonably accurate definition of what it means to hide something. They certainly cover the four examples presented above.

I will assume that belief is a modal operator and is described by a set of axioms along the [iu~ of Hintikka [I962].

The notion of wanting indicates that the actor finds the action desirable given the alternatives. This notion appears impossible to axiomatize as wants do not appear to be rational (e.g. Hare []97]]). However, by adding the belief that the action will occur into the notion of intention, we ensure that intentions must be at least as consistent as beliefs.","Actions may be performed intentionally or unintentionally. For example, consider the action of breaking a window. Inferring intentionality from observed action is a crucial ability needed in order to communicate and cooperate with other agents. While it is difficult to express a logical connection between action and intention, one can identify pragmatic or plausible inferences that can be used in a computational model (see [Allen, 1979]).","With these tools, we can attempt a more precise definition of hiding.

For instance, you can't hide something by performing an action after ,,he hiding is supposed to be done. 8O Conclusion","I have introduced a representation for events and actions that is based on an interval-based temporal logic. This model is sufficiently powerful to describe events and actions that involve change, as well as those that involve maintaining a state. In addition, the model readily allows the composition and modification of events and actions.","In order to demonstrate the power of the model, the action of hiding was examined in detail. This forced the introduction of the notions of belief, intention, and causality. While this paper does not suggest any breakthroughs in representing these three concepts, it does suggest how they should interact with the notions of time, event, and action.","At present, this action model is being extended so that reasoning about performing actions can be modeled.
