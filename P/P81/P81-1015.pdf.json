Abstract This paper presents an analysis of analogies based on observations of oatural conversations. People's spontaneous use of analogies provides Inslg~t into their implicit evaluation procedures for analogies. The treatment here, therefore, reveals aspects of analogical processing that is somewhat more difficult to see in an experimental context. The work involves explicit treatment of the discourse context in which analogy occurs. A major focus here is the formalization of the effects of analogy on discourse development. There is much rule-llke behavior in this process, both in underlying thematic development of the discourse and in the surface lir~ulstlc forms used in this development. Both these forms of regular behavior are discussed in terms of a hierarchical structurin6 of a discourse into distinct, but related and linked, context spaces. 1 Introduction People's use of analogies in conversation reveals a rich set of processing strategies. Consider the following example. A: B: C: I. I think if you're going to marry someone in the 2. Hindu tradition, you have to - Well, you - They 3. say you give money to the family, to the glrl, 4. but in essence, you actually buy her. 5. It's the same in the Western tradition. You 6. know, you see these greasy fat millionaires going 7. around with film stars, right? They've 8. essentially bought them by their status (?money). 9. HO, but, there, the woman is selllng herself. 10. In these societies, the woman isn't selling 11. herself, her parents are selling her. There are several interesting things happening in this exchange. For example, notice that the analogy is argued and discussed by the conversants, and that in the arEumentatlon C uses the close discourse deictlo \"these\" tO refer to the in~tlatlng subject of the a~alogy, and that she uses the far discourse delctlo \"there\" to refer to the linearly closer analogous utterances. In addition, notice that C bases her rejection ca a non-correspondence of relations effectlng the relation claimed constant between the two domains (women hei~ sold). She does not simply pick any arbitrary non-correspondence between the two domains. In the body of this paper, I address and develop these types of phenomena accompanying analogies in naturally ongoing discourse. The body of the paper is divided into four sections. First a theoretic framework for discourse is presented. This is followed by some theoretic work on analo~es, an integration of this work with the general theory of discourse proposed here, and an illuntratlon of how the","II would llke to thank Dedre Gentner for many useful comments end discussions. integration of the different approaches explicates the issues under discussion. In the last section of the paper, I concentrate on some surface llngulstlo phenomena accompanying a oonversant's use of analogy in spontaneous discourse. 2 The Context Space Theory of Discourse A close analysis of spontaneous dialogues reveals that discourse processing is focused and enabled by a conversant's ability to locate ~ single frame of reference [19, 15, 16] for the discussion. In effective communication, listeners are able to identify such a frame of reference by partitioning discourse utterances into a hierarchical organization of distinct but related and linked context snaces. At any given point, only some of these context spaces are in the foreground of discourse. Foreg~ounded context spaces provide the ~eeded reference frame for subsequent discussion. An abstract process model of discourse generation/interpretation incorporatlng a hierarchical view of discourse has been designed using the formalism of an Augmented Transition Network (ATN) [29] 2 . The ~Ta~r encoding the context space theory [20, 22] views a conversation as a sequence of conversatlooal moves. Conversational moves correspond to a speaker's communioatlve goal vis-A-vis a particular preceding section of discourse. Among the types of conversational moves - speaker communicative goals - formalized in the grammar are: Challenge, Support, Future-Generallzation, and Further-Development. The correlation between a speakerPs utterances and a speaker's communicative goal in the context space grammar is somewhat s~m~lar to a theory of speech acts A la Austin, Searle, and Grloe [I, 2q, 9]. As in the speech act theory, a speaker's conversatloral move is recognized as a functional communicative act [q] with an associated set of preconditions, effects, and mode of fulfillment. However, in the context space approach, the acts recognlzed are specific to maxlm-abldlng thematic conversational development, and their preconditions and effects stem from the discourse structure (rather than from/on arbitrary states in the external world). All utterances that serve the fulfillment of a slng~le communicative goal are partitloned into a single discourse unit - called a context space. A context space characterizes the role that its various parts play In the overall discourse structure and it explicates features relevant to \"well-formedness\" and \"maxim-abiding\" discourse development. ~ine types of context spaces have been formalized in the grammar representing the different constituent types of a discourse. The spaces are characterized in much the same way as elements of a • Systemic Grammar\" A la Halllday [10] via attributes represented as \"slots\" per Minsky [I~]. All context spaces have slots for the followlng elements:","2The rules incorporated in the grammar by themselves do not form a complete system of discourse generation/inter pretatlon. Rather, they enable specification of a set of high level Semantlc/log~Ical constraints that a surface lln~istlc from has to meet in order to fill a certain maxlm-abidlng conversational role at a given point in the discourse. 63","o a propositional representation of the set of functionally related utterances said to iie An the space; o the communicative goal served by the space;","o a marker reflecting the influential status of the space at any given point in the discourse;","o links to preceding context spaces in relatlon to which this context space wan developed; o specification at the relations involved. An equally important feature of a context space are its slots that hold the inferred components needed to recognize the communicative goal that the space serves in the discourse context. There are various ways to fulfill a given communicative goal, and usually, dependent on the mode of fulfillment and the goal in question, one can characterize a set of standardized implicit components that need to be inferred. For example, as noted by investigators of argumentation (e.g., [~, 23, 5, 22]), in interpreting a proposition as supporting another, we often need to infer some sot of mappings between an Interred generic principle of support, the stated proposition of support, and the claim being supported. We must also infer some general rule of inference that allows for conclusion a claim given the explicit statements of support and these inferred components. Reflecting this standardization of inferential elaborations, I have oategorlzed dlfferent types of context spaces based on communicative goal and method fttlftllment charaeterlzatlons (i.e., specification of specific slots needed to hold the standardized inferential elaboratlons particular tO a g~Lven goal and mode of fulfillment). Dellneatioo of context spaces, then, is functlomally based, and in the context space grammar, ImplAclt components of a move are treated an much a part of the discourse as those components verbally expressed. 3 The Analogy Conversational Move Znterpretlng/understanding an analogy obviously involves some inferenoing ca the part of a listener. An analogous context space, therefore, has some slots particular to it. The grammar's characterization of an analogous context space is derivative from its for~uLl analysis of an analogy oonversatlom-l move. 3.1 The Structure-Happing Approach Identification of those aspects of knowledge considered important in analogy seems to be of major cavern in current Investlgatlon of this cognitive task"]},{"title":"(e.g., [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 18, 25, 28]).","paragraphs":["GentnerJs ~ theory [6, 7, 8] seems most compatlble with the findings of the context space approach. Gentner argues that analogies aa-e based on an implicit understanding that \"identical operations and relationships hol~ among non identical things. The relational structure is preserved, hut not the objects\" [8, p.~]. Gentner's analysis can be used to explain B's analogy between the Hindu and Western traditions in Excerpt I. The relation ~ BUYING WOMAN. FOR $0~ COMPANION FUNCTION is held constant between the two doma/ns, and the appropriateness Of the analogy iS not affected, for instance, hy the noncorrespondlng political views and/or religions of the two societies. While Gentner cuts down on the number of correspondences that must exist between two domains for an analogy to be considered good, she still leaves open a rather wide set o£ relations that must seemingly be matched between a base and target domain. We need some. way to further characterize Just those relations that must be mapped. For example, the relation TRADING WITH CHINA is totally irrelevant to the Hindu-Western analogy in this discourse context. As noted by Lakoff & Johnson [12], metaphors simultaneously \"highlight\" and \"hide\" aspects of the two domains being mapped onto each other. The context space theory supplements both Lakoff & Johnson's analysis and the structure-mapplng approach in its ability to provide relevant relation characterization.. 3.2 The Context Space Approach In the context space theory, three elements are considered vital to analogy evaluation: o the structure mapping theory o relevant context identification o communicative goal identification The context space grammar's analysis of analogies can be characterized by the following: Explicating the connection between an utterance purportlng to make a claim analogous to another rests on recoghizlng that fc~. two propositions to be analogous, it anst be the cnse that they can bo ~h be seen an ~nstanc,s Of some more general claim, such that the predicates of all three propositions are identloal (i.e., relation identity), and the correspondent objects of the two domains involved are both subsets of some larger sot specified in this more general claim. Rejecting an analogy is based on specifylng some relation, RI, of one domain, that one implies (or claims) is not true in the other; or is based on specifying some non-ldentloal attrlbute-value pair ~'om whloh such a relation, RI, can be inferred. In both cases, RI oust itself stand in a 'CAUSE' relation (or soma other such relatlon 3) with one Of the relations explicitly mentioned in the creation of the analogy (i.e., one being held constant between the two domains, that we csul call RC). Furthermore, it must be the cnse that the communicative goal of the analogy hinges on RI(RC) being true (or not true) in both of the domains. 3.3 A-alogous Context Spaces Re£1ectlng this analysis of ~--!o~Les, all analogous context spaces have the followlng slot deflnltlons (among others).","Abstract: This slot contains the generic proposltlon, P, of which the Inltlatlng and analogous claim are instances. Reflecting the fact that the same predication must be true of both cla.lms, 3Since aceordin~ to this analysis the prime focal point of the analogy is always the relations (i.e., \"actions\") being held constant, and a major aspect of an \"action\" is its cause (reason, intent, or effect of occurrence), a non~orrespondenoe in one of these relations will usually invalidate the point at the analogy. 64 Relations: Proposition: Mappings: the predicate in the abstract slot is fixed; other elements of the abstract are variables corresponding to the abstracted clansea of which the specific elements mentionod in the analogous and initiating clalms are members. The structure of this slot, reflecting this importance of relation identity, consists of two subslots: This slot contains a llst of the relations that are constant and true in the two domains. This slot contains the generic proposition defined in terms of the constant predicates and their variable role fillers. This slot contains a llst of lists, where each llst corresponds to a variable of the generic proposition, P, and the m-ppings of the objects of the domain specified in the initiating context space onto the objects specified in the analogous context space. 3.~ Communicative Goals Served by Analogies An analogY conversational move can carve in fulfillment of a number of different communicative goals. Major roles currently identified are: I. Means of Explanation 2. Means of Support","3- Means of Implicit Judgement (i.e., conveying an evaluative opinion on a given state-of-a/falrs by comparing it to a situation for which opinion, either positive or negative, is assumed generally shared) 4. Topic ShiSt by Contrast 5. Hemna for Future-GeneraLizatlon ~n maxlm-abldlng discourse, only elements felt to be directly analogous cr contrastlve to elements contained in the Inltiat~ng context space are discussed in the analogous space\". Analogy construction entails a local shift in toplo, and, therefore, in general, a/tar discussion of the analogous space (iscluding its component parts, such as \"supports-of,\" \"challenges-of,, etc.), we have immediate resumption of the initiating context space. (When analogies are used for goals ~ & 5 noted above, if the analogy is accepted, then there need not be a return to the initiating space.) 3.5 Illuetratlon In this section, I present an analysis of an excerpt in which convereants spontaneously generate and argue about analog~les. The analysis hiEhlights the efficacy of inteKratlng the structure napping approach with r~e communicative gnal directed approach of the context space theory. The excerpt also illustrates the rule-llke behavior governing continued thematic development of a discourse after an analogy is given. Excerpt 2 is taken from a taped conversation between two friends, M and N, wherein M, a British citizen, is trying to explain to H, an American, the history cf the current turmoil in Ireland. The conversational moves involved in the excerpt (A & D being of the same category) are the following: A: ADalogy B: Challenge of Analogy C: Defense of A~alogy D: Alternate Aralogy","E: Return to the initiating context space of the analogy; with the return belng in the form of a \"Further-Development\" (as signalled by the clue","\"sow\").

It's 4. almost a Vietnam, in a way. 5. But, all within Northern Ireland? 6. All within Northern Ireland. Moving in as a 7. police force, belng seen by everybody as a 8. police force that was going to favor the 9. Protestants. 10. It'd rather be llke Syria being in Lebanon, 11. rlght? 12. I don't know enough about it to know, maybe. 13. There's - Where, there's a foreign police force I~. in one country. I mean, when you say it's llke 15. Vietnam, I can't take Vietnam. Vietnam is North 16. Vietnam and South Vietnam. 17. No, I meant war. You know, moving in and sayln6 18o we're a police action and actually flg~ting a war 19. when you got there. 20. Oh, well, that's Syria, that's obviously Syria, 21. rlght? Who are implicitly supporting - not 22. supportlng - 'cause actually it's very similar 23. in Lebanon, right? You have the Catholics and 2~. the Moslem. That's right, that's Lebanon. 25. I suppose, yes. 26. You have the Catholics and the Moslem, and then 27. Syria's eomlng in and implicitly supporting the 28. Moslem, because Syria itself is Moslem. 29. Now, England is Protestant?","qOf course, digressions. this does not preclude explicitly noted 65 3.5.1 Analysis We ~an begin the analysis with a more formal chaFaoterlzatlon of M's analogy conversational move. The generic proposition underlying N's analogy: $Countryl 81 $Country2 $Countryl R2 NEthnioGroup2 Where, the constant relations are: R1: MOVE-IN-AS-~OLICE-FORCE H2: TAKE-SIDE-OF The objects sapped onto each other: Mappings1: England, America Mappings2: Ireland, Vietnam Mapping=S: Protestants, South Viet~amese The communicative goal served by the analogy: Negative Evaluation on England In rejection of the analogy, N claims that in the Vietnam case alone the following three relations occur: R3: FOREIGN INVASION Rq: AID AGAINST FOREIGN INVASION RS: CAUSE Where, R5 la a relation between relations,"]},{"title":"i.e., 83","paragraphs":["CAUSE a~ 5 . The purpose of M's analogy is to hig~llght her negative assessment of England in the Ireland altuatlon (as identified by her utterance, \"And, whatOs made it worse this tlme ...\"). M attempts to accomplish this by mapplng the presummed acknowledged negative assessment of America in Vietnam onto England. Such a negative evaluative ~apping, however, can only occur of course if one oondenns America's involvement in Vietnam. N denies such a presummed negativity by arguing that it is possible to view America's involvement in Vietnam a~ coming to the aid of a country under foreign attack ~ (i.e., as a positive rather than a negative act). Thus, argues N, the \"cause\" relations of the acts being held constant between the two domain~ (i.e., enteran~e as a police force but being partisan) are quite different in the two cases. And, in the Vietnam case, the cause of the act obviates any common negativity associated with such \"unfair police force treatment.\" There is no negativity of America to map onto England, and the whole purpose of the analogy has failed. Hence, according to","5Rq can be thought of as another way of loo~.ing at R1 and R2. Alternatively, it could be thought of as replacing RI and R2, since when one country invades another, we do ~ot usually co~slder third party intervention as mere \"coming in as a polio= force and taklng the slde of,\" but rather as an entrance into an ongoing war. However, I think in one light one oen view the relations of 81 and R2 holding in either an internal or external war.","6Most criticisms of America's involvement in Vietnam rest on viewing it as an act of intervention in the internal affairs of a country agalnst the will of half oE its people. H, the analogy in thls discourse context is vacuous an~ warrants rejectlon 7. After N's rejection o~ M'e analogy, and N's offering o~\" an alternative analogy , which is somewhat accepted by M ~ as predicted by the gr--~r's analysis of an analogy conversational move u~ed for purposes or evaluatlon/Justlficatlon, it is time to have ~he initiating subject of the analogy returned-to (i.e., i~ is time to return to the subject of Br~Italn's moving into Ireland) The return, on Line 28, in the for= of \"Further-Development,\" constitutes a subordinating shaft ~rom dlsoussion of ~e event of the British a~my entering Ireland onto dlsousslon of England's underlying mot~ivatlons and reasons for engaging in this event. The form of return illustrates Lakoff & Johnson's notion of a metaphor creating new meanlngs for u~, and its ability to \"induce new similarities\" [12]. That is, it exemplifies a conversant's attempt to map new knowledge onto pre-existing knowledge of a domain based upon, and induced by, an analogy ,,,de to this domain. An appropriate extended paraphrase= of N's question on Line 28 is: \"Okay, so we accept Syria's presence in Lebanon as a better analogy for England's presence in Ireland. Now, we know, or have Just shown that Syria's bias to the Moslems can be explained by the fact that Syria herself is Moslem. It has been stated that England, in a sinMilar sltuatl~R , is favoring Protestants. can we then carry • otlves'\" over as well in the analogy? That is, can we then infer that England is Favoring the Protestants because she is Protestant?\" 7In a different context, perhaps, i.e., had the analogy been cited for a different purpose, N may have accepted it. In addition, it is iaportant to recognize ~at though there are mmerous o~her non-correspondences between the Amlrioan-Vletnam and England-L-=land situations (e.g., the respective geographlc distances involved), N's randoa selection of any one of these other nonnorresponding relations (irrespective of thelr complexlty) would not have necessarily led to effeotlve communication or a reason to reject the analogy.","8N'= citing of this alternative analogy is supportive of the grammar's analysis that the purpose of an analogy is vital to Its acceptance, slope, it happens that N views Syria's intervention in Lebanon quite negatively: thus, her cho£ce of this domain where (An her view) is=re is plenty of negativity to ~p.","9Notice, by the way, that in tsr'~a of \"at~ribute identity,\" Amities is a =mob closer latch to England than Syria la. This example supports the theory that \"attribute identity\" play= a milLimal role in analogy ~appings.","10The fact that M attempts to map a \"cause\" relation between the two domains, further supports the theory that it is correspondence of sohesatizatlon or relations between dosmins, rather than object identity, that is a governing criteria in analogy construction and evaluation. 66 Surface Lingulstlc Phenomena The rules of reference encoded in the context space grammar do not complement traditional pronominallzatlon theories which are based on criteria of recency and resulting potential semantic amblguities. Rather, the rules are more in llne with the theory proposed by Olson who states that \"words designate, signal, or specify an intended referent relative to the set of alternatives from which it must be differentiated\" [17, p.26~]. The context space grammar is able to delineate this set of alternatives governlng a speaker's choice (and listener's resolution) of a referring expresslon ;I by continually updating its model of the discourse based on its knowledge of the effects associated with different types of conversational moves. Its rule of reference, relevant to current discussion, is: Only elements in a currently active and controlling context space pair are in the set of alternatives vying for pronominal and close delctic referring expressions. The context space grammar continually updates its model of the discourse so that at any given point it knows which preceding utterances are currently in the active and controlling context spaces. Discourse model updating is governed by the effects of a conversational move. Major effects of most conversational moves are:","o changes to the influential statuses of preceding context spaces; changes to focus level assignments of constituents of the utterances contained in these Spaces; o establlshment of new context spaces; the creation of outstanding discourse expectations corresponding to likely subsequent conversational moves. The effects of initiating an analogy conversational move are to: put the initiating context space in a Controllln~ state (denoting its foreground role during the processing of the analogous space);","o create a new Active context space to contain the forthcoming analogous utterances; create the discourse expectation that upon completion of the analogy, discussion of the initiating context space will be resummed (except in cases of communicative goals q and 5 noted above). Endin~ an analogy conversational move, makes available to the grammar the \"Resume-lnitlatlng\" discourse expectation, created when the analogy was first generated. The effects of choosing this discourse expactation are to:","11Lacking from thls theory, however, but hopefully to be included at a later date, is Webber's notion of evoked entities [27] (i.e., entities not previously mentioned in the discourse but which are derivative from it - especially, quantified sets). 67","o Close the analogous context space (denoting that the space no longer plays a foreground discourse role);","o reinstantlate the initiating context space as Active. Excerpt 3 illustrates how the grammar's rule of reference and its updating actions for analo@les explain some seeming surprising surface linguistic forms used after an analo~ in the discourse. The excerpt is taken from an informal conversation between two friends. In the discussion, G is explaining to J the workings of a particle accelerator. Under current discussion is the cavity of the accelerator through which protons are sent and accelerated. Particular attention should be given to G's referring expressions on Line 8 of the excerpt. Excerot G: j. G: j. G: I. It's just a pure electrostatic field, which, 2. between two points, and the proton accelerates 3. through the electrostatic potential. ~. Okay. 5. Same physical law as if you drop a ball. It 6. accelerates through a gravitational potential. 7. Okay. 8: And the only important point here is that 9. the potential is maintained with this 10. Cockcroft-Walton unit. Lines 1 - 3: Lines 5 - 6 : Lines 8 - 10: Context Space CI, The Initiating ~pace. Context Space C2, The Analogous Space. Context Space CI, The Resumption. On Line 9, G refers to the \"electrostatic potential\" last mentioned on Line 3. with the unmodified, close deictlc referring expression 12 \"the potential,\" despite the fact that lntervening~ty on Line 5 he had referenced • gravitational potential,\" a potential semantic contender for the unmodified noun phrase. In addition, G uses the close delctic \"here\" to refer to context space CI, though in terms of linear order, context space C2, the analogous context space, is the closer context space. Both these surface linguistic phenomena are explainable and predictable by the context space theory. Line 8 fulfills the discourse expectation of resummlr~ discussion of the initiating context space of the analogy. As noted, the effects of such a move are to close the analogous context space (here, C2) and to reassign the initiating space (here, CI) an active status. As noted, only elements of an active or controlling context space are viable contenders for pronominal and close deictlc references; elements of closed context spaces are not. Hence, despite criteria of recency and resulting potentials of semantic ambiguity, G's references unambiguously refer to elements of CI, the active foregrounded context space in the discourse model. As a second example of speakers ualng close deictlcs to refer to elements of the initiating context space of an analogy, and corresponding use of far deictics for elements of the analogous space, lets re-consider Excerpt 1, repeated below.","12Th e grammar considers nThe X\" a close deictlc reference as it is often used as a comple~ment to \"That X,\" a clear far deictic expression [21] A: B: C: I. I think if you're going to marry someone in the 2. Hindu tradition, you have to - Well, you -They 3. say you give money to the family, to the glrl, q. but in essence, you actually ~uy her. 5. It's the same in the Western tradition. You 6. know, you see these greasy fat millionaires going 7. around with ~ilm stars, right? They've 8. essentially bought them by their status (?money). 9.

Lines 5 - 8: Context Space C3, The Analogous Space. LAnes 9 - 11: Context Space C3, The Challenge Space. On Line 9, C rejects B's analogy (as signalled by her use Of the clue words, \"t~o, but\") by citing a nonoorrespondence of relations between the two domains. Notice that in the rejection, C uses the far daictic • there = to refer to an element of the linearly close analogous context space, C2,t3 and that she uses the clone de~ctlc \"these\" to refer to an 1~lement~ of the linearly far initiating context space, CI . The grnmm\"r models C's move on Line 9 by processing the • Challenge- Analogy-Hap plngs\" (CAM) conversational move defined in its discourse network. This move is a subcategory of the grammar' s Challenge move category. Since this type of analogy challenge entails contrasting constituents of both the initiatlng and analogs context spaces'% the grammar must decide which of the two spaces should be in a controlling status, i.e., which space should serve as the frame of reference for subsequent processing. Reflecting the higher influential status of the initiating context space, the grammar chooses it as its reference frame Is. As such, on its transition path for the CAM move, move, the gr-mnutr\"","13This conversation was recorded in Switzerland, and in terms of a locative use of delctics, Western society is the closer rather than Hindu society. Thus, the choice of deict£c cannot be explained by appeal to external reference criteria.","1~Notlce, however, that C does not use the close \" delctlc \"here,\" though it is a better contrastlve term with \"there\" than is =these.\" The rule of using close delctlcs seems to be slightly constrained in that if the referent of \"here = is a location, and the s~aker is not in the location being referenced, then, s/he cannot use • here.\"","15Zn a different type of analogy challenge, for example, one could simply deny the truth of the smalo~us utterances.","16Zn the canes of Pre-Generalizatlon and Topic-Contrast-Shlft analogies, it is only after the analogy has been accepted that the analogous space is allowed to usurp the foreground role of the initiating context space.","O puts the currently active context space (i.e., the analogous context space) in a state (reflecting its new background role);","c leaves the initiating space in its Controlling state ( I. e., it has been serving as the reference frame for the analogy);","o creates a new Active context space in which to put the challenge about to be put forward. Performing such u~latlng actions, and using £ts rule that only elements in a controlling or active space are viable contenders for close delotlc and pronominal references, enables the grammar to correctly model, explain, and predict C's reference forms on Lines 9 11 of the excerpt. 5 Conclusion In this paper I have offered a treatment of analogies within spontaneous dlalo6ues. In order to do thls I first proposed a context space model of discourse. In the model discourse utterances are partitioned into discrete discourse units based on the communicative goal that they serve in the discussion. All communicative acts effect the precedlng discourse context and I have shown that by tracking these effects the grammar can specify a frame of reference for subsequent discussion. Then, a structure-~applng approach tO analogies was discussed. In this approach it is claimed that the focus of an analogy is on system~ of relatlonships between objects, rather than on attributes of objects. Analysis of naturally occurring analogies supported this claim. I then showed that the context space theory's communicative goal analysis of discourse enabled the theory to go beyond the struoture-mapplng approach by providing a further specification of waich klnds of relationships are most likely to be Included in description of an analogy. • Lastly, Z presented a number of excerpts taken from naturally ongoing discourse and showed how the context space analysis provided a cogent explanation for the types Of analogies found in dlsoouree, the types Of reJemt£ons given tO them, the rule-like thematic development of a dlsoourse after an a~alogy, and the surface llngulstlc forms used in these development. In conclusion, analyzing speakers spontaneous generation of analogies and other conversants' reaotlons to them, provides ua an usually direct form by which access individuals' implicit criteria for analogies. These exchanges reveal what conversants believe analogies are responsible for and thereby what i~ormatlon they need to convey. 68 zEvv~ENCES 1. Auatln J.L. ~ow To Do T~n~s With Words.
