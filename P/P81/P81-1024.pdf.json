In the second case, the presuppositions and implicatures are known (either true or false) and the assertion is unknown. The attempt to add the primary information again activates the verification of the meaning postulates. However, in this case, the presuppositions and implicatures are simply being checked - the verification process is not interrupted to add this secondary information to the model. This case corresponds to what Grice and others have termed to be a well-structured conversation. In the third case, the assertion of the sentence is known to be true or false. Since no new information needs to be added to the model to process the semantic representation of the sentence, the verification of meaning postulates is not activated. The presuppositions and implicatures need not be verified because they had to have been verified before the assertion of the sentence or its negation could have been entered into the model. The presuppositions and implicatures of subordinate clauses do not necessarily become presuppositions and implicatures of the whole sentence. The problem of when and how such presuppositions become those of the matrix sentence is known as the"]},{"title":"pPoSeotion problem","paragraphs":["[13]. The system described here provides a simple and motivated solution to the projection problem.

In the case where the presuppositions and implicatures are projected up from the subordinate clause to the matrix sentence, undefinable values are allowed to propagate, and thus a failure of a projected presupposition or implicature affects not only the subordinate clause in which it originates, but also the matrix sentence. The determination of the projection characteristics is claimed to be an integral part of the meanings of words and not a separable feature. There are two other major attempts to handle presuppositions and implicatures in a model-theoretic framework. Karttunen and Peters [g, 9, 10] produce a formula giving the conventional implicatures of a sentence from its syntactic structure.

Moran [12] compares the approach taken here to that of Karttunen and Peters and shows how this approach is simpler and better motivated. Gazdar's system is broader, but this approach is shown to correctly handle sentences which are incorrectly handled by Gazdar, and ways are suggested to expand the coverage of this system.
