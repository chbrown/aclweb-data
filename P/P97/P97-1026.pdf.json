Given a sufficiently rich logical language, the meaning of a natural language sentence can be represented as a description in this sense, by assuming sentences refer to entities in a DISCOURSE MODEL, cf. alternative semantics (Karttunen and Peters, 1979; Rooth, 1985).","Pragmatic analyses of referring expressions model speakers as PLANNING those expressions to achieve several different kinds of intentions (Donellan, 1966; Appelt, 198 1985; Kronfeld, 1986). Given a set of entities to describe and a set of intentions to achieve in describing them, a plan is constructed by applying operators that enrich the content of the description until all intentions are satisfied. Recent work on generating definite referring NPs (Reiter, 1991 ; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Reiter and Dale, 1992; Horacek, 1995) has emphasized how circumscribed in-stantiations of this procedure can exploit linguistic context and convention to arrive quickly at short, unambiguous descriptions. For example, (Reiter and Dale, 1992) apply generalizations about the salience of properties of objects and conventions about what words make base-level attributions to incrementally select words for inclusion in a description. (Dale and Haddock, 1991) use a constraint network to represent the distractors described by a complex referring NP, and incrementally select a property or relation that rules out as many alternatives as possible. Our approach is to extend such NP planning procedures to apply to sentences, using TAG syntax and a rich semantics.","Treating sentences as referring expressions allows us to encompass the strengths of many disparate proposals. Incorporating material into descriptions of a variety of entities until the addressee can infer desired conclusions allows the sentence planner to enrich input content, so that descriptions refer successfully (Dale and Haddock, 1991) or reduce it, to eliminate redundancy (McDonald, 1992). Moreover, selecting alternatives on the basis of their syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic contributions to the sentence using TAG allows the sentence planner to choose words in tandem with appropriate syntax (Yang et al., 1991), in a flexible order (Elhadad and Robin, 1992), and, if necessary, in conventional combinations (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Wanner, 1994)."]},{"title":"3 Linguistic Specifications","paragraphs":["Realizing this procedure requires a declarative specification of three kinds of information: first, what operators are available and how they may combine; second, how operators specify the content of a description; and third, how operators achieve pragmatic effects. We represent operators as elementary trees in LTAG, and use TAG operations to combine them; we give the meaning of each tree as a formula in an ontologically promiscuous representation language; and, we model the pragmatics of operators by associating with each tree a set of discourse constraints describing when that operator can and should be used.","Other frameworks have the capability to make comparable specifications; for example, HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) feature structures describe syntax (SUBCAT), semantics (CONTI3NT) and pragmatics (CONTEXT). We choose TAG because it enables local specification of syntactic dependencies in explicit constructions and flexibility in incorporating modifiers; further, it is a constrained grammar formalism with tractable computational properties."]},{"title":"3.1 Syntactic specification","paragraphs":["TAG (Joshi et al., 1975) is a grammar formalism built around two operations that combine pairs of trees, SUB-STITUTION and ADJOINING. A TAG grammar consists of a finite set of ELEMENTARY trees, which can be combined by these substitution and adjoining operations to produce derived trees recognized by the grammar. In substitution, the root of the first tree is identified with a leaf of the second tree, called the substitution site. Adjoining is a more complicated splicing operation, where the first tree replaces the subtree of the second tree rooted at a node called the adjunction site; that subtree is then substituted back into the first tree at a distinguished leaf called the FOOT node. Elementary trees without foot nodes are called INITIAL trees and can only substitute; trees with foot nodes are called AUXILIARY trees, and must adjoin. (The symbol $ marks substitution sites, and the symbol * marks the foot node.) Figure l(a) shows an initial tree representing the book. Figure l(b) shows an auxiliary tree representing the modifier syntax, which could adjoin into the tree for the book to give the syntax book.","Our grammar incorporates two additional principles. First, the grammar is LEXICALIZED (Schabes, 1990): each elementary structure in the grammar contains at least one lexical item. Second, our trees include FEATURES, following (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).","LTAG elementary trees abstract the combinatorial properties of words in a linguistically appealing way. All predicate-argument structures are localized within a single elementary tree, even in long-distance relationships, so elementary trees give a natural domain of locality over which to state semantic and pragmatic constraints. The LTAG formalism does not dictate particular syntactic analyses; ours follow basic GB conventions. 3.2"]},{"title":"Semantics","paragraphs":["We specify the semantics of trees by applying two principles to the LTAG formalism. First, we adopt an ONTO-LOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS representation (Hobbs, 1985) that includes a wide variety of types of entities. Ontological promiscuity offers a simple syntax-semantics interface. The meaning of a tree is just the CONJUNCTION of the meanings of the elementary trees used to derive it, once appropriate parameters are recovered. Such fiat semantics is enjoying a resurgence in NLP; see (Copestake et al., 1997) for an overview and formalism. Second, we constrain these parameters syntactically, by labeling each syntactic node as supplying information about a particular entity or collection of entities, as in Jackendoff's X-bar semantics (Jackendoff, 1990). A node X:X (about ×) can only substitute or adjoin into another node with the same label. These semantic parameters are instantiated using a knowledge base (cf. figure 7).","For Jackendoff, noun phrases describe ordinary individuals, while PPs describe PLACES or PATHS and VPs describe ACTIONS and EVENTUALITIES (in terms of a Reichenbachian reference point).

For example, in (Stone and Doran, 1996), we use reference to properties, actions and belief contexts (Ballim et al., 1991) to describe semantic collocations (Pustejovsky, 1991) and idiomatic composition (Nunberg et al., 1994)."]},{"title":"3.3 Pragmatics","paragraphs":["Different constructions make different assumptions about the status of entities and propositions in the discourse, which we model by including in each tree a specification of the contextual conditions under which use of the tree is pragmatically licensed. We have selected four representative pragmatic distinctions for our implementation; however, the framework does not commit one to the use of particular theories.","We use the following distinctions. First, entities differ in NEWNESS (Prince, 1981). At any point, an entity is either new or old to the HEARER and either new or old to the DISCOURSE. Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995). Salience assigns each entity a position in a partial order that indicates how accessible it is for reference in the current context. Third, entities are related by salient PARTIALLY-ORDERED SET (POSET) RELATIONS to other entities in the context (Hirschberg, 1985). These relations include part and whole, subset and superset, and membership in a common class. Finally, the discourse may distinguish some OPEN PROPOSITIONS (propositions containing free variables) as being under discussion (Prince, 1986). We assume that information of these four kinds is available in a model of the current discourse state.","The applicability conditions of constructions can freely make reference to this information. In particular, NP trees include the determiner (the determiner does not have a separate tree), the head noun, and pragmatic conditions that match the determiner with the status of the entity in context, as in 3(a). Following (Gundel et al., 1993), the definite article the may be used when the entity is UNIQUELY IDENTIFIABLE in the discourse model, i.e. the hearer knows or can infer the existence of this entity and can distinguish it from any other hearer-old entity of equal or greater salience.

Likewise, we follow (Prince, 1993) and (Birner, 1992) for LD and INV respectively. 4 SPUD"]},{"title":"4.1 The algorithm","paragraphs":["Our system takes two types of goals. First, goals of the form distinguish x as cat instruct the algorithm to construct a description of entity x using the syntactic category cat. Ifx is uniquely identifiable in the discourse model, then this goal is only satisfied when the meaning planned so far distinguishes x for the hearer. Ifx is hearer new, this goal is satisfied by including any constituent of type cat. Second, goals of the form communicate p instruct the algorithm to include the proposition p. This goal is satisfied as long as the sentence IMPLIES p given shared common-sense knowledge.","In each iteration, our algorithm must determine the appropriate elementary tree to incorporate into the current description. It performs this task in two steps to take advantage of the regular associations between words and trees in the lexicon. Sample lexical entries are shown in figure 4. They associate a word with the semantics of the word, special pragmatic restrictions on the use of the word, and a set of trees that describe the combinatory possibilities for realizing the word and may impose additional pragmatic restrictions. Tree types are shared between lexical items (figure 5). This allows us to specify the pragmatic constraints associated with the tree type once, regardless of which verb selects it. Moreover, we can determine which tree to use by looking at each tree ONCE per instantiation of its arguments, even when the same tree is associated with multiple lexical items.","Hence, the first step is to identify applicable lexical entries by meaning: these items must truly and appropriately describe some entity; they must anchor trees that can substitute or adjoin into a node that describes the entity; and they must distinguish entities from their distractors or entail required information. Then, the second step identifies which of the associated trees are applicable, by testing their pragmatic conditions against the current representation of discourse. The algorithm identifies the combinations of words and trees that satisfy the most communicate goals and eliminate the most distractors. From these, it selects the entry with the most specific semantic and pragmatic licensing conditions. This means that the algorithm generates the most marked licensed form. In (Stone and Doran, 1996) we explore the use of additional factors, such as attentional state and lexical preferences, in this step.","The new tree is then substituted or adjoined into the existing tree at the appropriate node. The entry may specify additional goals, because it describes one entity in terms of a new one. These new goals are added to the current goals, and then the algorithm repeats.","Note that this algorithm performs greedy search. To avoid backtracking, we choose uninflected forms. Morphological features are set wherever possible as a result of the general unification processes in the grammar; the inflected form is determined from the lemma and its associated features in a post-processing step.","The specification of this algorithm is summarized in the following pseudocode: 201 STEM"]},{"title":"/buy/","paragraphs":["/sell/ /purchase/ /book/"]},{"title":"SEMANTICS S YNTAX PRAGMATICS S buyer/buy/bought/from/seller, etc. register(informal) S seller~sell~bought~to~buyer, etc. register(informal) S buyer/purchase/bought/from/seller, etc. register(formal) book(x) /a//book/, etc. [always possible] S = buy(buying,buyer, seller, bought)","paragraphs":["Figure 4: Sample entries from the lexicon SUBCAT FRAME TREES PRAGMATICS Intransitive Active [always possible] Transitive Active [always possible] Topicalized Object in-poset(obj), in-op(event) Left-Dislocated Object"]},{"title":"in-poset(obj)","paragraphs":["Ditransitive Active [always possible] Topicalized Dir Object in-poset(dir obj), in-op(event) Left-Dislocated Dir Object in-poset(dir obj) PP Predicative Active [always possible] Locative Inversion newer-than(subj,loc) etc. Figure 5: Sample entries from the tree database"]},{"title":"until goals are satisfied: determine which uninflected forms apply; determine which associated trees apply; evaluate progress towards goals; incorporate most specific, best ( form, tree ): perform adjunction or substitution; conjoin new semantics; add any additional goals; 4.2 The system","paragraphs":["SPUD's grammar currently includes a range of syntactic constructions, including adjective and PP modification, relative clauses, idioms and various verbal alternations. Each is associated with a semantic and pragmatic specification as discussed above and illustrated in figures 4 and 5. These linguistic specifications can apply across many domains.","In each domain, an extensive set of inferences, presumed known in common with the user, are required to ensure appropriate behavior. We use logic programming to capture these inferences. In our domain, the system has the role of a librarian answering patrons' queries. Our specifications define: the properties and identities of objects (e.g., attributes of books, parts of the library); the taxonomic relationships among terms (e.g., that a service desk is an area but not a room); and the typical span and course of events in the domain (e.g., rules about how to check out books). This information is complete and available for each lexical entry. Of course, SPUD also represents its private knowledge about the domain. This includes facts like the status of books in the library. 4.3 An example Suppose our system is given the task of answering the following question: (1) Do you have the books for Syntax 551 and Pragmatics 590? Figure 6 shows part of the discourse model after processing the question. The two books, the set they comprise (introducing a poset relation), and the library are mentioned in (1). Hence, these entities must be both hearer-old and discourse-old. As in centering (Grosz et al., 1995), the subject is taken to be the most salient entity. Finally, the meaning of the question becomes a salient open proposition.","On the basis of the knowledge in figure 7, a rhetorical planner might decide to answer by describing state have27 as an S and lose5 likewise. To construct its reference to have27, SPUD first determines which lexical and syntactic options are available. Using the lexicon and information about have27 available from figure 7(b), SPUD determines that, of lemmas that truthfully and appropriately describe have27 as an S,/have/has the most specific licensing conditions. The tree set for/have/includes unmarked, LD and TOP trees. All are licensed, because of the poset relation R between book19 and books and the salient open proposition O. We choose TOP, the tree with the most specific condition--TOP requires R and O, while LD requires only R and the unmarked form has no requirements.","Thus, a topicalized /have/ tree, appropriately instantiated as shown in figure 8, is added to the description.

With its incremental choices and its emphasis on the consequences of functional choices in the grammar, our algorithm resembles the networks of systemic grammar (Mathiessen, 1983; Yang et al., 1991). However, unlike systemic networks, our system derives its functional choices dynamically using a simple declarative specification of function. Like many sentence planners, we assume that there is a flexible • association between the content input to a sentence planner and the meaning that comes out. Other researchers (Nicolov et al., 1995; Rubinoff, 1992) have assumed that this flexibility comes from a mismatch between input content and grammatical options. In our system, such differences arise from the referential requirements and inferential opportunities that are encountered.","Previous authors (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987) have noted that TAG has many advantages for generation as a syntactic formalism, because of its localization of argument structure. (Joshi, 1987) states that adjunction is a powerful tool for elaborating descriptions. These aspects of TAGs are crucial to SPUD, as they are to (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987; Yang et al., 1991; Nicolov et al., 1995; Wahlster et al., 1991; Danlos, 1996). What sets SPUD apart is its simultaneous construction of syntax and semantics, and the tripartite, lexicalized, declarative grammatical specifications for constructions it uses. Two contrasts should be emphasized in this regard. (Shieber et al., 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1991) construct a simultaneous derivation of syntax and semantics but they do not construct the semantics--it is an input to their system. (Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) represent syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a lexicalized framework, but concentrate on information structure rather than the pragmatics of particular constructions."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion","paragraphs":["Most generation systems pipeline pragmatic, semantic, lexical and syntactic decisions (Reiter, 1994). With the fight formalism, constructing pragmatics, semantics and syntax simultaneously is easier and better. The approach elegantly captures the interaction between pragmatic and syntactic constraints on descriptions in a sentence, and the inferential interactions between multiple descriptions in a sentence. At the same time, it exploits linguistically motivated, declarative specifications of the discourse functions of syntactic constructions to make contextually appropriate syntactic choices."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["D.
