Separate classifiers have to be trained for different words. We present an algorithm that uses the same knowledge sources to disambiguate different words. The algorithm does not require a sense-tagged corpus and exploits the fact that two different words are likely to have similar meanings if they occur in identical local contexts. 1 Introduction Given a word, its context and its possible meanings, the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to determine the meaning of the word in that context. WSD is useful in many natural language tasks, such as choosing the correct word in machine translation and coreference resolution.","In several recent proposals (Hearst, 1991; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Leacock, Towwell, and Voorhees, 1996; Ng and Lee, 1996; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1994), statistical and machine learning techniques were used to extract classifiers from hand-tagged corpus. Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1995) proposed an unsupervised method that used heuristics to obtain seed classifications and expanded the results to the other parts of the corpus, thus avoided the need to hand-annotate any examples.","Most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms determine the meanings of polysemous words by exploiting their local contexts. A basic intuition that underlies those algorithms is the following:"]},{"title":"(i)","paragraphs":["Two occurrences of the same word have identical meanings if they have similar local contexts. In other words, most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms learn to disambiguate a polysemous word from previous usages of the same word. This has several undesirable consequences. Firstly, a word must occur thousands of times before a good classifier can be learned. In Yarowsky's experiment (Yarowsky, 1995), an average of 3936 examples were used to disambiguate between two senses. In Ng and Lee's experiment, 192,800 occurrences of 191 words were used as training examples. There are thousands of polysemous words, e.g., there are 11,562 polysemous nouns in WordNet. For every polysemous word to occur thousands of times each, the corpus must contain billions of words. Secondly, learning to disambiguate a word from the previous usages of the same word means that whatever was learned for one word is not used on other words, which obviously missed generality in natural languages. Thirdly, these algorithms cannot deal with words for which classifiers have not been learned.","In this paper, we present a WSD algorithm that relies on a different intuition:","(2) Two different words are likely to have similar meanings if they occur in identical local contexts. Consider the sentence:","(3) The new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees The word \"facility\" has 5 possible meanings in WordNet 1.5 (Miller, 1990): (a) installation, (b) proficiency/technique, (c) adeptness, (d) readiness, (e) toilet/bathroom. To disambiguate the word, we consider other words that appeared in an identical local context as \"facility\" in (3). Table 1 is a list of words that have also been used as the subject of \"employ\" in a 25-million-word Wall Street Journal corpus.

The meaning of \"facility\" in (3) can be determined by choosing one of its 5 senses that is most similar 1 to the meanings of words in Table 1. This way, a polysemous word is disambiguated with past usages of other words. Whether or not it appears in the corpus is irrelevant.","Our approach offers several advantages:","• The same knowledge sources are used for all words, as opposed to using a separate classifier for each individual word.","• It requires a much smaller corpus that needs not be sense-tagged.","• It is able to deal with words that are infrequent or do not even appear in the corpus.","• The same mechanism can also be used to infer the semantic categories of unknown words.","The required resources of the algorithm include the following: (a) an untagged text corpus, (b) a broad-coverage parser, (c) a concept hierarchy, such as the WordNet (Miller, 1990) or Roget's Thesaurus, and (d) a similarity measure between concepts.","In the next section, we introduce our definition of local contexts and the database of local contexts. A description of the disambiguation algorithm is presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the evalua-tion results. 2 Local Context Psychological experiments show that humans are able to resolve word sense ambiguities given a narrow window of surrounding words (Choueka and Lusignan, 1985). Most WSD algorithms take as input • to be defined in Section 3.1 a polysemous word and its local context. Different systems have different definitions of local contexts. In (Leacock, Towwell, and Voorhees, 1996), the local context of a word is an unordered set of words in the sentence containing the word and the preceding sentence. In (Ng and Lee. 1996), a local context of a word consists of an ordered sequence of 6 surrounding part-of-speech tags, its morphological features, and a set of collocations.","In our approach, a local context of a word is defined in terms of the syntactic dependencies between the word and other words in the same sentence.","A dependency relationship (Hudson, 1984; Mel'~uk, 1987) is an asymmetric binary relationship between a word called head (or governor, parent), and another word called modifier (or dependent, daughter). Dependency grammars represent sentence structures as a set of dependency relationships. Normally the dependency relationships form a tree that connects all the words in a sentence. An example dependency structure is shown in (4).

We then explain how the similarity between a word and its selectors is maximized. 3.1 Similarity between Two Concepts There have been several proposed measures for similarity between two concepts (Lee, Kim, and Lee, 1989; Kada et al., 1989; Resnik, 1995b; Wu and Palmer, 1994).

The text was parsed in 126 hours on a SPARC-Ultra 1/140 with 96MB of memory. We then extracted from the parse trees 8,665,362 dependency relationships in which the head or the modifier is a noun. We then filtered out (lc, word) pairs with a likelihood ratio lower than 5 (an arbitrary threshold). The resulting database contains 354,670 local contexts with a total of 1,067,451 words in them (Table 1 is counted as one local context with 20 words in it).","Since the local context database is constructed from WSJ corpus which are mostly business news, we only used the \"press reportage\" part of SemCor which consists of 7 files with about 2000 words each. Furthermore, we only applied our algorithm to nouns. Table 3 shows the results on 2,832 polysemous nouns in SemCor. This number also includes proper nouns that do not contain simple markers (e.g., Mr., Inc.) to indicate its category. Such a proper noun is treated as a 3-way ambiguous word: person, organization, or location. We also showed as a baseline the performance of the simple strategy of always choosing the first sense of a word in the WordNet. Since the WordNet senses are ordered according to their frequency in SemCor, choosing the first sense is roughly the same as choosing the sense with highest prior probability, except that we are not using all the files in SemCor.","It can be seen from Table 3 that our algorithm performed slightly worse than the baseline when the strictest correctness criterion is used. However, when the condition is relaxed, its performance gain is much lager than the baseline. This means that when the algorithm makes mistakes, the mistakes tend to be close to the correct answer. 5 Discussion 5.1 Related Work The Step C in Section 3.2 is similar to Resnik's noun group disambiguation (Resnik, 1995a), although he did not address the question of the creation of noun groups.","The earlier work on WSD that is most similar to ours is (Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin, 1995). They proposed a set of heuristic rules that are based on the idea that objects of the same or similar verbs are similar. 3http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ 5.2 Weak Contexts Our algorithm treats all local contexts equally in its decision-making. However, some local contexts hardly provide any constraint on the meaning of a word. For example, the object of \"get\" can practically be anything. This type of contexts should be filtered out or discounted in decision-making. 5.3 Idiomatic Usages Our assumption that similar words appear in identical context does not always hold. For example,","(10) ... the condition in which the heart beats between 150 and 200 beats a minute The most frequent subjects of \"beat\" (according to our local context database) are the following:","(11) PER, badge, bidder, bunch, challenger, democrat, Dewey, grass, mummification, pimp, police, return, semi. and soldier. where PER refers to proper names recognized as persons. None of these is similar to the \"body part\" meaning of \"heart\". In fact, \"heart\" is the only body part that beats. 6 Conclusion We have presented a new algorithm for word sense disambiguation. Unlike most previous corpus-based WSD algorithm where separate classifiers are trained for different words, we use the same local context database and a concept hierarchy as the knowledge sources for disambiguating all words. This allows our algorithm to deal with infrequent words or unknown proper nouns.","Unnecessarily subtle distinction between word senses is a well-known problem for evaluating WSD algorithms with general-purpose lexical resources. Our use of similarity measure to relax the correctness criterion provides a possible solution to this problem.
