There is a voluminous literature on aspect within linguistics and philosophy. Recently, computational linguists also have joined in the act within the context of machine translation or text understanding etc. For example, consider the following Japanese sentences (quoted from (Gunji, 1992)). (a). Ken-wa ima tonarino heya-de kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.","Ken-TOP now next room-LOC kimono-ACC put-","on-PRES","'Ken is now putting on kimono in the next room.' (b). Ken-wa kesa-kara zutto axto kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.","Ken-TOP this morning-since always that kimono-","ACC weax-PRES","'Ken has been wearing that kimono since this morn-","ing.' (e). Ken-wa ano kimono-wo san-nen maeni ki-te-i-ru.","Ken-TOP that kimono-ACC three-year before","wear-PRES","'Ken has the experience of wearing that kimono","three years ago.'","Notice that English translations use separate lexical items (put on for (a) and wear for (b), (c)) and different aspectual configurations (the progressive for (a), the perfect progressive for (b), and an-other for (c)), while all Japanese sentences contain the same verbal form ki-te-i-ru. Thus. when the system tries to translate these sentences, it must be aware of the difference among them.","This paper describes an approach to extract the aspectual information of Japanese verb phrases from a monolingual corpus. In the next section, we will classify Japanese verbs into six categories by means of aspectual features following the framework of (Bennett et al., 1990). The aspectual forms land adverbs are defined as the functions which operate on verbs' aspectual features and changes their values. By using the constraints of the applicability of the functions, we can identify a unique category for each verb automatically. If one can acquire aspectual properties of verbs properly and know how the other constituents in a sentence operate on them, then the aspectual meaning of the whole sentence will be determined monotonically. To evaluate the result of the experiment, we will examine the meaning of -teiru which is one of the most fundamental aspectual forms, since the classification itself is difficult to evaluate objectively. 2 Realization Process of Aspectual Meaning We consider that the whole aspectual meaning of verb phrases is determined in the following order: verbs ---, arguments ~ adverbs ~ aspectual forms, Adverbs and aspectual forms are defined as indicators of such cognitive processes as \"zoom-ing\" and \"focusing\" which operate on the time-line representation. They are sinfilar to the notions \"aspectual coercion\" (Moens and Steedman, 1988) or","I The term \"form\" refers to grammatical morphemes which axe defined in terms of derivation. In this paper, we refer to the aspectual morphemes which follow verbs as \"aspectual forms\", including compound verbs such as .hazimevu(begin), suffixes with epenthetic -re such as - teiru, and aspectual nominals such as -bakaviOust now) etc."]},{"title":"352","paragraphs":["\"views\" (Gunji, 1992). We explain each in turn. 2.1"]},{"title":"Aspectual Categories","paragraphs":["of Verbs A number of aspectually oriented lexical-semantic representations have been proposed. ~Ve adopt and extend the feature-based framework proposed by (Bennett et al., 1990) in the spirit of (Moens and Steedman, 1988). They uses three features: ±dynamic, ±telic, and ±atomic. We add two more features: ±process and ±gradual.","The feature dynamicity distinguishes between states(-d) and events(+d), and atomicity distinguishes between point events(+a) and extended events(-a). The duration described by verbs is"]},{"title":"twofold:","paragraphs":["an ongoing process and a consequent state. The feature process concerns an ongoing process and distinguishes whether events described by verbs have the duration for which some actions unfold. The feature telicity distinguishes between culminative events(+t) and nonculminative events(-t). It presupposes a process. The feature graduality characterizes events in which some kind of change is included and the change gradually develops.","We can classify verbs by means of different combinations of the five features. Since there are dependences between features, only subsets of the combinatorially possible configurations of features are defined as shown in the Table 1.","In the Table 1, 1.stative verbs are those that are not dynamic. 2.atomic verbs are those that express an atomic event. 3.resultative verbs express a punctual event followed by a new state which holds over some interval of time. 4.process+result verbs are those that express a complex situation consisting of a process which culminates in a new state. 5.non-gradual process verbs are those that express only processes and not changes of state. 6.gradual process verbs are those that have graduality. Although the verbs of the categories 5 and 6 don't contain telicity, the arguments of the verbs or some kinds of adverbs can set up the endpoint of the process as discussed later. In Vendlerian classification, states correspond to 1, achievements to 2 and 3, accomplishments to 4 and 6, activities to 5, respectively (Vendler, 1957). Table 1: Aspectual categories of verbs 2.2 Arguments Tenny points out that internal argument of a verb can be defined as that which temporally delimits or measures out the event (Tenny, 1994).","The direct internal argument can aspectually • 'measure out the event\" to which the verb refers.

They play a role of framing the interval on which the focus should be brought. 2.3 Adverbs In general, adverbs focus on the subpart of the event described by a verb and give a more detailed description. According to the discussion in (Moriyama, 1988), adverbs can be classified as follows in terms of the subpart on which they focus.","Processes modifiers modify verbs which have process (+p).

She adopts the four-way classification system following Vendler (Vendler, 1957) and utilizes Dowty's test (Dowty, 1991) for deternfining aspectual categories of English verbs. She reports the results obtained from running the program on 219 sentences of the LOB corpus. Although we cannot know how many verbs she tested because she has shown only a subset of the verbs, the program was not able to pare down the aspectual category to one in 18 cases out of 27 verbs.","Brent (Brent, 1991) discusses an implemented program that automatically classifies verbs into two groups, stative vs. non-stative, on the basis of their syntactic contexts.

However, some sort of noise reduction technique such as the confidence intervals used by Brent may be needed to detect the cue more accurately. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed a method for classifying Japanese verbs on the basis of surface evidence from a monolingual corpus, and examined the meaning of the form -teiru by means of the classifications of verbs and adverbs.","The aspect of verb phrases provides not only the temporal configuration within a single event but also the information needed for processing temporal relation between multiple events (Dowty, 1986; Passonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988).","Furthermore, the lexical aspect of verbs is closely related with their deep complement structures which may not be directly reflected on the surface argument structures. Therefore, by combining the aspectual categories of verbs and those that are defined in terms of their surface argument structures, we can obtain an elaborate classification based on semantic types of verbs. (Preliminary experiments on this issue can be seen in (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1996).)","Thus, the information obtained here can be used for various applications. References","S. W. Bennett, T.
