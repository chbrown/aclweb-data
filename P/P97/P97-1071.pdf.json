I discuss two approaches to the generation of contrastive accent and propose an alternative method that is feasible and computationally attractive in data-to-speech systems. 1 Motivation The placement of pitch accent plays an important role in the interpretation of spoken messages. Utterantes having the same surface structure but a different accentuation pattern may express very different meanings. A generation system for spoken language should therefore be able to produce appropriate accentuation patterns for its output messages.","One of the factors determining accentuation is contrast. Its importance canbe illustrated with all example from GoalGetter, a data-to-speech systeln which generates spoken soccer reports in Dutch (Klabbers et al., 1997). The input of the system is a typed data structure containing data on a soccer match. So-called syntactic templates (van Deemter and Odijk, 1995) are used to express parts of this data structure. In GoalGetter, only 'new' information is accented; 'given' ('old') information is not (Chafe, 1976), (Brown, 1983), (Hirschberg, 1992). However, this strategy does not always lead to a correct accentuation pattern if contrastive information is not taken into account, as shown in example (1). t (1) a Ill the 16th minute, the Ajax player Kluivert kicked the ball into the wrong goal.","b Ten minutes later,"]},{"title":"Wooter","paragraphs":["scored for Ajax.","1 All GoalGetter examples are translated from Dutch.

There are two main problems with this approach. First, as Prevost himself notes, it is very difficult to define exactly which items count as be-ing of 'the same type'. If the definition is too strict, not all cases of contrast will be accounted for. On the other hand, if it is too broad, then anything will be predicted to contrast with anything. A second problem is that there are cases where co-occurrence of two items of the same type does not trigger contrast, as in the following soccer example:","(2) a b c After six minutes"]},{"title":"Nilis","paragraphs":["scored a goal for"]},{"title":"PSV.","paragraphs":["This caused"]},{"title":"Ajax","paragraphs":["to fall behind.

In fact, though, there is no contrast and"]},{"title":"PSV","paragraphs":["should be normally deaccented due to givenness. This shows that the presence of an alternative item is not sufficient to trigger contrast accent."]},{"title":"519","paragraphs":["Another approach to contrastive accent is advocated by Pulman (1997), who proposes to use higher order unification (HOU) for both interpretation and prediction of focus. Described informally, Pulman's focus assignment algorithm takes the semantic representation of a sentence which has just been generated, looks in the context for another sentence representation containing parallel items, and abstracts over these items in both representations. If the resulting representations are unifiable, the two sentences stand in a contrast relation and the parallel elements from the most recent one receive a pitch accent (or another focus marker).","Pulman does not give a full definition of parallel-ism, but states that \"to be parallel, two items need to be at least of the same type and have the same sortal properties\" ((Pulman, 1997), p. 90). This is rather similar to Prevost's conditions on alternative sets. Consequently, Pulman's theory also faces the problem of determining when two items are of the same type. Still, contrary to Prevost, Pulman can explain the lack of contrast accent in (2)c, because obviously the representations of sentences (2)b and (2)c will not unify.","Another advantage, pointed out in (Gardent et al., 1996), is that a HOU algorithm can take world knowledge into account, which is sometimes necessary for determining contrast. For instance, the contrast in (1) is based on the knowledge that kicking the ball into the wrong goal implies scoring a goal for the opposing team. In a HOU approach, the contrast in this example might be predicted by unifying the representation of the second sentence with the entail-ment of the first. However, such a strategy would require the explicit enumeration of all possible semantic equivalences and entalhnents in the relevant domain, which seems hardly feasible. Also, implementation of higher order unification can be quite inefficient. This means that although theoretically appealing, the HOU approach to contrastive accent is less attractive from a computational viewpoint. 3 An alternative solution Fortunately, in data-to-speech systems like GoalGetter, the input of which is formed by typed and structured data, a simple principle can be used for determining contrast. If two subsequent sentences are generated from the same type of data structure they express similar information and should therefore be regarded as potentially contrastive, even if their surface forms are different. Pitch accent should be as-signed to those parts of the second sentence that express data which differ from those in the data structure expressed by the first sentence.","Example (1) can be used as illustration. The theory of Prevost will not predict contrastive accent on"]},{"title":"Ajax","paragraphs":["in (1)b, because (1)a does not contain a member of its alternative set.

The fact that the input data structures of the system are organized in such a way that identical data types express semantically parallel information allows us to make use of the world (or domain) knowledge incorporated in the design of these data structures, without having to separately encode this knowledge. This also means","2Sentence (1)b happens not to express the goaltype value of B, but if it did, this phrase should also receive contrastive accent (e.g., 'Twenty minutes later,"]},{"title":"Over- mars","paragraphs":["scored a"]},{"title":"normal","paragraphs":["goal'). 520 that the prediction of contrast does not depend on the linguistic expressions which are chosen to express the input data; the data can be expressed in an indirect way, as in (1)a, without influencing the prediction of contrast.","The approach sketched above will also give the desired result for example (2): sentence (2)c will not be regarded as contrastive with (2)b, since (2)c expresses a goal event but (2)b does not. 4 Future directions An open question which still remains, is at which level data structures should be compared. In other words, how do we deal with sub- and supertypes? For example, apart from the goal_event data type the GoalGetter system also has a card_event type, which specifies at what time which player received a card of which color. Since goal_event and card_event are different types, they are not expected to be contrastible. However, both are subtypes of a more general event type, and if regarded at this higher event level, the structures might be considered as contrast-ible after all. Examples like (3) seem to suggest that this is possible. (3) a In the 11th minute, Ajax took the lead through a goal by Kluivert. b Shortly after the break, the referee handed Nilis a yellow card. c Ten minutes later, Kluivert scored for the second time.","The fact that it is not inappropriate to accent Kluivert in (3)c, shows that (3)c may be regarded as contrastive to (3)b; otherwise, it would be obligatory to deaccent the second mention of Kluivert due to givenness, like PSV in (2)c. Cases like this might be accounted for by assuming that there can be contrast between fields that are shared by data types having the same supertype. In (3), these would be the player and the minute fields of structures C and D, shown in Figure 2. This is a tentative solution which requires further research. player: Nilis ] C: card_event minute:","11 cardtype: yellow team: Ajax D: goal_event player: Kluivert minute:","21 goaltype: normal Figure 2: Data structures expressed by (3)b and c. 5 Conclusion I have sketched a practical approach to the assignment of contrastive accent in data-to-speech systems, which does not need a universal definition of alternative or parallel items. Because the determination of contrast is based on the data expressed by generated sentences, instead of their syntactic structures or semantic reprentations, there is no need for separately encoding world knowledge. The proposed approach is domain-specific in that it relies heavily on the data structures that form the input from generation. On the other hand it is based on a general principle, which should be applicable in any system where typed data structures form the input for linguistic generation. In the near future, the proposed approach will be implemented in GoalGetter.","Acknowledgements: This research was carried out within the Priority Programme Language and Speech Technology (TST), sponsored by NWO (the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research).
