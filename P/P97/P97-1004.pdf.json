This includes a finite-state part of speech tagger, a derivational morphological processor for analysis and generation, and a unification-based shallow-level parser using transformational rules over syntactic patterns. The contribution of this research is the successful combination of parsing over a seed term list coupled with derivational morphology to achieve greater coverage of multi-word terms for indexing and retrieval. Final results are evaluated for precision and recall, and implications for indexing and retrieval are discussed. 1 Motivation Terms are known to be excellent descriptors of the informational content of textual documents (Srinivasan, 1996), but they are subject to numerous linguistic variations. Terms cannot be retrieved properly with coarse text simplification techniques (e.g. stemming); their identification requires precise and efficient NLP techniques. We have developed a domain independent system for automatic term recognition from unrestricted text. The system presented in this paper takes as input a list of controlled terms and a corpus; it detects and marks occurrences of term","We would like to thank the NLP Group of Columbia University, Bell Laboratories - Lucent Technologies, and the Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Nantes for their support of the exchange visitor program for the first author. We also thank the Institut de l'Information Scientifique et Technique (INIST-CNRS) for providing us with the agricultural corpus and the associated term list, and Didier Bourigault for providing us with terms extracted from the newspaper corpus through LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993). variants within the corpus. The system takes as input a precompiled (automatically or manually) term list, and transforms it dynamically into a more complete term list by adding automatically generated variants. This method extends the limits of term extraction as currently practiced in the IR community: it takes into account multiple morphological and syntactic ways linguistic concepts are expressed within language. Our approach is a unique hybrid in allowing the use of manually produced precompiled data as input, combined with fully automatic computational methods for generating term expansions. Our results indicate that we can expand term variations at least 30% within a scientific corpus. 2 Background and Introduction NLP techniques have been applied to extraction of information from corpora for tasks such as free indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), (Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term acquisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Dallle, 1996), or extraction of lin9uistic information e.g. support verbs (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).","Although useful, these approaches suffer from two weaknesses which we address. First is the issue of filtering term lists; this has been dealt with by constraints on processing and by post-processing over-generated lists. Second is the problem of difficulties in identifying related terms across parts of speech. We address these limitations through the use of controlled indexing, that is, indexing with reference to previously available authoritative terms lists, such as (NLM, 1995). Our approach is fully automatic, but permits effective combination of available resources (such as thesauri) with language processing technology, i.e., morphology, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. 24","Automatic controlled indexing is a more difficult task than it may seem at first glance:","• controlled indexing on single-words must account for polysemy and word disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Klavans, 1995).","• controlled indexing on multi-word terms must consider the numerous forms of term variations (Dunham, Pacak, and Pratt, 1978; Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin, 1996). We focus here on the multi-word task. Our system exploits a morphological processor and a transformation-based parser for the extraction of multi-word controlled indexes.","The action of the system is twofold. First, a corpus is enriched by tagging each word unambiguously, and then expanded by linking each word with all its possible derivatives. For example, for English, the word genes is tagged as a plural noun and morphologically connected to genic, genetic, genome, genotoxic, genetically, etc. Second, the term list is dynamically expanded through syntactic transformations which allow the retrieval of term variants. For example, genic expressions, genes were expressed, expression of this gene, etc. are extracted as variants of gene expression.","This system relies on a full-fledged unification for-malism and thus is well adapted to a fine-grained identification of terms related in syntactically and morphologically complex ways. The same system has been effectively applied both to English and French, although this paper focuses on French (see (Jacquemin, 1994) for the case of syntactic variants in English). All evaluation experiments were performed on two corpora: a training corpus [ECI] (ECI, 1989 and 1990) used for the tuning of the metagrammar and a test corpus [AGR] (AGR, 1995) used for evaluation. [ECI] is a subset of the European Corpus Initiative data composed of 1.3 million words of the French newspaper \"Le Monde\"; [AGR] is a set of abstracts of scientific papers in the agricultural domain from INIST/CNRS (1.1 million words). A list of terms is associated with each corpus: the terms corresponding to [ECI] were automatically extracted by LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993) and the terms corresponding to [AGR] were extracted from the AGROVOC term list owned by INIST/CNRS.","The following section describes methods for grouping multi-word term variants; Section 4 presents a linguistically-motivated method for lexical analysis (inflectional analysis, part of speech tagging, and derivational analysis); Section 5 explains term expansion methods: constructions with a local parse through syntactic transformations preserving dependency relations; Section 6 illustrates the empirical tuning of linguistic rules; Section 7 presents an evaluation of the results in terms of precision and recall. 3 Variation in Multi-Word Terms: A Description of the Problem Linguistic variation is a major concern in the studies on automatic indexing. Variations can be classified into three major categories:","• Syntactic (Type 1): the content words of the original term are found in the variant but the syntactic structure of the term is modified, e.g. technique for performing volumetric measurements is a Type 1 variant of measurement technique.","• Morpho-syntaetic (Type 2): the content words of the original term or one of their derivatives are found in the variant. The syntactic structure of the term is also modified, e.g. electrophoresed on a neutral polyaerylamide gel is a Type 2 variant of gel electrophoresis.","• Semantic (Type 3): synonyms are found in the variant; the structure may be modified, e.g. kidney function is a Type 3 variant of renal function. This paper deals with Type 1 and Type 2 variations.","The two main approaches to multi-word term conflation in IR are text simplification and structural similarity. Text simplification refers to traditional IR algorithms such as (1) deletion of stop words, (2) normalization of single words through stemming, and (3) phrase construction through dictionary matching. (See (Lewis, Croft, and Bhandaru, 1989; Smeaton, 1992) on the exploitation of NLP techniques in IR.) These methods are generally limited. The morphological complexity of the language seems to be a decisive argument for performing rich stemming (Popovi~ and Willett, 1992). Since we focus on French, a language with a rich declensional inflectional and derivational morphology--we have chosen the richest and most precise morphological analysis. This is a key component in the recognition of Type 2 variants. For structural similarity, coarse dependency-based NLP methods do not account for fine structural relations involved in Type 1 variants. For instance, properties of flour should be linked to flour properties, properties of wheat flour but not to properties of flour starch (examples are from (Schwarz, 1990)). The last occurrence must be rejected because starch is the argument of the head 25 noun properties, whereas flour is the argument of the head noun properties in the original term. Without careful structural disambiguation over internal phrase structure, these important syntactic distinc-tions would be incorrectly overlooked. 4 Part of Speech Disambiguation and Morphology First, inflectional morphology is performed in order to get the different analyses of word forms. Inflectional morphology is implemented with finite-state transducers on the model used for Spanish (Tzoukermann and Liberman, 1990). The theoretical principles underlying this approach are based on generative morphology (Aronoff, 1976; Selkirk, 1982). The system consists of precomputing stems, extracted from a large dictionary of French (Boyer, 1993) enhanced with newspaper corpora, a total of over 85,000 entries. Second, a finite-state part of speech tagger (Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzoukermann and Radev, 1996) performs the morpho-syntactic disambiguation of words. The tagger takes the output of inflectional morphological analysis and through a combination of linguistic and statistical techniques, outputs a unique part of speech for each word in context. Reducing the ambiguity of part of speech tags eliminates ambiguity in local parsing. Furthermore, part of speech ambiguity resolution permits construction of correct derivational links. Third, derivational morphology (Tzoukermann and Jacquemin, 1997) is achieved to generate morphological variants of the disambiguated words. Derivational generation is performed on the lemmas produced by the inflectional analysis and the part of speech information. Productive stripping and concatenation rules are applied on lemmas.","The derived forms are expressed as tokens with feature structures 1. For instance, the following set of constraints express that the noun modernisateur is morphologically related to the word modernisation 2 . The <ON> metarule removes the -ion suffix, and the <EUR> rule adds the nominal suffix -eur.","1In the remainder of the paper, N is Noun, A Adjective, C Coordinating conjunction, D Determiner, P Preposition, Av Adverb, Pu Punctuation, NP Noun Phrase, and AP Adjective Phrase.","2Each lemma has a unique numeric identifier <reference>. <cat> =- N <lemma> =- 'modernisation' <reference> = 52663 <derivation cat> -- N <derivation lemma> = 'modernisateur' <derivation reference> = 52662 <derivation history> -- '<ON<>EUR>'.","The morphological analysis performed in this study is detailed in (Tzoukermann, Klavans, and Jacquemin, 1997). It is more complete and linguistically more accurate than simple stemming for the following reasons:","• Allomorphy is accounted for by listing the set of its possible allomorphs for each word. A1lomorphies are obtained through multiple verb stems, e.g. ]abriqu-, ]abric- (fabricate) or additional allomorphic rules.","• Concatenation of several suffixes is accounted for by rule ordering mechanisms. Furthermore, we have devised a method for guessing possible suffix combinations from a lexicon and a corpus. This empirical method reported in (Jacquemin, 1997) ensures that suffixes which are related within specific domains are considered.","• Derivational morphology is built with the perspective of overgeneration. The nature of the semantic links between a word and its derivational forms is not checked and all allomorphic alternants are generated. Selection of the correct links occurs during subsequent term expansion process with collocational filtering. Although dtable (cowshed) is incorrectly related to dtablir (to establish), it is very improbable to find a context where dtablir co-occurs with one of the three words found in the three multi-word terms containing dtable: nettoyeur (cleaner), alimenration (feeding), and liti~re (litter): Since we focus on multi-word term variants, overgenera-tion does not present a problem in our system. 5 Transformation-Based Term Expansion The extraction of terms and their variants from corpora is performed by a unification-based parser. The controlled terms are transformed into grammar rules whose syntax is similar to PATR-II. 5.1 A Corpus-Based Method for Discovering Syntactic Transformations We present a method for inferring transformations from a corpus in the purpose of developing a gram-26 mar of syntactic transformations for term variants. To discover the families of term variants, we first consider a notion of collocation which is less restrictive than variation. Then, we refine this notion in order to filter out genuine variants and to reject spurious ones. A Type 1 collocation of a binary term is a text window containing its content words wl and w2, without consideration of the syntactic structure. With such a definition, any Type 1 variant is a Type 1 collocation. Similarly, a notion of Type 2 collocation is defined based on the co-occurence of wl and w2 including their derivational relatives.","A d=5-word window is considered as sufficient for detecting collocations in English (Martin, A1, and Van Sterkenburg, 1983). We chose a window-size twice as large because French is a Romance language with longer syntactic structures due to the absence of compounding, and because we want to be sure to observe structures spanning over large textual sequences. For example, the term perte au stockage (storage loss) is encountered in the [AGR] corpus as: pertes occasionndes par les insectes au sorgho stockd (literally: loss of stored sorghum due to the insects).","A linguistic classification of the collocations which are correct variants brings up the following families of variations a.","• Type 1 variations are classified according to their syntactic stucture.","1. Coordination: a coordination the combination of two terms with a common head word or a common argument. Thus, fruits et agrumes tropicaux (literally: tropical citrus fruits or fruits) is a coordination variant of the term fruits tropicaux (tropical fruits).","2. Substitution/Modification: a substitution is the replacement of a content word by a term; a modification is the insertion of a modifier without reference to another term. For example, activitd thermodynamique de l'eau (thermodynamic activity of water) is a substitution variant of activitg de l'eau (activity of water) if activitd thermodynamique (thermodynamic activity) is a term; otherwise, it is a modification.","3. Compounding/Decompounding: in French, most terms have a compound noun structure, i.e. a noun phrase structure where determiners are omitted such as consommation d'oxyg~ne (oxygen consump-tion). The decompounding variation is the","3 Variations are generic linguistic functions and variants are transformations of terms by these functions. transformation of a term with a compound structure into a noun phrase structure such as consommation de l'oxyg~ne (consump-tion of the oxygen). Compounding is the reciprocal transformation.","• Type 2 variations are classified according to the nature of the morphological derivation. Often semantic shifts are involved as well (Viegas, Gonzalez, and Longwell, 1996).","1. Noun-Noun variations: relations such as result/agent (fixation de l'azote (nitrogen fixation) / fixateurs d ' azote (nitrogen fixater)) or container/content (rdservoir d ' eau (water reservoir) / rdserve en eau (water reserve)) are found in this family.","2. Noun-Verb variations: these variations often involve semantic shifts such as process/result fixation de l'azote/fixer l'azote (to fix nitrogen).","3. Noun-Adjective variations: the two ways to modify a noun, a prepositional phrase or an adjectival phrase, are generally semantically equivalent, e.g. variation du climat (climate variation) is a synonym of variation climatique (climatic variation).","A method for term variant extraction based on morphology and simple co-occurrences would be very imprecise. A manual observation of collocations shows that only 55% of the Type 1 collocations are correct Type 1 variants and that only 52% of the Type 2 collocations are correct Type 2 variants. It is therefore necessary to conceive a filtering method for rejecting fortuitous co-occurrences. The following section proposes a filtering system based on syntactic patterns. 6 Empirical Rule Tuning 6.1 Syntactic Transformations for Type 1","and Type 2 variants The concept of a grammar of syntactic transformations is motivated by well-known observations on the behavior of collocations in context (e.g. (Harris et al., 1989).) Initial rules based on surface syntax are refined through incremental experimental tuning.","We have devised a grammar of French to serve as a basis for the creation of metarules for term variants. For example, the noun phrase expansion rule is4:"]},{"title":"NP -~ D: AP*N (APIPP)* (1)","paragraphs":["awe use UNIX regular expression symbols for rules and transformations. 27 From this rule a set of expansions can be generated: NP = D ? (Av ? A)* N (Av ? A I (2) P D ? (Av ? A)* N (Av ? A)*)* In order to balance completeness and accuracy, expansions are limited. After the initial expansion is created for a range of structures, empirical tuning is applied to create a set of maximum coverage metarules.","We briefly illustrate this process for coordination. For this example, we restrict transformations to terms with N P N structures which represent a full 33% of the binary terms. Examples of metarules of Type 1 and Type 2 variations are given in Table 1. 6.2 Development of a Coordination","Transformation for N P N Terms The coordination types are first calculated by combining the pattern N1 P2 Ns with possible expansions of a noun phrase with a simple paradigmatic structure A TN(AIPD ? A ?NAT)s:","Coord(N1 P2 Ns) = N1 ((C A T N A T P) I (3) (A C P) I (P D? AT N A T C P?)) N3 The first parenthesis (C A T N A ? P) represents a coordinated head noun, the second (A C P) and third (P D ? A T N A T C P?) represent respectively an adjective phrase and a prepositional phrase coordinated with the prepositional phrase of the original term.","Variants were extracted on the [ECI] corpus through this transformation; the following observations and changes have been made.","First, coordination accepts a substitution which replaces the noun N3 with a noun phrase D ? A T Ns. For example, the variant tempdrature et humiditd initiale de Pair (temperature and initial humidity of the air) is a coordination where a determiner precedes the last noun (air).","Secondly, the observations of coordination variants also suggest that the coordinating conjunction can be preceded by an optional comma and followed by an optional adverb, e.g. la production, et surtout la diffusion des semences (the production, and particularly the distribution of the seeds).","Thirdly, variants such as de l'humiditd et de la vitesse de l'air (literally: of humidity and of the speed of the air) indicate that the conjunction can be followed by an optional preposition and an optional determiner. 5Subscripts represent indexing.","The three preceding changes are made on the expression of (3) and the resulting transformation is given in the first line of Table 1 (changes are underlined).","Our empirical selection of valid metarules is guided by linguistic considerations and corpus observations. This mode of grammar conception has led us to the following decisions:","• reject linguistic phenomena which could not be accounted for by regular expressions such as sentential complements of nouns;","• reject noisy and inaccurate variations such as long distance dependencies (specifically within a verb phrase);","• focus on productive and safe variations which are felicitously represented in our framework. Accounting for variants which are not considered in our framework would require the conception of a novel framework, probably in cooperation with a deeper analyzer. It is unlikely that our transformational approach with regular expressions could do much better than the results presented here. Table 2 shows some variants of AGROVOC terms extracted from the [AGR] corpus. 7 Evaluation The precision and recall of the extraction of term variants are given in Table 4 where precision is the ratio of correct variants among the variants extracted and the recall is the ratio of variants retrieved among the collocates. Results were obtained through a manual inspection of 1,579 Type 1 variants, 823 Type 2 variants, 3,509 Type 1 collocates, and 2,104 Type 2 collocates extracted from the [AGR] corpus and the AGROVOC term list.","These results indicate a very high level of accuracy: 89.4% of the variants extracted by the system are correct ones. Errors generally correspond to a semantic discrepancy between a word and its morphologically derived form. For example, dlevde pour un sol (literally: high for a soil) is not a correct variant of dlevage hors sol (off-soil breeding) because dlevde and dlevage are morphologically related to two different senses of the verb dlever:, dlevde derives from the meaning to raise whereas dlevage derives from to breed. Recall is weaker than precision because only 75.2% of the possible variants are retrieved. Improvement of Indexing through Variant Extraction For a better understanding of the importance of term expansion, we now compare term indexing with 28 Table 1: Metarules of Type 1 (Coordination) and Type 2 (Noun to Verb) Variations.

The [AGR] corpus has been indexed with the AGROVOC thesaurus in two different ways:","1. Simple indexing: Extraction of occurrences of multi-word terms without considering variation.","2. Rich indexing: Simple indexing improved with the extraction of variants of multi-word terms. Both indexings have been manually checked. Simple indexing is almost error-free but does not cover term variants. On the contrary, rich indexing is slightly less accurate but recall is much higher. Both methods are compared by calculating the effectiveness measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1975):","1 E~=l-a(_~)+(l_a)(_~) with0<a<l (4) P and R are precision and recall and a is a parameter which is close to 1 if precision is preferred to recall. The value of E~ varies from 0 to 1; E~ is close to 0 when all the relevant conflations are made and when no incorrect one is made.","The effectiveness of rich indexing is more than three times better than effectiveness of simple indexing. Retrieved variants increase the number Table 3: Evaluation of Simple vs. Rich Indexing.

Thus, term variant extraction is a significant expansion factor for identifying morphologically and syntactically related multi-word terms in a document without introducing undesirable noise.","As for performance, the parser is fast enough for processing large amounts of textual data due to the presence of several optimization devices. On a Pentium133 with Linux, the parser processes 18,100 words/min from an initial list of 4,300 terms."]},{"title":"Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has proposed a syntax-based approach via morphologically derived forms for the identification and extraction of multi-word term variants. 29 Table 4: Precision and Recall of Term Variant Extraction on [AGR] Type 1 variants Type 2 variants Total Subst.
