Misparsing reduced by omissions has a far-reaching consequence in machine translation. Namely, a misparse of the input often leads to a translation into the target language which has incoherent meaning in the given context. This is more frequently the case if the structures of the source and target languages are quite different, as in English and Korean. Thus, the question of how we parse telegraphic messages accurately and efficiently becomes a critical issue in machine translation. In this paper we describe a technical solution for the issue, and reSent the performance evaluation of a machine transtion system on telegraphic messages before and after adopting the proposed solution. The solution lies in a grammar design in which lexicalized grammar rules defined in terms of semantic categories and syntactic rules defined in terms of part-of-speech are utilized to-ether. The proposed grammar achieves a higher parsg coverage without increasing the amount of ambiguity/misparsing when compared with a purely lexicalized semantic grammar, and achieves a lower degree of. ambiguity/misparses without, decreasing the parsmg coverage when compared with a purely syntactic grammar."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Achieving the goal of producing high quality machine translation output is hindered by lexica] and syntactic ambiguity of the input sentences. Lexical ambiguity may be greatly reduced by limiting the domain to be translated. However, the same is not generally true for syntactic ambiguity.

Misparsing triggered by the ambiguity ot the input sentence often leads to a mistranslation in a machine translation system. Therefore, the issue becomes how to parse tele.graphic messages accurately and efficiently to produce high quahty translation output.","In general the syntactic ambiguity of an input text may be greatly reduced by introducing semantic categories in the grammar to capture the co-occurrence restrictions of the input string.

A","awback of this approach, however, is that the grammar coverage is quite low. On the other hand, grammar coverage may be maximized when we rely on syntactic rules defined in terms of part-of-speech at the cost of a high degree of ambiguity. Thus, the goal of maximizing the parsing coverage while minimizing the ambiguity may be achieved by adequately combining lexicalized rules with semantic categories, and non-lexicalized rules with syntactic categories. The question is how much semantic and syntactic information is necessary to achieve such a goal.","In this paper we propose that an adequate amount of lexical information to reduce the ambiguity in general originates from verbs, which provide information on subcategorization, and prepositions, which are critical for PP-attachment ambiguity resolution. For the given domain, lexicalizing domain-specific expressions which typically occur in phrases with omission is adequate for ambiguity resolution. Our experimental results show that the mix of syntactic and semantic grammar as proposed here has advantages over either a syntactic grammar or a lexicalized semantic grammar. Compared with a syntactic grammar, the proposed grammar achieves a much lower degree of ambiguity without decreasing the grammar coverage. Compared with a lexicalized semantic grammar, the proposed grammar achieves a higher rate of parsing coverage without increasing the ambiguity. Furthermore, the generality introduced by the syntactic rules facilitates the porting of the system to other domains as well as enablin.g the system to handle unknown words efficiently.","This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the motivation for lexicalizing grammar rules with semantic categories in the context of translating telegraphic messages, and its drawbacks with respect to parsing coverage. In section 3 we propose a grammar writing technique which minimizes the ambiguity of the input and maximizes the parsing coverage. In section 4 we give our experimental results of the technique on the basis of two sets of unseen test data. In section 5 we discuss system engineering issues to accommodate the proposed technique, i.e., integration of part-of-speech tagger and the adaptation of the understanding system.

The hierarchical structure of the parse tree is preserved in the semantic frame, and therefore a misparse of the input sentence leads to a mistranslation. Suppose that the sentence (1) is misparsed as an active rather than a passive sentence due to the omission of the verb was, and that the prepositional phrase 220 nm is misparsed as the direct object of the verb destroy. These instances of misunderstanding are reflected in the semantic frame.

In the sections below we discuss one such method in terms of grammar design and some of its side effects.x 2.1 Lexicalization of Grammar Rules with","Semantic Categories In the domain of naval operational report messages (MUC-II messages hereafter), 4 (Sundheim, 1989), we find two types of ellipsis.

However, relying on a semantic module for ambiguity resolution implies that the parser needs to produce all possible parses of the input text andcarry them along, thereby requiring a more complex understanding process.","One way of reducing the ambiguity at an early stage of processing without relying on a semantic module is to incorporate domain/semantic knowledge into the grammar as follows:","• Lexicalize grammar rules to delimit the lexical items which typically occur in phrases with omission;","• Introduce semantic categories to capture the co-occurrence restrictions of lexical items.","Some example grammar rules instantiating these ideas are given in (7)."]},{"title":"(7)","paragraphs":["a..locative_PP {at in near off on ...} NP headless_PP","e..np_distance numeric nautical_mile numeric yard","e..time_expression [at] numeric gmt b..headless_PP","[all np-distance","a np_bearing","d..temporal_PP","(during after prior_to ...} NP","time_expression","f..gmt","z","(7)a states that a locative prepositional phrase consists of a subset of prepositions and a noun phrase.

The head nouns which typically occur in prepositional phrases with the preposition omission are nautical miles and yard. The rest of the rules can be read in a similar manner. And it is clear how such lexicalized rules with the semantic categories reduce the syntactic ambiguity of the input text. 2.2 Drawbacks Whereas the language processing is very efficient when a system relies on a lexicalized semantic grammar, there are some drawbacks as well.","• Since the grammar is domain and word specific, it is not easily ported to new constructions and new domains.","• Since the vocabulary items are entered in the grammar as part of lexicalized grammar rules, if an input sentence contains words unknown to the grammar, parsing fails.","These drawbacks are reflected in the performance evaluation of our machine translation system.

The results are shown in Table 1. The system was also evaluated on the data which were collected from an in-house experiment.

Table 2 indicates that even for sentences constructed to be similar to the training data, the grammar coverage is about 43%, again excluding the parsing failures due to unknown words. The misparse 5 rate with respect to the total parsed sentences ranges between 8.7% and 14.6%, which is considered to be highly accurate. 3 Incorporation of Syntactic Knowledge Considering the low parsing coverage of a semantic grammar which relies on domain specific knowledse, and the fact that the successful parsing of the input sentence ks a prerequisite for producing translation output, it is critical to improve the parsing coverage. Such a goal may be achieved by incorporating syntactic rules into the ~ammar while retaining lexical/semantic information to minim'ize the ambiguity of the input text. The question is: how much semantic and syntactic information is necessary? We propose a solution, as in (8): (8) (a) Rules involving verbs and prepositions need to be lexicalized to resolve the prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity, cf. (Brill and Resnik, 1993).

Compared with a lex-","lzed semantic grammar, this grammar achieves a higher parsing coverage without increasing the amount of ambiguity/misparsing. When compared with a syntactic grammar, this grammar achieves a lower degree of ambiguity/misparsing without decreasing the parsing rate. 5 System Engineering An input to the parser driven by a grammar which utilizes both syntactic and lexicalized semantic rules consists of words (to be covered by lexicalized semantic rules) and parts-of-speech (to be covered by syntactic rules). To accommodate the part-of-speech input to the parser, the input sentence has to be part-of-speech tagged before parsing. To produce an adequate translation output from the input containing parts-of-speech, there has to be a mechanism by which parts-of-speech are used for parsing purposes, and the corresponding lexical items are used for the semantic frame representation. 5.1 Integration of Rule-Based Part-of-Speech","Tagger To accommodate the part-of-speech input to the parser, we have integrated the rule-based part-of-speech tagger, (Brill, 1992), (Brill, 1995), as a preprocessor to the language understanding system TINA, as in Figure 8. An advantage of integrating a part-of-speech tagger over a lexicon containing part-of-speech information is that only the former can tag words which are new to the system, and provides a way of handling unknown words.","While most stochastic taggers require a large amount of training data to achieve high rates of tagging accuracy, the rule-based","eThe parsing coverage of the semantic grammar, i.e. 34.8%, is after discounting the parsing failure due to words unknown to the ~rammar. The reason why we do not give the statistics of the parsing failure due to unknown words for the syntactic and the mixed grammar is because the part-of-speech tagging process, which will be discussed in detail in Section 5, has the effect of handling unknown words, and therefore the problem does not arise.

Given that the size of our training corpus is fairly small (total 7716 words), a transformation-based tagger is wellsuited to our needs.","The transformation-based part-of-speech tagger operates in two stages. Each word in the tagged training corpus has an entry in the lexicon consisting of a partially ordered list of tags, indicating the most likely tag for that word, and all other tags seen with that word (in no particular order). Every word is first assigned its most likely tag in isolation. Unknown words are first assumed to be nouns, and then cues based upon prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and adjacent word co-occurrences are used to upgrade the most likely tag. Secondly, after the most likely tag for each word is assigned, contextual transformations are used to improve the accuracy.","We have evaluated the tagger performance on the TEST Data both before and after training on the MUC-II corpus.

These high rates of tagging accuracy are largely due to two factors: (1) Combination of domain specific contextual rules obtained by training the MUC-II corpus with general contextual rules obtained by training the WSJ corpus; And (2) Combination of the MUC-II lexicon with the lexicon for the WSJ corpus. 5.2 Adaptation of the Understanding System The understanding system depicted in Figure 1 derives the semantic frame representation directly from the parse tree. The terminal symbols (i.e. words in general) in the parse tree are represented as vocabulary items in the semantic frame. Once we allow the parser to take part-of-speech as the input, the parts-of-speech (rather than actual words) will appear as the terminal symbols in the parse tree, and hence as the vocabulary items in the semantic frame representation. We adapted the system so that the part-of-speech tags are used for parsing, but are replaced with the original words in the final semantic frame. Generation can then proceed as usual.
