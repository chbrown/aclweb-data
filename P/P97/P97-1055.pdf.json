Given a pronunciation lexicon, this algorithm first extracts the most productive paradigmatic mappings in the graphemic domain, and pairs them statistically with their correlate(s) in the phonemic domain. These mappings are used to search and retrieve in the lexical database the most promising analog of unseen words. We finally apply to the analogs pronunciation the correlated series of mappings in the phonemic domain to get the desired pronunciation. 1 Motivation Psychological models of reading aloud traditionally assume the existence of two separate routes for converting print to sound: a direct lexical route, which is used to read familiar words, and a dual route rely-ing upon abstract letter-to-sound rules to pronounce previously unseen words (Coltheart, 1978; Coltheart et al., 1993). This view has been challenged by a number of authors (e.g. (Glushsko, 1981)), who claim that the pronunciation process of every word, familiar or unknown, could be accounted for in a unified framework. These single-route models crucially suggest that the pronunciation of unknown words results from the parallel activation of similar lexical items (the"]},{"title":"lexical neighbours).","paragraphs":["This idea has been tentatively implemented both into various symbolic analogy-based algorithms (e.g. (Dedina and Nusbaum, 1991; Sullivan and Damper, 1992)) and into connectionist pronunciation devices (e.g. (Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989)).","The basic idea of these analogy-based models is to pronounce an unknown word x by recombin-ing pronunciations of lexical items sharing common subparts with x.

This alignment makes it possible to retrieve, for any graphemic substring of a given lexical item, the corresponding phonemic string, at the cost however of an unmotivated complexification of lexical representations.","In comparison, the paradigmati c cascades model (PCP for short) promotes an alternative view of analogical processes, which relies upon a linguistically motivated similarity measure between words. 428 The basic idea of our model is to take advantage of the internal structure of \"natural\" lexicons. In fact, a lexicon is a very complex object, whose elements are intimately tied together by a number of fine-grained relationships (typically induced by morphological processes), and whose content is severely restricted, on a language-dependant basis, by a complex of graphotactic, phonotactic and morphotactic constraints. Following e.g. (Pirrelli and Federici, 1994), we assume that these constraints surface simultaneously in the orthographical and in the phonological domain in the recurring pattern of paradigmatically alterning pairs of lexical items. Extending the idea originally proposed in (Federici, Pirrelli, and Yvon, 1995), we show that it is possible to extract these alternation patterns, to associate alternations in one domain with the related alternation in the other domain, and to construct, using this pairing, a fairly reliable pronunciation procedure."]},{"title":"2 The Paradigmatic Cascades","paragraphs":["Model In this section, we introduce the paradigmatic cascades model.

A paradigmatic relationship involves four lexical entries a, b, c, d, and expresses that these forms are involved in an analogical (in the Saussurian (de Saussure, 1916) sense) proportion: a is to b as e is to d (further along abbreviated as a : b = c : d, see also (Lepage and Shin-Ichi, 1996) for another utilization of this kind of proportions). Morphologically related pairs provide us with numerous examples of orthographical proportions, as in: reactor : reaction = factor : faction (1) Considering these proportions in terms of orthographical alternations, that is in terms of partial fnnctions in the graphemic domain, we can see that each proportion involves two alternations.

Lexical neighbourhoods in the paradigmatic cascades model are thus defined with respect to the locally most productive alternations. As a consequence, the definition of neighbourhoods implicitely incorporates a great deal of linguistic knowledge extracted fl'om the lexicon, especially regarding morphological processes and phonotactic constraints, which makes it much for relevant for grounding the notion of analogy between lexical items than, say, any neighbourhood based on the string edition metric. 2.3 The Pronunciation of Unknown Words Supose now that we wish to infer the pronunciation of a word x, which does not appear in the lexicon. This goal is achieved by exploring the neighbourhood of x defined by A, in order to find one or several analogous lexica.1 entry(ies) y. The second stage of the pronunciation procedure is to adapt the known pronunciation of y, and derive a suitable pronunciation for x: the idea here is to mirror in the phonemic domain the series of alternations which transform x into y in the graphemic domain, using the statistical pairing between alternations that is extracted during the learning stage. The complete pronunciation procedure is represented on figure 2.","Let us examine carefully how these two aspects of the pronunciation procedure are implemented. The first stage is I;o find a lexical entry in the neighbour-430 Graphcmic domain Phonemic domain Figure 2: The pronunciation of an unknown word hood of x defined by L:.","The basic idea is to generate A(x), defined as {Ai(x), forAi E ,4, x E domain(Ai)}, which contains all the words that can be derived from x using a function in ,4. This set, better viewed as a stack, is ordered according to the productivity of the Ai: the topmost element in the stack is the nearest neighbour of x, etc. The first lexical item found in fl, (x) is the analog of x. If A (x) does not contain any known word, we iterate the procedure, using x I, the top-ranked element of .4 (x), instead of x. This expands the set of possible analogs, which is accordingly reordered, etc. This basic search strategy, which amounts to the exploration of a derivation tree, is extremely ressource consuming (every expension stage typically adds about a hundred of new virtual analogs), and is, in theory, not guaranted to terminate. In fact, the search problem is equivalent to the problem of parsing with an unrestricted Phrase Structure Grammar, which is known to be undecidable.","We have evaluated two different search strategies, which implement various ways to alternate between expansion stages (the stack is expanded by generating the derivatives of the topmost element) and matching stages (elements in the stack are looked for in the lexicon). The first strategy implements a depth-first search of the analog set: each time the topmost element of the stack is searched, but not found, in the lexicon, its derivatives are immediately generated, and added to the stack. In this approach, the position of an analog in the stack is assessed a.s a function of the \"distance\" between the original word x and the analog y = A~ (A~_, (... A~ (x))), according to:","l=k"]},{"title":"d(x, y) = 1-I","paragraphs":["/----1 The search procedure is stopped as soon an analog is found in L:a, or else, when the distance between x and the topmost element of the stack, which monotonously decreases (Vi, pi < 1), falls below a pre-defined theshold.","The second strategy implements a kind of compromise between depth-first and breadth-first exploration of the derivation tree, and is best understood if we first look at a concrete example. Most alternations substituting one initial consonant are very productive, in English like in many other languages. Therefore, a word starting with say, a p, is very likely to have a very close derivative where the initial p has been replaced by say, a r. Now suppose that this word starts with pl: the alternation will derive an analog starting with rl, and will assess it with a very high score. This analog will, in turn, derive many more virtual analogs starting with rl, once its suffixes will have been substituted during another expansion phase. This should be avoided, since there are in fact very few words starting with the prefix rl: we would therefore like these words to be very poorly ranked. The second search strategy has been devised precisely to cope with this problem. The idea is to rank the stack of analogs according to the expectation of the number of lexical derivatives a given analog may have. This expectation is computed by summing up the productivities of all the alternations that can be applied to an analog y according to:","p,"]},{"title":"(61","paragraphs":["i/yEdom(Ai) This ranking will necessarily assess any analog starting in rl with a low score, as very few alternations will substitute its prefix. However, the computation of (6) is much more complex than (5), since it requires to examine a given derivative before it can be positioned in the stack. This led us to bring for-ward the lexical matching stage: during the expansion of the topmost stack element, all its derivatives are looked for in the lexicon. If several derivatives are simultaneously found, the search procedure halts and returns more than one analog.","The expectation (6) does not decrease as more derivatives are added to the stack; consequently, it cannot be used to define a stopping criterion. The search procedure is therefore stopped when al} derivatives up to a given depth (2 in our experiments) have been generated, and unsuccessfully looked for in the lexicon. This termination criterion is very restrictive, in comparison to the one implemented in the depth-first strategy, since it makes it impossible to pronounce very long derivatives, for which a significant number of alternations need to 431 be applied before an analog is found. An example is the word synergistically, for which the \"breadth-first\" search terminates uncessfully, whereas the depth-first search manages to retrieve the \"analog\" energy. Nonetheless, the results reported hereafter have been obtained using this \"breadth-first\" strategy, mainly because this search was associated with a more efficient procedure for reconstructing pronunciations (see below).","Various pruning procedures have also been implemented in order to control the exponential growth of the stack. For example, one pruning procedure detects the most obvious derivation cycles, which generate in loops the same derivatives; another pruning procedure tries to detect commutating alternations: substituting the prefix p, and then the suffix s often produces the same analog than when alternations apply in the reverse order, etc. More details regarding implementational aspects are given in (Yvon, 1996b).","If the search procedure returns an analog y ="]},{"title":"Aik(Aik_~(...Ail(x)))","paragraphs":["in £, we can build a pronunciation for x, using the known pronunciation ¢(y) of y.

The reason for using multiple analogs is twofold: first, it obviates the risk of being wrongly influenced by one very exceptional analog; second, it enables us to model conspiracy effects more accurately. Psychological models of reading aloud indeed assume that the pronunciation of an unknown word is not influenced by just one analog, but rather by its entire lexical neighbourhood."]},{"title":"3 Experimental Results","paragraphs":["3.1 Experimental Design We have evaluated this algorithm on two different pronunciation tasks. The first experiment consists in infering the pronunciation of the 70 pseudo-words originally used in Glushko's experiments, which have been used as a test-bed for various other pronunciation algorithms, and allow for a fair head-to-head comparison between the paradigmatic cascades model and other analogy-based procedures. For this experiment, we have used the entire nettalk (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987) database (about 20 000 words) as the learning set.","The second series of experiments is intended to provide a more realistic evaluation of our model ill the task of pronouncing unknown words. We have used the following experimental design: 10 pairs of disjoint (learning set, test set) are randomly selected from the nettalk database and evaluated. In each experiment, the test set contains abou~ the tenth of the available data. A transcription is judged to be correct when it matches exactly the pronuncia-- tion listed in the database at the segmental level. The number of correct phonemes in a transcription is computed on the basis of the string-to-string edit distance with the target pronunciation. For each experiment, we measure the percentage of phoneme and words that are correctly predicted (referred to as correctness), and two additional figures, which are usually not significant in context of the evaluation of transcription systems. Recall that our algorithm, unlike many other pronunciation algorithms, is likely to remain silent. In order to take this aspect into account, we measure in each experiment the number of words that can not be pronounced at all (the silence), and the percentage of phonemes and words that are correctly transcribed amongst those words that have been pronounced at all (the precision). The average values for these measures are reported hereafter. 3.2 Pseudo-words All but one pseudo-words of Glushko's test set could be pronounced by the paradigmatic cascades algorithm, and amongst the 69 pronunciation suggested by our program, only 9 were uncorrect (that is, were not proposed by human subjects in Glushko's experiments), yielding an overall correctness of 85.7%, and a precision of 87.3%.","An important property of our algortihm is that it allows to precisely identify, for each pseudo-word, the lexical entries that have been analogized, i.e. whose pronunciation was used in the inferential process. Looking at these analogs, it appears that three of our errors are grounded on very sensible analogies, and provide us with pronunciations that seem at least plausible, even if they were not suggested in Glushko's experiments.

The careful exalnination of the words that cannot be pronounced reveals that they are either loan words, which are very isolated in an English lexicon, and .for which no analog can be found; or complex morphological derivatives for which the search procedure is stopped before the existing analog(s) can be reached. Typical examples are: synergistically, timpani, hangdog, oasis, pemmican, to list just a few. This suggests that the words which were not pronounced are not randomly distributed. Instead, they mostly belong to a linguistically homogeneous group, the group of foreign words, which, for lack of better evidence, should better be left silent, or processed by another pronnnciation procedure (for example a rule-based system (Coker, Church, and Liberman, 1990)), than uncorrectly analogized.","Some complementary results finally need to be mentioned here, in relation to the size of lexical neighbourhoods. In fact, one of our main goal was to define in a sensible way the concept of a lexical neighbourhood: it is therefore important to check that our model manages to keep this neighbourhood relatively small. Indeed, if this neighbourhood can be quite large (typically 50 analogs) for short words, the number of analogs used in a pronunciation averages at about 9.5, which proves that our definition of a lexical ncighbourhood is sufficiently restrictive."]},{"title":"4 Discussion and Perspectives","paragraphs":["4.1 Related works A large number of procedures aiming at the automatic discovery of pronunciation \"rules\" have been proposed over the past few years: connectionist models (e.g. (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987)), traditional symbolic machine learning techniques (in-duction of decision trees, k-nearest neighbours) e.g. (Torkolla, 1993; van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993), as well as various recombination techniques (Yvon, 1996a). In these models, orthographical correspondances are primarily viewed as resulting from a strict underlying phonographical system, where each grapheme encodes exactly one phoneme. This assumption is reflected by the possibility of align-ing on a one-to-one basis graphemic and phonemic strings, and these models indeed use this kind of alignment t.o initiate learning. Under this view, tile orthographical representation of individual words is strongly subject to their phonological forms on an word per word basis. The main task of a machine-learning algorithm is thus mainly to retrieve, on a statistical basis, these grapheme-phoneme correspondances, which are, in languages like French or 433 English, accidentally obscured by a multitude of exceptional and idiosyncratic correspondances. There exists undoubtly strong historical evidences support-ing the view that the orthographical system of most european languages developped from a such phonographical system, and languages like Spanish or Italian still offer examples of that kind of very regular organization.","Our model, which extends the proposals of (Coker, Church, and Liberman, 1990), and more recently, of (Federici, Pirrelli, and Yvon, 1995), entertains a different view of orthographical systems. Even we if acknowledge the mostly phonographical organiza-tion of say, French orthography, we believe that the nmltiple deviations from a strict grapheme-phoneme correspondance are best captured in a model which weakens somehow the assumption of a strong dependancy between orthographical and phonological representations. In our model, each domain has its own organization, which is represented in the form of systematic (paradigmatic) set of oppositions and alternations. In both domain however, this organization is subject to the same paradigmatic principle, which makes it possible to represent the relationships between orthographical and phonological representations in the form of a statistical pairing between alternations. Using this model, it be-comes possible to predict correctly the outcome in the phonological domain of a given derivation in the orthographic domain, including patterns of vocalic alternations, which are notoriously difficult to model using a \"rule-based\" approach. 4.2","Achievements The paradigmatic cascades model offers an original and new framework for extracting information from large corpora. In the particular context of grapheme-to-phoneme transcription, it provides us with a more satisfying model of pronunciation by analogy, which:","• gives a principled way to automatically learn local similarities that implicitely incorporate a substantial knowledge of the morphological processes and of the phonotactic constraints, both in the graphemic and the phonemic domain. This has allowed us to precisely define and identify the content of lexical neighbourhoods;","• achieves a very high precision without resorting to pre-aligned data, and detects automaticMly those words that are potentially the most difficult to pronounce (especially foreign words). Interestingly, the ability of our model to process data which are not aligned makes it directly applicable to the reverse problem, i.e. phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. is computationally tractable, even if extremely ressource-consuming in the current version of our algorithm. The main trouble here comes from isolated words: for these words, the search procedure wastes a lot of time examining a very large number of very unlikely analogs, before re-alizing that there is no acceptable lexical neighbout. This aspect definitely needs to be improved. We intend to explore several directions to improve this search: one possibility is to use a graphotactieal model (e.g. a rt-gram model) in order to make the pruning of the derivation tree more effective. We expect such a model to bias the search in favor of short words, which are more represented than very long derivatives. Another possibility is to tag, during the learning stage, alternations with one or several morphosyntactic labels expressing morphotactical restrictions: this would restrict the domain of an alternation to a certain class of words, and accordingly reduce the expansion of the analog set. 4.3 Perspectives The paradigmatic cascades model achieves quite satisfactory generalization performances when evaluated in the task of pronouncing unknown words. Moreover, this model provides us with an effective way to define the lexical neighbourhood of a given word, on the basis of \"surface\" (orthographical) local similarities. It remains however to be seen how this model can be extended to take into account other factors which have been proven to influence analogical processes. For instance, frequency effects, which tend to favor the more frequent lexical neighbours, need to be properly model, if we wish to make a more realistic account of the human performance in the pronunciation task.","In a more general perspective, tile notion of similarity between linguistic objects plays a central role in many corpus-based natural language processing applications. This is especially obvious in the context of example-based learning techniques, where the inference of some unknown linguistics property of a new object is performed on the basis of the most similar available example(s). The use of some kind of similarity measure has also demonstrated its effectiveness to circumvent the problem of data sparseness in the context of statistical language modeling.","In this context, we believe that our model, which is precisely capable of detecting local similarities in 434 lexicons, and to 16erform, on the basis of these sinailarities~ a global inferential transfer of knowledge, is especially well suited for a large range of NLP tasks. Encouraging results on the task of learning the English past-tense forms have already l~een reported in (Yvon, 1996b), and we intend to continue to test this model on various other potentially relevant applications, such as morpho-syntactical \"guessing\", part-of-speech tagging, etc."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Coker, Cecil H., Kenneth W.
