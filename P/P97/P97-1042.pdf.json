Rule features are incorporated into the right context of rules. This general notion can also be applied to other algorithms which compile regular rewrite rules into automata. 1 Introduction The past few years have witnessed an increased in-terest in applying finite-state methods to language and speech problems. This in turn generated interest in devising algorithms for compiling rules which describe regular languages/relations into finite-state automata.","It has long been proposed that regular formalisms (e.g., rewrite rules, two-level formalisms) accommodate rule features which provide for finer and more elegant descriptions (Bear, 1988). Without such a mechanism, writing complex grammars (say two-level grammars for Syriac or Arabic morphology) would be difficult, if not impossible. Algorithms which compile regular grammars into automata (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Mohri and Sproat, 1996; Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996) do not make use of this important mechanism. This paper presents a method for incorporating rule features in the resulting automata.","The following Syriac example is used here, with the infamous Semitic root {ktb} 'notion of writing'. The verbal pa\"el measure 1, /katteb/~ 'wrote CAUSATIVE ACTIVE', is derived from the following 1Syriac verbs are classified under various measures (i.e., forms), the basic ones being p'al, pa \"el and 'a/'el. 2Spirantization is ignored here; for a discussion on Syriac spirantization, see (Kiraz, 1995). morphemes: the pattern {cvcvc} 'verbal pattern', the above mentioned root, and the voealism {ae} 'ACTIVE'.

The following convention has been adopted. Lexical forms (e.g., morphemes in morphology) appear in braces, { }, phonological segments in square brackets, [], and elements of tuples in angle brackets, ().","Section 2 describes a regular formalism with rule features. Section 3 introduce a number of mathematical operators used in the compilation process. Sections 4 and 5 present our algorithm. Finally, section 6 provides an evaluation and some concluding remarks. 2 Regular Formalism with Rule Features This work adopts the following notation for regular formalisms, cf.

A same-length relation is devoid of e. For clarity, the elements of the n-tuple are separated by colons: e.g., a:b:c* q:r:s describes the 3-relation { (amq, bmr, cms) [ m > 0 }. Following current terminology, we call the first j elements 'surface '6 and the remaining elements 'lexical'.) The arrows correspond to context restriction (CR), surface coercion (SC) and composite rules, respectively. A compound rule takes the form"]},{"title":"r { ~, ~, ¢, } ~l___pl; ~2__p2;...

An attribute is an atomic label. A val can be an atom or a variable drawn from a predefined finite set of possible values, z The ith element in the tuple corresponds to the (j z_ i)th element in rule expressions. As a way of illustration, consider the simplified grammar in Figure 1 with j = 1.","The four elements of the tuples are: surface, pattern, root, and vocalism. R1 and R2 sanction the first and third consonants, respectively. R3 and R4 sanction vowels. R5 is the gemination rule; it is only triggered if the given rule features are satisfied: [cat=verb] for the first lexical element (i.e., the pattern) and [measure=pa\"el] for the second element (i.e., the root). The rule also illustrates that r can be a sequence of tuples. The derivation of/katteb/ is illustrated below: length descriptions at some preprocessing stage.","6In natural language, usually j = 1.","tit is also possible to extend the above formalism in order to allow val to be a category-feature structure, though that takes us beyond finite-state power.

For example, although R5 is devoid of context expressions, the rule is composite indicating that if the root measure is pa \"el, then gemination must occur and vice versa. Note that in a compound rule, each set of contexts is associated with a feature structure of its own.","What is meant by 'rule features are satisfied'? Regular grammars which make use of rule features normally interact with a lexicon. In our model, the lexicon consists of (n - j) sublexica corresponding to the lexical elements in the formalism. Each sub-lexical entry is associate with a feature structure. Rule features are satisfied if they match the feature structures of the lexical entries containing the lexical expressions in r, respectively. Consider the lexicon in Figure 2 and rule R5 with 7\" = t:c.,:t:0 t:0:0:0 and the rule features ([cat=verb], [measure=pa\"el], []). The lexical entries containing r are {clvc_,vc3} and {ktb}, respectively. For the rule to be triggered, [cat=verb] of the rule must match with [cat=verb] of the lexical entry {clvc2vc3}, and [measure=pa\"el] of the rule must match with [measure=(p'al,pa\"el)] of the lexical entry {ktb}.","As a second illustration, R6 derives the simple p'al measure,/ktab/. Note that in R5 and R6,","1. the lexical expressions in both rules (ignoring 0s) are equivalent, 2. both rules are composite, and 330 3. they have different surface expression in r. In traditional rewrite formalism, such rules will be contradicting each other. However, this is not the case here since R5 and R6 have different rule features.

It is possible, of course, to avoid this limitation by having rule features match the feature structures of both lexical entries in such cases. 3 Mathematical Preliminaries We define here a number of operations which will be used in our compilation process.","If an operator 0p takes a number of arguments (at, • •., ak), the arguments are shown as a subscript, e.g. 0p(a,,...,~k) - the parentheses are ignored if there is only one argument.
