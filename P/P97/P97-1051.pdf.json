The generality of the approach makes it directly applicable to a variety of other types of ellipsis and reference. 1 The Problem of VP Ellipsis VP ellipsis has received a great deal of attention in theoretical and computational linguistics (Asher, 1993; Crouch, 1995; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991; Fiengo and May, 1994; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Hardt, 1992; Kehler, 1993; Lappin and McCord, 1990; Priist, 1992; Sag, 1976; Webbet, 1978; Williams, 1977, inter alia). The area is a tangled thicket of examples in which readings are mysteriously missing and small changes reverse judgments. It is a prime example of a phenomenon at the boundary between syntax and pragmatics.","VP ellipsis is exemplified in sentence (1). (1) John revised his paper before the teacher did. This sentence has two readings, one in which the teacher revised John's paper (the"]},{"title":"strict","paragraphs":["reading), and one in which the teacher revised his own paper (the"]},{"title":"sloppy","paragraphs":["reading). Obtaining an adequate account of strict/sloppy ambiguities has been a major focus of VP ellipsis research. This is challenging because not all examples are as simple as sentence (1). In fact, sentence (1) is the first main clause of one of the more problematic cases in the literature:","(2) John revised his paper before the teacher did, and Bill did too.","Whereas one might expect there to be as many as six readings for this sentence, Dalrymple et ai.

Previous analyses have either generated too few or too many readings, or have required an appeal to additional processes or constraints external to the actual resolution process itself.","Examples like (2) test the adequacy of an analysis at a fine-grained level of detail. Other examples test the generality of an analysis, in terms of its ability to account for phenomena similar to VP ellipsis and to interact with other interpretation processes that may come into play. For instance, strict/sloppy ambiguities are not restricted to VP ellipsis, but are common to a wide range of constructions that rely on parallelism between two eventualities, some of which are listed in Table 1. Given the ubiquity of strict/sloppy ambiguities, one would expect these to be a by-product of general discourse resolution mechanisms and not mechanisms specific to VP ellipsis. Any account applying only to the latter would miss an important generalization.","In this paper, we give an account of resolution rooted in a general computational theory of parallelism. We demonstrate the depth of our approach by showing that unlike previous approaches, the algorithm generates the correct five readings for example (2) without appeal to additional mechanisms or constraints.

Table 1: Phenomena Giving Rise to Sloppy Interpretations nomena in Table 1, we briefly discuss the algorithm's handling of lazy pronoun cases. 2 A Theory of Parallelism The Theory A clause conveys a property or eventuality, or describes a situation, or expresses a proposition. We use the term \"property\" to cover all of these cases. A property consists of a predicate applied to a number of arguments. We make use of a duality between properties having a number of arguments, and arguments having a number of properties. Parallelism is characterized in terms of a co-recursion in which the similarity of properties is defined in terms of the similarity of arguments, and the similarity of arguments is defined in terms of the similarity of properties. 1","Two fragments of discourse stand in a parallel relation if they describe similar properties. Two properties are similar if two corresponding properties can be inferred from them in which the predicates are the same and the corresponding pairs of arguments are either coreferential or similar. Similarly(el,x1,",".. •, Zl), p2(e2; x2, ..., z2)]: p~(el,xl,...,Zx) ~ p'(el,xl,...,zl) and I e ..., ..., P2( 2,X2, Z2) Dp'(e2,x2, z2), where","Corer(x1,..., x2 .... ) or Similar[x1, x2], Corer(z1,..., z2, . . .) or Similar[z1, z2] Two arguments are similar if their other, \"inferentially independent\" properties are similar.","Similar[xl, x2]: Similar~ (..., zl, . . .),p~2 (..., x2, . . .)], ... Similar[q~ (..., Xl , . . .), q~ (..., x2, . . .)]","1This account is a elaboration of treatments of parallelism by Hobbs (1979; 1985) and Kehler (1995). The constructed mapping between pairs of arguments must be preserved and remain one-to-one.","There are three ways the recursion can bottom out. we can run out of new arguments in properties. We can run out of new, inferentially independent properties of arguments. And we can \"bail out\" of proving similarity by proving or assuming coreference between the two entities.","Two properties are inferentially independent if neither can be derived from the other. Given a knowledge base K representing the mutual knowledge of the participants in the discourse, properties P1 and P2 are inferentially independent if neither K,/)1 I-- P~ nor K, P2 ~- PI. This rules out the case in which, for example, the fact that John and Bill are both persons would be used to establish their similarity when the fact that they are both men has already been used. Inferential independence is generally undecidable, but in practice this is not a problem. In discourse interpretation, all we usually know about an entity is the small set of properties presented explicitly in the text itself. We may take these to be inferentially independent and look for no further properties, once properties inferrable from these have been used in establishing the parallelism.","Similarity is a matter of degree. The more corresponding pairs of inferentially independent properties that are found, and the more contextually salient those properties are, the stronger the similarity. In a system which assigns different costs to proofs (e.g., Hobbs et al. (1993)), the more costly the proofs required to establish similarity are, the less similar the properties or arguments should seem. Interpretations should seek to maximize similarity.","This account of parallelism is semantic in the sense that it depends on the content of the discourse rather than directly on its form. But syntax plays an implicit role. When seeking to establish the paral-395 lelism between two clauses, we must begin with the \"top-level\" properties; this is generally determined by the syntactic structure of the clause. Then the co-recursion through the arguments and properties normally mirrors the syntactic structure of the sentence. However, features of syntax that are not man-ifested in logical form are not taken into account. An Example To illustrate that the theory has applicability well beyond the problem of VP ellipsis, we present an example of semantic parallelism in discourse. It comes from an elementary physics textbook, and is worked out in essentially the same manner in Hobbs (1979).","(4) A ladder weighs 100 lb with its center of grav-ity 10 ft from the foot, and a 150 lb man is 10 ft from the top. We will assume \"the foot\" has been identified as the foot of the ladder.

In addition to straightforward examples of parallelism like the above, there are also contrasts, exemplifications, and generalizations, which are defined in a similar manner.

In brief, our theory of parallelism is not something we have introduced merely for the purpose of handling VP ellipsis; it is needed for a wide range of sentential and discourse phenomena."]},{"title":"Other Approaches","paragraphs":["Based on Parallelism Our aim in this paper is to present the theory of parallelism at an abstract enough level that it can be embedded in any sufficiently powerful framework. By \"sufficiently powerful\" we mean that there must be a formalization of the notion of inference, strength of inference, and inferential independence, and there must be a reasonable knowledge base. In Hobbs and Kehler (forthcoming), we show how our approach can be realized within the \"Interpretation as Abduction\" framework (Hobbs et al., 1993).","There are at least two other treatments in which VP ellipsis is resolved through a more general system of determining discourse parallelism, namely, those of PriJst (1992) and Asher (1993).","Prfist (1992) gives an account of parallelism developed within the context of the Linguistic Discourse Model theory (Scha and Polanyi, 1988). Parallelism is computed by determining the \"Most Specific Common Denominator\" of a set of representations, which results from unifying the unifiable aspects of those representations and generalizing over the others.

One weakness of this approach is that it appears overly restrictive in the syntactic similarity that it requires.","Asher (1993) also provides an analysis of VP ellipsis in the context of a theory of discourse structure and coherence, using an extension of Discourse Representation Theory. The resolution of VP ellipsis is driven by a need to maximize parallelism (or in some cases, contrast) that is very much in the spirit of what we present.","Detailed comparisons with our approach are given with the examples below. In general, however, in neither of these approaches has enough attention been paid to other interacting phenomena to explain the facts at the level of detail that we do. 3 VP Ellipsis: A Simple Case We first illustrate our approach on the simple case of VP ellipsis in sentence (1). The representation for the antecedent clause in our \"logical form\" ~ appears on the left-hand side of Figure 2. Note that a Core] relation links Xl, the variable corresponding to \"he\" (eventuality e13), to its antecedent j; the entity described by \"John\" (eventuality ell).","From the second clause we know there is an elided eventuality e22 of unknown type P, the logical subject of which is the teacher t.","P(e22, t) t : teachert(e21, t) Because of the ellipsis, e22 must stand in a parallel relation to some previous eventuality; here the only candidate is John's revising his paper (e12). To establish Similar(el2, e22),3 we need to show that their corresponding arguments are similar. John j and the","2The normally controversial term \"logical form\" is used loosely here, simply to capture the information that the hearer must bear in mind, at least implicitly, in in-terpreting texts such as sentence (1).","3 We cannot establish coreference between the events because their agents are distinct. In other cases, how-ever, the process can bail out immediately in event coreference; consider the sentence \"John revised his paper, teacher t are similar by virtue of being persons. The corresponding objects Pl and/>2 are similar if we take p2 to be a paper and to have a Poss property similar to that of Pl. The latter is true if corresponding to the possessor Xl, there is an x2 that is similar to xl.","In constructing the similarity between x2 and xl, we can either take them to be coreferential (case *a) or prove them to be similar by having similar properties, including having similar dependencies estab. lished by Core] (case *b). In the former case, x~ is coreferential with xl which is coreferential with John j, giving us the strict reading. In the latter case, we must preserve the previously-constructed mapping between John j (on which xl is dependent) and the teacher t; thus x2 is similar to xl if taken to be coreferential with t, giving us the sloppy reading. 4 4 A Missing Readings Paradox Sentence (1) is the antecedent clause for example (2), one of the more problematic examples in the literature. Theoretically, this example could have as many as six readings, paraphrased as follows:","(5) John revised John's paper before the teacher revised John's paper, and Bill revised John's/Bill's paper before the teacher revised John's/Bill's paper.","(6) John revised John's paper before the teacher revised the teacher's paper, and Bill revised John's/Bill's paper before the teacher revised the teacher's paper. smoking incessantly as he did.\" A Core] link is established between the elided and antecedent events in the same way as for pronouns. This symmetry accounts for another problematic case, discussed in Section 6.","4It is also possible to \"bail out\" in coreference between the papers pl and p2; here we would get the strict reading again. However, consider if the example had said \"a paper of his\" rather than \"his paper\". The resulting sentence has two strict readings, one in which both revised the same paper of John's (generated by assuming coreference between the papers), and one in which each revised a (possibly) different paper of John's (generated by assuming coreference between the pronouns). 397","before'(el2, e22)","revise'(e12, j, Pl) j: John'(ell,j) Pl : paper'(els,pl)","Poss'(e14, xl,pl)","xl : he'(e13,xl)"]},{"title":"Coref(xl, el3, j, ell)","paragraphs":["revise'(e22, t, P2) t : teacher'(e21, t) P2 : papert(e25, P2)","Poss' (e24, x2, P2)","x2 : he'(e23,x2)"]},{"title":"[Co~ef(z~., e23, xl, e13) (*a)] [Corel(z2, e23, t, e..,~) (*b)]","paragraphs":["Figure 2: Representations for Simple Case We follow DSP in claiming that this example has five readings, in which the JJJB reading shown in (3) is missing. ~ DSP, who use this case as a benchmark for theories of VP ellipsis, note that the methods of Sag (1976) and Williams (1977) can be seen to derive two readings, namely JJJJ and JTBT. An analysis proposed by Gawron and Peters (1990), who first introduced this example, generates three readings (adding JJBB to the above two), as does the analysis of Fiengo and May (1994). A method that Gawron and Peters attribute to Hans Kamp generates either four readings, including the above three and JTJT, or all six readings. DSP's analysis strictly speak-ing generates all six readings; however, they appeal to anaphor/antecedent linking relationships to eliminate the JJJB reading. However, these linking relationships are not a by-product of the resolution process itself, but must be generated separately. Our approach derives exactly the correct five readings. 6","The antecedent clause is represented in Figure 2, and the expansion of the final VP ellipsis is shown in Figure 3. In proving similarity, each pronoun can be taken to be coreferential with its parallel element (cases *a, *c and *e), or proven similar to it (cases *b, *d, *f and *g). If choice *a is taken in the second clause, then the \"similarity\" choice in the fourth clause must be *f; if *b, then *g. If *a and *c are chosen, the JJJJ reading results. If *a, *d, and *e are chosen, the JJBJ reading results. If *a, *d, and *f are chosen, the JJBB reading results. If *b and *c are chosen, the JTJT reading results. If *b and *d are chosen, the JTBT reading results. Thus taking all possible choices gives us all acceptable readings.","Now consider what it would take to obtain the *JJJB reading. The variable x3 would have to be","5Each reading for this example contains four descrip-tions of papers that were revised. We use the notation JJJB to represent the reading in which the first three papers are John's and fourth is Bill's, corresponding to reading (3). Other uses of such notation should be understood analogously.","6The approach presented in Kehler (1993) also derives the correct five readings, however, our method has advantages in its being more general and better motivated. coreferential with John and x4 with Bill. The former requirement forces us to pick case *c. But then case *e makes x4 coreferential with either John or the teacher (depending on how the first ellipsis was resolved). Case *f makes x4 coreferential with John, and case *g makes it coreferential with the teacher. There is no way to get x4 coreferential with Bill once we have set x3 to something other than Bill.","Neither Prtist (1992) nor Asher (1993) discuss this example. In extrapolating from the analyses Pr/ist gives, we find that his analysis generates only two of the five readings. Briefly, if the first ellipsis is resolved to the strict reading, then the JJJJ reading is possible. If the first ellipsis is resolved to the sloppy reading, then only the JTBT reading is possible. Asher's account, extrapolating from an example he discusses (p. 371), may generate as many as six readings, including the missing reading. This reading results from the manner in which the strict reading for the first ellipsis is generated--the final clause pronoun is resolved with the entity specified by the subject of the antecedent clause, whereas our algorithm creates a dependency between the pronoun and its parallel element in the antecedent clause. Our mechanism is more natural because of the alignment of parallel elements between clauses when establishing parallelism, and it is this property which results in the underivability of the missing reading."]},{"title":"5 A Source-of-Ellipsis Paradox","paragraphs":["DSP identify two kinds of analysis in the VP ellipsis literature. In identity-of-relations analyses (Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Fiengo and May, 1994, inter alia) strict/sloppy readings arise from an ambiguity in the antecedent VP derivation. The ambiguity in the ellipsis results from copying each possibility. In non-identity approaches (Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991; Kehler, 1993; Crouch, 1995, inter alia) strict/sloppy readings result from a choice point within the resolution algorithm. Our approach falls into this class.","Non-identity approaches are supported by examples such as (7), which has reading (8). 398","before(e32, e42)","revise' (e32, b, P3 ) b : Bill'(e31, b) p3 : paper'(e35, P3)","P oss' ( e34 , x 3 , P3 )","x3 : he'(e33,x3)"]},{"title":"[(*c) C,:,'ef(z3, e33, =~, e~3)] [(*d) Core.f (z3, e33, b, e31)]","paragraphs":["Figure 3: Representations","(7) John realizes that he is a fool, but Bill does not, even though his wife does. (Dahl, 1972)","(8) John realizes that John is a fool, but Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool. Example (7) contains two ellipses. Reading (8) results from the second clause receiving a sloppy interpretation from the first, and the third clause re- . ceiving a strict interpretation from the second. An identity-of-relations analysis, however, predicts that this reading does not exist. Because the second clause will only have the sloppy derivation received from the first, the strict derivation that the third clause requires from the second will not be present.","However, in defending their identity-of-relations approach, Gawron and Peters (1990) note that a non-identity account predicts that sentence (9) has the (nonexistent) reading given in (10).","(9) John revised his paper before Bill did, but after the teacher did.","(10) John revised John's paper before Bill revised Bill's paper, but after the teacher revised John's paper. In this case, the first clause is the antecedent for both ellipses. These two examples create a paradox; apparently neither type of analysis (nor any previous analyses we are aware of) can explain both.","Our analysis accounts for both examples through a mutually-constraining interaction of parallelisms. Example (7) is fairly straightforward, so we focus on example (9). Let us refer to the clauses as clauses 1, 2, and 3. Because clauses 2 and 3 are VP-elliptical, we must establish a parallelism between each of them and clause 1. In addition, the contrast relation signalled by \"but\" is justified by the contrast-ing predicates \"before\" and \"after\", provided their corresponding pairs of arguments are similar. Their first arguments are similar since they are identical-- clause 1. Then we also have to establish the similarity of their second arguments--clause 2 and clause 3.","revise' ( e42 , t, p4 ) t : teacher'(e41, t) P4 : paper'(e45,P4)","Poss'(e44, x4, P4)","x4 : he'(e4z, x4)"]},{"title":"[Co~e/(z4, e43, z2, e~3) (*e)] [Core/(z4, e43, z3, e33) (*f)] [Co~el(x~, e,3, t, e,1) (*g)]","paragraphs":["for Five Readings Case Thus, three mutually constraining parallelisms must be established: 1 - 2, 1 - 3, and 2 - 3.","In Figure 4, cases *a and *b arise from the coreference and similarity options when establishing the parallelism between clauses 1 and 2, and cases *c and *d from the parallelism between clauses 1 and 3. However, because parallelism is also required between clauses 2 and 3, we cannot choose these options freely. If we choose case *a, then we must choose case *c, giving us the JJJ reading. If we choose case *b, then we must choose case *d, giving us the JBT reading. Because of the mutual constraints of the three parallelisms, no other readings are possible. This is exactly the right result.","Prtist (1992) essentially follows Sag's (1976) treatment of strict and sloppy readings, which, like other identity-of-relations analyses, will not generate the reading of the cascaded ellipsis sentence (7) shown in (8). While the approach will correctly predict the lack of reading (10) for sentence (9), it does so for the wrong reason. Whereas ellipsis resolution does :not permit such readings in any circumstance in his account, we claim that the lack of such readings for • sentence (9) is due to constraints imposed by multiple parallelisms, and not because of the correctness of identity-of-relations analyses.","Asher's (1993) analysis falls into the non-identity class of analyses, a~ld therefore makes the correct predictions for sentence (7).

Other cases in the literature indicate that the situation is more complicated than might initially be evident. Handling these cases requires an account of how such dependencies are established, which we discuss in Hobbs and Kehler (forthcoming). Extended Parallelism In some cases, the elements involved in a sloppy reading may not be contained in the minimal clause containing the ellipsis.","(13) John told a man that Mary likes him, and Bill told a boy that Susan does. ~","(14) The man who gives his paycheck to his wife is wiser than the man who gives it to his mistress.

Then in expahding the VP ellipsis in the second main clause, taking the similarity option for the event generates the desired reading. Inferentially-Determined Antecedents Webbet (1978) provides several examples in which the antecedent of an ellipsis is derived inferentially:","(17) Mary wants to go to Spain and Fred wants to go to Peru, but because of limited resources, only one of them can.","Our account of parallelism applies twice in handling this example, once in creating a complex antecedent from recognizing the parallelism between the first two clauses, and again in resolving the ellipsis against this antecedent. Hobbs and Kehler (forthcoming) describe the analysis of this case as well as others involving quantification. 7 Summary We have given a general account of parallelism in discourse and applied it to the special case of resolving possible readings for instances of VP ellipsis. In doing so, we showed how a variety of examples that have been problematic for previous approaches are accounted for in a natural and straightforward fashion. Furthermore, the generality of the approach makes it directly applicable to a variety of other types of ellipsis and reference in natural language.
