These items are commonly transliterated, i.e., replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents. For example, computer in English comes out as ~ i/l:::'=--~-- (konpyuutaa) in Japanese. Translating such items from Japanese back to English is even more challenging, and of practical interest, as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries. We describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine. This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process. 1 Introduction Translators must deal with many problems, and one of the most frequent is translating proper names and technical terms. For language pairs like Spanish/English, this presents no great challenge: a phrase like Antonio Gil usually gets translated as Antonio Gil. However, the situation is more complicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English. Phonetic translation across these pairs is called transliteration. We will look at Japanese/English transliteration in this paper.","Japanese frequently imports vocabulary from other languages, primarily (but not exclusively) from English. It has a special phonetic alphabet called katakana, which is used primarily (but not exclusively) to write down foreign names and loan-words. To write a word like golf bag in katakana, some compromises must be made. For example, Japanese has no distinct L and R sounds: the two English sounds collapse onto the same Japanese sound. A similar compromise must be struck for English H and F. Also, Japanese generally uses an alternating consonant-vowel structure, making it impossible to pronounce LFB without intervening vowels. Katakana writing is a syllabary rather than an alphabet--there is one symbol for ga (~I), another for gi (4e), another for gu (P'), etc. So the way to write gol]bag in katakana is =~'~ 7 ~ ~, ~, roughly pronounced goruhubaggu.

Also, a dot-separator (.) is used to separate words, but not consistently. And transliteration is clearly an information-losing operation: aisukuriimu loses the distinction between ice cream and I scream.","Transliteration is not trivial to automate, but we will be concerned with an even more challenging problem--going from katakana back to English, i.e., back-transliteration. Automating back-transliteration has great practical importance in Japanese/English machine translation. Katakana phrases are the largest source of text phrases that do not appear in bilingual dictionaries or training corpora (a.k.a. \"not-found words\"). However, very little computational work has been done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a patternmatching approach, while (Arbabi et al., 1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.","The information-losing aspect of transliteration makes it hard to invert. Here are some problem in-stances, taken from actual newspaper articles: 1","ITexts used in ARPA Machine Translation evaluations, November 1994. 128 ?

There are many ways to write an English word like switch in katakana, all equally valid, but we do not have this flexibility in the reverse direction. For example, we can-not drop the t in switch, nor can we write arture when we mean archer.","• Back-transliteration is harder than romanization, which is a (frequently invertible) transformation of a non-roman alphabet into roman letters. There are several romanization schemes for katakana writing--we have already been using one in our examples. Katakana Writing follows Japanese sound patterns closely, so katakana often doubles as a Japanese pronunciation guide. However, as we shall see, there are many spelling variations that complicate the mapping between Japanese sounds and katakana writing.","• Finally, not all katakana phrases can be \"sounded out\" by back-transliteration. Some phrases are shorthand, e.g., r] _","7\" ~ (uaapuro) should be translated as word processing. Others are onomatopoetic and difficult to translate. These cases must be solved by techniques other than those described here.","The most desirable feature of an automatic back-transliterator is accuracy. If possible, our techniques should also be:","• portable to new language pairs like Arabic/English with minimal effort, possibly reusing resources.","• robust against errors introduced by optical character recognition.","• relevant to speech recognition situations in which the speaker has a heavy foreign accent.","• able to take textual (topical/syntactic) context into account, or at least be able to return a ranked list of possible English translations.","Like most problems in computational linguistics, this one requires full world knowledge for a 100% solution. Choosing between Katarina and Catalina (both good guesses for ~' ~ ~ \")-) might even require detailed knowledge of geography and figure skating. At that level, human translators find the problem quite difficult as well. so we only aim to match or possibly exceed their performance."]},{"title":"2 A Modular Learning Approach","paragraphs":["Bilingual glossaries contain many entries mapping katakana phrases onto English phrases, e.g.: (aircraft carrier --, ~ T ~ ~ 7 I. ~ ~ ~3 7\" ). It is possible to automatically analyze such pairs to gain enough knowledge to accurately map new katakana phrases that come along, and learning approach travels well to other languages pairs. However, a naive approach to finding direct correspondences between English letters and katakana symbols suffers from a number of problems. One can easily wind up with a system that proposes iskrym as a back-transliteration of aisukuriimu. Taking letter frequencies into account improves this to a more plausible-looking isclim. Moving to real words may give is crime: the i corresponds to ai, the s corresponds to su, etc. Unfortunately, the correct answer here is ice cream. After initial experiments along these lines, we decided to step back and build a generative model of the transliteration process, which goes like this: 1. An English phrase is written. 2. A translator pronounces it in English. 3. The pronunciation is modified to fit the","Japanese sound inventory. 4. The sounds are converted into katakana. 5. Katakana is written.","This divides our problem into five sub-problems. Fortunately, there are techniques for coordinating solutions to such sub-problems, and for using generative models in the reverse direction. These techniques rely on probabilities and Bayes' Rule. Suppose we build an English phrase generator that produces word sequences according to some probability distribution P(w). And suppose we build an English pronouncer that takes a word sequence and assigns it a set of pronunciations, again probabilistically, according to some P(plw). Given a pronunciation p, we may want to search for the word sequence w that maximizes P(wtp ). Bayes\" Rule lets us equivalently maximize P(w). P(plw). exactly the two distributions we have modeled.","Extending this notion, we settled down to build five probability distributions: 1. P(w) -- generates written English word se-","quences. 2.

P(jle)\" P(kJj). P(olk) Following (Pereira et al., 1994; Pereira and Riley, I996), we implement P(w) in a weighted finite-state aceeptor (WFSA) and we implement the other distributions in weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). A WFSA is an state/transition diagram with weights and symbols on the transitions, making some output sequences more likely than others. A WFST is a WFSA with a pair of symbols on each transition, one input, and one output. Inputs and outputs may include the empty symbol e. Also following (Pereira and Riley, 1996), we have implemented a general composition algorithm for constructing an integrated model P(zlz) from models P(~IY) and P(ylz), treating WFSAs as WFSTs with identical inputs and outputs. We use this to combine an observed katakana string with each of the models in turn. The result is a large WFSA containing all possible English translations. We use Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm {Dijkstra, 1959) to extract the most probable one.","The approach is modular. We can test each engine independently and be confident that their results are combined correctly. We do no pruning, so the final WFSA contains every solution, however unlikely. The only approximation is the Viterbi one, which searches for the best path through a WFSA instead of the best sequence (i.e., the same sequence does not receive bonus points for appearing more than once)."]},{"title":"3 Probabilistic Models","paragraphs":["This section describes how we desigued and built each of our five models.

We use the English phoneme inventory from the online CMU Pronuncia-tion Dictionary, 3 minus the stress marks. This gives a total of 40 sounds, including 14 vowel sounds (e.g., AA, AE, UW), 25 consonant sounds (e.g., K, 1tlt, It), plus our special symbol (PAUSE).

This is an inherently information-losing process, as English R and L sounds collapse onto Japanese r, the 14 English vowel sounds collapse onto the 5 Japanese vowel sounds, etc. We face two immediate problems: 1. What is the target Japanese sound inventory?","2. How can we build a WFST to perform the sequence mapping?","An obvious target inventory is the Japanese syllabary itself, written down in katakana (e.g., \") or a roman equivalent (e.g., hi). With this approach, the English sound K corresponds to one of 2 (ka), -'Y (ki), ~' (ku), ~ (ke), or = (ko), depending on its context. Unfortunately, because katakana is a syllabary, we would be unable to express an obvious and useful generalization, namely that English g usually corresponds to Japanese k, independent of context. Moreover, the correspondence of Japanese katakana writing to Japanese sound sequences is not perfectly one-to-one (see next section), so an independent sound inventory is well-motivated in any case. Our Japanese sound inventory includes 39 symbols: 5 vowel sounds, 33 consonant sounds (including doubled consonants like kk), and one special symbol (pause). An English sound sequence like (P R OW PAUSE S AA K ER) might map onto a Japanese sound sequence like (p u r o pause s a kk a a). Note that long Japanese vowel sounds are written with two symbols (a a) instead of just one (an). This scheme is attractive because Japanese sequences are almost always longer than English sequences.","Our WFST is learned automatically from 8,000 pairs of English/Japanese sound sequences, e.g., ( (s AA K ER) --* (s a kk a a)). We were able to produce'these pairs by manipulating a small English-katakana glossary. For each glossary entry, we converted English words into English sounds using the previous section's model, and we converted katakana words into Japanese sounds using the next section's model. We then applied the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Baum, 1972) to generate symbol-mapping probabilities, shown in Figure 1. Our EM training goes like this:","1. For each English/Japanese sequence pair, compute all possible"]},{"title":"alignments","paragraphs":["between their elements. In our case. an alignment is a drawing . that connects each English sound with one or more Japanese sounds, such that all Japanese sounds are covered and no lines cross.

For each pair, assign an equal weight to each of its alignments, such that those weights sum to 1. In the case above, each alignment gets a weight of 0.5.","3. For each of the 40 English sounds, count up in-stances of its different mappings, as observed in all alignments of all pairs. Each alignment contributes counts in proportion to its own weight.","4. For each of the 40 English sounds, normalize the scores of the Japanese sequences it maps to, so that the scores sum to 1. These are the symbol-mapping probabilities shown in Figure 1.","5.

However, these models are expensive to compute (many more alignments) and lead to a vast number of hypotheses during WFST composition. Furthermore, in disallowing \"swallow-ing,\" we were able to automatically remove hundreds of potentially harmful pairs from our training set, e.g., ((B AA R B ER SH AA P) -- (b a a b a a)). Because no alignments are possible, such pairs are skipped by the learning algorithm; cases like these must be solved by dictionary lookup any-way. Only two pairs failed to align when we wished they had--both involved turning English Y UW into Japanese u, as in ((Y UW K AH L EY L IY) ~ (u kurere)).","Note also that our model translates each English sound without regard to context. We have built also context-based models, using decision trees receded as WFSTs. For example, at the end of a word, English T is likely to come out as (= o) rather than (1;).

We do not, however,","4And harmfully restrictive in their unsmoothed incarnations. generate all katakana sequences with this model; for example, we do not output strings that begin with a subscripted vowel katakana. So this model also serves to filter out some ill-formed katakana sequences, possibly proposed by optical character recognition. 3.5 Katakana to OCR Perhaps uncharitably, we can view optical character recognition (OCR) as a device that garbles perfectly good katakana sequences. Typical confusions made by our commercial OCR system include ~ for ~-', ¢-for -)', T for 7, and 7 for 7\". To generate pre-OCR text, we collected 19,500 characters worth of katakana words, stored them in a file, and printed them out. To generate post-OCR text, we OCR'd the printouts.

Of these, 222 were missing from an online 100,000-entry bilingual dictionary. We back-transliterated these 222 phrases. Many of the translations are perfect: technical program, sez scandal, omaha beach, new york times, ramon diaz. Others are close: tanya harding, nickel simpson, danger washington, world cap. Some miss the mark: nancy care again, plus occur, patriot miss real. While it is difficult to judge overall accuracy--some of the phases are onomatopoetic, and others are simply too hard even for good human translators--it is easier to identify system weaknesses, and most of these lie in the P(w) model. For example, nancy kerrigan should be preferred over nancy care again.","In a second experiment, we took katakana versions of the names of 100 U.S. politicians, e.g.: -Jm :/. 7' =-- (jyon.buroo), T~/~ . ~'0' I\" (a.rhonsu.dama~;'¢o), and \"~'4 3' • ~7,f :/ (maiku.de~ain). We back-transliterated these by machine and asked four human subjects to do the same. These subjects were native English speakers and news-aware: we gave them brief instructions, examples, and hints. The results were as follows: correct (e.g., spencer abraham /","spencer abraham) phonetically equivalent, but misspelled (e.g., richard brian /","richard bryan) incorrect (e.g., olin hatch /","omen hatch) human machine 27% 64% 7,% 12% 66% 24%","There is room for improvement on both sides. Be-ing English speakers, the human subjects were good at English name spelling and U.S. politics, but not at Japanese phonetics. A native Japanese speaker might be expert at the latter but not the former. People who are expert in all of these areas, however, are rare.","On the automatic side. many errors can be corrected. A first-name/last-name model would rank richard bryan more highly than richard brian. A bigram model would prefer orren hatch over olin hatch. Other errors are due to unigram training problems, or more rarely, incorrect or brittle phonetic models. For example, \"Long\" occurs much more often than \"R.on\" in newspaper text, and our word selection does not exclude phrases like \"Long Island.\" So we get long wyden instead of ton wyden. Rare errors are due to incorrect or brittle phonetic models.","Still the machine's performance is impressive. When word separators (,) are removed from the katakana phrases, rendering the task exceedingly difficult for people, the machine's performance is unchanged. When we use OCR. 7% of katakana tokens are mis-recognized, affecting 50% of test strings, but accuracy only drops from 64% to 52%. 6 Discussion We have presented a method for automatic back-transliteration which, while far from perfect, is highly competitive. It also achieves the objectives outlined in Section 1. It ports easily to new language pairs; the P(w) and P(e[w) models are entirely reusable, while other models are learned automatically. It is robust against OCR noise, in a rare example of high-level language processing being useful (necessary, even) in improving low-level OCK.","We plan to replace our shortest-path extraction algorithm with one of the recently developed k-shortest path algorithms (Eppstein, 1994). We will then return a ranked list of the k best translations for subsequent contextual disambiguation, either by machine or as part of an interactive man-machine system. We also plan to explore probabilistic models for Arabic/English transliteration. Simply identify-ing which Arabic words to transliterate is a difficult task in itself; and while Japanese tends to insert extra vowel sounds, Arabic is usually written without any (short) vowels. Finally, it should also be possible to embed our phonetic shift model P(jle) in-side a speech recognizer, to help adjust for a heavy Japanese accent, although we have not experimented in this area. 7 Acknowledgments We would like to thank Alton Earl Ingram, Yolanda Gil, Bonnie Glover-Stalls, Richard Whitney, and Kenji Yamada for their helpful comments.
