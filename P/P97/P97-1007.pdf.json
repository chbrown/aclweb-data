Manual construction of lexicons is the most reliable technique for obtaining structured lexicons but is costly and highly time-consuming. This is the reason for many researchers having focused on the massive acquisition of lexical knowledge and semantic information from pre-existing structured lexical resources as automatically as possible.","*This research has been partially funded by CICYT TIC96-1243-C03-02 (ITEM project) and the European Comission LE-4003 (EuroWordNet project).","As dictionaries are special texts whose subject matter is a language (or a pair of languages in the case of bilingual dictionaries) they provide a wide range of information about words by giving definitions of senses of words, and, doing that, supplying knowledge not just about language, but about the world itself.","One of the most important relation to be extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD) is the hyponym/hypernym relation among dictionary senses (e.g. (Amsler, 1981), (Vossen and Serail, 1990) ) not only because of its own importance as the backbone of taxonomies, but also because this relation acts as the support of main inheritance mechanisms helping, thus, the acquisition of other relations and semantic features (Cohen and Loiselle, 1988), providing formal structure and avoiding redundancy in the lexicon (Briscoe et al., 1990).

It is clear that different dictionaries do not contain the same explicit information. The information placed in LDOCE has allowed to extract other implicit information easily, e.g. taxonomies (Bruce et al., 1992). Does it mean that only highly structured dictionaries like LDOCE are suitable to be exploited to provide lexical resources for NLP systems?","We explored this question probing two disparate dictionaries: Diccionario General Ilustrado de la Lengua Espa~ola (DGILE, 1987) for Spanish, and Le Plus Petit Larousse (LPPL, 1980) for French. Both are substantially poorer in coded information than LDOCE (LDOCE, 1987) 3. These dictionaries are very different in number of headwords, polysemy degree, size and length of definitions (c.f. table 1). While DGILE is a good example of a large sized dictionary, LPPL shows to what extent the smallest dictionary is useful.","Even if most of the techniques for WSD are presented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques. This work does not address all the heuristics cited in her paper, but prof-its from techniques that were at hand, without any claim of them being complete. In fact we use unsupervised techniques, i.e. those that do not require hand-coding of any kind, that draw knowledge from a variety of sources - the source dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries and WordNet - in diverse ways.","2Called also Lexical Ambiguity Resolution, Word Sense Discrimination, Word Sense Selection or Word Sense Identification.","3In LDOCE, dictionary senses are explicitly ordered by frequency, 86% dictionary senses have semantic codes and 44% of dictionary senses have pragmatic codes.

After this short introduction, section 2 shows the methods we have applied. Section 3 describes the test sets and shows the results. Section 4 explains the construction of the lexical knowledge resources used. Section 5 discusses previous work, and finally, section 6 faces some conclusions and comments on future work. 2 Heuristics for Genus Sense Disambiguation As the methods described in this paper have been developed for being applied in a combined way, each one must be seen as a container of some part of the knowledge (or heuristic) needed to disambiguate the correct hypernym sense. Not all the heuristics are suitable to be applied to all definitions. For combining the heuristics, each heuristic assigns each candidate hypernym sense a normalized weight, i.e. a real number ranging from 0 to 1 (after a scaling process, where maximum score is assigned 1, c.f. section 2.9). The heuristics applied range from the simplest (e.g. heuristic 1, 2, 3 and 4) to the most informed ones (e.g. heuristics 5, 6, 7 and 8), and use information present in the entries under study (e.g. heuristics 1, 2, 3 and 4) or extracted from the whole dictionary as a unique lexical knowledge resource (e.g. heuristics 5 and 6) or combining lexical knowledge from several heterogeneous lexical resources (e.g. heuristic 7"]},{"title":"and 8).","paragraphs":["2.1 Heuristic 1: Monosemous Genus Term This heuristic is applied when the genus term is monosemous. As there is only one hypernym sense candidate, the hyponym sense is attached to it. Only 12% of noun dictionary senses have monosemous genus terms in DGILE, whereas the smaller LPPL reaches 40%. 2.2 Heuristic 2: Entry Sense Ordering This heuristic assumes that senses are ordered in an entry by frequency of usage. That is, the most used and important senses are placed in the entry before less frequent or less important ones. This heuristic provides the maximum score to the first sense of the hypernym candidates and decreasing scores to the others. 49 2.3 Heuristic 3: Explicit Semantic Domain This heuristic assigns the maximum score to the hypernym sense which has the same semantic domain tag as the hyponym. This heuristic is of limited application: LPPL lacks semantic tags, and less than 10% of the definitions in DGILE are marked with one of the 96 different semantic domain tags (e.g."]},{"title":"med.","paragraphs":["for medicine, or"]},{"title":"def.","paragraphs":["for law, etc.). 2.4 Heuristic 4: Word Matching This heuristic trusts that related concepts will be expressed using the same content words. Given two definitions - that of the hyponym and that of one candidate hypernym - this heuristic computes the total amount of content words shared (including headwords). Due to the morphological productivity of Spanish and French, we have considered different variants of this heuristic. For LPPL the match among lemmas proved most useful, while DGILE yielded better results when matching the first four characters of words. 2.5 Heuristic 5: Simple Cooccurrence This heuristic uses cooccurrence data collected from the whole dictionary (see section 4.1 for more de-tails). Thus, given a hyponym definition (O) and a set of candidate hypernym definitions, this method selects the candidate hypernym definition (E) which returns the maximum score given by formula (1):"]},{"title":"SC(O, E) : E cw(wi, wj) (I)","paragraphs":["'wIEOAwj6E The cooccurrence weight"]},{"title":"(cw)","paragraphs":["between two words can be given by Cooccurrence Frequency, Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990) or Association Ratio (Resnik, 1992).

Given a hyponym definition (O) and a set of candidate hypernym definitions, this method selects the candidate hypernym (E) which returns the maximum score following formula (2):"]},{"title":"CV(O, E) = sim(Vo, VE)","paragraphs":["(2) The similarity"]},{"title":"(sim)","paragraphs":["between two definitions can be measured by the dot product, the cosine function or the Euclidean distance between two vectors"]},{"title":"(Vo","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"VE)","paragraphs":["which represent the contexts of the words presented in the respective definitions following formula (3):"]},{"title":"t%el = eiv(wd (3)","paragraphs":["wi6De,f The vector for a definition"]},{"title":"(VDel)","paragraphs":["is computed adding the cooccurrence information vectors of the words in the definition"]},{"title":"(civ(wi)).","paragraphs":["The cooccurrence information vector for a word is collected from the whole dictionary using Cooccurrence Frequency, Mutual Information or Association Ratio.

Instead of assigning only one tag we can attach to each dictionary sense a vector with weights for each of the 25 semantic tags we considered (which correspond to the 25 lexicographer files of WordNet (Miller, 1990)).

Conceptual distance between two concepts is essentially the length 50 of the shortest path that connects the concepts in the hierarchy. In order to apply conceptual distance, WordNet was chosen as the hierarchical knowledge base, and bilingual dictionaries were used to link Spanish and French words to the English concepts.","Given a hyponym definition (O) and a set of candidate hypernym definitions, this heuristic chooses the hypernym definition (E) which is closest according to the following formula:"]},{"title":"CD(O, E) = dist(headwordo, genusE)","paragraphs":["(6)","That is, Conceptual Distance is measured between the headword of the hyponym definition and the genus of the candidate hypernym definitions using formula (7), c.f.

The weights each heuristic assigns to the rivaling senses of one genus are normalized to the interval between 1 (best weight) and 0.

From these samples, we retained only those for which the automatic selection process selected the correct genus (more than 97% in both dictionaries). Both test sets were disambiguated by hand. Where necessary multiple correct senses were allowed in both dictionaries.

The best heuristics according to the recall in both dictionaries is the sense ordering heuristic (2). For the rest, the difference in size of the dictionaries could explain the reason why cooccurrence-based heuristics (5 and 6) are the best for DGILE, and the worst for LPPL. Semantic distance gives the best precision for LPPL, but chooses an average of 1.25 senses for each genus.","With the combination of the heuristics (Sum) we obtained an improvement over sense ordering (heuristic 2) of 9% (from 70% to 79%) in DGILE, and of 7% (from 66% to 73%) in LPPL, maintaining in both cases a coverage of 100%.

(Gale et al., 1993) estimate that any sense-identification system that does not give the correct sense of polysemous words more than 75% of the time would not be worth serious consideration. As table 5 shows this is not the case in our system. For instance, in DGILE heuristic 8 has the worst performance (see table 4, precision 57%), but it has the second larger contribution (see table 5, precision decreases from 83% to 77%). That is, even those heuristics with poor performance can contribute with knowledge that other heuristics do not provide. 3.3 Evaluation The difference in performance between the two dictionaries show that quality and size of resources is a key issue. Apparently the task of disambiguating LPPL seems easier: less polysemy, more monosemous genus and high precision of the sense ordering heuristic. However, the heuristics that depend only on the size of the data (5, 6) perform poorly on LPPL, while they are powerful methods for DGILE.","The results show that the combination of heuristics is useful, even if the performance of some of the heuristics is low. The combination performs better than isolated heuristics, and allows to disambiguate all the genus of the test set with a success rate of 83% in DGILE and 82% in LPPL.","All the heuristics except heuristic 3 can readily be applied to any other dictionary. Minimal parameter adjustment (window size, cooccurrence weigth formula and vector similarity function) should be done to fit the characteristics of the dictionary, but according to our results it does not alter significantly the results after combining the heuristics. 4 Derived Lexical Knowledge Resources 4.1 Cooccurrence Data Following (Wilks et al., 1993) two words cooccur if they appear in the same definition (word order in definitions are not taken into account). For instance, for DGILE, a lexicon of 300,062 cooccurrence pairs among 40,193 word forms was derived (stop words were not taken into account). Table 6 shows the first eleven words out of the 360 which cooccur with vino (wine) ordered by Association Ratio. From left to right, Association Ratio and number of occurrences.","The lexicon (or machine-tractable dictionary, 52","AR #oc. 11.1655 15 tinto (red) 10.0162 23 beber (to drink) 9.6627 14 mos¢o (must) 8.6633 9 jerez (sherry) 8.1051 9 cubas (cask, barrel) 8.0551 16 licor (liquor) 7.2127 17 bebida (drink) 6.9338 12 uva (grape) 6.8436 9 trago (drink, swig) 6.6221 12 sabot (taste) 6.4506 15 pan (bread) Table 6: Example of (wine). association ratio for vino MTD) thus produced from the dictionary is used by heuristics 5 and 6. 4.2 Multilingual Data Heuristics 7 and 8 need external knowledge, not present in the dictionaries themselves. This knowledge is composed of semantic field tags and hierarchical structures, and both were extracted from WordNet. In order to do this, the gap between our working languages and English was filled with two bilingual dictionaries. For this purpose, we derived a list of links for each word in Spanish and French as follows.","Firstly, each Spanish or French word was looked up in the bilingual dictionary, and its English translation was found. For each translation WordNet yielded its senses, in the form of WordNet concepts (synsets). The pair made of the original word and each of the concepts linked to it, was included in a file, thus producing a MTD with links between Spanish or French words and WordNet concepts. Obviously some of this links are not correct, as the translation in the bilingual dictionary may not necessarily be understood in its senses (as listed in WordNet). The heuristics using these MTDs are aware of this.","For instance when accessing the semantic fields for vin (French) we get a unique translation, wine, which has two senses in WordNet: <wine,vino> as a beverage, and <wine, wine-coloured> as a kind of color. In this example two links would be produced (vin, <wine,vino>) and (vin, <wine, wine-coloured>). This link allows us to get two possible semantic fields for vin (noun.food, file 13, and noun.attribute, file 7) and the whole structure of the hierarchy in WordNet for each of the concepts. 5 Comparison with Previous Work Several approaches have been proposed for attaching the correct sense (from a set of prescribed ones) of a word in context. Some of them have been fully tested in real size texts (e.g. statistical methods (Yarowsky, 1992), (Yarowsky, 1994), (Miller and Teibel, 1991), knowledge based methods (Sussna, 1993), (Agirre and Rigau, 1996), or mixed methods (Richardson et al., 1994), (Resnik, 1995)). The performance of WSD is reaching a high stance, although usually only small sets of words with clear sense distinctions are selected for disambiguation (e.g. (Yarowsky, 1995) reports a success rate of 96% disambiguating twelve words with two clear sense distinctions each one).","This paper has presented a general technique for WSD which is a combination of statistical and knowledge based methods, and which has been applied to disambiguate all the genus terms in two dictionaries.","Although this latter task could be seen easier than general WSD 4, genus are usually frequent and general words with high ambiguity ~. While the average of senses per noun in DGILE is 1.8 the average of senses per noun genus is 2.75 (1.30 and 2.29 respectively for LPPL). Furthermore, it is not possible to apply the powerful \"one sense per discourse\" property (Yarowsky, 1995) because there is no discourse in dictionaries.","WSD is a very difficult task even for humans 6, but semiautomatic techniques to disambiguate genus have been broadly used (Amsler, 1981) (Vossen and Serail, 1990) (Ageno et ah, 1992) (Artola, 1993) and some attempts to do automatic genus disambiguation have been performed using the semantic codes of the dictionary (Bruce et al., 1992) or using cooccurrence data extracted from the dictionary itself (Wilks et al., 1993).","Selecting the correct sense for LDOCE genus terms, (Bruce et al., 1992)) report a success rate of 80% (90% after hand coding of ten genus). This impressive rate is achieved using the intrinsic char-","4In contrast to other sense distinctions Dictionary word senses frequently differ in subtle distinctions (only some of which have to do with meaning (Gale et ah, 1993)) producing a large set of closely related dictionary senses (Jacobs, 1991).","5However, in dictionary definitions the headword and the genus term have to be the same part of speech.","6(Wilks et al., 1993) disambiguating 197 occurrences of the word bank in LDOCE say \"was not an easy task, as some of the usages of bank did not seem to fit any of the definitions very well\". Also (Miller et al., 1994) tagging semantically SemCor by hand, measure an error rate around 10% for polysemous words. 53 acteristics of LDOCE. Yhrthermore, using only the implicit information contained into the dictionary definitions of LDOCE (Cowie et al., 1992) report a success rate of 47% at a sense level. (Wilks et al., 1993) reports a success rate of 45% disambiguating the word bank (thirteen senses LDOCE) using a technique similar to heuristic 6. In our case, combining informed heuristics and without explicit semantic tags, the success rates are 83% and 82% overall, and 95% and 75% for two-way ambiguous genus (DGILE and LPPL data, respectively). Moreover, 93% and 92% of times the real solution is between the first and second proposed solution."]},{"title":"6 Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["The results show that computer aided construction of taxonomies using lexical resources is not limited to highly-structured dictionaries as LDOCE, but has been succesfully achieved with two very different dictionaries. All the heuristics used are unsupervised, in the sense that they do not need hand-codding of any kind, and the proposed method can be adapted to any dictionary with minimal parameter setting.","Nevertheless, quality and size of the lexical knowledge resources are important. As the results for LPPL show, small dictionaries with short definitions can not profit from raw corpus techniques (heuristics 5, 6), and consequently the improvement of precision over the random baseline or first-sense heuristic is lower than in DGILE.","We have also shown that such a simple technique as just summing is a useful way to combine knowledge from several unsupervised WSD methods, allowing to raise the performance of each one in isola-tion (coverage and/or precision). Furthermore, even those heuristics with apparently poor results provide knowledge to the final result not provided by the rest of heuristics. Thus, adding new heuristics with different methodologies and different knowledge (e.g. from corpora) as they become available will certainly improve the results.","Needless to say, several improvements can be done both in individual heuristic and also in the method to combine them. For instance, the cooccur-fence heuristics have been applied quite indiscriminately, even in low frequency conditions. Significance tests or association coefficients could be used in order to discard low confidence decisions. Also, instead of just summing, more clever combinations can be tried, such as training classifiers which use the heuristics as predictor variables.","Although we used these techniques for genus disambiguation we expect similar results (or even better taken the \"one sense per discourse\" property and lexical knowledge acquired from corpora) for the WSD problem."]},{"title":"7 Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["This work would not be possible without the collaboration of our colleagues, specially Jose Mari Arriola, Xabier Artola, Arantza Diaz de Ilarraza, Kepa Sarasola and Aitor Soroa in the Basque Country and Horacio Rodr~guez in Catalonia."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Alicia Ageno, Irene CastellSn, Maria Antonia Marti, Francesc Ribas, German Rigau, Horacio Rodriguez, Mariona Taul@ and Felisa Verdejo. 1992.
