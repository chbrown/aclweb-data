We show that the two approaches are closely related, and we argue that feature weighting methods in the Memory-Based paradigm can offer the advantage of automatically specifying a suitable domain-specific hierarchy between most specific and most general conditioning information without the need for a large number of parameters. We report two applications of this approach: PP-attachment and POS-tagging. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both domains, and allows the easy integration of diverse information sources, such as rich lexical representations."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Statistical approaches to disambiguation offer the advantage of making the most likely decision on the basis of available evidence. For this purpose a large number of probabilities has to be estimated from a training corpus. However, many possible conditioning events are not present in the training data, yield-ing zero Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates. This motivates the need for smoothing methods, which reestimate the probabilities of low-count events from more reliable estimates.","Inductive generalization from observed to new data lies at the heart of machine-learning approaches to disambiguation. In Memory-Based Learning 1 (MBL) induction is based on the use of similarity (Stanfill & Waltz, 1986; Aha et al., 1991; Cardie, 1994; Daelemans, 1995). In this paper we describe how the use of similarity between patterns embodies a solution to the sparse data problem, how it","1The Approach is also referred to as Case-based, Instance-based or Exemplar-based. relates to backed-off smoothing methods and what advantages it offers when combining diverse and rich information sources.","We illustrate the analysis by applying MBL to two tasks where combination of information sources promises to bring improved performance: PP-attachment disambiguation and Part of Speech tag-ging. 2 Memory-Based"]},{"title":"Language Processing","paragraphs":["The basic idea in Memory-Based language processing is that processing and learning are fundamentally interwoven. Each language experience leaves a memory trace which can be used to guide later processing. When a new instance of a task is processed, a set of relevant instances is selected from memory, and the output is produced by analogy to that set.","The techniques that are used are variants and extensions of the classic k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier algorithm. The instances of a task are stored in a table as patterns of feature-value pairs, together with the associated \"correct\" output. When a new pattern is processed, the k nearest neighbors of the pattern are retrieved from memory using some similarity metric. The output is then determined by extrapolation from the k nearest neighbors, i.e. the output is chosen that has the highest relative frequency among the nearest neighbors.","Note that no abstractions, such as grammatical rules, stochastic automata, or decision trees are extracted from the examples. Rule-like behavior results from the linguistic regularities that are present in the patterns of usage in memory in combination with the use of an appropriate similarity metric. It is our experience that even limited forms of abstraction can harm performance on linguistic tasks, which often contain many subregularities and exceptions (Daelemans, 1996)."]},{"title":"2.1 Similarity metrics","paragraphs":["The most basic metric for patterns with symbolic features is the Overlap metric given in equations 1 436 and 2; where A(X, Y) is the distance between patterns X and Y, represented by n features, wi is a weight for feature i, and 5 is the distance per feature. The k-NN algorithm with this metric, and equal weighting for all features is called IB1 (Aha et al., 1991). Usually k is set to 1. where: A(X, Y) = ~ wi 6(xi, yi) (1) i=l tf(xi,yi) = 0 if xi = yi, else 1 (2)","This metric simply counts the number of (mis)matching feature values in both patterns. If we do not have information about the importance of features, this is a reasonable choice. But if we do have some information about feature relevance one possibility would be to add linguistic bias to weight or select different features (Cardie, 1996). An alternative--more empiricist--approach, is to look at the behavior of features in the set of examples used for training. We can compute statistics about the relevance of features by looking at which features are good predictors of the class labels. Information Theory gives us a useful tool for measuring feature relevance in this way (Quinlan, 1986; Quinlan, 1993).","Information Gain (IG) weighting looks at each feature in isolation, and measures how much information it contributes to our knowledge of the correct class label. The Information Gain of feature f is measured by computing the difference in uncertainty (i.e. entropy) between the situations without and with knowledge of the value of that feature (Equation 3).","w] = H(C) - ~-]~ev, P(v) x H(Clv ) si(f) (3) si(f) = - Z P(v)log 2 P(v) (4) vEVs","Where C is the set of class labels, V f is the set of values for feature f, and H(C) = - ~cec P(c) log 2 P(e) is the entropy of the class labels. The probabilities are estimated from relative frequencies in the training set. The normalizing factor si(f) (split info) is included to avoid a bias in favor of features with more values. It represents the amount of information needed to represent all values of the feature (Equation 4). The resulting IG values can then be used as weights in equation 1. The k-NN algorithm with this metric is called ml-IG (Daelemans & Van den Bosch, 1992).","The possibility of automatically determining the relevance of features implies that many different and possibly irrelevant features can be added to the feature set. This is a very convenient methodology if theory does not constrain the choice enough beforehand, or if we wish to measure the importance of various information sources experimentally.","Finally, it should be mentioned that MBclassifiers, despite their description as table-lookup algorithms here, can be implemented to work fast, using e.g. tree-based indexing into the case-base (Daelemans et al., 1997)."]},{"title":"3 Smoothing of Estimates","paragraphs":["The commonly used method for probabilistic classification (the Bayesian classifier) chooses a class for a pattern X by picking the class that has the maximum conditional probability P(classlX ). This probability is estimated from the data set by looking at the relative joint frequency of occurrence of the classes and pattern X. If pattern X is described by a number of feature-values Xl,..., xn, we can write the conditional probability as P(classlxl,... , xn). If a particular pattern x~,..., x\" is not literally present among the examples, all classes have zero ML probability estimates. Smoothing methods are needed to avoid zeroes on events that could occur in the test material.","There are two main approaches to smoothing: count re-estimation smoothing such as the Add-One or Good-Turing methods (Church & Gale, 1991), and Back-off type methods (Bahl et al., 1983; Katz, 1987; Chen & Goodman, 1996; Samuelsson, 1996). We will focus here on a comparison with Back-off type methods, because an experimental comparison in Chen & Goodman (1996) shows the superiority of Back-off based methods over count re-estimation smoothing methods. With the Back-off method the probabilities of complex conditioning events are approximated by (a linear interpolation of) the probabilities of more general events:"]},{"title":"/5(ctasslX) = ~x/3(clas~lX) + ~x,/3(d~sslX') +... + ),x,~(dasslX n) (5)","paragraphs":["Where/5 stands for the smoothed estimate,/3 for the relative frequency estimate, A are interpolation weights, ~-']i~0\"kx' = 1, and X -< X i for all i, where -< is a (partial) ordering from most specific to most general feature-sets 2 (e.g the probabilities of trigrams (X) can be approximated by bigrams (X') and unigrams (X\")). The weights of the linear interpolation are estimated by maximizing the probability of held-out data (deleted interpolation) with the forward-backward algorithm. An alternative method to determine the interpolation weights without iterative training on held-out data is given in Samuelsson (1996). 2X -< X' can be read as X is more specific than X'. 437","We can assume for simplicity's sake that the Ax, do not depend on the value of"]},{"title":"X i,","paragraphs":["but only on i.

In most applications the interpolation method is used for tasks with clear orderings of feature-sets (e.g. n-gram language modeling) so that many of the 2 F -- 1 terms can be omitted beforehand. More recently, the integration of information sources, and the modeling of more complex language processing tasks in the statistical framework has increased the interest in smoothing methods (Collins ~z Brooks, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Magerman, 1994; Ng & Lee, 1996; Collins, 1996).

In the first place, if the most specific terms have non-zero frequency, it still interpolates them with the more general terms. Because the more general terms should never overrule the more specific ones, the Ax e for the more general terms should be quite small. Therefore the interpolation effect is usually small or negligible. The second function is the pure back-off function: if the more specific terms have zero frequency, the probabilities of the more general terms are used instead. Only if terms are of a similar specificity, the A's truly serve to weight relevance of the interpolation terms.","If we isolate the pure back-off function of the interpolation equation we get an algorithm similar to the one used in Collins & Brooks (1995). It is given in a schematic form in Table 1. Each step consists of a back-off to a lower level of specificity.

Hence, the problem of fitting the Axe parameters is replaced by a term selection task. To optimize the term selection, an evaluation of the up to 2 F terms on held-out data is still necessary. In summary, the Back-off method does not provide a principled and practical domain-independent method to adapt to the structure of a particular domain by determining a suitable ordering -< between events.

This is desirable when: (i) there are a number of schemata which are almost equally relevant, (ii) the top ranked schema selects too few cases to make a reliable estimate, or (iii) the chance that the few items instantiating the schema are mislabeled in the training material is high. In such cases we wish to include some of the lower-ranked schemata. For case (i) this can be done by discretiz-ing the IG weights into bins, so that minor differences will lose their significance, in effect merging some schemata back into buckets. For (ii) and (iii), and for continuous metrics (Stanfill & Waltz, 1986; Cost & Salzberg, 1993) which extrapolate from exactly k neighbors 5, it might be necessary to choose a k parameter larger than 1. This introduces one additional parameter, which has to be tuned on held-out data. We can then use the distance between a pattern and a schema to weight its vote in the nearest neighbor extrapolation. This results in a back-off sequence in which the terms at each step in the sequence are weighted with respect to each other, but without the introduction of any additional weighting parameters. A weighted voting function that was found to work well is due to Dudani (1976): the nearest neighbor schema receives a weight of 1.0, the furthest schema a weight of 0.0, and the other neighbors are scaled linearly to the line between these two points.","5Note that the schema analysis does not apply to these metrics. 439 Method IB1 (=Naive Back-off) IBI-IG LexSpace IG Back-off model (Collins & Brooks) C4.5 (Ratnaparkhi et al.)

This identifies the preposition as the most important feature: its weight is higher than the sum of the other three weights. The composition of the back-off sequence following from this can be seen in the lower part of Figure 1. The grey-colored schemata were effectively left out, because they include a mismatch on the preposition.","Table 2 shows a comparison of accuracy on the test-set of 3097 cases. We can see that Isl, which implicitly uses the same specificity ordering as the Naive Back-off algorithm already performs quite well in relation to other methods used in the literature. Collins & Brooks' (1995) Back-off model is more so-phisticated than the naive model, because they performed a number of validation experiments on held-out data to determine which terms to include and, more importantly, which to exclude from the back-off sequence. They excluded all terms which did not match in the preposition! Not surprisingly, the 84.1% accuracy they achieve is matched by the performance of IBI-IG. The two methods exactly mimic each others behavior, in spite of their huge difference in design. It should however be noted that the computation of IG-weights is many orders of magnitude faster than the laborious evaluation of terms on held-out data.","We also experimented with rich lexical representations obtained in an unsupervised way from word co-occurrences in raw WSJ text (Zavrel & Veenstra, 1995; Schiitze, 1994). We call these representations Lexical Space vectors. Each word has a numeric 25 dimensional vector representation. Using these vectors, in combination with the IG weights mentioned above and a cosine metric, we got even slightly better results. Because the cosine metric fails to group the patterns into discrete schemata, it is necessary to use a larger number of neighbors (k = 50). The result in Table 2 is obtained using Dudani's weighted voting method.","Note that to devise a back-off scheme on the basis of these high-dimensional representations (each pattern has 4 x 25 features) one would need to consider up to 2 l°° smoothing terms. The MBL framework is a convenient way to further experiment with even more complex conditioning events, e.g. with semantic labels added as features. 5.2 POS-tagging Another NLP problem where combination of different sources of statistical information is an important issue, is POS-tagging, especially for the guessing of the POS-tag of words not present in the lexicon. Relevant information for guessing the tag of an unknown word includes contextual information (the words and tags in the context of the word), and word form information (prefixes and suffixes, first and last letters of the word as an approximation of affix information, presence or absence of capitaliza-tion, numbers, special characters etc.). There is a large number of potentially informative features that could play a role in correctly predicting the tag of an unknown word (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Weischedel et al., 1993; Daelemans et al., 1996). A priori, it is not clear what the relative importance is of these features.","We compared Naive Back-off estimation and MBL with two sets of features:","• PDASS: the first letter of the unknown word (p),","the tag of the word to the left of the unknown","word (d), a tag representing the set of possible","lexical categories of the word to the right of the","unknown word (a), and the two last letters (s).","The first letter provides information about cap-","italisation and the prefix, the two last letters 440 about suffixes.","• PDDDAAASSS: more left and right context features, and more suffix information.","The data set consisted of 100,000 feature value patterns taken from the Wall Street Journal corpus. Only open-class words were used during construc-tion of the training set. For both IBI-IG and Naive Back-off, a 10-fold cross-validation experiment was run using both PDASS and PDDDAAASSS patterns. The results are in Table 3. The IG values for the features are given in Figure 2.","The results show that for Naive Back-off (and ml) the addition of more, possibly irrelevant, features quickly becomes detrimental (decrease from 88.5 to 85.9), even if these added features do make a generalisation performance increase possible (witness the increase with IBI-IG from 88.3 to 89.8). Notice that we did not actually compute the 21° terms of Naive Back-off in the PDDDAAASSS condition, as IB1 is guaranteed to provide statistically the same results. Contrary to Naive Back-off and IB1, memory-based learning with feature weighting (ml-IG) manages to integrate diverse information sources by differentially assigning relevance to the different features. Since noisy features will receive low IG weights, this also implies that it is much more noise-tolerant. 0.30 - 0.25 -","0.20 - F o~ \"3 ~_ 0.15-0.10 , 0.05 - 0.0-p d d d a a a s s s feature Figure 2: IG values for features used in predicting the tag of unknown words.

All differences are statistically significant (two-tailed paired t-test, p < 0.05). Standard deviations on the 10 experiments are between brackets. 6 Conclusion We have analysed the relationship between Back-off smoothing and Memory-Based Learning and established a close correspondence between these two frameworks which were hitherto mostly seen as unrelated. An exception is the use of similarity for alleviating the sparse data problem in language modeling (Essen & Steinbiss, 1992; Brown et al., 1992; Dagan et al., 1994). However, these works differ in their focus from our analysis in that the emphasis is put on similarity between values of a feature (e.g. words), instead of similarity between patterns that are a (possibly complex) combination of many features.","The comparison of MBL and Back-off shows that the two approaches perform smoothing in a very similar way, i.e. by using estimates from more general patterns if specific patterns are absent in the training data. The analysis shows that MBL and Back-off use exactly the same type of data and counts, and this implies that MBL can safely be incorporated into a system that is explicitly probabilistic. Since the underlying k-NN classifier is a method that does not necessitate any of the common independence or distribution assumptions, this promises to be a fruitful approach.","A serious advantage of the described approach, is that in MBL the back-off sequence is specified by the used similarity metric, without manual in-tervention or the estimation of smoothing parameters on held-out data, and requires only one parameter for each feature instead of an exponential number of parameters. With a feature-weighting metric such as Information Gain, MBL is particularly at an advantage for NLP tasks where conditioning events are complex, where they consist of the fusion of different information sources, or when the data is noisy. This was illustrated by the experiments on PP-attachment and POS-tagging data-sets. 441"]},{"title":"Acknowledgements","paragraphs":["This research was done in the context of the \"Induction of Linguistic Knowledge\" research programme, partially supported by the Foundation for Language Speech and Logic (TSL), which is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
