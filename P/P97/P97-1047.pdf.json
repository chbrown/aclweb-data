We describe a stack decoding algorithm in this paper. We present the hypothesis scoring method and the heuristics used in our algorithm. We report several techniques deployed to improve the performance of the decoder. We also introduce a simplified model to moderate the sparse data problem and to speed up the decoding process. We evaluate and compare these techniques/models in our statistical machine translation system. 1 Introduction 1.1","Statistical Machine Translation Statistical machine translation is based on a channel model. Given a sentence T in one language (German) to be translated into another language (English), it considers T as the target of a communication channel, and its translation S as the source of the channel. Hence the machine translation task becomes to recover the source from the target. Basically every English sentence is a possible source for a German target sentence. If we assign a probability P(S I T) to each pair of sentences (S, T), then the problem of translation is to find the source S for a given target T, such that P(S [ T) is the maximum. According to Bayes rule,","P(S IT) = P(S)P(T I S) P(T) (1) Since the denominator is independent of S, we have -- arg maxP(S)P(T I S) (2) S","Therefore a statistical machine translation system","must deal with the following three problems: • Modeling Problem: How to depict the process","of generating a sentence in a source language,","and the process used by a channel to generate a target sentence upon receiving a source sentence? The former is the problem of language modeling, and the later is the problem of translation modeling. They provide a framework for calculating P(S) and P(W I S) in (2).","• Learning Problem: Given a statistical language model P(S) and a statistical translation model P(T I S), how to estimate the parameters in these models from a bilingual corpus of sentences?","• Decoding Problem: With a fully specified (framework and parameters) language and translation model, given a target sentence T, how to efficiently search for the source sentence","that satisfies (2).","The modeling and learning issues have been dis-","cussed in (Brown et ah, 1993), where ngram model","was used for language modeling, and five different","translation models were introduced for the transla-","tion process. We briefly introduce the model 2 here,","for which we built our decoder.","In model 2, upon receiving a source English sen-","tence e = el,. • -, el, the channel generates a German","sentence g = gl, • • \", g,n at the target end in the fol-","lowing way:","1.

For each position i (0 < i < m) in g, find the corresponding position ai in e according to an alignment distribution P(ai I i, a~ -1, m, e). In model 2, the distribution only depends on i, ai and the length of the English and German sentences: P(ai l i, a~-l,m,e) = a(ai l i, m,l)","3.

Although the authors of (Brown et al., 1993) stated that they would discuss the search problem in a follow-up arti- • cle, so far there have no publications devoted to the decoding issue for statistical machine translation. On the other side, decoding algorithm is a crucial part in statistical machine translation. Its performance directly affects the quality and efficiency of translation. Without a good and efficient decoding algorithm, a statistical machine translation system may miss the best translation of an input sentence even if it is perfectly predicted by the model. 2 Stack Decoding Algorithm Stack decoders are widely used in speech recognition systems. The basic algorithm can be described as following: 1. Initialize the stack with a null hypothesis.","2. Pop the hypothesis with the highest score off the stack, name it as current-hypothesis.","3. if current-hypothesis is a complete sentence, output it and terminate.","4. extend current-hypothesis by appending a word in the lexicon to its end.

Because of the constraints from language model and from the fact that a position in a source sentence cannot be occupied by two different words, normally the placement of words in those unfilled positions cannot maximize the likelihood of all the target words simultaneously. 2.2 Pruning and aborting search Due to physical space limitation, we cannot keep all hypotheses alive. We set a constant M, and whenever the number of hypotheses exceeds M, the algorithm will prune the hypotheses with the lowest scores. In our experiments, M was set to 20,000.","There is time limitation too. It is of little practical interest to keep a seemingly endless search alive too long. So we set a constant T, whenever the decoder extends more than T hypotheses, it will abort the search and register a failure. In our experiments, T was set to 6000, which roughly corresponded to 2 and half hours of search effort. 2.3 Multi-Stack Search The above decoder has one problem: since the heuristic function overestimates the merit of extending a hypothesis, the decoder always prefers hypotheses of a long sentence, which have a better chance to maximize the likelihood of the target words. The decoder will extend the hypothesis with large I first, and their children will soon occupy the stack and push the hypotheses of a shorter source sentence out of the stack. If the source sentence is a short one, the decoder will never be able to find it, for the hypotheses leading to it have been pruned permanently.","This \"incomparable\" problem was solved with multi-stack search(Magerman, 1994). A separate stack was used for each hypothesized source sentence length 1. We do compare hypotheses in different stacks in the following cases. First, we compare a complete sentence in a stack with the hypotheses in other stacks to safeguard the optimality of search result; Second, the top hypothesis in a stack is compared with that of another stack. If the difference is greater than a constant ~, then the less probable one will not be extended. This is called soft-pruning, since whenever the scores of the hypotheses in other stacks go down, this hypothesis may revive. 368 Z 2 5000 400O 3000 2000 1000 0 0 5","l0 15 20 25 Sentence Length Engfish -- 30 35 40 5OOO 4OOO 3OOO 111011 0 5","I0 15 20 25 Sentence Length German -- 30 35 40 Figure 1: Sentence Length Distribution 3 Stack Search with a Simplified Model In the IBM translation model 2, the alignment parameters depend on the source and target sentence length I and m.

This may not be a problem when massive training data are available. However, in our application, this is a severe problem. Figure 1 plots the length distribution for the English and German sentences. When sentences get longer, there are fewer training data available.","2. the search algorithm has to make multiple hypotheses of different source sentence length.

It is used to calculate the mean of the heuristics over all possible source sentence length, m is the target sentence length. The parameters of the Poisson distributions can be estimated from training data. 4 Implementation Due to historical reasons, stack search got its current name. Unfortunately, the requirement for search states organization is far beyond what a stack and its push pop operations can handle. What we really need is a dynamic set which supports the following operations: 1. INSERT: to insert a new hypothesis into the","set. 2. DELETE: to delete a state in hard pruning. 3. MAXIMUM: to find the state with the best","score to extend. 4. MINIMUM: to find the state to be pruned.","We used the Red-Black tree data structure (Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, 1990) to implement the dynamic set, which guarantees that the above operations take O(log n) time in the worst case, where n is the number of search states in the set. 5 Performance We tested the performance of the decoders with the scheduling corpus(Suhm et al., 1995). Around 30,000 parallel sentences (400,000 words altogether for both languages) were used to train the IBM model 2 and the simplified model with the EM algorithm. A larger English monolingual corpus with around 0.5 million words was used to train a bigram for language modelling. The lexicon contains 2,800 English and 4,800 German words in morphologically inflected form. We did not do any preprocessing/analysis of the data as reported in (Brown et al., 1992). 5.1 Decoder Success Rate Table 1 shows the success rate of three models/decoders. As we mentioned before, the comparison between hypotheses of different sentence length made the single stack search for the IBM model 2 fail (return without a result) on a majority of the test sentences. While the multi-stack decoder improved this, the simplified model/decoder produced an output for all the 120 test sentences. 5.2 Translation Accuracy Unlike the case in speech recognition, it is quite arguable what \"accurate translations\" means. In speech recognition an output can be compared with the sample transcript of the test data. In machine translation, a sentence may have several legitimate translations. It is difficult to compare an output from a decoder with a designated translation. In-stead, we used human subjects to judge the machine-made translations. The translations are classified into three categories 1. 1. Correct translations: translations that are grammatical and convey the same meaning as the inputs.","2. Okay translations: translations that convey the same meaning but with small grammatical mistakes or translations that convey most but not the entire meaning of the input.","3. Incorrect translations: Translations that are ungrammatical or convey little meaningful information or the information is different from the input.","Examples of correct, okay, and incorrect translations are shown in Table 2.","Table 3 shows the statistics of the translation results. The accuracy was calculate by crediting a correct translation 1 point and an okay translation 1/2 point.","There are two different kinds of errors in statistical machine translation. A modeling erivr occurs when the model assigns a higher score to an incorrect translation than a correct one. We cannot do anything about this with the decoder. A decoding","1 This is roughly the same as the classification in IBM statistical translation, except we do not have \"legitimate translation that conveys different meaning from the input\" -- we did not observed this case in our outputs. 370","Model 2, Single Stack","Model 2, Multi-Stack","Simplified Model Total Test Sentences Decoded Sentenced Failed sentences","120 32 88","120 83 37","120 120 0 Table 1: Decoder Success Rate Correct Okay Incorrect German English (target) English (output) German English/target) English (output) German English (target) English/output/ German English/target) English (output) German English (target) English (output) German English (target) English (output) ich habe ein Meeting yon halb zehn bis um zwSlf I have a meeting from nine thirty to twelve I have a meeting from nine thirty to twelve versuchen wir sollten es vielleicht mit einem anderen Termin we might want to try for some other time we should try another time ich glaube nicht diis ich noch irgend etwas im Januar frei habe I do not think I have got anything open m January I think I will not free in January ich glaube wit sollten em weiteres Meeting vereinbaren I think we have to have another meeting I think we should fix a meeting schlagen Sie doch einen Termin vor why don't you suggest a time why you an appointment ich habe Zeit fiir den Rest des Tages I am free the rest of it I have time for the rest of July Table 2: Examples of Correct, Okay, and Incorrect Translations: for each translation, the first line is an input German sentence, the second line is the human made (target) translation for that input sentence, and the third line is the output from the decoder. error or search error happens when the search algorithm misses a correct translation with a higher score.","When evaluating a decoding algorithm, it would be attractive if we can tell how many errors are caused by the decoder. Unfortunately, this is not attainable. Suppose that we are going to translate a German sentence g, and we know from the sample that e is one of its possible English translations. The decoder outputs an incorrect e ~ as the translation of g. If the score of e' is lower than that of e, we know that a search error has occurred. On the other hand, if the score of e' is higher, we cannot decide if it is a modeling error or not, since there may still be other legitimate translations with a score higher than e ~ -- we just do not know what they are.","Although we cannot distinguish a modeling error from a search error, the comparison between the decoder output's score and that of a sample translation can still reveal some information about the performance of the decoder. If we know that the decoder can find a sentence with a better score than a \"correct\" translation, we will be more confident that the decoder is less prone to cause errors. Table 4 shows the comparison between the score of the outputs from the decoder and the score of the sample translations when the outputs are incorrect. In most cases, the incorrect outputs have a higher score than the sample translations. Again, we consider a \"okay\" translation a half error here.","This result hints that model deficiencies may be a major source of errors. The models we used here are very simple. With a more sophisticated model, more training data, and possibly some preprocessing, the total error rate is expected to decrease. 5.3 Decoding Speed Another important issue is the efficiency of the decoder. Figure 3 plots the average number of states being extended by the decoders. It is grouped according to the input sentence length, and evaluated on those sentences on which the decoder succeeded.","The average number of states being extended in the model 2 single stack search is not available for long sentences, since the decoder failed on most of the long sentences.","The figure shows that the simplified model/decoder works much more efficiently than the other mod-371 Total Model 2, Multi-Stack 83 Simplified Model 120","Correct Okay Incorrect Accuracy 39 12 32 54.2% 64 15 41 59.6% Table 3: Translation"]},{"title":"Accuracy","paragraphs":["Model 2, Multi-Stack Simplified Model Total Errors"]},{"title":"Scoree > Scoree, Scoree < Seoree,","paragraphs":["38 3.5 (7.9%) 34.5 (92.1%) 48.5 4.5 (9.3%) 44 (90.7%) Table 4: Sample Translations versus Machine-Made Translations 6000 5000 ~d 4000 3000 =~ 2ooo Z 10oo < 0 j..Zh 1-4 \"Model2-Single-S tack\" , ,","\"Model2-Multi-Stack\" --~ \"Simplified-Moder' , ......... i i 5-8 9-12 13-16 17-20 Target Sentence Length Figure 3: Extended States versus Target Sentence Length els/decoders. 6 Conclusions We have reported a stack decoding algorithm for the IBM statistical translation model 2 and a simplified model. Because the simplified model has fewer uarameters and does not have to posit hypotheses with the same prefixes but different length, it outperformed the IBM model 2 with regard to both accuracy and efficiency, especially in our application that lacks a massive amount of training data. In most cases, the erroneous outputs from the decoder have a higher score than the human made translations. Therefore it is less likely that the decoder is a major contributor of translation errors. 7 Acknowledgements We would like to thank John Lafferty for enlightening discussions on this work.
