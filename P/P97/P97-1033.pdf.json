Allen Department of Computer Science University 9f Rochester Rochester NY 14627, USA","paragraphs":["{heeman, j ames }~cs. rochester, edu Abstract To understand a speaker's turn of a conversation, one needs to segment it into intonational phrases, clean up any speech repairs that might have occurred, and identify discourse markers. In this paper, we argue that these problems must be resolved together, and that they must be resolved early in the processing stream. We put for-ward a statistical language model that resolves these problems, does POS tagging, and can be used as the language model of a speech recognizer. We find that by accounting for the interactions between these tasks that the performance on each task improves, as does POS tagging and perplexity. 1 Introduction Interactive spoken dialog provides many new challenges for natural language understanding systems. One of the most critical challenges is simply determining the speaker's intended utterances: both segmenting the speaker's turn into utterances and determining the intended words in each utterance. Since there is no well-agreed to definition of what an utterance is, we instead focus on intonational phrases (Silverman et al., 1992), which end with an acoustically signaled boundary lone. Even assuming perfect word recognition, the problem of determining the intended words is complicated due to the occurrence of speech repairs, which occur where the speaker goes back and changes (or repeats) something she just said. The words that are replaced or repeated are no longer part of the intended utterance, and so need to be identified. The following example, from the Trains corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1995), gives an example of a speech repair with the words that the speaker intends to be replaced marked by reparandum, the words that are the intended replacement marked as alteration, and the cue phrases and filled pauses that tend to occur in between marked as the editing term. Example 1 (d92a-5.2 utt34) we'll pick up ~. uh the tanker of oranges reparandu \"q'ml ~ • ~ •","editing term alteration interruption point","Much work has been done on both detecting boundary tones (e.g. (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992; Wightman and Ostendorf, 1994; Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996a; Kompe et al., 1994; Mast et al., 1996)) and on speech repair detection and correction (e.g. (Hindle, 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992; Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1994; Heeman and Allen, 1994; Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996b)). This work has focused on one of the issues in isolation of the other. However, these two issues are intertwined. Cues such as the presence of silence, final syllable lengthening, and presence of filled pauses tend to mark both events. Even the presence of word correspondences, a tradition cue for detecting and correcting speech repairs, sometimes marks boundary tones as well, as illustrated by the following example where the intonational phrase boundary is marked with the ToBI symbol %. Example 2 (d93-83.3 utt73) that's all you need % you only need one boxcar","Intonational phrases and speech repairs also in-teract with the identification of discourse markers. Discourse markers (Schiffrin, 1987; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Byron and Heeman, 1997) are used to relate new speech to the current discourse state. Lexical items that can function as discourse markers, such as \"well\" and \"okay,\" are ambiguous as to whether they are being used as discourse markers or not. The complication is that discourse markers tend to be used to introduce a new utterance, or can be an utterance all to themselves (such as the acknowledgment \"okay\" or \"alright\"), or can be used as part of the editing term of a speech repair, or to begin the alteration. Hence, the problem of identifying discourse markers also needs to be addressed with the segmentation and speech repair problems.","These three phenomena of spoken dialog, however, cannot be resolved without recourse to syntactic information. Speech repairs, for example, are often 254 signaled by syntactic anomalies. Furthermore, in order to determine the extent of the reparanduin, one needs to take into account the parallel structure that typically exists between the reparandum and alteration, which relies on at identifying the s:?ntactic roles, or part-of-speech (POS) tags, of the words involved (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992; Heeman and Allen, 1994). However, speech repairs disrupt the context that is needed to determine the POS tags (Hindle, 1983). Hence, speech repairs, as well as boundary tones and discourse markers, must be resolved during syntactic disambiguation.","Of course when dealing with spoken dialogue, one cannot forget the initial problem of determining the actual words that the speaker is saying. Speech recognizers rely on being able to predict the probability of what word will be said next. Just as intonational phrases and speech repairs disrupt the local context that is needed for syntactic disambiguation, the same holds for predicting what word will come next. If a speech repair or intonational phrase occurs, this will alter the probability estimate. But more importantly, speech repairs and intonational phrases have acoustic correlates such as the presence of silence. Current speech recognition language models camlot account for the presence of silence, and tend to simply ignore it. By modeling speech repairs and intonational boundaries, we can take into account the acoustic correlates and hence use more of the available information.","From the above discussion, it is clear that we need to model these dialogue phenomena together and very early on in the speech processing stream, in fact, during speech recognition. Currently, the approaches that work best in speech recognition are statistical approaches that are able to assign probability estimates for what word will occur next given the previous words. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a statistical language model that can detect speech repairs, boundary tones, and discourse markers, and can assign POS tags, and can use this information to better predict what word will occur next.","In the rest of the paper, we first introduce the Trains corpus. We then introduce a statistical language model that incorporates POS tagging and the identification of discourse markers. We then augmeat this model with speech repair detection and correction and intonational boundary tone detection. We then present the results of this model on the Trains corpus and show that it can better account for these discourse events than can be achieved by modeling them individually. We also show that by modeling these two phenomena that we can in-crease our POS tagging performance by 8.6%, and improve our ability to predict the next word.

However, for detecting and correcting speech repairs, and identifying boundary tones and discourse markers, we need to augment the model so that it incorporates shallow statistical analysis, in the form of POS tagging. The POS tagset, based on the Penn Treebank tagset (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993), includes special tags for denoting when a word is being used as a discourse marker. In this section, we give an overview of our basic language model that incorporates POS tagging. Full details can be found in (Heeman and Allen, 1997; Heeman~ 1997).","To add in POS tagging, we change the goal of the speech recognition process to find the best word and POS tags given the acoustic signal.

However, the amount of training data is limited (as are the learning techniques) and so we need to encode the context in order to simplify the task of constructing meaningflfl equivalence classes. We start with the words and their POS tags that are in the context and for each non-null tone, editing term (we also skip over E=ET), and repair tag, we insert it into the appropriate place, just as Kompe et al.

This means that we can then generalize between fluent speech and instances that have a repair. For instance, in the two examples below, the context for the word \"get\" and its POS tag will be the same for both, namely \"so/CC_D we/PRP need/VBP to/TO\".

Due to sparseness of data, we make several the independence assumptions so that we can separate the silence information from the rest of the context. For example, for the tone tag, let Resti represent the rest of the context that is used to condition T/. By assuming that Resti and Si are independent, and are independent given T/, we can rewrite Pr(TiISiResti) as follows. . Pr(2qlSi-1) Pr(T~lS~Rest~) = Pr(filResh) Pr(T, IS, ) We can now use P,-(T,) as a factor to modify the tone probability in order to take into account the silence duration. In Figure 3, we give the factors by which we adjust the tag probabilities given the amount of silence. Again, due to sparse of data, we collapse the values of the tone, editing term and repair tag into six classes: boundary tones, editing term pushes, editing term pops, modification repairs and fresh starts (without an editing term). From the figure, we see that if there is no silence between wi-1 and wi, the null interpretation for the tone, repair and editing term tags is preferred. Since the independence assumptions that we have to make are too strong, we normalize the adjusted tone, editing term and repair tag probabilities to ensure that they sum to one over all of the values of the tags. 6 Example To demonstrate how the model works, consider the following example.

The fifth column adds in boundary tone detection, which improves both the detection and correction of speech repairs. 8 Comparison to Other Work Comparing the performance of this model to others that have been proposed in the literature is very difficult, due to differences in corpora, and different input assumptions. However, it is useful to compare the different techniques that are used.","Bear et al. (1992) used a simple pattern matching approach on ATIS word transcriptions. They exclude all turns that have a repair that just consists of a filled pause or word fragment.

Using these clues they were able to train a decision tree which achieved a recall rate of 86.1% and a precision of 92.1% on a set of turns in which each turn contained at least one speech repair. Stolcke and Shriberg (1996b) examined whether perplexity can be improved by modeling simple types of speech repairs in a language model. They find that doing so actually makes perplexity worse, and they attribute this to not having a linguistic segmentation available, which would help in modeling filled pauses. We feel that speech repair modeling must be combined with detecting utterance boundaries and discourse markers, and should take advantage of acoustic information.","For detecting boundary tones, the model of Wightman and Ostendorf (1994) achieves a recall rate of 78.1% and a precision of 76.8%. Their better performance is partly attributed to richer (speaker dependent) acoustic modeling, including phoneme duration, energy, and pitch. However, their model was trained and tested on professionally read speech, rather than spontaneous speech.","Wang and Hirschberg (1992) did employ spontaneous speech, namely, the ATIS corpus. For turn-internal boundary tones, they achieved a recall rate of 38.5% and a precision of 72.9% using a decision tree approach that combined both textual features, such as POS tags, and syntactic constituents with intonational features. One explanation for the difference in performance was that our model was trained on approximately ten times as much data. Secondly, their decision trees are used to classify each data point independently of the next, whereas we find the best interpretation over the entire turn, and incorporate speech repairs.","The models of Kompe et al. (1994) and Mast et al. (1996) are the most similar to our model in terms of incorporating a language model. Mast et al. achieve a recall rate of 85.0% and a precision of 53.1% on identifying dialog acts in a German corpus. Their model employs richer acoustic modeling, however, it does not account for other aspects of utterance modeling, such as speech repairs. 9 Conclusion In this paper, we have shown that the problems of identifying intonational boundaries and discourse markers, and resolving speech repairs can be tackled by a statistical language model, which uses local context. We have also shown that these tasks, along with POS tagging, should be resolved together. Since our model can give a probability estimate for the next word, it can be used as the language model for a speech recognizer. In terms of perplexity, our model gives a 14% improvement over word-based language models. Part of this improvement is due to being able to exploit silence durations,"]},{"title":"260","paragraphs":["which traditional word-based language models tend to ignore. Our next step is to incorporate this model into a speech recognizer in order to validate that the improved perplexity does in fact lead to a better word recognition rate. 10 Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the NSF under grant IRI-9623665 and by ONR under grant N00014-95-1-1088.
