This transformation is especially advantageous for part-of-speech tagging because the resulting transducer can be composed with other transducers that encode correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors. The speed of tagging is also improved. The described methods have been implemented and successfully tested on six languages. 1 Introduction Finite-state automata have been successfully applied in many areas of computational linguistics.","This paper describes two algorithms 1 which approximate a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used for part-of-speech tagging by a finite-state transducer (FST). These algorithms may be useful beyond the current description on any kind of analysis of written or spoken language based on both finite-state technology and HMMs, such as corpus analysis, speech recognition, etc. Both algorithms have been fully implemented.","An HMM used for tagging encodes, like a transducer, a relation between two languages. One language contains sequences of ambiguity classes obtained by looking up in a lexicon all words of a sentence. The other language contains sequences of tags obtained by statistically disambiguating the class sequences. From the outside, an HMM tagger behaves like a sequential transducer that deterministically","1There is a different (unpublished) algorithm by Julian M. Kupiec and John T. Maxwell (p.c.). maps every class sequence to a tag sequence, e.g.:","[DET, PRO] [ADJ,NOUN] [ADJ,NOUN] ...... [END] (i) DET ADJ NOUN ...... END","The aim of the conversion is not to generate FSTs that behave in the same way, or in as similar a way as possible like IIMMs, but rather FSTs that perform tagging in as accurate a way as possible. The motivation to derive these FSTs from HMMs is that HMMs can be trained and converted with little manual effort.","The tagging speed when using transducers is up to five times higher than when using the underlying HMMs. The main advantage of transforming an HMM is that the resulting transducer can be handled by finite state calculus. Among others, it can be composed with transducers that encode:","• correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors which are automatically generated (Brill, 1992; Roche and Schabes, 1995) or manually written (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995), in order to significantly improve tagging accuracy 2. These rules may include long-distance dependencies not handled by HMM taggers, and can conveniently be expressed by the replace operator (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Karttunen, 1995; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996).","• further steps of text analysis, e.g. light parsing or extraction of noun phrases or other phrases (Ait-Mokhtar and Chanod, 1997). These compositions enable complex text analysis to be performed by a single transducer. An IIMM transducer builds on the data (probability matrices) of the underlying HMM. The accuracy","2Automatically derived rules require less work than manually written ones but are unlikely to yield better results because they would consider relatively limited context and simple relations only. 460 of this data has an impact on the tagging accuracy of both the HMM itself and the derived transducer. The training of the HMM can be done on either a tagged or untagged corpus, and is not a topic of this paper since it is exhaustively described in the literature (Bahl and Mercer, 1976; Church, 1988).","An HMM can be identically represented by a weighted FST in a straightforward way.

We do, however, not estimate probabilities over paths. The tag of the first word is selected based on its initial and class probability. The next tag is selected on its transition probability given the first tag, and its class probability, etc. Unlike in an HMM, once a decision on a tag has been made, it influences the following decisions but is itself irreversible.","A transducer encoding this behaviour can be generated as sketched in figure 1. In this example we have a set of three classes, Cl with the two tags tn and t12, c2 with the three tags t21, t22 and t23 , and c3 with one tag t31.

Every following symbol is mapped to the empty string by means of [? :[ ]]. (eq. 19).

First, the word is looked for in the lexicon. If this fails, it is looked for in the guesser.

Tag probabilities in this class are approximated by tags of words that appear only once in the training corpus.","As soon as an input token gets labelled with the tag class of sentence end symbols (fig. 2: [SENT]), the tagger stops reading words from the input.
