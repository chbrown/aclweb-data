It includes a core English lexicon and grammar, a concept network, processes for applying these to lexical , syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, and tools that support the adaptation of the generi c core to new domains, primarily by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific lexicon and topic patterns . The lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis components required little adaptation fo r MUC-5, the most significant change being conversion of the task-specific semantic representation s to object-oriented form . The discourse analysis component was modified to operate on the task - specific semantic structures, rather than the generic case frames."]},{"title":"APPROAC H","paragraphs":["The overall structure and operation of PAKTUS are shown in Figure 1 . This is similar to the \"generic system\" described in [1] . Processing proceeds mostly sequentially, with the exception o f the interaction between the syntactic and semantic components at the clause and noun phrase level , and between the lexical analysis and preprocessor.","For the MUC5 task, we added some bracketing capabilities to handle the special syntacti c phenomena in the financial application domain which might cause problems for the parser or late r extraction processes . These phenomena include company name, currency, temporal expressions , and one percentage expression . For example, \"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO .\" , \"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWAN CO\" , \"UNION PRECISION CASTING CO\" and \"TAG A CO.\" are recognized as company names during the bracketing phase ; \" 20 MILLION NE W TAIWAN DOLLARS\" is bracketed as ((20000000 DOLLA RA CURRENCY BASE CT̂AIWAN)) ; and \"75 PCT BY\" is treated as a preposition . The complete sentence parse rate for the MUC 5 corpus was significantly improved by the bracketing process, minimizing the need for comple x additions to the grammar .","Unlike the generic system, PAKTUS has no text filter or preparser . Full parses are attempted on all sentences, and the first syntactico-semantically successful parse of a sentence is accepted . Parse time is restricted as a linear function of the number of words, however, and parse fragment s are returned, implicitly conjoined, if a full parse cannot be produced in the allotted time . Ful l parses were achieved for approximately 50 percent of the sentences in the MUC-5 corpus. Usefu l information was obtained from the fragmentary parses of the other half, however . Based o n comparison of the MUC-5 error measures when fragmentary parses were included and excluded , 195 the fragmented parses yielded, on average, about one-third as much correct information as the full parses .","Another variation on the generic system is that fragment combination and semanti c interpretation are integrated in PAKTUS, and semantic interpretation is divided into two distinc t modules : one that produces a generic representation of the complete sentence, and a subsequen t module that maps this into (possibly several) task-specific representations . In addition, at the lexical analysis phase, as mentioned above, each word was associated with both syntactic an d semantic information . Lexical patterns were developed as an alternative to semantic interpretatio n based on full syntactico-semantic parses . This takes advantage of the information rich lexica l analysis. A pattern matcher uses the results of both the lexical analysis (as in Figure 2a) and the syntactic analysis (as in Figure 3b) to extract information . This is invoked when the extractio n based on full parsing fails to yield any data . The patterns are defined as regular expressions tha t are matched against the results of lexical analysis. When a match is found, the corresponding nou n phrases (produced by the full parser) are extracted and the task-specific semantic representation i s constructed from these .","PAKTUS has no separate lexical disambiguation module : that function is distributed across all system modules . Initially, words are assigned all possible meanings available in the lexicon . Senses that are inconsistent with any processing choice are filtered out when that choice i s considered .","Doc Template Preprocessor Words & Sentences Semantic \\t Semantic \\t Semantic Frames \\t Analysis \\t Structures","016 Parser","Internal Reps & Link s Generic-to-Task \\t Task-specific Mapping \\t Structures Reference Resolution Topics & Bindings Outpu t Generator Filled Template s Lexicon & Morph Rules Syntactic Structures Semantic Mapping s Output Template s Figure 1 : PAKTUS Modules and Control Flo w"]},{"title":"PROCESSING OF MUC-5 DOCUMENT 059 2","paragraphs":["Figure 2a shows the raw, unprocessed text of the first sentence (Si) of article number 0592 , followed by its lexical analysis.

This left us with one month of effort for task-specific linguistic development . Th e specific changes and additions to the PAKTUS knowledge bases for MUC-5 are enumerated i n Figure 10. In parallel with the MUC-5 activity, we devoted 1 .9 months of effort to generi c development of our system, which may have had some impact on MUC-5 performance . Limiting Factors","The two areas that could significantly improve performance with modest effort are the definition of task-specific semantic mappings and the output generator. These are highlighted i n Figure 11 . Very little was done here, however, due to limited time and resources . Only 147 of the semantic mappings were defined . We estimate that about 1,000 would be needed to map th e generic linguistic data extracted by PAKTUS into the task-specific representations. That woul d have required about another month of effort . Within the output generator module, which produce s the final output template fills, many functions were incomplete or entirely absent .

This detracts from linguisti c development that might otherwise have been done, and hides much of the linguistic competence o f the system if the engineering is incomplete, as in our case (e .g ., correct information was clearl y obtained, as in Figure 6, but not reported due to an incomplete output function) .
