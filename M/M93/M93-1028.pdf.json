The Shogun system used 37 patterns in English, and 7 for Japanese . Patterns wer e context dependent, and referenced a dateline in order to handle relative time . The patterns were able to perform temporal calculations, and the system computed a temporal structure from reference points on th e dateline. The system was able to handle temporal references which were spread throughout a message . Thi s approach allowed the Shogun system to have a good coverage of time fills ; extensions to this approach wil l provide improved handling of ambiguous dates ."]},{"title":"AUTOMATICALLY TRAINABLE ERROR CORRECTION O F JAPANESE SEGMENTATION AND PART-OF-SPEECH ANAL-YSI S","paragraphs":["Sean Boisen presented BBN 's work on a learning algorithm which was used to improve the performanc e of the Juman Japanese word-segmentation system provided by Kyoto University . BBN used AMED (Automatic Morphological Error Detection) as a segment correction model between Juman and BBN's POS T tagger . Using hand-produced segmentation and tagging for training purposes, the system was able to ac - quire transformations from tags, and learn rules for segment correction, in order to reclassify words, pu t words together, and take words apart . The system produced a chart of possible corrections . The supervised training used Treebank software . The AMED/POST combination was able to improve segmentation an d tagging performance with little data ; this approach will be extended to parsing in the future . 341"]},{"title":"SOME ASPECTS OF PRINCIPLE-BASED PARSING IN TH E MUC-5 TAS K","paragraphs":["Robert Belvin described the use of principle-based parsing in LSI's parser, in particular the use of principle s of grammatical theory and parsing principles (based on empirical knowledge of language) . LSI 's parser incorporates a number of features of the Government-Binding theory of syntax, including projection and thematic principles, in an essentially head-driven parser which employs bottom-up and expectation-base d characteristics . The parser is designed to be language independent, to produce syntactic structures whic h facilitate semantic processing, and to be robust enough to produce partial parses which are usable in late r semantic processing . Robert discussed the handling of empty categories, with respect to passive constructions and embedded infinitivals. Robert concluded with a discussion of the insertion of special structures as a mean s of providing a \"quick fix \" for constructions which are not completely handled by the principles which have been implemented ."]},{"title":"DEALING WITH AMBIGUITY","paragraphs":["Jim Cowie discussed experiences with NMSU's reference resolution module in their Diderot system . Th e system attempted to disambiguate text into a list of sense tokens . Disambiguation was performed in parsing and semantic tagging stages . Tagging was done using word-lists with semantic and type tags . Parsing use d tags in conjunction with co-specification patterns . Jim discussed various problems which occurred, includin g a lack of sense-tokens for Japanese, multiple-tagging problems, the need for a lexical database featurin g compound terms, the need for domain-specific markers, the need for combinatorial rules, and the need fo r negative blocking information . Future experiments will focus on the use of machine learning techniques fo r acquiring semantic tagging information and deriving semantic patterns . 342"]}]}
