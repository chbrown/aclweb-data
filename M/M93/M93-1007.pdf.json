Although this may not seem reasonable from an applications perspective, from a research perspective w e believe that the exclusion of noncommittal responses results in a much less distorted cross-system view o f performance . The question comes down to whether systems normally leave a slot blank out of knowledge or whethe r they do so out of a lack of knowledge . Highly immature systems tend either to overgenerate to an extreme, leavin g few blanks, or to undergenerate to an extreme, leaving many blanks . The latter type of immature system is more common and may benefit unfairly from a metric that considers a noncommittal response to be a correct response, especially if there are relatively many blanks in the key templates .","If, for example, noncommittals were considered correct responses and included in the denominator of the error per response fill measure, the rankings of all 17 MUC-4 systems on TST3 (the name of one of the two test set s used in the evaluation) would change. The most radical changes would be for immature systems whose number of noncommittals greatly outweighs all other categories of response . Since there are a lot of immature systems evaluate d for MUC-5 (as there were for MUC-4) and since the average number of fills in the answer-key templates for MUC- 5 is only about half of what it was for MUC-4, the distortions of the results for MUC-5 have the potential to be eve n greater than they were for MUC-4 . However, the potential effect on the MUC-5 evaluation is damped somewhat b y the fact that the MUC-5 template consists of objects that are aligned separately ; response objects that contain an insufficient amount of slot-fillers to warrant an alignment with a key object are not scored against a key object at th e slot level . Nonetheless, we believe that omitting noncommittals from the metrics provides a better basis fo r comparison across the full range of MUC-5 (and MUC-4) systems and provides a more accurate assessment of the - state of the art . 7 6 Decides Relevant Relevant I s Correc t a","Irrelevant I s Correc t b a+ b Decides Irrelevant c d c+ d a+c b+d a+b+c+d = n POS ACT COR PAR INC ICR IPA S p"]},{"title":"u MIS NO N Recall","paragraphs":["= a/(a+c) \\t Undergeneration = c/(a+c ) Precision = a/(a+b) \\t Overgeneration = b/(a+b)","Tex t Filtering a+c a+b \\t a c db Table 6 : Text Filtering."]},{"title":"CHANGES TO THE METRICS FROM PREVIOUS EVALUATION S","paragraphs":["The changes to the evaluation metrics are expected to enable three different types of evaluation \"users \" (NLP researchers, program managers, and potential customers) to assess and compare system performance in a meaningful way. It is also hoped that the changes will correct deficiencies in the evaluation that may unwittingl y encourage conservative development strategies on the part of the researchers and that may also limit the evaluation' s meaningfulness to other evaluation users.","Although the terms recall and precision were borrowed from IR, the metrics themselves represent a significant departure from the contingency table model, which underlies the IR version of the metrics . The task o f extraction is a complex one that includes elements of information detection and classification, plus open-ende d generation of strings and object pointers . The focus on recall and precision as primary metrics for the last few year s has had some advantages, among them the following : • they bring out the fundamental tension between spurious and missing data ; • they require that evaluation users view system performance along more than one dimension ;","• they present a positive view of system performance, which may have helped to make the NL P researchers more comfortable with the idea of submitting their systems to evaluation .","However, recall and precision have the disadvantage of making a two-way distinction between error type s (spurious and missing) when in fact there are three types of error. The third kind of error is captured by the substitution metric ; it is accounted for by the categories of incorrect and ( .5 times) partial . Substitution errors arc taken into account in the recall-precision metrics to the extent that they contribute to the denominator of both recal l and precision ; however, this type of error is not isolated, and its inclusion in the denominator of recall and precisio n prevents those metrics from revealing to what extent a system's shortfalls are due to substitution rather than t o missing (in the case of recall) or spurious (in the case of precision) . 7 7","In a way, the recall-precision metrics view substitution as a blend of missing and spurious ; a system did no t simply produce the wrong fill, but rather produced a spurious fill on the one hand and missed a fill on the other hand . This is a reasonable model of system behavior in many cases, but not in others, especially when a response is scored partially correct . These deficiencies of the recall and precision metrics make the use of the error per response fil l reasonable, as long as it is accompanied by the secondary metrics of overgeneration (spurious), undergeneratio n (missing), and substitution (incorrect, including half of the partial) .","The F-measure, which was introduced for MUC-4 in response to needs of researchers and program managers for a ranking metric, has come to be used more generally than just for cross-system comparisons . B y becoming the one metric of focus, it has been competing with recall and precision for the role of primary metric , thereby weakening two of the major advantages that recall and precision originally had . Furthermore, now that performance of some systems is in or approaching the 50% range, recall and precision are at a disadvantage fo r motivating researchers to push performance of the top systems through the more difficult stages ahead because the y focus on the positive aspects of performance . These factors make the adoption of error per response fill as the primary metric a reasonable next step in determining the best way to measure performance .","The statistical significance results from MUC-5 give us feedback on how well the error metric and the F - measure distinguish systems . The results show that there are no differences between the rankings determined by erro r per response fi11 2 and the rankings determined by F-measure. The error per response fill distinguishes systems slightl y better ; four more system pairs were significantly different in their error per response fill than were significantl y different in their F-measure . The error per response fill also shows a tendency towards clustering systems in slightl y clearer groups than the F-measure for EJV due to its ability to distinguish systems slightly better .","The richness-normalized error represents another change from previous evaluations and was motivated b y the desire for a system-independent metric . The nature of this metric requires that spurious behavior be ignored . Th e search for such a metric led us to innovate one in which two values, a minimum and maximum, were calculated sinc e language understanding necessarily involves variability in interpretation .
