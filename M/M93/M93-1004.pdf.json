Interim evaluations were conducted in September, 1992, and February, 1993 ; th e final evaluation was conducted in July, 1993 . The final evaluation included not only the Tipster-supported information extraction contractors but thirteen other participants as well. This evaluation was the topic of th e Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5) in August, 1993 . With particular respect to the research an d development tasks of the Tipster contractors, the goal of these evaluations has been to assess success in terms of the development of systems to work in both English and Japanese (BBN, GE/CMU, and NMSUBrandeis) and/or in both the joint ventures and microelectronics domains (BBN, GE/CMU, NMSU/Brandeis, and UMass/Hughes) .","The methodology associated with these evaluations has been under development since 1987, when the serie s of Message Understanding Conferences began . The evaluations have pushed technology to handle the recurring language problems found in sizeable samples of naturally-occuring text. Designing the evaluations around an information extraction application of text processing technology has made it possible to discuss NLP technique s at a practical level and to gain insight into the capabilities of complex systems .","However, any such evaluation testbed application will undoubtedly differ in important respects from a reallife application. Thus, there is only an indirect connection between the evaluation results for a system and th e suitability of applying the system to performance of a task in an operational setting . A fairly large number of metrics have been defined that respond to the variety of subtasks inherent in information extraction and th e varying perspectives of evaluation consumers .","The evaluations measure coverage, accuracy, and classes of error on each language-domain pair , independently of all other language-domain pairs that the system may be tested on . With its dual language and domain requirements and challenging task definition, Tipster Phase 1 pushed especially hard on issues such as portability tools, language- and domain- independent architectures and algorithms, and system efficiency. These aspects of software were not directly evaluated, although information concerning some or all of them may be found in the papers prepared by the evaluation participants ."]},{"title":"THE EVALUATION PROCES S","paragraphs":["The Tipster contractors were allowed access to the training corpus (articles and hand-coded templates for a given language-domain pair) and associated materials (documentation, software resources, lexical resources) a s they were being prepared over the course of Phase 1 .

The evaluation software, corpora, documentation, and miscellaneous other resources were distributed primarily through electronic mail and electronic file transfer . Virtually every item was updated numerous times, and updates continued on some of them right up to the start of final testing . Personnel at the Consortium for Lexical Research (New Mexico State University) and the Institute for Defense Analyse s played critical roles in making these materials available for electronic transfer .","At the start of the test week for each evaluation, the participants were supplied electronically with encoded test sets of articles, which they were to decode only when they were ready to begin testing . Testing was conducted by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a strict test protocol . After their system s processed the texts and produced the extracted information in the expected template format, the participant s electronically transfered the templates to the Government for scoring .","Using the evaluation software prepared by SAIC, evaluators may score templates fully automatically (batc h mode) or partially interactively (interactive mode) . Since interactive scoring produces a slightly more accurat e performance evaluation, scoring for the formal evaluations is usually done in that way . Some of the same analysts who hand-coded the answer-key templates prepared written guidelines for conducting the interactiv e scoring and did the scoring . SAIC conducted statistical significance tests on the 24-monthIMUC-5 final tes t scores for the overall metrics of performance [3] .","Table 2 summarizes the Phase 1 evaluations in terms of the test sets, participating sites, and primary evaluation metrics . l Since the JV template was especially complex, JV testing was done in two ways for eac h evaluation : (1) the core portion of the template, including the identification of tie-ups, entities, and relationship s of entities within tie-ups, (2) the full template . The first microelectronics test was conducted at the 18-mont h point; up until a few weeks prior to that test, the Tipster contractors had had only a small portion of the EME an d JME corpora available to them .

The criteria are limited to those that can be measured without access to anything more than the template s that the systems generated.

In order to reveal information about th e circumstances affecting performance, the scoring software calculates scores at the following levels of granularity : for each slot in each template, for each object type in each template, and overall for each template ; for each slot i n the test set, for each object type in the test set, and overall for the test set.","Two sets of metrics were in force for MUC-5 [4] .

For the 12-month test, the evaluation software that had been used for MUC-4 was rewritten by SAIC to accomodate the object - oriented Tipster templates . Issues that were addressed in the interim between the 12-month and the 18-month tests include JV template formatting (especially in the Japanese template), performance metrics (probability o f false alarm as alternative to precision, system-independent version of recall), object alignment by the evaluation software8 (content-based as well as threshold-based alignment options, alignment optimization based on scor e rather than on number correct), and evaluation software support for human performance studies (scoring of one se t of hand-coded templates versus another) .","At the 18-month meeting, decisions were made regarding scoring for the 24-month/MUC-5 9 evaluation . The principal decision was to supplant recall and precision with a modified formulation of the error rate metri c that had been in experimental usage for the 18-month test . The revised metric was named error per response fill because it is system-dependent (i .e ., the denominator in the formula varies across systems according to th e number of spurious fills generated, and it also varies because the answer keys allow for a somewhat variabl e number of expected fills). Error per response fill became the primary measure of performance . However, a less system-dependent error rate metric was also implemented; this metric was termed the richness-normalized error. These changes to the metrics necessitated significant reprogramming of the evaluation software . In addition, the decision was made to convert portions of the JV template from objects to complex slots l0 , and this resulted in significant updates to the evaluation software, JV corpora, and JV documentation . Another decision resulting from this meeting was to ease the object alignment criteria, largely because of the difficulty of setting valid threshold values given the sparseness of the fills in many of the objects in the answer key .","The MUC-5 dry run was conducted after all these updates had been completed . Between the dry run and th e final test two months later, further updates were made to the evaluation software, including a revised way of scoring two-part (complex) slots in the JV template . The new method gives separate scores to each part of the two-part fill, rather than giving one score to the complex fill as a whole . Another update was the implementation of a limited two-pass object alignment strategy, which results in slightly improved object alignments becaus e more of the information on the interrelationships among entities is present when objects that reference the entitie s are aligned .","The intention had been to eliminate some evaluation criteria before the MUC-5 effort began in earnest i n March, 1993 ; however, some of the decisions made at the 18-month meeting were tentative and, in the end, fe w simplifications were made at that time. The net result was that the number of performance measures has increase d since MUC-4, and it is clear that there is still no clear answer as to the single most appropriate criterion to appl y to assessing performance on an information extraction task . The good news is that the error per response fill an d $Object alignment as implemented for MUC-5 is discussed in the next section . 9 Since the MUC-5 evaluation was the 24-month evaluation for the Tipster contractors, the evaluation will hereafter b e referred to simply as the MUC-5 evaluation . °This conversion affected three parts of the JV template: ownership percent, product/service, and activit y site . After the conversion, each of these was represented in the template as a two-part slot rather than as an object with two slots . 30 the F-measure provide consistent views of the relative performance of systems, and therefore technolog y consumers may choose to use whichever set of metrics they feel is most appropriate for their purposes. All thi s experimentation resulted in other useful information as well about system-independent metrics, object alignmen t approaches, and template design, among other things ."]},{"title":"Alignment and Scorin g System-generated","paragraphs":["(response) templates must be aligned with the answer-key (key) templates for scoring . Alignment takes place at all levels where there exist more than one response instance of a given kind and/or mor e than one key instance. These levels include the template level, the object level, and the slot-fill level . In each case, the intent is to find the alignment that will provide the best content match between the key and th e response . At the object level, there is also the intent to determine whether a response object should be rejected fo r alignment purposes for failing to show any substantial degree of match with a key object .","Alignment at the template level is trivial ; it is done on the basis of matching the <template> doc n r fills in the key and response. At the slot-fill level, when there are more than one key and/or response slot-fill fo r a given instance of a slot type, alignment is done on the basis of the degree of match between key and respons e fills . Slot-fill alignments that the alignment program can only guess at may be revised interactively during th e scoring stage .","Alignment at the object level is the most complicated and controversial aspect of alignment . It takes plac e prior to scoring, and it is normally done fully automatically because to do it interactively would be so time - consuming as to be virtually impossible . The criteria for establishing whether an object ought to be allowed t o align at all are defined in a file external to the alignment process . The criteria are defined to apply across al l instances of a given object type . However, it is difficult to specify the criteria in this manner since man y instances in the keys contain little fill on which to base a comparison .","Various object alignment schemes and minimal alignment criteria (also called the minimal mapping requirements) have been tried ; for MUC-5, an alignment scheme called threshold-based was used, and th e alignment criteria were loose . As used for MUC-5, this scheme allows nearly any matching fill in a given objec t type to enable an object alignment. The only exception concerns certain slots for which an overwhelming defaul t fill exists, e.g ., <entity>type . Such slots are ignored in the alignment process .","If there is no content match at all between a response object and a key object or if the only match is on a slot that is excluded from the threshold-based alignment criteria, the response object is marked as spurious . In such cases, the object's alignment status is termed connected, meaning that the object did not align but there existed a key object to which it could have mapped had it met the minimal alignment criteria. As a connected object under the official All-Objects scoring method (see [41 and preface to score-report appendix), response fill s with no corresponding key fill are scored as spurious and those with a corresponding key fill (whether the fill s themselves are a correct match or not) are scored as incorrect.","For a given object type in a template, there may be more than one possible alignment of object instance s that meet the alignment criteria . Such objects are aligned on the basis of the degree of slot-fill match, as coarsely determined by the alignment program. The program determines an approximate error per response fill score , which will be overridden during the actual scoring process following alignment .","The alignment of objects in one pass results in suboptimal mappings of some object types, especiall y <entity> in the JV template, because advantage cannot be taken of useful information about the dependenc y between <entity> (or <person>) and <entity-relationship> . The solution implemented for MUC-5 wa s to align objects in two passes, with a few of the object types handled in both passes . However, despite th e theoretical advantages of two-pass alignment, it is believed that the adopted solution results in only slightl y improved object mappings over what can be done in a single pass . Two-pass alignment is only a partial solutio n to the problem, but the problem itself appears to be relatively minor . 31"]},{"title":"MEASURING TASK DIFFICULT Y","paragraphs":["With each new MUC, the evaluators have challenged technology to deal with a broader variety of texts an d to do more with them. One of the ways in which MUC-5 distinguishes itself from previous evaluations is in th e increased task realism, which manifests itself in a greater variety of data extraction requirements, in th e requirement for translation of extracted information into entries from standard reference sources (unabridge d gazetteers, the Standard Industrial Code manual, etc .), and in a richer template structure . However, the mos t distinctive feature of Tipster Phase 1 for extraction is the requirement to handle more than one language and mor e than one domain . This requirement generated a strong push in the direction of language- and domain - independence, while the task realism generated a strong push for maximizing task coverage with minimum tim e and effort.","Major changes have been made to the evaluation design over the years, which complicates the issue o f progress assessment. Not only have the metrics and scoring and alignment algorithms evolved and been replaced , but new extraction tasks have been defined [10] . The first two tasks were in the naval tactical domain, the nex t two were in the terrorist domain, and the Tipster/MUC-5 evaluation was conducted in the joint ventures and microelectronics domains. One could conceive of trying to compare the difficulty of these tasks in terms o f human performance ; however, at this point there exists reasonably sound performance data only for MUC-5 [11 , 12] . One could also imagine trying to measure relative difficulty in some atheoretic or polytheoretic way i n terms of the number of semantic patterns, inference rules, etc ., required to carry out the task, but that idea is not a practical one .","In a preliminary attempt to compare the difficulty of different extraction tasks, quantitative criteria wer e developed in support of MUC-3 that enable comparison in terms of superficial features of the texts, templat e definition, and template fill rules [5] . Comparison of the complexity of the terrorist task with the naval task i n light of these criteria shows at least an order-of-magnitude increase for several of the criteria . Once allowances are made for changes to the scoring methods and the earlier evaluation results are recomputed, it is clear for the result s of the top systems in each evaluation that MUC-3 system performance represents significant progress fo r extraction systems as a group over the previous evaluation . \\tDIMENSION Text corpus complexit y Text corpus dimension s Template fill characteristic s Nature of task"]},{"title":"\\t","paragraphs":["FACTO R -l x -3 x -1-2 x -2 x Table 3.

Some of the assumptions inherent in this approach t o assessing relative difficulty are that longer sentences will be processed less accurately than shorter ones, tha t relevant texts with a greater amount of relevant information present more opportunities for error, that a greate r variety of extraction requirements makes a task harder, and that extraction is harder when it goes beyon d categorization of information into a set fill .","The EJV task is harder by a factor of two on criteria such as the following : • vocabulary size; • average number of sentences per text; • number of slots in the template ; • one of the types of slot (numeric/complex slots) .","Among the ways in which EJV is easier than the terrorism task are the following : • sentences in the EJV corpus are shorter on average (18 words versus 27 words) ; • there are so few nonrelevant EJV texts that relevance filtering plays a negligible role (—10% nonrelevan t versus -50% nonrelevant) ; • there is a sparser amount of information in the EJV templates (—1 filler per slot versus -1 .5 per slot) .","The greatest difference between the EJV and terrorism tasks concerns the text corpus dimensions. Thi s dimension, which treats the volume of text as a measure of difficulty, could be viewed as less of an issue no w than it was for MUC-3 . In fact, with the increasing popularity of statistical techniques, large amounts of training data are sometimes required . Nonetheless, the challenge of making effective use of text increases with th e quantity of text, since a large amount of text implies a broad domain, and most kinds of domain knowledg e cannot currently be captured using automated training methods . 11 One other statistic that was used in comparing the naval and terrorism tasks, the number of template types, was not used in this comparison because the statistic is not pertinent to the way the Tipster templates are designed . 12In the MUC-4 template, there were no objects, but there were groupings of slots into those that contained data on the perpetrator of the terrorist act, the physical target of the terrorist act, the human target of the terrorist act, and on th e terrorist act itself. These four slot groupings were referred to as pseudo-objects. 13Two other statistics that could be used if two object-oriented tasks were being compared--average number of object s per template and average number of slots per object--were not used in this comparison because there were no forma l object types in the terrorist template. 33","The percent nonrelevant texts criterion, which figures in two of the dimensions, is based on the view tha t the more a system's performance would suffer as a consequence of ignoring the text filtering (document detection ) subtask, the harder the task . The percentage of nonrelevant texts in EJV is so low (approximately 5% in th e training corpus and 10% in the MUC-5 test sets) that a system can almost ignore the text filtering subtas k without suffering a serious degradation in performance; the system can be optimized in favor of generating tie-ups even when it is not sure there is sufficient information in the text . This is not true of the terrorism task, where the percentage of nonrelevant and relevant texts is about equal . In conclusion, either a task such as EJV that places extremely little emphasis on text filtering or a task that places extremely high emphasis on text filtering i s considered to be less difficult than one such as the terrorism task, which places significant emphasis both on tex t filtering and information extraction .","Within the context of the extraction subtask independent of the text filtering subtask, the more information there is to be extracted, the more difficult the task is judged to be . This is because richer texts present more opportunities to miss information and to confuse information about one reportable item with another .","The most difficult comparison to make concerns the template fill characteristics, because of the switch to the object-oriented template . Furthermore, the overall difficulty of slot fill criterion is itself composed of severa l features . It is based on the number and distribution of the various types of slots : set-fill slots with no more than twelve possible fills, set-fill slots with more than twelve possible fills (for MUC-5, these were slots tha t referenced the gazetteer), numeric/complex slots (which includes some normalized fills and, in the case of MUC-5 , some two-part fills), string-fill slots (and normalized strings such as corporation names), and pointer-fill slots (i n the case of MUC-4, these are slots that require cross-references) . The more open-ended the extraction task, th e harder it is judged to be . The EJV task is judged to be harder with regard to the numeric/complex slots in particular.","In summary, the generalization may be that the EJV task is harder than the terrorism task in terms of th e template (number and nature of slots), the sheer volume of text (vocabulary size), and the discourse demand s (number of sentences per text), but a little easier in terms of the shorter sentence length, lesser proportion of relevant information in relevant texts (number of fills per slot), and very small proportion of nonrelevant texts ."]},{"title":"OVERALL RESULTS","paragraphs":["The discussion of the MUC-5 evaluation results will be presented from various perspectives, using th e metrics that are most appropriate in each case .

To that end, only the top-scoring systems are included in th e comparison, namely those that were in one of the top two ranks statistically according to the F-measure . 1 4","There were four systems in the top two ranks for MUC-4 (TST3 and TST4 test sets) [2] and three in the to p two ranks for MUC-5 (EJV test set) [3] .

If the one non-Tipster EJV system (SRI) is excluded from th e EJV MUC-5 average, the average rises to 49 .35 .","The greater level of difficulty of the MUC-5 EJV task and the fact that the F-measure scores are close t o being as high as the MUC-4 F-measure scores indicate that performance of top MUC-5 EJV systems is at leas t comparable to performance of top MUC-4 systems .

Two systems achieved an F-measure score on the JJV core-template test in the 70-8 0 range -- 73 .54 (corresponding to error per response fill of 39) for the GE/CMU Shogun system and 77 .94 (error per response fill of 34) for the GE/CMU optional test run with the TEXTRACT system . Top performance on the EJV core-template test was about 20 points worse . The relatively high performance on the JJV core-templat e task may be indicative not only of the relative simplicity of the core-template task compared to the full-templat e task but also to the relative simplicity of the JJV texts compared to the EJV texts .

In terms of performance shortfall, the machines fell 19-38 points of human performance on the recal l measure and 18-31 points short of human performance on the precision measure .","Increasing system recall and precision by another 20 points or so may not seem to be a difficult task -- afte r all, since systems managed to obtain an F-measure score in the 70s on the JJV core-template test, why not als o on the EME task? But it may not be easy to increase both recall and precision by that amount simultaneously on a relatively difficult task such as EME, since the metrics are in tension with each other . The harder a system tries to extract all the expected information (i.e ., the more aggressively configured it is), the more likely it is to extrac t erroneous information . The tension is reduced if the texts are easier to interpret, as the JJV texts apparently are (see section below on handling two languages) and if the task is simpler, as the JJV core-template tas k undoubtedly is in comparison to the EME (full-template) task.","The overall recall and precision scores hide the fact that there were not only slots on which human performance was relatively strong but also slots on which human performance was relatively weak . A stud y reported in [11] measured the degree of difference between human and machine performance for frequently-fille d slots in a portion of the EME test set . The author's general conclusion was that machines did comparatively wel l on slots that may lend themselves to keyword analysis and that are to be filled with a set-fill category from a relatively long list; examples include the <layering> type and film slots.","Speed . Another respect in which systems showed an advantage over humans is in terms of speed . O n average, the time required for a human to fill a template (using software tools tailored for the Tipster tasks) wa s between 15 minutes (for an EME template) to over 60 minutes (for a JJV template) . In contrast, timin g information collected for the BBN PLUM system, the GE/CMU Shogun system, and the NMSU/Brandeis Didero t 35 system shows that the average time required to process an article in the EME test set was between 75 .0 seconds (Shogun on a Sparc 10 with 64 mb RAM) and 211 .2 seconds (Diderot, which was not optimized for speed i n English, on a Sparc2 with 32 mb RAM) and that the average time required to process an article in the JJV test se t was between 39 .0 seconds (Diderot on a Sparc2 with 2.32 mb RAM) and 140 .8 seconds (PLUM on a Sparc 1 0 with 128 mb RAM) ."]},{"title":"Predominant Classes of Error","paragraphs":["The most frequent type of error committed by nearly all of the MUC-5 systems was to miss pertinen t information .

The effect of undergeneration in relation to the overgeneration and substitution metrics as well as to the error pe r response fill metric can be seen in figures 1 and 2, which graph the results of all MUC-5 systems for the EM E and JME tests . From these graphs it is clear that undergeneration (UND) generally correlates with the overall metric of error per response fill (ERR), overgeneration (OVG) does not correlate with it, and substitution (SUB) correlates with it only to a limited extent .

Examination of the template-fill specifications sheds light on these data . Some slots and objects in the JV and ME templates have essentially fixed number, requiring one fill or allowing zero or one fill ; others have a highly variable number, some requiring one or more fills and some allowing zero or more fills . Thus, for the slots having a highly variable number of fills, there is no absolute bound on the number of fills a syste m could potentially spuriously generate . This means that overgeneration on those slots could be quite high . Substitution errors, on the other hand, are accrued only when there exists a pairing between a fill in the key and a fill in the response, and the response is judged to be incorrect . Thus, the substitution score has as its uppe r bound the number of fills in the key .","If the extraction of relatively little target information is indicative of poor overall performance, how and t o what extent does the extraction of relatively much information -- good or bad -- correlate with overal l performance? Are the aggressive systems just wildly guessing, or is their aggressiveness paying off form them on the overall metric? The data show that there is a correlation between generating lots of data and obtaining a relatively good (i .e ., low) error per response fill score. This can be seen by computing the number of right and wrong fills generated by a system (this number is called the actual (ACT)) as a percentage of the total number o f fills expected (termed the possible (POS)) and comparing that percentage with the overall error per response fil l score .","In figure 3, the EME results are sorted by increasing error per response fill on the vertical axis .

Since the MUC evaluations are designed to challenge research technology as well as to show a practical use of technology , it would probably be unreasonable to expect that any information extraction system participating in a MU C evaluation would perform at a level close to humans, and it is unlikely that any of the MUC-5 participants ha d comparability with humans as their primary development goal. Nonetheless, there may be evaluation data to help support speculation about how likely it would be that these systems could be developed to make up the shortfall .","Figure 1 shows that all EME systems other than GE/CMU incurred more errors as a result of missin g information than as a result of committing other types of error, and figure 3 shows that generating more data was generally beneficial in terms of improving overall performance . The fact that the BBN and UManitoba systems ' overall performance is very close to GE/CMU ' s -- in fact, the differences among the three are statisticall y insignificant [3] -- provides evidence that relatively good performance does not necessarily come at the expense o f high overgeneration 1S and therefore that greater task coverage could make up for some of the shortfall fro m human performance . Further evidence of the room left for improvement of most, if not all, MUC-5 systems i s found in the fact that there are slots which systems never filled in during the final test. 16 Even in the case of Tipster systems, these unattempted slots can account for a sizeable proportion of the total number of misse d pieces of information . 1 7"]},{"title":"Measuring the Performance of Systems at Different Levels of Maturit y Scoring of unfilled","paragraphs":["slots .

The question comes down t o whether systems normally leave a slot unfilled out of knowledge or whether they do so out of a lack o f knowledge. Highly immature systems tend either to overgenerate to an extreme, leaving few slots unfilled, or to undergenerate to an extreme, leaving many slots unfilled. The latter type of immature system was very common at the MUC-5 evaluation and could have benefited unfairly from a metric that considers a noncommittal fill to b e a correct fill, especially since there are many unfilled slots in the key templates .","The effect of scoring noncommittal fills as correct fills is to give an inflated estimate of performance, at least for the systems that undergenerate to a relatively large extent. It also has the potential effect of giving a distorted cross-system view, since very immature systems could end up being ranked higher than is intuitivel y sensible . 1 8","The latter effect was not evident, however, for MUC-5, despite the relatively large number of unfilled slots in the answer keys (EJV compared to MUC-4) . Apparently, the potential effect on the MUC-5 evaluation wa s eliminated through the object structure . Since the MUC-5 templates consist of objects that are aligned separately, the scoring impact of producing an object that fails to meet the minimal alignment criteria is limited to just tha t one object. Such an object, which contains an insufficient amount of correct fill to warrant alignment, is no t given credit for any \"correct\" fills . 19 Thus, even though the object alignment criteria were loose for MUC-5 , there were still objects that failed to align, and systems got no credit for any correct information that they may have contained.","For MUC-4, on the other hand, there was no object alignment, only template alignment, and the templat e alignment criteria were fairly strict. Thus, although no credit would be gained for correct fills in an unaligne d template, the amount of credit that would be obtained for noncommittal fills in an aligned template would be fairly high on average, since the MUC-4 template is a larger structure than any of the objects in the MUC- 5 template .","eeN","OERNU","NMSWBR","UMASSMU","BSN","GEO","OE","J(OPn warren Figure 4.

The lower scores on joint-venture and entity2 are therefore attributed in part to the relative difficulty of identifying specific roles of entities .","The restricted use of the joint-venture and entity2 slots is reflected in the template definition: joint - venture and entity2 are constrained to contain either zero or one filler while the entity and entityl slot s must contain at least one filler and may contain two or more . The system must decide not only what to fill th e joint-venture and entity2 slots with but also whether to fill them at all . Thus, the system is likely to fil l them only if it has found clear evidence in order to avoid generating spurious data, and this can result in th e opposing type of performance problem, namely missing relevant information .","Apart from the joint-venture and entity2 slots, the only core slots that appear to have suffered relativel y poor performance for all four systems compared to other core slots are the <entity> location and <entity>nationality slots, two of the three geographic place-name slots in the template . Although th e systems scored better on these two place-name slots than on the non-core one, <facility>location, the fact that all systems appeared to have relative difficulty with those two core slots is notable, as it may reflect a practical difficulty of selecting the correct entry for an ambiguous place name from the large English gazetteer a s 4 2 well as the linguistic difficulty of determining whether a mention of a place in association with an entity reflect s the entity's location or its nationality.","However, there is a problem with attributing relatively low performance of the four core slots unde r discussion solely to the difficulty of determining the correct role of an entity or of a geographic place-name . The problem is that the lower performance may also be partially explained by the fact that those slots are les s frequently filled than any of the other core slots in the full-template test . 25 All other core slots account for a t least 3% each of the fills in the full-template test, with six core slots in the 3-4% range and five slots in the 5 - 10% range . Thus, even among the core slots, it can be expected that development efforts were not focused equall y on all slots and that lower performance on some core slots may be a consequence not only of their relativ e difficulty but also of their lesser impact on the total evaluation."]},{"title":"SUMMAR Y The evaluations conducted during Phase 1 of the Tipster extraction program have measured the completeness and accuracy of systems and have used an examination of the role of missing, spurious and otherwise erroneou s output as a means of diagnosing the state of the art.

The scope of the evaluations was broad enough to cause mos t MUC-5 sites to skip parts of the extraction task, especially types of information that appear relatively rarely i n the corpus. Since no type of information is weighted in the scoring more heavily than any other, the biases tha t exist in the evaluation reflect the distribution of relevant information in the text corpus and result in a natura l emphasis on handling the most frequently-occurring slot-filling tasks . These tasks turn out to be the ones that are less idiosyncratic and therefore more important to the development of generally useful technology. 25 However, these four core slots are more frequently filled than many of the non-core slots . Of the 30 non-core slots, 24 account for less than 3% each of the total fills (13 account for less than 1% each, and 11 account for 1-2% each) ; only six of the non-core slots account for a sizeable proportion of the total fills (four account for 3-4% each, and only tw o account for 5-10% each). 43","Examination of the slot-level results in the appendix to this volume shows which systems are filling whic h slots and how aggressively they are generating fills . For those slots where a system is generating a substantial number of fills, analysis at the level of the individual templates and corresponding texts would provide insight into the particular circumstances under which the system extracted correct or incorrect information . In other words, the quantitative performance measures may yield information on aspects of performance that deserve furthe r analysis, but a deeper investigation needs to include examination of the actual fills and the actual texts . The discussion in this paper of slot-level performance on the JV core-template task does not go as far as that ; the discussion is based only on frequency of slot fill and on the slot definitions . Some of the deeper analysis can be carried out only by the authors of the systems . Such an analysis would relate the circumstances under which correct or incorrect system behavior was seen with the strengths and weaknessses of particular algorithms an d modules of the system."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S","paragraphs":["The author would like to acknowledge the extensive support throughout Tipster Phase 1 from Nanc y Chinchor and Gary Dungca at SAIC .
