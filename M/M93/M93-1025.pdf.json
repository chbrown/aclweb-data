The main goal of the SNAP project is to build a massivel y parallel computer capable of fast and accurate natural language processing [5] . Throughout the project, a parallel computer was built in the Parallel Knowledge Processing Laboratory at USC, and various softwar e was developed to operate the machine [3] . The approach in designing SNAP was to find a knowledge repre - sentation and a reasoning paradigm useful for natural language processing which exhibits massive parallelism . We have selected marker-passing on semantic networks as a way to represent and process linguistic knowledge .","The work for MUC-5 started at the end of January 1993 . Prior to this we had implemented on SNA P a memory-based parsing system which was also used for MUC-4 . Since the domain has been changed fro m MUC-4, we improved the dictionary with semantic tags necessary for EJV domain, developed a new templat e generation module, and constructed a new knowledge base including concept hierarchy and concept sequenc e patterns for parsing . Our group consisting of one faculty and five graduate students spent approximately 6 months to engineer a large system . Approach","The underlying ideas of the SNAP natural language processing system are : (1) memory based parsing , and (2) marker-passing on semantic networks [5] . In SNAP, parsing becomes a guided search over the knowl - edge base which stores linguistic information . Input words activate and predict concepts in the knowledg e base . While the semantic network represents the static part of the knowledge base, marker passing is th e mechanism which changes the state of the knowledge base with each new word . Based on the MUC-4 expe - rience, we emphasized efficiency and practicality in developing the system for MUC-5 . Full analysis of inpu t texts is avoided . The system picks up only necessary and relevant information from input texts . The knowledge base of domain specific phrasal patterns for TIE-UP relationship has been constructed automaticall y by using a lexical acquisition system called PALKA, and couple of back-up routes have been established to extract partial information when parsing fails . SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE","The SNAP system architecture is shown in Figure 1 . It consists of a preprocessor, phrasal parser , memory-based parser, knowledge base, and template generator . The preprocessor provides lexical look-u p and semantic tagging . The phrasal parser performs grouping of words, and the memory-based parser gener - ates semantic meaning representation by using stored patterns in the knowledge base . The knowledge base consists of a domain concept hierarchy including location hierarchy, a set of phrasal patterns for TIE-UP, an d semantically relaxed versions of some phrasal patterns . The phrasal patterns are automatically extracte d 305 template \\t Database generator \\t templates concept \\t phrasal hierare-hy \\t","pattern s \\tA\\t\\t; ---------------------------------------------- - Figure 1 : The SNAP information extraction system . from training texts by the PALKA lexical acquisition system . The template generator has a set of rules to fil l slots from the phrasal parser results and the memory-based parser results . To detect a TIE-UP relationship , the template generator first checks the memory-based parser output for the regular patterns . If there is no memory-based parser output, it tries to apply rules to the phrasal parser output, and if no rules ar e applicable, it checks the memory-based parser output for the relaxed patterns . Figure 2 shows the flow of control including the back-up routes . PREPROCESSOR Description of Operatio n","Our preprocessor is not significantly different from the \"generic preprocessor\" . It locates sentence boundaries and inserts sentence boundary markers for the phrasal parser . In addition, sentences are joined togethe r on one line so that pattern matching can take place for concatenating noun phrases together . Certain noun phrases are grouped together to reduce work load on the phrasal parser . These noun phrases come from 4 different sources : our permuted list of company names, locations from the gazeteer, a list of special word s related to facilities, titles, and positions, specifically chosen for filling template slots and/or recognizing th e possibility of filling slots, and noun phrases from WordNet . (Company names are a special case that will b e discussed below . )","As in our system for MUC-4 last year, our preprocessor continues to group semi-auxiliary verbs lik e USED_TO and prepositional phrases like SUCH_AS and AS_TO together . Contractions such as CAN 'T an d DON 'T are expanded into CAN NOT and DO NOT . Numbers in the text are normalized by removing comma s and/or dollar signs . Abbreviations immediately following numbers without intervening spaces are separate d from the number, and expanded ; for example 2 .3BN is converted into 2 .3 BILLION . Three such abbreviations following numbers deserve a small note . When s follows a number, it is always a plural, as in 1980s or IBM MODEL 55s ; this s is just removed as no important information required in our system is lost . Th e abbreviation m is ambiguous, and could mean either million or meters ; because it almost always means million in this domain, it is always changed to million . Finally, the obvious abbreviation 4wD is converted t o FOUR WHEEL DRIVE . Punctuation markers are separated from the words they are adjacent to, and then each word is looked up in our dictionary . For each word, every possible part of speech is passed on to the phrasa l parser segment of our system . In the dictionary look-up function, numbers are a special case . In order that numbers which are not spelled out do not have to be added to the dictionary, the dictionary look-up progra m tests words to find out if they are cardinal, ordinal, or real numbers, and then reports their part of speec h as such . No spelling correction is done in the preprocessor ; misspelled words are reported as unknown to th e phrasal parser, and they will usually be interpreted as a corporation name if some other word in the nou n","•\\t' SUN Host","\\t","SNAP Controller and Array","It —text preprocessor phrasal","parser","memory-based parser (rules) ,","lexical knowledge base","Training","texts acquisition","syste m --------------- - 306 Input testa","+","Dictionary look-up and semantic tagg ing","t","Segmentize the input into groups Semantic interpretatio n by using phrasal patterns Apply rules to the phr parser output Semantic interpretation by using relaxed patterns","Generate templates for TIE-UP and ENTITY","i Generate templates for other objects i \\t No output Output templates Figure 2 : The flow of control in SNAP system . phrase such as CORP . suggests this, or a human name otherwise . Morphological processing is performed , but not at run time ; a set of programs is applied to the input files used in construction of the dictionary t o generate all possible inflected forms of words .","As mentioned above, corporation names are recognized and grouped together in the preprocessor . I n order to match as many company names as possible, a program was written to generate permutations o f the company names in our list of such names . Abbreviations such as INC . are permuted into both INC and INCORPORATED, and abbreviations such as \"S .A .\" are permuted into their various forms such as \"S .A \" and \"S . A .\" . This increases the size of our list of corporations several-fold . In addition, each of these abbreviations is added to our preprocessor dictionary, and tagged as a corporation name in case only th e abbreviation is recognized in some input text .","In addition to the part of speech, root form, and other related information such as tense or number which was in our preprocessor dictionary for passing along to the phrasal parser, many of the words i n our preprocessor dictionary were tagged according to the requirements of our rule-based inferencing an d template filling module . These tags included MUC5-COMPANY, approximately 12 different types of facilities (MUC5-FACILITY1 for broadcasting stations and studios, MUC5-FACILITY2 for plants, mills , and development facilities, etc .), ten or so different position tags (MUC5-POSITION1 for CEO, chief executive officer, etc ., MUC5-POSITION2 for chairman, chairmen, chairman of the board, etc .), and several different human name and title tags (MUC5-NAME-TITLE for Mr ., Mrs ., etc ., MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-FAMILY, MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-GIVEN, MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-MALE, and MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-FEMALE) . These tags alerted later processing states that the words so tagged might be importan t for template filling . Tags were not the only method used for this . The knowledge-base that we built from WordNet, for example, provided a very easy way to recognize words that were part of a date, or words whic h indicated time . We also built a knowledge-base of location names and possible types (cities, countries, etc .) , 307 from the available gazeteer file, and included the tag MUC5-LOCATION on all words in our preprocesso r dictionary which might have been location names in the text . For several pronouns and prepositions such as I and TO, which are also city names in Indonesia, our phrasal parser always ignored this tag . Even thoug h the gazeteer was very large, there are place names missing such as KAOHSIUNG in the walk-through message .","This year, WordNet was used to substantially increase the size of our dictionary . However, through an unfortunate oversight, the morphological programs were not run on the verbs from WordNet in order to generate all of their inflected forms . This caused the word ENTRUSTING to be missing from our dictionary , and not recognized, when it should have been there. Even with WordNet, though, our dictionary doesn' t contain all inflected forms of all words . WordNet contains the noun CAPITAL, but not the verb form CAPI-TALIZE, and so none of the inflected forms of that particular verb were included in our dictionary, and w e failed to recognize that CAPITALIZED was either a past tense or past participle verb form . Since our syste m doesn't do any morphological processing at run time, this is an area where significant improvement could b e made with relatively little effort ; if unknown words were run through a process that guessed at their par t of speech with decent accuracy, then our phrasal parser would do a better job of segmenting each sentence into its constituent phrases . This would have made a difference this year, as there were several times wher e a verb was unknown, treated incorrectly as a noun by our phrasal parser, and lumped into a noun phrase a s part of a corporation name .

The parsing is performed within the knowledge base by propagating markers through the network . The knowledge base contains a concept hierarchy, basic concept sequences, and domain specific patterns fo r TIE-UPs . Concept Hierarchy and Basic Concept Sequence s","Several different sources were used in constructing the knowledge-base used in memory based parsin g for this year ' s system . WordNet was used in the construction of the noun-based ontologically structure d knowledge-base, and also in the construction of the verb-based basic concept sequence knowledge-base . The ontological and taxonomical classifications built into WordNet are carried over into our knowledge-base . The English gazeteer was used in building the location knowledge-base . As in WordNet, the inherent structur e built into the gazeteer is carried over into the location knowledge-base .","In all of these knowledge-bases, a word may have several different semantic meanings . Our system provided for the representation of these various different meanings, but not the resolution of the semantic lexical ambiguity yet . In the future, new knowledge in the form of appropriate links between the noun-based ontologically structured knowledge-base and the verb-based concept sequence knowledge-base, and semanti c priming links between appropriate semantic meaning nodes, will aid in the automatic semantical lexical am - biguity resolution of some of the nouns and verbs . This will occur during parsing, with no extra effort neede d by the parser ; the knowledge built into the knowledge-bases will guide the markers during marker passing t o select the appropriate senses of some ambiguous words . For those words which cannot be disambiguated i n this fashion, common-sense and pragmatic inferencing rules can be applied after parsing . Location names , too, can be semantically ambiguous . An extra algorithm of marker passing along a limited number and type of links in the location knowledge-base will be added to the system in the future in order to resolve the ambiguities in location names . 309 Text corm - TIE-UP : [ (ENTITYI : COMPANY) form (joint-venture) with (ENTITY2: COMPANY) ] Figure 3 : The FP-structure representation","In each knowledge-base, a common structure emerges . Nodes are basically of two types . Some node s represent the actual word itself, while other nodes represent a possible meaning of a single word or multiple words . Using the terminology of WordNet, we call these \"meaning\" nodes \"synset nodes\", and we cal l the nodes representing the words themselves \"word nodes\" . Except in the case of antonyms, the semanti c relationships such as hypernomy, hyponomy, meronomy and holonymy exist as pointers between the synse t nodes, because they are relationships between the meanings, and not between the words themselves . For antonyms, however, the antonym relationship exists between individual words and not the meanings of thos e words . In the future, the hypernym links will be used like ISA links in propagating markers upwards fro m the nouns, through the restrictions which shall be added to the knowledge-base for semantic ambiguity resolution, to the verb-based concept sequences . Likewise, the meronym and holonym links can be used bot h for semantic priming, and also for \"understanding\" sentences where meronymic or holonymic metaphor i s used . Domain Specific Patterns for TIE-UP s","The most important task for the Joint Venture domain is to detect a TIE-UP relationship between several ENTITIES . Since the TIE-UP relationship is represented by using various kinds of expressions, a large amount of rules are necessary to detect the TIE-UPs, after the syntactic and semantic processing . Fo r example, a TIE-UP relationship between company A and company B can be expressed by using the ver b set, form, or establish as \"A set up joint venture with B\", or using the verb agree or sign as \"A agree wit h B to start joint venture\" . A verb-oriented semantic representation is not sufficient ; one more step is neede d to generate the final representation .","This year, we developed a domain specific semantic pattern representation for efficient information extraction . A pattern is represented as a pair of a meaning frame defining the necessary information to b e extracted, and a phrasal pattern describing the surface syntactic ordering . This representation is called an FP-structure . The FP-structures are used by the parser to detect TIE-UP relationships by pattern matching . Figure 3 shows an example of the FP-structure for TIE-UP relationship . The frame has slots o f ENTITYO (joint venture company), ENTITY1 and ENTITY2, and each slot has semantic constraint MUC5 - COMPANY . In the text representation of the FP-structure, the elements with parenthesis are concepts, an d other elements are all lexical elements . When the parser performs pattern matching, all the lexical entries , that are mapped under a concept specified in the FP-structure, are matched to their corresponding element . By using the FP-structure, the direct mapping from a surface phrase pattern of input sentence to the targe t representation of a TIE-UP relation between companies is possible .","Currently, more than 300 patterns for the TIE-UP relationship have been automatically generated b y using our lexical acquisition system, and those patterns were successfully used by parser to detect TIE-UPs . The lexical acquisition system, and the performance improvement according to the FP-structures, are presented in the later sections .

Figure 5-(a) shows the basic marker-passing steps used to match an input sentence with relevant concep t sequences . Prediction-markers (P markers) are used to predict some concept sequence elements as potential hypotheses of the input phrase . Activation-markers (A markers) are used to propagate activations fro m the input phrase to the corresponding concept sequence elements . As shown in Figure 5-(b), among th e P-marked concept sequence elements, those which receive A markers are accepted as valid hypotheses . After a P-marked concept sequence element is accepted, the P marker is passed to the next concept sequenc e element and waiting to be activated by the next input phrase . When all concept sequence elements of a concept sequence are accepted, a concept sequence instance is generated for meaning representation . Parsing Example","We describe here how the memory-based parser produces a pseudo-template from an example sentenc e Si of the walkthrough message . At the start of parsing, all concept sequences are potential hypotheses for an incoming sentence . Therefore, in step 1, all concept sequences are initially predicted by placing P markers o n their CSRs and the first CSEs . For example, in the example knowledge base shown in Figure 6, P markers are placed on TIE-UP-186, 186-1, TIE-UP-66 and 66-1 . In step 4, from the first input phrase, [BRIDGESTON E SPORTS CO ..], a concept instance MUC5-COMPANY#1 is generated and connected to the corresponding semantic concept MUCS-COMPANY via instance link, as indicated in Figure 6 . These links are used as paths for propagating bottom-up activations from the concept instance MUCS-COMPANY#1 to the corresponding concept sequence elements in step 5 . Even though the CSEs 186-1, 186-8, 186-10, 66-3 and 66-5 in Figure 6 received A markers, only the P-marked CSE 186-1 is accepted, and therefore, MUC5-COMPANY#1 is bound to 186-1 via cse-instance link, as shown in Figure 7 . A markers at other CSE nodes are disregarded, becaus e they are not predicted at this stage . As a result, the P marker at 186-1 is passed to the next CSE 186-2 . However, other P markers are not affected by this change . The P-marked nodes (in this case, 186-2, 66-1 , TIE-UP-186 and TIE-UP-66) again wait for A markers generated from the next input phrase . trUCS-COMPANY AI [BRIDGESTONE' SPORTS COJ semantic 313 TIE-UP-186 TIE-UP-186#1 CS-cOMPANY# 2C5-COMPANY#1 CS-COMPANY#3 [BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO, \\t [A LOCAL CONCERN] \\t [A JAPANESE TRADING_ HOUSE] Figure 7 : Interpretation of S i","This procedure is repeated until all input phrasal segments are processed . Even though many nodes are predicted in the early processing stage, as more input words are processed, only a few nodes receive activations and are accepted . Eventually only relevant hypotheses survive as the interpretation of the input sentence . In this way, a parsing problem is converted into a phrasal pattern matching problem . Th e memory-based parser acts as a filter, in which each new input word reduces the number of possible meanings . TEMPLATE GENERATION MODUL E Overvie w","The template generation module is a rule-based system, which consists of 4 levels as shown in Figure 8 . The first part generates templates based on the output of the memory-based parser with strict constraint s for the verb cases . The second part generates templates based on the output of the phrasal parser, whe n the memory-based parsing failed to generate correct interpretation . The third part is almost same as th e second part, but it requires less strict string patterns to apply the rules . The forth part is also based o n the memory-based parsing output but with less strict verb case constraints . When applying the rules, latter parts are not applied when a former part succeeds in generating templates . Template Generation Based on Memory-Based Parse r","When memory-based parsing is successful, generated concept sequence instances are marked . In the template generation process, some markers are propagated from this marker, and the information is extracte d by collecting markers . The memory-based parser not only gives the syntactic information but also gives th e semantic interpretation . Thus, the output contains the template generation rules by itself, and the templates generated have high precision rate . All concept sequences are attained by an automatic knowledg e acquisition tool from the TIPSTER texts and keys . There are about 300 concept sequences for templat e generation in the knowledge base .","One major problem is caused by the advantage above, because concept sequences require the satisfactio n of strict semantic constraints . Because many company and human names are not known to the system an d there is no inference routine to guess company or human names, the memory-based parser fails on man y sentences that are matched to the existing concept sequences but doesn 't satisfy the semantic constraints . To overcome this problem, the semantic constraints of some part of the concept sequences are relaxed t o nothing .

For the purposes of template generation based on the phrasa l parser, domain-specific rules were generated .

All template generation base d on the phrasal parser is due to both the successful application of a specific rule, and the implementatio n of the actions associated with the specific rule . Another use of the rules was as an aid in building concep t sequences for the knowledge base to be utilized by the memory- based parser .","Rule generation was performed through the use of training sentences obtained from the TIPSTER text s and also from human intuition . Training sentences were analyzed for important concepts, words, punctuation, symbols, etc . (e .g . company name, 'with', '$', ',') .

The precision of results obtained through rule application was not as high as the precision of results obtaine d by utilizing the memory-based parser .

Therefore, a very simple referenc e resolution scheme is used with phrasal parser output, only for the joint venture and the entities . When a definite reference to a joint venture (e .g . \"the joint venture\") is found, the most recent joint venture is chosen as a referent . The same scheme is applied to definite references to entities, except the cases using company names (e .g . aliases) . A small module has been written to handle acronyms and company aliases . LEXICAL ACQUISITION SYSTEM","To provide the domain specific semantic patterns (FP-structures) presented in the previous section, a n automatic lexical acquisition system called PALKA has been developed [4] . The major goal of this syste m is to facilitate the construction of a large knowledge base of semantic patterns . PALKA acquires semanti c patterns from a set of domain specific sample texts .","The information extraction task on a narrow domain is quite different from a general semantic interpretation task . First, there are only a small number of event categories to which each text should be mapped , and only a small amount of pre-defined types of information to be extracted . Various expressions need to be mapped into one event category . Second, the information to be extracted can be found anywhere in th e sentence, not only in the subject or the object of the sentence, but also in the prepositional phrases or in th e modifier . An efficient representation should map various expressions to one of the desired categories, an d detect the information carrying words or phrases from anywhere in the sentence . Based on these observations,the FP-structure has been developed as a suitable representation . Acquisition Procedure","First., a meaning frame including several keywords is defined as a target of the acquisition . The TIE-U P meaning frame contains ENTITYO, ENTITYI, and ENTITY2 slots, each of which has its semantic constraint as MUC5-COMPANY . ENTITY0 corresponds to the joint venture company (child company) .

TIE-UP: [ (ENTITYI : COMPANY) form (JOINT VENTURE) with (ENTITY2 : COMPANY) ) Figure 9 : The example FP-structure s word \"joint venture \" has been selected as a keyword . Relevant sentences are extracted from training text s by using the keyword . Second, an extracted sentence is segmentized and decomposed into several simpl e phrasal patterns . The original text consists of complex sentences which contain relative clauses, nomina l clauses, conjunctive clauses, etc . Since semantic patterns are acquired from simple clauses, it is necessary t o convert a complex sentence to a set of simple clauses . The phrasal parser groups words based on each word' s syntactic category and ordering rules for noun-groups and verb-groups . After grouping is performed, th e phrasal parser first simplifies the sentence by eliminating several unnecessary elements such as determiners , adverbs, quotations, brackets and so on . Then it. converts the simplified sentence into several simple clause s by using conversion rules . The conversion rules include separation of relative clauses, nominal clauses an d conjunctive clauses . Third, by using the semantic tags provided by the preprocessor . links between the fram e slots and the phrasal pattern elements are established . All the noun groups representing a company nam e are mapped as an ENTITY . Separating ENTITYO from others is done by a human after generating all th e FP-structures . Finally, PALKA constructs an FP-structure based on the mapping information . The basi c strategy for constructing an FP-structure is to include the mapped elements and the main verb, and discar d the unmapped elements .","Figure 9 shows several examples of the training sentences and the FP-structure generated from them fo r TIE-UP . As discussed in the performance analysis section, the FP-structures generated by PALKA greatl y affects the overall scores . Also by automating the procedure of building patterns, it reduces the time fo r constructing the knowledge base of semantic patterns, and provides scalabilit .y and portability to the knowledge based information extraction . PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSSIO N Summary of Score Result s","During the development of the system, the 186 dryrun messages were used as a test set . For the final run, 251 new messages were processed . A part of the summary of score results for the final run is shown i n Tables 2 and 3 . In Error-based metrics, ER.R = 84%, and in recall-precision-based metrics, the recall for al l objects was 19%, the precision was 36%, and the F-measure was 24 .67 .","While developing the system, we have tried various options to improve the performance . The most important option was changing the semantic pattern knowledge base . To detect the TIE-UP relationship, w e used simple string matching rules, domain specific FP-structures, and a relaxed version of the FP-structures . Table 4 shows the different results according to the selection of different knowledge base options .","The basic system only include the simple string matching rules . The string matching rules are too primitive, so the recall was only 10% .

In the relaxed pattern, the semantic constraints are removed, so any noun group can be mappe d to an ENTITY slot . The relaxed patterns were tested because there were many company names that wer e not detected (they are not in the company name list) . Due to the relaxed constraint, more TIE-UP relation s were detected, so the recall increased 3% . However, the relaxed patterns also produced many incorrect result , and the precision decreased 10%, resulting in a slightly decreased F-measure . By carefully selecting onl y part of the relaxed pattern, the overall performance would increase by detecting unknown company names without producing a large amount of incorrect matching . Amount of Effor t","The development of whole system including the knowledge base took 6 month in our team consisting o f one faculty and five graduate students . Since the skeleton of the memory-based parser used for MUC-4 wa s reusable, most of the time was spent on construction of the knowledge base, updating the dictionary entries , and coding the template generation rules . The total effort for MUC-5 can be estimated as follows : Knowledge base construction 25 % Preprocessor and dictionary 20% Memory based parser 10 % Template generation 25% System integration 10% Testing and scoring 10% Limiting Factor s","Regarding the limiting factors in the performance of the system we have noticed that : (1) Inferencin g rules to detect unknown company names are needed, (2) More semantic patterns are needed, (3) Our discourse processing capability was insufficient, (4) The parser does not address enough linguistic problems , and (5) The semantic tagging in dictionary entries was not. complete .

The preprocessor not only performs the dictionary look-up, but also detects various multi-word nouns, and provides semantic tags for important words, which are necessary for late r processing stages . The use of domain specific semantic patterns to detect TIE-UP relationships is efficien t and effective . The memory-based parser performs fast and efficient semantic parsing by using those patterns . The lexical acquisition system was effective in constructing the knowledge base of patterns . It also provides portability-to other domains . The main weaknesses lie in the lack of discourse processing and lac k of a module that performs inference to detect company names . A large portion of the dryrun and finalru n messages did not produce a correct TIE-UP relationship only because we failed to detect the company names . Reusability","Assuming that the domain and the required output is changed, approximately 75% of the lexicon an d concept hierarchy is reusable . None of the inferencing rules for filling templates and the domain specifi c patterns are reusable . However, the patterns can be easily acquired for a new domain by using the lexica l acquisition system . What was Learned","Through the development of the SNAP system for MUC-5, we have learned that the information extraction task needs different approaches from the Natural Language Understanding task, although a full natural language understanding capability is necessary for perfect performance . Full syntactic analysis and semanti c interpretation are not necessary for information extraction . If sufficient semantic information is provide d for each lexical entry, a phrasal pattern matching approach can achieve reasonable performance in a ver y efficient way . Over all, our experience with MUC-5 has been useful and rewarding .
