Utilizing dictionaries and parsing engines we have already had, we have developed the VENIEX System (VENus for Information EXtraction) as used for MUC-5 in only three months. Our method is to apply both domain-specifi c keyword-based analysis and full sentential parsing with general grammar[6, 7] . The keyword dictionary o f VENIEX contains about thirty thousand entries, whose semantic structures are sub..ME_Capability frame , and the parsing and discourse processing are controlled with the information given in this semantic structure of keywords . The resulting scores of VENIEX for formal run *texts were from 0 .7181(minimum) t o 0 .7548(maximum) in Richness-Normalized Error and 48 .33 in F-MEASURES(P&R) ."]},{"title":"SYSTEM ARCHITECTUR E","paragraphs":["The overall system architecture is shown in Fig. 1 .

We have improved the system a little after the formal run -only by debugging parsing rules, not by adding new rules and/or dictionaries-, and the current scores of VENIEX for formal run texts are from 0 .7181(minimum ) to 0.7548(maximum) in Richness-Normalized Error and 48 .33 in F-MEASURES(P&R), which are shown i n Table 2. The current scores for dry run texts are also shown in Table 3.","Though we have developed the VENIEX System in only three months, there wasn't so much differenc e in scores with other systems in MUG-5 . But the scores were lower than we had expected . The main reaso n is the lowness of recall rate . We didn't have enough time to collect keywords, especially verbs representin g the relations between entities and microelectronics .","We have developed many new functions for the MUG5 system, such as co-reference resolution and keyword deduction . We have been evaluating these functions separately to judge weather they worked as w e designed . For example, to evaluate the performance of keyword deduction function in the Local Parser and the Parser, we made an information extraction experiment without dictionaries of entities .
