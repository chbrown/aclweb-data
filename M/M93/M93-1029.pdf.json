Jacob s Artificial Intelligence Laborator y GE Research and Developmen t Schenectady, NY 12301 USA psjaco bs @crd .ge . corn","paragraphs":["This broad topic session covered a range of ideas on challenges for the future, along with approaches t o meeting these challenges . Although some discussion of matters of scale was common to all the presentations , the speakers offered different perspectives on how to achieve scale-up .","Two of the presentations, \"A Unified View of Different Understanding Tasks\" by Dckang Lin, and \"Applications of Extraction Technology : Today and Tomorrow \" by Christine Montgomery, focused on linguisti c principles and processing as ways of meeting future challenges . Lin emphasized that a unifying theoretica l framework for understanding could lead to \"graceful degradation \" , helping systems to produce better results . Montgomery, while covering a number of practical applications of data extraction, stressed that there ar e many areas in which systems still perform poorly .","Robert Gaizauskas' talk \"Applications of Text Extraction in Police Command and Control Systems : From POETIC to GENIE\" presented the \"ideal \" , generic information extraction system as an extension o f a current message interpretation framework, which is robust but handles only limited messages in limite d domains .","My own view, \"Making Knowledge Acquisition Work\" questioned the incremental approach to extendin g data extraction systems, claiming that what systems need to make further leaps is not more of what the y have now but more of what they don't have . For example, lexical acquisition work has focused on learnin g features of words that are usually found in computational lexicons, while scaling up seems to emphasiz e world knowledge and discourse-level knowledge, which exist only in very limited forms today .","John Burger's presentation, \"Information Extraction and Text Enrichment\" emphasized progress throug h the integration of data extraction with other technologies and standards rather than the development of ne w methods . Burger stressed the importance of the SGML standard for document markup, explaining ho w data extraction and document enrichment work together, creating structured texts, hypertext, and servin g a text database . In addition to showing how data extraction could help in a document management system , Burger pointed out that conforming to standards makes it easy to use off-the-shelf tools instead of developin g custom research software for many functions .","While there are certain areas of agreement about what systems currently can do and what they can ' t , do, the differences among these brief talks shows some variation in opinion, not only about which problem s are most crucial, but also about how to address them . In the discussions at MUC, there were substantia l disputes among participants even about whether more progress is likely in the near future, and whether tha t progress will come from more research, as most of the presenters in this session suggested, or from \"fin e tuning\" and engineering . It seems that the only way to find out is to continue with task-oriented evaluation s like MUC, but the rate of progress that has been made in the MUC series does not seem to be slowing . Hence the reading for the future may be \"we will do better\"—the open questions are how we will do better , and how much better we will do . 343"]}]}
