What is described below is the result of 12 person-months of intensive effort over six month s to adapt a pre-existing system, designed with very different objectives and application in mind, to the MUC- 5 English Joint Ventures task. This task, starting from cold, is colossal : the overhead of understanding the task , the training data, the scoring, the background resources, of developing a suitable harness for the system, not to mention sorting out contractual arrangements, leaves little time for even basic porting – actual developmen t tailored to the task was a very remote prospect . So, despite the quirks and failings exposed by the discussio n below of the 'walkthrough ' example, we are pleased with our system's performance, and believe the effort to hav e been a worthwhile part of our ongoing research ."]},{"title":"HISTOR Y","paragraphs":["The system used for MUC-5 is a modified version of a system developed at Sussex as part of the TIC ('Traffi c Information Collator') and subsequently POETIC ('Portable Extendable Traffic Information Collator') projects, i n association with Racal Research Ltd ., the Automobile Association, and National Transcommunications Ltd ., an d part-funded by the UK Science and Engineering Research Council and Department of Trade and Industry .","POETIC is a prototype software system which monitors police reports of traffic incidents and automaticall y generates 'traffic bulletins ' for motorists . POETIC ' s inputs are police incident reports entered as text into a polic e logging computer – database entries containing free format text fields which describe the incident in telegrammatic , jargon-laden English, as well as some information in fixed field format . The system identifies reports about traffi c incidents, and uses them to build up a picture of the key features of an incident . From this information it makes judgements about the effect, seriousness, duration etc . of each incident, formulates suitable advisory messages , and coordinates delivery of the messages to the affected motorists . Further details of POETIC can be found i n [1], [11], [14], [5] .","The initial stages of the POETIC system constitute a message understanding system very similar in functio n to the systems participating in the MUC evaluations : mapping from narrow-domain free text input to a semanti c representation of key pieces of information . Furthermore the 'Portable' in POLL IC refers to domain portabilit y – the system is structured to make porting between domains relatively straightforward, albeit only in the narrow sense of different police sublanguage domains all within the same overall domain of traffic reports . But althoug h POETIC is a fairly mature system (more than 16 person-years of development effort over the past 8 years, of 321 which we estimate two thirds has been on the message understanding component), it has to date remained rathe r isolated in its own field of traffic management systems, in which there is little similar work . In particular, th e message understanding component has been evaluated primarily only relative to the requirements of the rest o f the POETIC system, rather than in an independent context .","Thus our objectives in participating in MUC-5 were threefold : firstly, to see how readily POETIC's messag e understanding component (designed with a particular type of domain in mind) could be adapted to a radicall y different topic domain, secondly to get a more objective view of how well the system performs, and how it relate s to other approaches, and finally to take a further step towards the larger goal of developing a generic messag e understanding system – portable to a much wider range of (still narrow) domains ."]},{"title":"SYSTEM DESCRIPTIO N Key Design Features","paragraphs":["The key strengths and novelties of our approach to message understanding are : • the declarative representation of all its main knowledge bases (lexicon, grammar, domain model )","• support for extendability and domain-portability, through identification and localisation of domain-specifi c informatio n","• the 'interesting corner ' island parsing technique, which allows grammar coverage to focus on domain-relevan t phenomen a","• the coupling of robust but overfragmented partial analysis of input sentences with a semantic modelle r which utilises domain knowledge to construct a coherent interpretation of extended text s","• the application and integration in a practical information extraction system of theoretically well-founde d techniques – bidirectional chart parsing, unification-based grammar, compositional semantics, inheritance - based representation languages . Architectur e The architecture of the Sussex system used for MUC is shown in Figure 1 . The Pre-processor The Pre-processor takes an input document' and massages it into a form more easily processe d by the rest of the system . Its key function is to break the document up into 'fixed field' sentences (such as documen t number, date and source), and free text sentences . To do this, it interprets SGML tags where present, looks fo r sentence boundaries in conventional ways, and tokenises the resulting text – identifying numbers and punctuatio n symbols and separating them from alphabetic text etc . . It also attempts to locate quoted speech and discards i t – examination of the training corpora revealed that very rarely was there useful information in such text whic h was not also elsewhere, and far more often it proved quite troublesome to process . The result is a sequence o f distinct sentences, either fixed field or free text .","Fixed field sentences bypass lexical and syntactic processing : they are converted directly into fake semanti c parses and passed to the Discourse Interpreter . Free text sentences are passed to the lexical analyser and the n the parser . The Lexical Analyser The Lexical Analyser takes pre-processed sentences and performs a sequence of tests . looking for lexical phrases and lexical entries for individual words . It is primarily here that background resource s (company names, locations, personal names etc .) are employed . Broadly speaking, this process splits int o three phases : looking for lexical phrases with reliable indicators, looking in the main lexicon for known words . and then looking for lexical phrases with less reliable indicators . l he aim here, and indeed throughout th e 'Or, in test mode, a corpus, which it splits up into separate documents . 322","E XTPAC T 00C NAME DATE .

To this end the search is ordered so that mor e probable interpretations of a word are sought first, and if found will often preclude the hypothesis of less probabl e alternatives . The following reliable phrasal indicators are detected :","Numbers some of which may have alternative interpetations as years, or be followed by an ordinal marker (st , nd, rd etc .) .","Titled names where the titles come from a fixed set, and special-purpose name detection routines locate th e entire name phrase . Titles can be prefixed or postfixed and most become incorporated in the resultin g lexical phrase . A few, however, such as president and chairman have their own entries in the main lexicon , and so trigger a name phrase but remain independent of it so that the appropriate semantic compositio n takes place during parsing .","Common locations gleaned from the training corpus . The supplied gazetteer is far too unwieldy to use directl y and the timescale did not permit much experimentation with it . Instead we compiled a list of the mos t frequent locations (cities, countries regions — just over 300 in all) actually occurring in the training corpu s and this is the data used here . Other locations may be picked up in the third phase of lexical processing — see below .","Fixed phrases occurring frequently in the domain, such as joint venture, trading house, stock exchange, mostl y derived from a digram analysis of the training corpus . Also, common English fixed phrases such as as well as .","Corporate designators whose presence triggers special-purpose company name detection code . Company name s identified in this way are remembered so that they will be recognised later in the document even without a corporate designator 2 .","The main domain-specific lexicon is written in the inheritance-based lexical representation language DAT R [10], [9] . This contains the root forms of significant domain words (e .g . company, own) and the most commo n English words (e .g. the, and) found in the training corpus — about 600 entries in all, although the level of semanti c detail is as yet far from uniform . Before looking up a word in this lexicon, a simple morphological analysis i s performed : a set of rules is used to detect standard suffixes, resulting in a root + suffix analysis for each word . The root indexes a lexical entry (or entries, for ambiguous forms) while the suffix information is used to fill i n feature details . Further details of this mechanism can be found in [4], [3] . The following less reliable phrasal indicators are only accepted cautiously :","Simple corporate names from the supplied resources . One-word company names are sought after the mai n lexicon lookup . Thus a normal domain interpretation of a word is preferred over any possible compan y name intepretation . However the presence of a following corporate designator will generally force a compan y interpretation when it is encountered .","Phrasal corporate names from the supplied resources . A phrasal name is split into an essential (contiguous ) core, plus peripheral optional parts . Phrases are indexed on the first word of the core, and if the whole cor e is located, then optional parts will also be incorporated into the lexical phrase if present . In principle, thi s might be a very reliable match but both the automatic identification of appropriate cores in the corpus, an d the heuristics for matching optional words are still rather rudimentary . Bare personal names using the names resources and a certain amount of guesswork about unknown words .","2 This is in fact the only 'global state' maintained by the lexical analyser or the parser — all other lexical and syntactic processin g looks only at the current sentence . 324","Gazetteer locations from the supplied gazetteer – using this directly leads to many surprising, and generall y spurious hits, and much irrelevant ambiguity even in sensible cases, so it is employed very much as a las t resort at present .","Note that the main lexicon contains only about 600 words, and since many words in the input will neither b e in this lexicon nor be part of recognisable lexical phrases, many words will be given no lexical analysis whatsoeve r by the Lexical Analyser. Avoiding complete initial lexical analysis is one of the features of our approach ; limite d further lexical analysis is done during parsing, as described in the next section . The Parser The Parser takes the initial lexical hypotheses for a single sentence produced by the lexical analyser , and attempts to build larger syntactic structures (ideally, but rarely, a complete parse) . From these it build s semantic representations . The lexical entries returned (for single words and larger phrases) have three basi c components : a backbone category, some feature/value specifications, and a semantic expression . The gramma r rules similarly consist of backbone categories and feature specifications, plus semantic composition rules describin g how the semantics of the mother category is constructed from that of the daughters .","The backbone categories are parsed using a chart parser in a conventional fashion : the fact that they ar e atomic allows greater efficiency in rule indexing and primary category matching . Once backbone categories hav e been matched, the corresponding feature sets are unified together . The most important role of unification is to enforce domain-specific type restrictions which play an important role in the parsing process . The parser has a sophisticated semantic type system, which uses term unification to implement type-compatibility (see [13] fo r further details) .","As well as the restrictive effects of the type system in the grammar, the other main aspect which distinguishe s the parser from standard chart parsers is the use of 'interesting-corner' parsing (see [13]) . A grammar rule is onl y triggered if its indexing category is currently 'interesting ' . What constitutes an interesting category is controlle d dynamically by the parser and grammar and is quite domain-specific . Initially, just a few classes of lexical categorie s are deemed interesting (such as company names and joint venture phrases), and so only parsing from such word s or phrases is ever initiated . This strategy means that the parser has to be bidirectional, but it does restrict it t o analysing phrases which have some interesting content . The 'interestingness' can spread to features which ar e explicitly sought by a rule which has been triggered .","The parser also includes heuristics for handling common words not in the main domain lexicon . Once th e chart has been extended as far as it can be on the basis of the initial hypotheses (which included only domai n specific words and very common English words), the words which are 'blocking' active chart edges are examined . These words are sought in the 'ANLT ' lexicon, a general lexicon of English developed under the 'Alvey Natura l Language Tools' Project [2] which contains about 7000 root forms and associated with each a syntactic categor y If the ' blocking ' words are in the ANLT lexicon and are of the right category to extend the active edge, then the y are added at this point, and parsing proceeds again . In this way, the presence of the odd unknown word withi n interesting text does not cause a problem, but the parser is not weighed down with attempting to process all th e common words in the sentence .","The parser constructs semantic representations – expressions of lambda calculus over predicate logic – as a post-process on completed syntactic parse trees . The grammar rules specify compositionally how the semantic s of complex linguistic categories are constructed out of the semantics of component categories . At the highes t level, in a parse tree of a complete message, all lambda variables disappear and the parser produces an expressio n of predicate calculus as its interpretation of the 'meaning' of the message . The Discourse Interpreter The Discourse Interpreter integrates semantic information from each successiv e parsed sentence into the current semantic model . This component draws on a number of previous approaches . such as auxiliary role fillers [7], scripts [15], interpretation as abduction [12] and world models [8] . [6] .","The first semantic task is to add any facts presupposed by the new information, to give us a more explici t picture of the intended meaning . So for example, a 'joint venture' event presupposes at least two (distinct ) joint venture participants and an activity in which the participants will engage, but this information may not b e explicitly present in the input . 325 SEMANTIC ONTOLOG Y erfly(X) (Including al SC \\t (Inducing al Fealty hpas) categories) \\t Figure 2 : Fragment of EJV Ontology used in MUC- 5","The second semantic task is co-reference resolution – the same entity may be referenced throughout the tex t in different ways, perhaps even implicitly (as in ellipsis), and this identity of reference needs to be establishe d To do this a data structure is employed which locates all entity types in a hierarchical type system or ontology, a fragment of which is shown in figure 2 .","Each node in the ontology has properties associated with it, either defined explicitly or inherited from above . Such properties are themselves nodes in the ontology . Co-reference resolution is constrained to respect the typ e system (inconsistent ' types ' may not co-refer) and the property specifications (some properties are unique-valued . others are not) . Apart from this it is unconstrained, except that we attempt resolution within a parse befor e attempting resolution between a parse and the existing model . This is a legacy of the traffic domain, wher e multiple entities of the same type were rare, but as we shall see in the walkthrough, this means that inappropriat e coreferences do sometimes occur .","This component also has a more subtle role in the overall architecture of the system . In order to parse robustly, the grammar has rather patchy, oversimplified coverage in 'uninteresting' areas . This means that the resultan t analyses tend to be overfragmented . Part of the role of the co-reference resolver is to pull such fragment s back together at the semantic level . This technique is an important factor in the overall effectiveness of ou r approach, allowing clearer, more conventional expression of the grammatical knowledge encoded, not encumbere d by complicated support for robustness issues .","The final stage of semantic analysis, after all the sentences have been processed, is to provide values for a number of key domain features . The system has a notion of the certain features which must be present in an y model, and if values for them have not been provided explicitly from the text, it will attempt to provide the m itself . This is partly achieved through inference from values which have been provided, so that, for example , the description of an industry can be inferred from the description of a facility - mining happens at mines . manufacturing at plants etc . . When all else fails, default values are provided where appropriate . Many of thes e defaults are derived from statistical analysis of the training corpus and templates – for example, in the WSJ, MEA D and PROMT development template sets, ecentity-type') is COMPANY in 92% of cases, tie-up-status is EXISTIN G","3 Throughout this paper we use the term 'ecentity' (economic entity) to denote the MUC-5 template ENTITY object - the ter m 'entity ' being already in use as the top of our own ontology . poison(x) gowx) company(X) ° 1 ct(X) \\t earvice(X) awn(x(v,Z) softy(x) \\t )19oP(X ) le(%) \\t immutpble(X) reational.prop(X ) agrculture(%) mirrrq(X) oorwruaion(X) manulaauriny(X) communications(X) sia(X) factory(X) farm(x) bulid(X,Y.Z) aperate(X,Y,Z) produce(X,Y,Z) acility_name(x,Y) acily_tocatcn(x,Y ) lie_up slatus(X,Y) U ._up_ecentny(X,Y) de_upjv_comp(X,Y ) ecentiy_alias(x,Y) number_ot(x ) time_ot(x) (Including all unique \\t (including all non-unique valued template skits) \\t valued template skits) 326 in 79% of cases .

Notice in fragment 4 that the common word LOCAL has not blocked the successful detection of the full noun phrase , despite not being present in the main lexicon .","On receiving these parses, the Discourse Interpreter first attaches an instance node to the ontology for eac h entity referred to in the parses (el, e2 etc .) . These instance nodes are attached immediately below the mos t specific object or event type node by which the entity is identified in the parses . Each predicate in the parses which is a property (determined by reference to the ontology — see figure 2) is then added to the property lis t of each of the entity instances which occur as its arguments . Once this mapping of representations has bee n achieved, we end up with an instance model containing four ecentity objects, a tie_up object and a couple of location objects . The next step is to expand presuppositions, and in this case only the tie_up entity has an y presuppositions : that there are two tie_up_ecentities and a tie_up_activity. This latter has its own presupposition s that it is at an activity_site and associated with an industry . So new objects are created for all these also, and w e are ready to start co-reference resolution, the main task .","Since this is the first sentence of any significance, only intra-sentential co-reference resolution occurs .

It does not unify wit h TRADING HOUSE since the latter is not a company — it has the incompatible type ' other_ecentity ' ', nor with th e second tie_up ecentity, which is constrained to be distinct from the first, leaving these two free to unify together .

In an y case, while we would have got more accurate company names with mixed case, it is not clear that many of th e structural problems would go away . To fix those, one needs to look at the parser, or particularly the grammar .","paragraphs":["In POETIC, the grammar is remarkably stable across police sublanguages, presumably because most of th e sublanguage variation is lexical rather than grammatical . However, this grammar is less appropriate for the Join t Ventures domain, where the language is much closer to standard English . Hence a fair amount of developmen t work is required to achieve a proper port, and of course, only a fragment of this work has been done so far . Man y of our problem areas are the standard ones — apposition, coordination etc . but it would be interesting to se e whether our architecture offers more pragmatic solutions . If the parser can be persuaded to pass on just a littl e more grammatical information, it might be possible for the discourse interpreter to make the right association s more robustly . This is already happening to some extent : prepositions often indicate relationships between nou n phrases that are difficult to capture syntactically . In the grammar, such links are reported as being simply a n abstract relation between entities, and it is up to the discourse interpreter, with its far richer context, to decid e what more specific relationship is appropriate .","A further weakness that the walkthrough example shows up well is our inability to deal with many objects o f the same type, notably companies . In the traffic domain, it was rarely important to distinguish entities beyon d their type, and so the co-reference resolution strategies used are rather eager and arbitrary . Finer control, an d perhaps even backtracking, is clearly needed here .","Finally, a few words on evaluation . Table 1 gives the results for the final evaluation run, scoring against th e full templates . Table 2 gives the results when scored against the reduced template that was used in the dry ru n test two months before the final run . These figures are noticably better and arguably a better assessment of th e system, because the reduced template corresponds more closely to the system's abilities . The reason for this i s that the full template included a number of objects and slots not present in the reduced template, which ou r system never attempted to fill — we simply did not have time to develop, any code to support them . These, of course, count as errors in the full template score, but are ignored in the reduced template scor e s lt is interesting to note here that the walkthrough example alone gave very similar figures, and so is fairly average for our syste m","UN DERR","78ALL OBJECTS : SU B","3859 OV G","2 5 Max-errMin-err 0 .90620 .882 REC PR E 25 46 331 ERROR-BASED METRIC SU BERR - UND OVG 38ALL OBJECTS :","2 35174 RICHNESS-NORMALIZED ERROR",": II\\tMin-er r 0 .5311 Max-er r 0 .545 7 RECALL AND PRECISIO N RE C 30 PRE 48","P&R F-Measur e 37 .1 4 Table 2 :Reduced Template Score s"]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S The research described in this paper would not have been possible but for the generous support of Integra l Solutions Ltd ., Racal Research Ltd ., Sussex University (COGS) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency , Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office (contract no .
