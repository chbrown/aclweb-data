Diderot is an information extraction system built at CRL and Brandeis University over th e past two years. It was produced as part of our efforts in the Tipster project . The same overall system architecture has been used for English and Japanese and for the micro-electronics and join t venture domains. The past history of the system is discussed and the operation of its major components described . A summary of scores at the 24 month workshop is given and the performance of the system o n the texts selected for the system walkthrough is discussed . INTRODUCTIO N","paragraphs":["The Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University, in collaboration with Brandei s University, was one of four sites selected to develop systems to extract relevant information automatically from English and Japanese texts . The systems produced by the Tipster research groups hav e already been evaluated at 12 and 18 months into the project . The performance of the Diderot Syste m has improved both for English and Japanese . The performance in Japanese, however, is still far ahea d of our English performance .","The Tipster project is, without a doubt, the largest scale Applied Natural Language Processin g task yet undertaken anywhere in the world . The government data preparation effort involved th e selection and analysis of more than 5,000 individual texts . The results of this analysis have been use d to develop and test the systems produced by each site . The software used to support this huma n extraction task, both for English and Japanese, was developed and supported by the CRL under a separate subcontract .","Because of the emphasis on different languages and different subject areas the research has focuse d on the development of general purpose, re-usable techniques . The CRL/Brandeis group have implemented statistical methods for focusing on the relevant parts of texts, programs which recognize an d mark names of people, places and organizations and also dates . The actual analysis of the critical part s of the texts is carried out by a parser controlled by lexical structures for the k̀ey ' words in the text . To extend the system's coverage of English and Japanese some of the content of these lexical structure s was derived from machine readable dictionaries . These were then enhanced with information extracted from corpora. 161","The system has already been evaluated in the 4th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4 ) where it was required to extract information from 200 texts on South American terrorism . Considering the very short development time allowed for this additional domain the system performed adequately. The system was then adapted to handle the business domain and also to process Japanese texts . Further extensions to the system allowed it to process texts on micro-electronics development . Performance at the 12 and 18 month evaluations was good for Japanese, but less good for English wher e we have been attempting to automate much of the development process . A more pragmatic approac h was adopted for the final 24 month evaluation, using the same hand-crafted techniques for English a s had been used for Japanese .","We estimate the amount of effort used directly to build the systems described here is around sixt y man months ."]},{"title":"MAIN RESEARCH OBJECTIVE S","paragraphs":["Our objectives in this research have been as follows :","• to develop and implement a language-independent framework for lexical semantic representation , and develop and implement a robust integration of that framework into a language-independent theory of semantic processing ;","• to investigate and implement language independent techniques for automating the building o f lexical knowledge bases from machine readable resources ; • to implement statistical tools for the tuning of lexical structures to specific domains ; • to implement the use of language independent statistical techniques for identifying relevan t","passages of documents for more detailed analysis ; • to develop and implement a set of robust multi-pass finite-state feature taggers ; • to develop and implement the equivalent methods for Japanese ."]},{"title":"SYSTEM OVERVIE W","paragraphs":["An outline of the functions of the main system modules are given here .

Reference Resolutio n","paragraphs":["The task of this component is to gather all the relevant information scattered in a text together . Th e major task is to resolve reference or anaphora . For the current application only references betwee n tie-up events, between entities, and between entity relations are considered .","Since entities are expressed in noun phrases, the references for entities are resolved by resolvin g the reference between noun phrases . Since the entity can either be referred to by definite or indefinit e noun phrase or by name, it is necessary to detect the reference between two definite or indefinite nou n phrases, between two names, as well as between one name and one definite or indefinite noun phrase . All entities are represented as frames of the form :","entity(Sen#, Para#, Noun-phrase, Name , Location, Nationality , Ent-type, alias-list, np-list) .","The reference between two entities is resolved by looking at the similarity between their names and/or their noun phrases . Since companies are often referred by their nationality or location, th e Location and Nationality slot fillers in the entity frame also contribute to the reference resolution . Some special noun phrases which refer to some particular role of a tie-up (the newly formed venturei n particular) are also recognized and resolved . For example, a phrase which refers to the child entity , such as t̀he new company' or t̀he venture', will be recognized and merged with the child of the tie-up event in focus . A stack of entities found in the text is maintained . 166","Definite noun phrases can only be used for local reference . So they can only be used to refer to entities involved in the tie-up event which is in focus . On the contrary, names can be used for bot h local and global reference, so they can refer to any entity referred to before in the text .","When a reference relation between two entities is resolved they are merged to create one singl e entity which contains all the information about that particular entity .","Since a tie-up is generally referenced by an entire sentence rather than a single noun phrase, th e reference of tie-up events is handled by resolving the reference between its participants and some othe r information mentioned about the event . Other heuristics are also applied . These mostly block th e overapplication of merging . For example, two tie-ups cannot be merged if their dates are different ; similarly, entities with different locations will not be merged . There are currently two types of tex t structures which are considered . In the first type, one tie-up-event is in focus until the next one i s mentioned and after the new one is mentioned the old one will not be mentioned again . In the secon d type, a list of tie-up-events are mentioned shortly in one paragraph, and more details of each event ar e given sequentially later . Finally, when the reference between two tie-ups is resolved they will also b e merged to form a single tie-up event . The final result is a set of new frames which are linked in suc h a way as to reduce the requirement on the final stage of maintaining pointers to the various objects .","With the exception of the use of definite articles —an obvious cross-linguistic difference betwee n the languages studied— the reference resolution process for Japanese is identical to English .

Another difference might b e due to the focus of effort on automatic and semi-automatic pattern generation for the English systems , a process which was not attempted for Japanese development . Although this differential would appea r to speak slightly against these particular automatic development techniques, we feel that additiona l testing and refinement of the patterns would have brought the scores more in line with the Japanes e systems, since they use the same architecture ."]},{"title":"KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERIN G","paragraphs":["The DIDEROT system has involved the development of a significant amount of diverse knowledge . This consisted of the automatic construction of the lexicon and partial syntactic forms for a give n language and domain, along with subsequent tuning and refinement . Human tuning was also neede d for both languages .","This off-line component included the derivation of vocabulary automatically from machine readabl e sources, and made use of statistically-based techniques to determine the relevant domain-dependen t vocabulary of words and phrases from text samples .","Statistical techniques were used extensively to assist in the development of the various lexicon s of the Tipster system . Initially, a simple frequency count of the tokens in the initial corpora wa s used to highlight those words which should be targeted, essentially determining what core vocabular y elements are of rnost importance . In general, the lexical structures used by the system can be though t of as providing for the shallowest possible semantic decomposition while still capturing significan t generalizations about how words relate conceptually to one another . 168"]},{"title":"Deriving the Lexicon from Machine-Readable Resource s","paragraphs":["The lexical knowledge base consists of lexical items called generative lexical structures (GLSs), after Pustejovsky[9] . This model of semantic knowledge associated with words is based on a system o f generative devices which is able to recursively define new word senses for lexical items in the language . For this reason, the algorithm and associated dictionary is called a generative lexicon . The lexical structures contain conventional syntactic and morphological information along with detailed typin g information about arguments","The creation of the GLS lexicon begins with the printer 's tape of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), Proctor[8] . This was parsed and analysed by the CRL lexical grou p to give a tractable formatted version of LDOCE called LEXBASE[5] .

For example, the subject is typed as a organization and the object as the type device .","The syntactic and collocational behavior of a word is represented in the cospec (cospecification ) field of the entry . The cospec of a lexical item can be seen as. paradigmatic syntactic behavior for a word, involving both abstract types as well as lexical collocations . This field is created automaticall y by reference to the syntactic codes of the verb, as represented in LDOCE, in this case T1 (i .e . , basic transitive) . That is, the cospec encodes explicit information regarding the linear positioning of arguments, as well as semantic constraints on the arguments as imposed by the typing information i n the qualia . The syntactic representation of a word's environment may appear flat, but the semanti c interpretation is based on a unification-like algorithm which creates a much richer functional structure . Theoretically, the expressive power of converting the cospecs of a GLS into DCG parse rules i s equivalent to the power of a Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar with collocations (Shieber[14]) , what we have termed Hyper Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (HTAGs) (Pustejovsky[13]) ."]},{"title":"Lexically Encoding Idiomatic and Phrasal Structure s","paragraphs":["One of the advantages to the highly lexical approach being taken here is the ability to encode idiomati c expressions and phrasal expressions as part of the lexicon proper, where motivated by statistical confir - mation of the collocations .

The standard linguistic approach to resolving the coreference between the pronoun and the compan y name is to syntactically \"walk\" the parse tree and bind the pronoun according to standard syntacti c anaphora constraints . That is, the subject of the matrix sentence is a possible antecedent to th e pronoun in the lower clause .

The project has depended a great deal on the skill and care of the people working on it t o ensure consistency in our data and code. Given the large number of knowledge bases in our syste m this is an onerous task and one task needed for the future is a system which allows this knowledge t o be integrated and held in one central data-base, where consistency can be maintained . The second is to develop an easily configurable and portable reference resolution engine .","There are no major differences in the structure of the English and Japanese systems . It woul d seem that a critical part of achieving high precision and recall is to have at least one person with a reasonable knowledge of the whole system to carry out repeated test/improve cycles .","The current system is robust and provides a good starting point for the application of more sophis - ticated techniques, some of them simply refined versions of the current architecture . Given appropriat e data it should be possible to produce a similar system for a different domain in a matter of months . Many parts of the system are portable in particular the semantic tagging mechanisms, the statistica l filtering component . Dates, companies and people - all of which occur in many kinds of text - we no w handle with good levels of accuracy .
