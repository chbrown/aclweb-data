The LINK parser applies unification grammar rules to a sentence to generate a syntactic and semantic representation . A set of principled grammar rule application heuristics select which grammar rules t o apply. If these heuristics fail, we revert to bottom-up chart parsing . We will outline the forma t of the grammar and then we will describe our parsing strategy . The LINK grammar","LINK's grammar rules are quite similar in form to those used in PATR-II (Shieber, 1986) . Semantic information resides mainly in the lexicon, along the lines of HPSG (Pollard and Sag , 1987) . This organization improves the portability of the system, since the vast majority o f the grammar should be applicable to other domains, while the lexicon contains most of th e domain-specific information .","The integration of syntactic and semantic knowledge into the same grammar formalism i s crucial to our system's ability to process large texts in a reasonable length of time, and t o producing the semantic analysis used to generate templates .","Edges are placed in the chart to represent constituents that the parser identifies . Edges hav e associated with them both syntactic and semantic information, represented in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) . The DAGs correspond to the information in the set of gramma r rules used to build a constituent . The MUC-5-LINK parsing strateg y","LINK is a bottom-up chart parser which does not use top-down constraints . Top-dow n","constraints are not used so that as many partial parses as possible can be generated .","Because unrestricted bottom-up chart parsing can be (and is, in our system) very inefficient ,","LINK uses heuristics to decide on the next edge to be entered into the chart . Many of th e 295 heuristics we use are taken from those suggested in psycholinguistic work (e .g ., Ford, Bresnan , and Kaplan, 1982), although we found the need to embellish these with additional heuristics o f our own (see Huyck and Lytinen, 1993, for details) .","The heuristics are encoded in a rule-based system . The rules are invoked each time a ne w edge is to be entered into the chart, in case more than one edge could be entered next . Each rule specifies a set of conditions under which a grammar rule should be preferred or unpreferred . Rules may specify several different types of preference levels, similar to the preferences that ar e used in SOAR (Laird, Rosenbloom, and Newell, 1987) . Heuristics may state that one gramma r rule is preferable to another under some set of circumstances (i .e ., if it is possible to apply bot h rule a and rule b at this point, then rule a should be applied), that a rule is a good candidate , that it is a bad candidate, or that it is the best candidate (i .e ., under these conditions, definitel y apply this grammar rule) .","Because the heuristics are incomplete, often it is the case that, at some point during th e parse, they are not able to suggest which rule to apply next . When this occurs, the syste m performs regular undirected bottom-up parsing . This continues until a complete parse of th e sentence is found, no more rules can be applied, or a maximum time limit is exceeded . If a complete parse is not found, one or more partial parses is passed on for further processing . N o attempt is made to \"patch\" together a complete interpretation of the sentence if it is not parse d successfully. The Postprocesso r","The postprocessor is responsible for assembling the semantic representations of individua l sentences into a coherent representation of the entire article, and for generating the respons e template(s) from this overall representation . Our MUC-5 postprocessor is a two-stage, rule-based system . In the first stage, the rules transform representations produced by the parser into a cannonical form . Irrelevant portions of the representation are also discarded in this firs t stage . In the second stage, another set of rules transforms these representations into a for m which much more closely resembles the form of the response templates .","A rule consists of a left hand side (lhs), which must match (i .e ., unify with) the semanti c output from the parser . If the lhs matches, the representation is converted to the form specifie d in the right hand side (rhs) .","Here are some example rules from the first stage of postprocessing :","(CONVERT report-action (1hs) = report (lhs object) = ACTIO N (rhs) = (lhs object ) (rhs actor) = (lhs actor) )","(CONVERT equi v (1hs) = equi v (lhs actor) = HUMA N (lhs actor name) = custome r 296 (rhs) = transfer-to-custome r (rhs recipient) = (lhs object) )","The first rule converts the representation produced for sentences such as \"It was reporte d that . . .\" . If the main predicate representing the sentence is REPORT, and the reported object i s an ACTION, then this rule discards the REPORT predicate and replaces it with the ACTION . If the ACTION has no actor, it is filled in as the actor of the REPORT . Thus, the transforme d representation of the sentence \"LSI Logic Corp . reported that they developed . . .\" becomes DEVELOP, with the actor filled in as \"LSI Logic Corp . \"","The second rule transforms the representation of a sentence such as \"The customer wa s Hampshire Instruments . \" Whenever the main predicate is EQUIV (our semantic representatio n of \"to be\"), and the subject (or actor) of this action is \"customer\", this rule converts th e representation to the predicate TRANSFER-TO-CUSTOMER, the recipient of which is th e complement (object) of \"to be\" . Together, these two rules transform the representation of a sentence like \"The customer is reported to be LSI Logic Corp\" to the predicate TRANSFER-TO-CUSTOMER, the recipient of which is \"LSI Logic Corp . \"","The postprocessor also merges representations from separate sentences into a single templat e when appropriate . After the transformation rules are run, the representations of two sentence s are merged together if they can unify. The resulting single representation is simply the resul t of the unification . If representations of sentences cannot be unified, then their representation s may produce separate templates in the response .

In it s most conservative setting, only partial parses whose semantic interpretations involved importan t actions (e .g ., DEVELOP, SELL, etc.) were used in postprocessing . The system could be mad e less conservative by expanding the types of partial parses that were used in tempalte generation . In its least conservative setting, even single words might be chosen as interesting partial parses , 30 1 resulting in the generation of a template . For example, the appearance of the word \"CVD \" could result in the generation of a LAYERING template with TYPE field CVD .","For the test run, we used the system in its least conservative setting . During development testing, we found that this setting resulted in approximately 50% improvement in recall rate s without adversely affecting precision . We believe that this reflects the English microelectronic s domain . Since the vocabulary used in articles in this domain consisted of a large number of technical terms not normally used in most English texts, the extraction of information base d on occurrence of these words without analysis of their surrounding context was a relatively saf e thing to do . In other domains, it is likely that the use of single-word partial parses would resul t in significant reduction in precision .","Our system's precision results did suffer from the fact that templates were sometimes produced that contained so little information that they could not be matched by the scorer t o answer key templates . These templates were counted by the scorer as spurious, reducing ou r precision score .

Due to lack of resources this year, the total developmen t time for the system totaled only about 6 person-months . This represents about 1/3 of the development time of our MUC-4 system .

For all the string fills, we added the string directly to the dictionary wit h the semantic type that was derived from the slot that it filled . Many of the set fills were als o added verbatim to the lexicon, since in this domain set fills were often technical terms (e .g . , CVD) . Other lexicon entries were simply created by either expanding the set-fill abbreviation s or abbreviating the full-text set-fills .","The other main training source came as a result of the tagger . Since the tagger made it possible to recognize proper names that were not in the lexicon by analyzing strings of capitalize d words, we used the tagged items to hypothesize new lexicon entries . This was only done fo r items that the tagger was sure of, like company names (strings that ended with \"Corp\", \"Co\" , \"Inc\", etc) and person names that started with \"Mrs\", \"Dr\", \"VP\", etc .

Our own experience indicated tha t the utilization of even partial parses of only a few words (or even a single word) improved ou r system's recall without damaging precision .
