SRA's NLP core system , SOLOMON, has been under development since 1986 . It has been used for a variety of domains, and wa s aimed from the start to be language-independent, domain-independent, and application-independent . Mor e recently, SOLOMON has been extended to be multilingual, beginning with Spanish in 1990 and Japanese i n 1991 . The Spanish-Japanese text understanding system that uses SOLOMON was developed for a dornai n very different from the MUC-5 joint venture domain (cf . Aone, et al . [2]) .","SOLOMON's principal applications have been in data extraction, but it is also used in a prototyp e machine translation system (cf. Aone and McKee [5]) . The domain areas in which SOLOMON application s have been developed are : financial, terrorism, medical, and the MUC-5 joint-venture domain . SRA has significantly enhanced its capability to add new domains and languages by developing new strategies fo r data acquisition using both statistical techniques and a variety of user-friendly tools ."]},{"title":"MUC-5 SYSTEM ARCHITECTUR E","paragraphs":["SOLOMON employs a modular, data-driven architecture to achieve its language- and domain-independence .
