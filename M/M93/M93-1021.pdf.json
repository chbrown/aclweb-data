First . in some cases the tagger did not make sufficiently fine-grained distinctions . A good example of this typ e of case is the lack of a class distinction between the definite article the and the indefinite article n, both o f which are assigned the tag DT . And second, in cases where the accuracy of a given tag was crucial, ofte n the tagger was not accurate enough . This latter type of problem has arisen in rules which depend on th e identification of possessive \"s\" tokens . Ll general, part-of-speech tagging did not play as significant a rol e as it was anticipated to, and given that it consumed 25% of the time required to process a message, wa s more trouble than it was worth in the MUC-5 task .","The company name parser used in CBAS was a major success . The parser, which is implemented in ( .' , is fast, taking on average about 4 seconds per text to do its job . The parser incorporates three procedures for detecting company names . First, it searches for known company names, looking for matches of toke n sequences against a company name database in Unix DBM format . The matches are not required to b e exact ; for example, trailing designators don 't need to match—all three of the following sequences woul d be matched against the \"Ford Motor \" entry in the DBM database : • Ford Motor Co. • Ford Motor Inc . • Ford Motor Ltd . When looking for matches, lowercase names are not recognized, and names preceded by the prepositio n \" in \" are not recognized, since so many company names are also the names of places . DBM databases are capable of containing large quantities of data—as many as a billion blocks . (Currently the company name database contains about 8 MB of entries .) Moreover, DBM databases can be accessed very quickly , making them especially attractive in a data extraction task . '","In addition to the search for word token sequences corresponding to known company names, the compan y name parser also searches for sequences of capitalized words . This procedure does not. attempt to detect . sequences which start at the beginning of a sentence, or to detect sequences in \"all caps\" text . Also , sequences of tokens which correspond to place names or months are not recognized as possible compan y names .","A third and final procedure used by the company name parser is to look for sequences of tokens whic h end in company designators . The basic strategy here is to first locate a company designator and then wor k backwards until the sequence meets one or more delimiting criteria, including the presence of a sentenc e boundary, a punctuation marker, a preposition, another company designator, or something in lower cas e (other than \"and\") .","The CBAS company name parser is a good example of the sort of processor which one wants to develo p in a data extraction system : the procedures it embodies are simple ; the facts it extracts have a consisten t level of reliability ; it relies minimally on other processors (just the text zoner) to perform its task ; i t performs its task quickly ; and finally, there are many domains for which the detection of company name s is required, and so it will be a useful preprocessor in many applications .","During the early stages of developing the MUC-5 version of CBAS, an effort was made to incorporate a n NLP parser as yet another sensor invoked during tokenization . Tomek Strzalkowski 's Tagged Text Parse r","3 Processing speed is not directly factored into the scores assigned to systems in MUC evaluations . However, it. is a critical issue in performing well on the evaluations, since a rapid rule development cycle is needed for development purposes a failure to consider the need for a rapid rule development cycle is one of the more common errors among less experience d participants in such efforts . Government sponsors have also begun to realize that a data extraction system which can process , say, 100 messages in 15 minutes is useful as an interactive analysis tool, which is a very desirable attribute . A few extractio n systems are capable of this level of performance—systems relying heavily on linguistic analysis techniques take much longer , in the neighborhood 8-10 hours. Typical extraction systems which do not rely heavily on linguistic analysis techniques require 2-5 hours (1-3 minutes per text) to process 100 messages, depending on the texts being processed . However, n o existing data extraction system is truly interactive in the sense that extraction queries can be formulated \"on the fly\" ; al l implementations of existing extraction architectures are custom-built to answer a single query . 251 MIT) was acquired for this purpose [4] . However, after the parser was integrated into the system, i t was determined that the structures returned by the parser did not preserve enough information about th e regions of actual text corresponding to recognized syntactic structures to be useful, and that to modif y the parser to return suitable output structures would not be possible, given the staffing resources availabl e for the Muc;-5 effort . .' Aside from the fundamental problem with output structures inappropriate for th e blue-5 task, the 'I'TP parser, despite its speed compared to other parsers examined, was nevertheless mor e than doubling the amount, of time required to process a text . Consequently, the effort to incorporate a n NLP parser into CBAS for the Muc-5 evaluation was abandoned . '","Unlike the situation in canonical NLP systems, the tokenization phase in the CBAS architecture involve s a great deal of processing . Indeed, in CBAS any processors incorporating linguistic analysis techniques are viewed as components of the tokenization phase . What counts as a \"primitive fact \" versus a \"derive d fact\" is a fairly arbitrary decision, and similarly what counts as a tokenization phase component versus a component of some higher-level processing phase is also arbitrary . However, the direction which is bein g taken in CBAS --pushing more and more analysis \"up front\" in the form of multiple, specialized, relativel y asynchronous processors—is one which other research groups are also finding to be advantageous .' We believe there is a trend underway in which NLP systems applied to information extraction tasks ar e beginning to look more and more like standard multisensor data fusion engines . Intensional Reasonin g","After the tokenization phase has generated a collection of primitive facts, \"higher-level \" processin g phases of the CBAS architecture are invoked to derive additional information . Two such phases exis t in the cu rrent. implementation of CBAS, and the first of these involves intensional reasoning, so-name d because the general idea at this stage is to detect possible events being referred to, along with thei r component objects and attributes, without firmly committing to their existence .","Both of the higher-level processing phases are realized as collections of forward-chaining rules . Th e decision to use forward-chaining as the default reasoning method was motivated by an overall desire il n CBAS to maintain as asynchronous a reasoning process as possible, imposing control only when necessary . CLIPS, a popular forward-chaining system, was used to implement the higher-level phases .' It is easy i n (.'LIPS to incorporate calls to external programs via C procedures, and this capability makes it possible to escape from the default forward-chaining reasoning method whenever it is desirable to engage in a differen t style of analysis . In CBAS, calls are made within CLIPS images to external UNIX DBM databases, whic h are used to store static knowledge (just like the company name parser stores relatively static knowledg e about known companies) . This use of DBM databases greatly reduces the size of internal CLIPS factbases without a penalty in access time .","A number of other Muc-5 systems have architectures similar to that of CBAS in that pattern-matchin g plays a key role in their reasoning phases .' However, CBAS is distinguished from these systems in that the pattern-matching process in CBAS is implemented using general-purpose expert system software wherea s the other systems rely on custom-built code, and in most cases the custom-built code involves the use o f","In MI fC evaluation tasks, there is a need to supply the actual text substrings corresponding to an analysis structur e when instantiating output data structures (templates), and it has been our experience that the representations generated b y some linguistic analysis components (of which TTP is just one example) do not provide a straightforward means of satisfyin g this requirement .","'̀ludependent of speed and the accessibility of data in the output structures generated by linguistic analysis components , another problem which may be lurking about is a highly inconsistent level of reliability : it could be that the accurac y of results are so unpredictable, that incorporating linguistic analysis results in the contexts of intensional and extensiona l reasoning is too much of a rule-writing burden to be manageable.","'Lisa Ran (GE) has expressed this view in discussions .","'CLIPS is a \"GO'l'S\" product developed and maintained at NASA's Johnson Space Center . Rule-based systems similar to ('LIPS have been used before to implement data extraction systems ; two well-known implementations of this sort are th e Carnegie Group's 'lext Categorization Shell [3] and the ADS Rubric system, which is a subcomponent of the Codex syste m evaluated at MtI('-3 [t] .","\"A distinction is being made here between pattern-matching and various forms of NLP-based syntactic analysis, including systems which don't make a strong attetnpt to derive full sentential parses . 252 a formalism which is less familiar to ordinary users than standard production rules .","A fundamental feature of the forward-chaining rules used in CBAS is that. the facts which the rule s infer are associated with specific regions of text in very much the same way that edges i ~~ a. parse r 's well - formed substring table are assigned to specific regions of an input string . However, unlike typical parsers , which contain an implicit constraint that adjacent constituents in a . rule must be realized by contiguou s strings of text in the input, all constraints in CBAS inference rules are explicitly encoded via attributes o f facts—contiguity is not assumed .","A brief digression is needed at this point to provide a basic understanding of the structure of a CLIPS forward-chaining rule . First, any forward-chaining system, CLIPS included, has two basic data types : facts and rules . Facts represent what is already known, and rules describe how to infer new facts, give n whatever facts currently exist . Forward-chaining rules have a \"left-hand side \" (LHS) and a \"right-han d side\" (RHS), which are delimited from each other by an arrow symbol, __> . The LHS of a rule consist s primarily of patterns that facts in the factbase might satisfy, and the RHS of a rule consists of actions t o be performed if all the expressions constituting the LHS of the rule do match existing facts, and of cours e a common action performed on the RHS of a rule is to assert new facts and/or to remove existing fact s which match the patterns on the rule's LHS . Pattern-matching never occurs on the RHS of a rule, onl y actions. In CLIPS, rules are defined using a defrule construct, which is fairly transparent in format .","It is easier to grasp the nature of a forward-chaining rule by looking at concrete examples . The followin g CBAS rule used in the intensional reasoning phase states that if a company name has been predicted by the company name parser, and if this company name consists of one word token whose part-of-speec h category is PP$, VB, RB, IN, or CC, then the predicted company name is not really describing a compan y object and should be eliminated from consideration . 9","(defrule delete-company-name-with-wrong-cat (declare (salience 400) ) (control-fact (phase corp) ) ?A <- (company-name (1 ?vl)(r ?v2) ) (txt_token (1 ?vl)(r ?v2)(cat \"PP$\"I\"VB\"I\"RB\"I\"IN\"I\"CC\") ) __ > (retract ?A) )","Note in this example how the \"1\" (left) and \" r\" (right) attributes, whose values are pointers to locations in the text, are used to capture the fact that the company-name \"concept \" and the word token span th e same region of text . Typically in forward-chaining formalisms an expression beginning with a questio n mark is a variable to be instantiated by a value in an actual fact in the factbase . Note that for the \"cat. \" attribute, alternative literal string values are provided—a given actual fact would need to have a valu e for its \"cat\" attribute which corresponds to one of the literal strings . The CLIPS facts used in CBAS are defined to be \"template \" structures, which means that the order in which attributes are specified i s irrelevant, and templates will match a pattern on the LHS of a rule even if the template has attributes no t specified in the pattern—the only requirement is that attributes explicitly mentioned in the pattern matc h the template . 10 Finally, the ?A <- notation is used to provide a way of pointing to the fact instantiatin g a given pattern on the LHS so that on the RHS the fact can be modified or deleted .","In the following rule, the 1(eft) and r(ight) attributes of txt_token facts are used to require two wor d tokens to be contiguous . This rule illustrates a rudimentary form of syntactic analysis in which words i n domain-specific classes are combined to infer constituent structures . Constraining the tokens to specifi c word classes is done by unifying the reg attributes of txt_token and word facts, where word facts encode the class information . In this particular case, the only words of type \"joint\" are joint, co-operative, an d new, and the only words of type \"venture\" are venture, project, plan, deal, firm, concern, and development . And the set of possible phrases recognized by this rule is the Cartesian product of these two word classes . 9 TreeBank part-of-speech labels are assigned by the tagger used in CBAS . 10 Do not confuse the use of the term \"template structure\" in CLIPS with the use of the same terns in MI JC applications- - i n the latter case, it refers to output structures which are intended to represent generalized data base records . 253","(defrule const-joint-venture (control-fact (phase const) ) (txt_token (p ?p)(s ?s)(l ?vl)(r ?v2)(cite ?tl)(reg ?rl) ) (word (type \"joint\")(reg ?rl) ) (txt_token (p ?p)(s ?s)(l ?v2)(r ?v3)(cite ?t2)(reg ?r2) ) (word (type \"venture\")(reg ?r2) ) == > (bind ?cid (gensym*) ) (bind ?new-r (format nil \"%s %s\" ?rl ?r2) ) (bind ?new-c (format nil \"is %s\" ?tl ?t2) ) (assert (const (cid ?cid)(type \"venture\")(p ?p)(s ?s)(l ?vl)(r ?v3)(reg ?new-r)(cite ?new-c))) )","Surely the above rule represents the sort of formalism that gives linguists nightmares—subconstituent s are domain-specific, not embodying any linguistic generalizations . 11 Nevertheless, such rules are muc h simpler to compose and maintain, despite their superficially complex appearance, than standard collection s of grammar rules for large-scale systems . Moreover, they are are much more robust—grammar rules are so interdependent that robustness is a chronic problem—and they are much faster to execute, simply becaus e they do not constitute an effort to reach a complete constituent analysis .","In the following forward-chaining rule a distinction is made between definite and indefinite reference s to joint ventures . In this case, explicit strings corresponding to definite and indefinite articles must b e accessed, since no part-of-speech distinction is available between definite and indefinite determiners .

However, the first word is required to be to the lef t of the second word . The negated pattern ensures that any words occurring between the first and secon d words must be adjectives or numeric expressions—ie, modifying expressions . The & : notation introduces \"in-line\" functional contraints on variables in patterns . It should be possible to hide a great deal of th e explicit encoding of constraints on location pointers by introducing a slightly higher-level formalism whic h expands to the explicit notation currently being used . The primary reason this has not already been don e is that while encoding the constraints may look complicated, it is actually a fairly straightforward task , and taking the time out to develop the higher-level formalism has not been justifiable .","A significant. feature of the above rule is the use on the right-hand side of the function get-region-string . This function invokes a remote C procedure which accesses Df3M databases . In this rule, the procedure is used to access regions of text both in their citation forms and in a regularized form (all lowercase) . The ability to compute arbitrary regions of text in this fashion greatly simplifies the writing of CBA S forward-chaining rules, since it bypasses the need to do explicit pattern-matches on the left-hand sid e ll 'lu be fair, it. has been our experience that \"industrial-strength \" grammars tend to be very domain-specific as well , requiring a high overhead for rule maintenance . 254 of the rule to determine the strings corresponding to word tokens, a particularly problematic situation , given that in this particular case, the distance between the deterutiner and the \" venture \" constituent i s arbitrary . This is a good example of when bypassing a default reasoning method is desirable .","Following standard practice in forward-chaining system development, the antecedent portions of CBA S forward-chaining rules include references to \"control fact \" statements (see the above rules for examples) . These control facts are asserted and retracted during the processing of a text to enable or disable portion s of the Rete network constructed out of the system 's factbase . 12 The use of control facts is dependent, o n the ability to set the salience of a given forward chaining rule . The salience of a rule determines its positio n on the agenda CLIPS maintains of all rules whose left-hand side patterns have been satisfied . Below, fo r example, is a rule which retracts a control fact of the form (control-fact (phase const)) and asserts a . fact of the form (control-fact (phase et)) . All rules whose LHS contains the pattern (control-fac t (phase const)) and which have a higher salience value than -500 will be activated before this rule ha s a chance to retract the fact, after which those rules will no longer be able to fire . 13 Each rule retracting a control fact generally asserts a new control fact in order to activate another portion of the Rete network .","(defrule const-phase-en d (declare (salience -500) ) ?f <- (control-fact (phase const) ) (retract ?f ) (assert (control-fact (phase et))) )","The rules which are associated with a given portion of a Rete network which is activated or deactivate d by a given control fact constitute a rule module . Three different types of rule modules arise in th e intensional reasoning phase :","• Modules which consist of rules for locating possible references to events . There is only one modul e of this sort in the MUC-5 implementation of CBAS, since only one type of event is of interest, bu t multiple modules of this sort could exist . (In the MUC-4 terrorist domain, for example, differen t types of terrorist acts needed to be distinguished . )","• Modules which consist of rules for inferring facts describing possible objects and attributes of events .

In the Muc-5 joint venture domain, this activity primarily involves reference resolution among compan y entities . The rules used to perform this task in CBAS are fairly primitive ; the following rule does most o f the work by insuring that if two company entities exist and one has a \"reg \" value which is a substring o f the other, then the \"cite\" and \"reg\" attribute values of the entity with the shorter reg value are made th e same as the longer cite and reg values . It also insures that both entities have the short cite value as a n \"alias\", which is a requirement in the Muc-5 task . 12A Rete network is a data structure commonly used to encode information in forward-chaining systems .

Based on testing of the company name parser, it is known that whenever th e metric it assigns to a possible name is less than 1 .0, the likelihood that an actual company name is presen t is relatively low, and consequently, any possible company names with less than 1 .0 likelihood are throw n out, . This heuristic generally works very well (as a heuristic should), but in this example a company nam e is excluded that it would have been better to keep : BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO . And because of this error, CBAS misses the identification of one of the parents of the detected joint venture . The heuristi c also fails to rule out TRADING HOUSE as a plausible company name and consequently it is incorrectl y inferred to he a reference to a parent company . The other two parents in the joint venture, UNION PRECISION CASTING CO . and TAGA CO ., are correctly identified .","Rules for determining the roles played by companies typically involve the detection of a company nam e in a syntactic context within which a relationship of a certain type is likely to be mentioned . For example , definite references to joint ventures followed by a comma followed by a company name typically signa l that the company name denotes a company in a child role . It is for this reason that BRIDGESTONE SPOR'T'S TAIWAN CO . in the context THE JOINT VENTURE, BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWA N CO . is inferred to be referring to a child ."]},{"title":"Extensional Reasonin g","paragraphs":["'I'he extensional reasoning phase is implemented as a completely separate CLIPS process .

We do not, believe that we have fully exploited the capabilities of non-linguist i s data extraction methods and intend to continue exploring such techniques, especially special-purpos e parsers . However, at the same time, we do believe that linguistic analysis techniques will ultimately h e essential in data extraction applications, and our research group is actively engaged in the developmen t of new linguistically-based methodologies which meet the portability, reliability, accuracy, and spee d requirements of large-scale systems .","Another motivating factor has been the desire to build a relatively inexpensive system which individual s with no training whatsoever in linguistics could develop and maintain . The current implementation o f CBAS certainly demonstrates that we have been successful in meeting this goal : the primary implementation media, Perl and CLIPS, are available at little or no cost ; and we have made successful use of rul e developers with little or no experience in linguistic analysis .","Finally, the most significant factor in the design of CBAS has been a desire to exploit. multiple preprocessors in the same way that multiple sensors are exploited in multisensor data fusion engines . The basi c idea behind this design concept is simple : by having many different processors contributing information , the failure of any one processor will not result in a lot of information being lost . Thus, instead of having a single NLP parser from which all information regarding constituent structure is derived, multipl e specialized parsers are implemented, parsers for recognizing company names, dates, names of individuals , place names, and so forth . In this type of situation, different parsers may contribute \"competing information\" . For example, a company name parser may determine that a given substring denotes the name of a company whereas a place name parser may determine that the sane substring denotes the name of a city .","We have not yet actually proven the merit of the \"multisensor \" approach : there is no \"sensor management\" capability in existing CBAS implementations to compensate for preprocessor failure, nor is there an y methodology in place for managing competing processor output . We of course intend to pursue the goal o f proving the utility of this approach in future evaluation efforts with more sophisticated implementations o f the CBAS architecture. In future implementations we are particularly interested in the possibility that a multisensor approach will provide a natural framework for the development of interactive data extractio n systems in which the multiple preprocessors extract \"basic\" objects and relations (ie, an ontology) from which composite structures are derived in response to user extraction queries (which are constrained b y the ontology and a set of composition rules defined over it) ."]},{"title":"REFERENCE S","paragraphs":["[1] Laura Blumer Balcom and Richard M .
