Soderland Department of Computer Science University of Massachusett s Amherst, MA 01003 lehnert@cs.umass .edu INTRODUCTIO N","paragraphs":["The UMass/MUC-4 system is based on a form of sentence analysis known as selective concept extraction . This approach to language processing is distinguished by a minimal reliance on syntactic sentenc e analysis, along with a minimal dictionary customized to operate in a limited domain . Last year, the UMass/MUC-3 system demonstrated the viability of selective concept extraction, but serious questions were raised about th e portability and scalability of the technology, particularly with respect to the creation of domain-dependent and taskdependent dictionaries . We estimated that 9 person/months went into the creation of the dictionary used by UMass/MUC-3, and we were unable to say how much domain-dependent lexicon was still missing . We were nevertheless sure that our dictionary coverage was incomplete .","This year we confronted the issue of efficient system development, with particular attention to the problem o f dictionary construction . As a result, we are now in a position to claim that effective customized dictionaries can b e constructed quickly and easily by relatively inexperienced system developers . The dictionary used by UMass/MUC- 3 emerged after roughly 1500 hours of highly skilled labor by two advanced graduate students and one post doc . For MUC-4, we created a new dictionary that achieved nearly the full functionality of the UMass/MUC-3 dictionary after only 8 hours of effort on the part of a first-year graduate student . This outcome was achieved through the use of an automated dictionary construction tool called AutoSlog . The AutoSlog dictionary was used for our optional TST 3 and TST4 runs, while a modified version of our UMass/MUC-3 dictionary was used for our official TST3 and TST4 runs. Our optional and official systems were identically configured except for their dictionaries .","Our official UMass/MUC-4 system employs a new memory-based consolidation module for discours e analysis, some generic enhancements to the CIRCUS sentence analyzer, and filters that operate after sentenc e analysis and then again after consolidation in order to reduce spurious slot fills and spurious templates. We also made a number of adjustments associated with MUC-4 template updates and domain specifications . We found it necessary to eliminate last year's optional case-based consolidation module because of its strong tendency towar d overgeneration . Even so, we had two competing consolidation modules to evaluate, as well as a variety of possibl e filters . To resolve all of these other system options, we ran hundreds of tests over TST1, TST2 and 250 additiona l texts from the development corpus."]},{"title":"OFFICIAL TESTING AND RESULT S","paragraphs":["We ran four test sets for MUC-4 . Our official system was run on TST3 and TST4 as required, and we ran on e additional optional system on TST3 and TST4 . The official system and optional system were identical except fo r their dictionaries . The optional system ran a dictionary constructed by AutoSlog that contained 379 concept nod e definitions. Our official system ran with a version of the UMass/MUC-3 dictionary augmented by 76 additiona l concept node defmitions imported from the AutoSlog dictionary (for a total of 389 concept node definitions) . Both dictionaries accessed the same 5436 lexical definitions for part-of-speech recognition (these definitions were taken from the UMass/MUC-3 dictionary), along with 2102 proper names . We predicted that both systems would produc e comparable levels of precision, and that the optional system would fall behind the official system by 10 recall point s under All Templates . Table 1 contains the All Templates scores for all four test runs .","Our official and optional systems both crashed twice on TST3, once on a relevant text containing three key templates and once again on an irrelevant text . No system crashes occurred during TST4 . We note that the official system was run on all of DEV, TST1, and TST2 without any fatal errors shortly before the official testing began . 151 As predicted, the AutoSlog dictionary produced lower recall levels than the official system : 7 points lower for TST3 , and 12 points lower for TST4. Precision was comparable for both systems with AutoSlog generating higher overall precision rates : 2 points higher for TST3 and 1 point higher for TST4 . We note that our performance on TST4 wa s generally worse than TST3. However, a close inspection of the detailed score reports for the official system show s that the primary difference in those reports lies in the All Templates precision scores : 57 for TST3 vs. 45 for TST4 . This loss of precision can be explained for the most part by comparing the number of spurious templates : 16 for TST3 vs. 31 for TST4 .

Comparing P&R scores, our AutoSlog dictionary achieved 93% of the overall performance of our official system on TST3, and 87% of the official system' s performance on TST4. In an effort to leverage the UMass/MUC-3 and the AutoSlog dictionaries, we strengthened the performance of the MUC-3 dictionary by augmenting it with 76 AutoSlog defrnitions . t Without this boost to the MUC-3 dictionary, the distance between our official and optional systems would have been insignificant.","Given our MUC-4 test results, we have demonstrated that an effective domain-dependent dictionary can be efficiently constructed using a representative text corpus accompanied by hand-coded template encodings. Our preliminary and very limited efforts have produced a dictionary that closely mirrors the functionality obtained by a relatively successful hand-crafted dictionary. Although the process of dictionary construction via AutoSlog is not totally automated, the manual labor needed can be completed in a matter of hours by a single individual with minimal expertise in dictionary construction . We consider this to be a significant step forward in the area o f automated dictionary construction for text extraction applications ."]},{"title":"AUTOMATED DICTIONARY CONSTRUCTIO N","paragraphs":["The AutoSlog construction tool analyzes available key templates in conjunction with source texts and generates hypothesized CIRCUS definitions without human assistance . AutoSlog's proposed concept nod e definitions are derived from sentences in the MUC-4 development corpus that contain string fills associated with key templates . Using the complete 1300-text DEV corpus as the training set for our dictionary construction experiment , AutoSlog proposed 1356 concept node definitions in response to 1272 string-fill slots. Although a large number of these definitions were flawed or redundant, 28% of AutoS log's proposed definitions were reasonable and could be included in an operational dictionary without alteration . In our experiment, 375 of the 1356 definitions proposed by AutoSlog were deemed acceptable when reviewed by visual inspection .","Each AutoSlog definition begins with a single string fill in a single key template . Given a specific slot , AutoSlog extracts the first non-empty string fill listed in the key template (string-fill slots often contain multipl e strings based on multiple references within the source text) . It then searches the source text for the first instance of that exact string within the source text . Once located, AutoSlog pulls the complete sentence containing that strin g from the source text and passes it to the CIRCUS sentence analyzer for syntactic analysis . CIRCUS analyzes th e sentence using a part-of-speech dictionary . When all goes well, a set of buffers are instantiated with simple syntacti c constituents corresponding to a subject, a verb, and possibly an object or a prepositional phrase . When the original string fill shows up in one of these buffers, AutoSlog hypothesizes a concept node definition complete with a lexica l trigger, complement pattern, and slot constraints . This definition is then written to a file and AutoSlog returns to th e key template for the next siring fill slot . Figure 1 shows the AutoS log construction tool in action . t Other methods of leveraging the two dictionaries were tested, but this was the most effective strategy . 15 2 Key Template sentenc e string fil l 5436 tagge d words"]},{"title":"1","paragraphs":["*Do * _ (__ ) *PP * _ ( ...

In fact, the more string-fil l slots, the better. The MUC-4 templates contained six string-fill slots used by AutoSlog : inc-instr-id, perp-ind-id, perp-org-id, phys-tgt-id, hum-tgt-name, and hum-tgt-desc . After processing the 1300 texts of DEV, AutoSlo g generated 136 definitions based on inc-instr-id, 316 definitions from perp-ind-id, 201 definitions from perp-org-id , 306 definitions from phys-tgt-id, 193 definitions from hum-tgt-name, and 204 definitions from hum-tgt-desc . Thi s dictionary was compiled in 14 hours and then passed to a CIRCUS programmer for manual review. During the review process, each definition was dispatched into one of two possible states : (1) keep as is, or (2) save for possible revision . Files were maintained for the \"keeps\" and the \"edits\" with the expectation that the keep-definitions migh t be augmented by some number of edit-definitions if any of the edit definitions could be salvaged . The initial categorization into \"keeps\" and \"edits\" was relatively fast because each definition could be categorized on the basis o f visual inspection alone . Many definitions destined for the edit files were easy to spot since they often resulted fro m parsing errors, patterns of no linguistic generality, or patterns of dubious reliability .

AutoSlog does not produce multiple copies of the same definition . By tracking the number of duplicates AutoSlog suppresses, we can see evidence that the dictionary is approaching a saturation point. In particular, we note that after AutoSlog has processed 1200 texts, the next 100 texts generat e only half as many definitions as the first 100 texts. Figure 2 shows the weakening frequency of new dictionar y definitions as we move through the development corpus .","Although the AutoSlog dictionary definitions are derived from only six template slots, consolidation and template-generation routines are capable of extracting the information needed to fill additional slots. When the AutoSlog dictionary operates in conjunction with the full system, we can fill every template slot except phys-tgtnation, phys-tgt-effect, phys-tgt-total-num, and hum-tgt-total-num .","The 8-hour AutoSlog dictionary was completed only four weeks before the final testing for MUC-4 . Now tha t we have seen how much impact AutoSlog can have on the process of dictionary construction, it makes sense to pursue enhancements to AutoSlog in order to strengthen its baseline performance . As it stands, AutoSlog can be moved to new domains with a minimal amount of software tuning . Adjustments must be made to handle a ne w template design, but any templates that contain string-fills will serve to fuel dictionary construction .

For TST3, CIRCUS extracted 943 string fills to fill variabl e slots in enabled concept nodes. Because there are a lot of redundant concept node definitions, almost half of these string fills were duplicates, leaving 520 unique string fills extracted by CIRCUS . According to our analysis, 214 of these string fills were discarded during consolidation and 306 string fills made it into a response template.","Of the 520 non-redundant string-fills, 38% were correctly incorporated into a response template where the y matched the string or strings listed in a key template .

This tells us that we did not tend to lose otherwise legitimate templates because of their incident types in TST3, whereas a significant number of legitimat e templates were lost for this reason in TST4 . Precision is most dramatically affected by these errors, but P&R may have lost at least 2 points because of this problem (it is not possible to extrapolate from batch scores to interactive scores with complete certainty) .","Second, a large number of spurious templates were created when military targets were not recognized to b e military in nature .
