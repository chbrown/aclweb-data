The TTS-MUC4 system is our second full-scale prototype . I t is an adaptation of the TTS-MUC3 system [1] [2], which constituted our first-full scale text skimming prototype .","TTS-MUC3 utilized a previously-constructed text database facility and pattern matcher used for shallo w parsing. Its modular process model integrated the results of case memory retrieval over sentences from multipl e stories, extracting the date and location of incidents, and computing cross-reference information for various slots . One calendar month and approximately three (3) person months were spent developing TTS for MUC-3 .","TTS-MUC3 demonstrated that a pattern classification approach was promising for performing tex t skimming . TTS-MUC4 is similar to TTS-MUC3, with a few minor changes . First, the K-Nearest Neighbo r classifier used in TTS-MUC3 was replaced in TTS-MUC4 with a Bayesian Classifier which actually includes specialized classifiers for each slot . Therefore, for : INCIDENT-TYPE the set of features present in an entire sentence were used as features, but for :HUM-TGT-NAME the features just before and after a candidate were used . Secondly, in the new prototype, code was added to extract information to fill the new and revised slots of the MUC- 4 templates . Thirdly, additional filters were developed to improve the precision of the values of the template fillers . Like our rust prototype, TTS-MUC4 incorporates semi-automated lexicon generation and almost fully automate d phrase pattern generation . Two calendar months and approximately 2.5 person months were spent on enhancing th e TTS-MUC3 system to create TTS-MUC4 .","As with TTS-MUC3, all the modules in TTS-MUC4 are domain independent. All the modules except the date and location extraction modules are trained prior to skimming . In addition, the location extraction modul e requires a location database, including the specification of which locations are contained within others .","The goal of the TTS project is to develop a text skimmer that can be used in a variety of applications . B y relying on statistical information processing and keeping the amount of domain-dependent information to a minimum, it is hoped that this system can be easily ported to a variety of tasks, such as analysis of finance-relate d wire-service stories."]},{"title":"THE TTS APPROAC H","paragraphs":["There are two aspects of TTS . The first is system training, or the process of deriving or identifying th e phrases which are used in the training corpus . The second is text skimming, or the process of skimming a tex t with the purpose of identifying whether the text falls into a specific category, and if so, extracting particular pieces of information from the text . Figure 1 illustrates the key components of both aspects of Hughes Trainable Tex t Skimmer. The training involves deriving the set of phrases used to generate the templates associated with a particular corpus of texts, and the generation of training features which map features to the actual text in the stories . The text skimming involves the Text Database, databases containing derived phrases and training features, a Phrasa l Parser, the Classifier, and a Feature-to-Template Process Model. 189 Figure 1 : A block diagram of Hughes Trainable Text Skimmer."]},{"title":"TTS Module Description s","paragraphs":["The training processor uses the provided templates to derive the phrase lexicon and build the features used by the pattern classifier. Phrases are generated from the fillers for the template slots. Features are generated from the sentences that provided the fillers . The word lexicon is generated by performing a word frequency analysi s on the raw text. In TTS-MUC4, all words that occur between 10 and 105 times are included in the lexicon .","The text database contains: (1) the database of training stories, (2) the database of testing stories, (3) the database of training templates for user browsing, and (4) the database of parsed templates for use during training . It supports retrieval of a single fragment of text from a large collection of texts that may be spread over multiple dis k files.

In the third case, an s-expression representing a parsed template can be retrieved for further use by the pattern classifier .","The phrasal parser is a fast, shallow, conceptual parser . The parser accepts a token structure, a lexica l hierarchy, and a phrase-pattern set . The parser returns an ordered list of text features . A text feature includes: (1) a member of the concept hierarchy, (2) the string covered by the phrase, and (3) a recursive token structure spanning the tokens covered by the phrase . Lexicon entries are created by adding word stems to a concept hierarchy as follows , (ks :isa h-lex \"PRIEST\" :religious-individual-w ) (ks :isa h-lex \"MISSIONARY\" :religious-individual-w ) (ks :isa h-lex \"CONFERENCE\" :conference-w ) (ks :isa h-lex \"SUMMIT\" :conference-w ) (ks :isa h-lex \"RECEPTION\" :conference-w)","Phrasal pattern definitions have three parts : the discrimination net to which the pattern belongs, a list of th e pattern components, and the pattern descriptor . Phrasal patterns may reference either elements of the concep t hierarchy, or specific words . Pattern definitions have the syntax illustrated in the following examples :","(ph :defpattern (net ? h-con ) ( :determiner :small-number :unidentified-w :human-group-w ) :civilian )","(ph :defpattern (net ? h-con ) ( :civilian-w \"FROM\" :number-w :spanish-name-w \"AREA\" ) :civilian )","(ph :defpattern (net ? h-con ) ( :public-w :communication-device-w :building-w ) :communications )","The features are extracted using a depth first search of the patterns, with a preference for patterns that have specific words over those which have only concept names, as well as a preference for longer patterns .","The pattern classifier actually consists of a separate pattern classifier for each template slot to be filled.

The second phase consists of determining which topics are relevant, and eliminating from furthe r consideration the sentences having no bearing on the chosen topics.

The weigh t for each type of incident is computed for every sentence . The weights are then passed through a competitive filter , resulting in binary signals. The competitive filter first normalizes the topic weights using a Gaussian mask on a sentence by sentence basis, then computes the best topic. A topic is a set of contiguous sentences with the sam e computed value for INCIDENT: TYPE .","Figure 2 shows the inputs and outputs to the topic grouping process . Note that moderately high evidenc e of kidnapping throughout the story is suppressed in favor of the bombing interpretation, which turns out to b e correct. This filter used is topic grouping is designed to pick out signals that are high but that \"drop out\" from time to time, as one can see in the smoothing over the arson signal .

The first three parts consider only relevant sentences. A relevant sentenc e shares the same topic with the previous sentence or contains no competing topic . There are two distinct types of processing for slot filling. Two slots, date and location, are filled by domain specific procedures. The remaining slots are filled using hypotheses returned by the pattern classifier. The slots are filled from the pattern classifier fall into three categories:","1. Set fills—Pure set fills are computed by averaging the weights over all sentences fo r","a given topic, and picking the highest score .","2. String fills—String fills are computed in a similar manner to set fills. They differ in that the suggestions returned by the classifier are subject to a threshold on th e weights. For the official run of TTS-MUC4 the string fill threshold was set at 0 .75 .","3. Cross reference generation—Cross reference generation is performed by choosing th e most likely tag (as suggested by the classifier) for the sentence that contains th e string fill .","For date extraction, all sentences within a topic are scanned for absolute or relative date references. Absolute date references are combined into a range . Absolute dates are preferred over relative dates within a give n sentence. Relative date references are interpreted with respect to either the current date specification for a story (if on e has been found) or the story date line. 192","For location extraction, all sentences within a topic are scanned for known location names .
