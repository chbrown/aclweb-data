Prior to MUC-4, LINK ha d been used to extract information from free-form texts in two narrow application domains . One application corpus contained terse descriptions of symptoms displayed by malfunctioning automobiles, and the repairs which fixed them . The other corpus described sequences of activities to be performed on an assembly line . In empirical testing in these two domains, LINK correctly processed 70% of previously unseen descriptions . A template was counted as correct only if all of the fillers in the template were filled correctly . In addition, LINK generated incomplete (but not incorrect) templates for another 15% of the descriptions .","These previous domains were much narrower than the MUC-4 terrorism domain . As a comparison, the lexicons for the previous domains contained only 300-500 words, compared wit h 6700 words in our MUC-4 test configuration . Previous grammar size ranged from 75-100 rules , compared with over 500 rules in the MUC-4 knowledge base . In addition, the previous application domains consisted only of single-sentence inputs . Thus, the integration of information from multiple sentences was not an issue in our previous work ."]},{"title":"Flow of contro l","paragraphs":["The MUC-4 LINK system consists of the modules shown in figure 1 .

Since LINK is a bottom-up chart parser, this means that the preprocessor must initialize the chart . The initialization is constructed by looking up each word in the sentence , and adding a link into the chart corresponding to each possible sense of a word . In addition , likely noun phrases are identified and grouped together, and NP links are entered into the char t for these groups of words .","Noun phrases are preidentified for two reasons . First, undefined words often appear as part s of noun phrases . The grouping of these unidentified words eliminates the need to deal with the m in the parser itself . Second, preprocessing noun phrases enabled us to encode parsing heuristic s in the preprocessor which could not easily be encoded in the parser itself, such as preferring th e longest possible noun phrase . This improves the efficiency of the system .","Each link in the initial chart contains both syntactic and semantic information about a word or noun phrase . For a single word, this semantic information is simply copied from th e definition of the word . For noun phrases, semantic information on a link is the result of unifying, or merging together, semantic information from all of the defined words in the noun phrase . Adjacent nouns whose definitions cannot unify are not grouped together into a single noun phrase by the preprocessor . For example, \"government headquarters\" is not initially grouped as 290 a single NP, since the meanings of \"government\" and \"headquarters\" cannot be unified . Thus , it might be more accurate to say that the preprocessor identifies \"noun clusters \" rather than noun phrases .","If all of the words of an NP are undefined, then a default semantic definition is assigned . For the test configuration of the system, the default definition was HUMAN-OR-PLACE, a definition which could be refined during processing to be any of the set fills for the HUM TGT , PHYS TGT, or LOCATION fields .","The preprocessor is also responsible for identifying names of people . A list of names that appeared in the HUM TGT : NAME fields of the MUC-3 development answer keys is used to identify names, along with a few simple heuristics for identifying likely additional names . Fo r example, any undefined word ending in a z̀ ' is considered a potential name .","Here are the results produced by the preprocessor for the first sentence in article TST2 - MUC4-0048 . The initial chart is displayed, with potential noun phrases already grouped together :","Next sentence (1) : SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNE D","THE TERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AND","ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF THE CRIME","Preprocessor results : Node 0 : (SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ) Node 1 : CONDEMNED Node 2 : (THE TERRORIST) Node 3 : (KILLING) KILLIN G Node 4 : O F Node 5 : ((ATTORNEY GENERAL) ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO ) Node 6 : AND Node 7 : ACCUSE D Node 8 : (THE (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) ) Node 9 : O F Node 10 : (THE CRIME ) Node 11 :"]},{"title":"The LINK parse r","paragraphs":["LINK is a bottom-up, unification-based chart parser . Its grammar rules are quite similar i n form to those used in PATR-II (Shieber, 1986) . We have incorporated semantic information int o LINK's grammar, along the lines of HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987) . The integration of syntacti c and semantic knowledge into the same grammar formalism is crucial to our system's ability t o process large texts in a reasonable length of time, and to producing the semantic analysis use d to generate templates .","Here is a simplified example of a constraint rule : 291","(define-class S (1) = NP <1 > (2) = VP <2> (head) = (2 head) <3 > (head agr) = (1 head agr) <4> (head rep actor) = (1 head rep)) <5>","Each equation in this rule specifies a property which . any node labeled S must have . A property consists of a path, or a sequence of arcs with the appropriate labels starting fro m the node in question ; and a value, which is another node to be found at the end of the path . Equations specify the values of properties in one of two ways . They may specify the label of th e node to be found at the end of the path, as in equations 1 and 2 (i .e ., the arc from an S nod e labeled 1 leads to a node labeled NP) . We will call these labeling equations. Or, they may specify that two paths must lead to the identical node, as in equations 3-5 . Identity here is defined by the unification operation ; i .e, if two paths must lead to the identical node, then the nodes a t the end of the two paths must unify. Unification merges the properties of two nodes ; thus, two paths can unify if their values have no properties which explicitly contradict each other . Thes e equations will be called unifying equations.","Links are placed in the chart to represent potential constituents that the parser identifies . These links contain both syntactic and semantic information, represented in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) . The DAGs correspond to the information in the set of gramma r rules used to build a constituent .","The core of the grammar is a set of domain-independent rules that handle all regular ver b tenses, and many of the simple english constructions . The rules encode both syntactic an d semantic constraints, which allows much of the work of finding the actor, object, location, etc . to be done during the parse .","The core is augmented by a set of rules that handle common constructions from the 130 0 MUC-3 development articles . Typical examples of this are \"Meanwhile, [sentence] .\" or \" . . .an attack on [place] . . .\", and are handled in as general a rule as possible provided the correct semantics may be given the parent based on the semantics of the children . An example of a grammar rule for a specific type of construction is shown below .","(define-class S ((1) = PRO N (2) = VP2-PAS S (3) = THA T (4) = S (1 1) = it (2 head rep) = stran s (head) = (2 head ) (head rep object) = (4 head rep)) ) This rule handles all constructions of the form \"It has been said that [sentence]\" or \"It wa s reported by the government today that [sentence],\" etc . Although the preprocessor is responsible for finding simple noun phrases, the correct interpretation of complex NPs relies on semantics and is handled by a set of grammar rules for NPs . 29 2 INJURE DESTROY SHOOT AMBUSH ATTACK (ACTOR) = HUMAN-OR-ORG (OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-PLACE TERRORIST-ACT KIDNAPPING (OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-OFFICIAL ROBBERY HIJACKING MURDER (OBJECT) = HUMAN-OR-OFFICIAL ARSON Figure 2 : The ATTACK subtree of the concept hierarchy of actions for the terrorism domai n These include past particples used as adjectives (e .g ., \"the kidnapped priests\") ; noun phrase complements (e .g ., \"Noriega, the president of Panama\") and some noun-noun construction s (e .g ., \"government headquarters\" or \"FMLN terrorists\") .","If a sentence fails to parse completely, the chart can be inspected to see what constituent s have been constructed, and what their semantic content is . Thus, after a failed parse, the system examined the chart, identifying those links which contained information relevant to the construction of templates . Links which contained the most relevant information (i .e ., th e greatest number of slots filled which could map to template fields) were selected and passed t o the postprocessor for incorporation into templates .","An example parse of sentence 1 from article TST2-MUC4-0048 is shown below .","((SENTENCE 1) \"actionl \" ((ACTION-DESC (SEM-REF MURDER) ) (ACTOR (SEM-REF TERRORIST) (ACT-WORD (TERRORIST)) ) (OBJECT (SEM-REF GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL) (ACT-WORD (ATTORNEY GENERAL) ) (NAME (ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO)))) )"]},{"title":"The Inheritance Hierarchy","paragraphs":["The LINK parser utilizes semantic/domain knowledge during processing . This information is organized in an inheritance hierarchy. Figure 2 presents the actions from the hierarchy used i n the MUC-4 domain, along with constraints on fillers of slots for actions . Slot-filling constraints on a concept may either be defined for that concept or inherited from the concept's ancestor s in the tree . For example, since ATTACK requires an OBJECT that is a HUMAN-OR-PLACE , this restriction also implicitly holds for actions like SHOOT and ROBBERY . KIDNAPPIN G is an example of a concept which makes a further restriction on a previously constrained slot . HUMAN-OR-OFFICIAL, the OBJECT of this action, must be a descendant of HUMAN-OR-PLACE . 293"]},{"title":"The Postprocesso r","paragraphs":["The postprocessor receives semantic representations from the LINK parser for each sentenc e in an article, and is responsible for producing response templates .
