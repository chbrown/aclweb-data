This collection of slots is logically connected due to their implicit reference to one particular filler . In addition, objects may be nested so that one object contains another object, or may be recursive, with one object pointing t o another and back again . Finally, there may be multiple instances of any given object .","In MUC-4 is is possible to isolate three distinct levels of objects . The first level contains a STORY object . Attached to a STORY object are INCIDENT objects, each of which contains participant objects ; TARGET , INSTRUMENT and PERPETRATOR. The Figure 1 illustrates an object-oriented template design .","The MUC template design has been moving from a flat structure to a more object-oriented structur e with cross-references tying together multiple slots into what has been termed a \"pseudo-object\" . Slots tie d together with cross-references are pseudo-objects and not true objects because the cross-references are no t enforced . For example, consider the following scenario depicted in Figure 2 . Although the human target (\"MARY\") is wrong, the system is allowed partial credit for the other slots, even though they are clearl y cross-referenced to different, and equal incorrect, fills ."]},{"title":"MOTIVATIO N","paragraphs":["There are a variety of reasons why an object-oriented design is desirable . First, an object-oriented desig n is conceptually easier to understand . Instead of a flat listing of all slots of a template, slots pertaining to a single fill are grouped together . Cross-references are no longer needed, as indentation indicates the grouping , so the visual design is cleaner .","Asthetics aside, there are additional performance data that can be obtained when groups of slots ar e connected as objects . Systems can be scored on how well a given object aligns, in a way analogous t o template matching alignment scores (template ID score) . Moreover, it is possible to construct an object total that does not consider whether any given object appears in a matching template or not . For exampl e in our system, we found that data such as a human target was correctly extracted by the program with all it s associated fields, but was put in the wrong template . This resulted in missing and spurious points for all th e 78"]},{"title":"Story slot: incident Inciden t slot: date slot: locatio n slot: typ e slot: stage slot: inst id slot: inst typ e slot: perp id slot: perp org slot: INSTRUMENT \\t slot: perp con f slot: category slot: phys tgt id slot: PERPETRATOR slot: TARGE T slot:hum tot nu m slot: phys tot num slot: phys tgt typ e slot: phys tgt number slot: phys tgt for na t slot: phys tgt effect slot: hum tgt name slot: hum tgt desc slot: hum tgt typ e slot: hum number slot: hum for nat slot: hum tgt effec t","paragraphs":["Figure 1 : Object-oriented MUC-4 Template Desig n fields in the object, although it could be argued that all that was incorrect was the association of the objec t with an incorrect incident .

This process was aided by the existing cross-references, but was complicated by a variety of special cases we encountered. These special cases fell into two general categories; system glitches, and problems with the MUC-4 template format. The first three problems described below are system glitches; the last three are issues in the design of the templates. 1. Inconsistent cross-references: We encountered inconsistent cross-reference strings.

Violation of Template Filling Rules: Some sites cross-referenced the perpetrator confidence to a null value, or to the PERP ID slot for example. 3. Multiple Set Fills: We encountered fills such as NO INJURY NO DEATH INJURY DEATH.","4. Inconsistent treatments: The treatment of repeated fills, as could be required in sentences such as \"KILLED 3 PEOPLE AND INJURED 2 a was handled in different ways, with PEOPLE repeated as a fill, or with two EFFECTS cross-referenced to one fill."]},{"title":".","paragraphs":["When an EFFECT has a blank value, its scoping is ambiguous.

Object-oriented design is a more intuitive method of representin g information that is related . Moreover, objects can be aligned, allowing for object-level scoring . This increase s the usefulness of an automated scoring program to perform selective diagnosis for performance evaluation . Also, object-oriented alignment allows for the scoring of objects that match even when they are placed i n an incorrect template .
