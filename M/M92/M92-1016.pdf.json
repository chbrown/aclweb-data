Using CLIPS as a forward-chaining engine is desirable because it runs on a wide range of machine s (including Sun Sparc stations, Apple Mac IIs, and PCs), it is available at little or no cost from th e government, it is fast, and it comes with good documentation and support services. The Paramax MUC-4 development team consisted of one Paramax staff member and one governmen t employee on sabbatical at Paramax . The data extraction module was designed and implemented in les s than two months, using less than four person-months of labor . Developing inference rules for the system did not require any linguistic expertise or any detailed knowledge of CLIPS—neither of the developer s had any prior experience using CLIPS . All that was required was knowledge of the domain and the dat a extraction task to be performed . TEST RESULT S The Paramax MUC-4 system's ALL TEMPLATES score summaries for the TST3 and TST4 test set s are listed below . The Paramax system generated more spurious responses in each of the two tests than any other system : the average number of TST3 spurious responses for all systems participating in MUC- 4 was 883 and the average number of TST4 spurious responses was 867 ; the Paramax system generated 2207 and 2240 spurious responses, respectively.","paragraphs":["TEST POS ACT COR PAR INC ICR IPA SPU MIS NON REC PRE OV G TST3 1693 3264 TST4 1253 3148 607 \\t 225 \\t 22 5 529 \\t 184 \\t 195 14 154 2207 636 2224 2 117 2240 345 2050 42 \\t 22 \\t 6 8 50 \\t 20 \\t 71"]},{"title":"Since the Paramax MUC-4 implementation is substantially different from the Paramax MUC-3 submission, the two systems are difficult to compare .","paragraphs":["2"]},{"title":"The rules developed for the MUC-4 system were initiall y based on rules developed for the MUC-3 system, but the MUC-3 and MUC-4 rule formalisms are significantly different in structure and functionality .

However, analyses of statistical significance were performed among F scores across system s participating in MUC-4 . The results of these analyses indicate that for the P&R F measure (in whic h precision and recall are given equal weight), there was no significant difference in performance between th e Paramax system and the system submitted by SRA . Similarly, on the 2P&R F measure (in which precisio n is given more weight), there was no significant difference in performance between the Paramax system an d the systems submitted for evaluation by McDonnell-Douglas (MDC) and New Mexico-Brandeis (NM-BR) . Finally, on the P&2R F measure (in which recall is given more weight), there was no significant differenc e in performance between the Paramax system and the system submitted by BBN . Appendix G provide s additional information on F scores and how the analyses of statistical significance were performed . ANALYSIS The Paramax MUC-4 implementation satisfied the key goal of its developers : a fast rule development cycle . The Paramax MUC-3 system was implemented using a forward-chaining engine called Pfc, whic h is written in Prolog . Although the Pfc rule formalism has a number of interesting properties, includin g in particular a mechanism for easily escaping to Prolog in order to use Prolog's built-in factbase and t o reason in a backward-chaining fashion, the system as a whole was inefficient . Processing a standard test set of 100 messages using the MUC-3 implementation required 40 hours of processing time running on three separate Sun workstations. In contrast, the Paramax MUC-4 system implemented in CLIPS ca n process 100 messages in just 31. hours on one Sun workstation . This dramatic improvement in the rule development cycle made it possible to achieve a respectable level of performance in a small amount of time . The mid-range performance of the Paramax MUC-4 system could have been significantly improved i f additional staffing had been available to better engineer the implementation .' After the MUC-4 test, i t was determined that a bug existed in the preprocessing code for recognizing sentence boundaries—sentenc e endings terminated by double quotes were not recognized . Since sentence boundaries play a very important role in determining the relative likelihood of possible slot values, this problem had a significant impact on the accuracy of the system's slot value preferencing heuristics . The problem could have been easily resolved if enough staffing had been available to more carefully examine system output during trainin g runs. Bugs in the forward-chaining rule base were also discovered after the MUC-4 test that would hav e been easy to correct and that had a dramatic cumulative impact on performance . Examples of such bug s are given in the Paramax MUC-4 system summary. The Paramax system 's high rate of spurious responses was caused by a poor performance in establishin g coreference among event descriptions . This poor performance was caused in large part by a lack o f time/staffing to develop routine heuristics for merging similar templates . For example, in some cases th e Paramax system would generate two identical templates for the same message . In other cases, the same target would arise in two different templates of the same type for the same message (ie, the same buildin g would be bombed, the same individual would be killed, and so forth) . Improving the set of heuristics use d to establish object coreference will be a top priority for the Paramax team in MUC-5 . These improvements should result in a lower rate of spurious responses . 4","paragraphs":["1n the case of P&R F scores, for which recall and precision are given equal weight, ,0 = 1 .0.","'No formal mechanism exists for determining the level of effort dedicated to the development of MUC-4 systems, and the informal estimates offered by the participating research groups are surely inaccurate . We estimate that implementations which performed better than the Paramax system generally involved double the staffing level—most such systems wer e developed with government support, which is not the case for the Paramax system . 130"]},{"title":"CONCLUDING REMARK S The Paramax MUC-4 system takes about 32 hours to process 100 messages on a Sparc2 with 32MB o f memory and a normal CPU load (ie, with a text editor or two in use) . The CLIPS-based data extraction component's average elapsed processing time per text in the MUC-4 TST3 data set is 1 minute, 47 seconds . This processing speed permits a fast rule development cycle, which is critical in building knowledge-base d systems . A failure to insure a rapid rule development cycle is a common mistake among research groups that ar e not accustomed to building large-scale text processing systems . This mistake was made by a number o f research groups in MUC-3, and the Paramax team and other research groups, most notably SRI, rectifie d this mistake in MUC-4 . The MUC-4 development strategies of Paramax and SRI were roughly similar : a rapid rule development cycle was insured by stripping away inefficient linguistic analysis techniques . Th e SRI MUC-4 system performed significantly better than the Paramax submission, but this is very likely a result of greater staffing resources than the consequence of some fundamental difference in approach . For both the Paramax and SRI research teams, the decision to eliminate linguistic analysis technique s was more a recognition of the primary importance of satisfying the requirements of knowledge-based systems than it was a rejection of linguistic analysis as a useful methodology in text processing . Linguisti c analysis is still clearly necessary for achieving finer-grained data extraction capabilities, but additional re - search must be performed to improve the efficiency and robustness of the techniques . Meanwhile, the dat a extraction capabilities of systems with only rudimentary linguistic analysis techniques are capable of generating data bases with sufficient detail to cause researchers to begin worrying about system developmen t issues beyond the data extraction process itself. Paramount among these issues is the need to perfor m object coreference on the database level—in other words, to recognize that multiple database records ar e describing the same object . Until object cofererence on the data base level becomes a manageable problem , it will be difficult to use the data bases that are now being extracted . The decision on the part of the Paramax team to build a completely new text processing implementatio n for MUC-4 was a difficult one to make . Although it was clearly necessary to achieve a fast rule developmen t cycle, it was also clear that building a new implementation in only a couple of months with limited staffin g was a high risk venture . But in retrospect, the Paramax team is confident that the right decision wa s made ; system development requirements were prioritized and the need for a rapid rule development cycl e came out on top . What is truly surprising is that the Paramax MUC-4 system did as well as it did, given the level o f effort that went into developing it . CLIPS has proven to be an excellent choice for building rule-base d text analysis systems : it is an extremely fast forward-chaining engine, and it is easily integrated wit h other analysis components . Several CLIPS rule modules developed for the MUC-4 system can be reused , particularly the rules used to recognize proper names .
