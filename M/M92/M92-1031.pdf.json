Development for Tipster ha s been going on since September, 1992 .","The system we have used for the MUC-4 tests has only implemented some of the features we pla n to include in our final Tipster system . It relies intensively on statistics and on context-free text markin g to generate templates . Some more detailed parsing has been added for a limited lexicon, but lack of fulle r coverage places an inherent limit on its performance . Most of the information produced in our MUC template s is arrived at by probing the text which surrounds s̀ignificant' words for the template type being generated , in order to find appropriately tagged fillers for the template fields ."]},{"title":"OVERVIEW OF THE TEMPLATE FILLING PROCES S","paragraphs":["The overall system architecture is shown in Figure 1 . Three independent processes operate on an inpu t text . One, the Text Tagger, marks a variety of strings with semantic information . The other two, the Relevant Template Filter and the Relevant Paragraph Filter, perform word frequency analysis to determin e whether a text should be allowed to generate templates for particular incident types and which paragraph s are specifically related to each incident type . These predictions are used by the central process in th e system, the Template Constructor, which uses a variety of heuristics to extract template information fro m the tagged text . A skeleton template structure is then passed to the final process, the Template Formatter, which performs some consistency checking, creates cross references and attempts to expand any names foun d in the template to the longest form in which they occur in the text . Each of the above processes is described in more detail below ."]},{"title":"Relevancy Filters","paragraphs":["We have developed a procedure for detecting document types in any language .

So far the method has been applied to English, discriminating between Tipster and MUC texts, an d to Japanese between Tipster texts and translations of ACM proceedings . In both cases the classification scheme developed was correct 99% of the time .","The method has now been extended to the identification of relevant paragraphs and relevant templat e types for the MUC documents. This is a more complex problem due to the non-homogeneous nature of th e texts and the difficulty of deriving training sets of text . Each process uses two sets of words, one whic h occurs with high probability in the texts of interest, and the other which occurs in the ǹon-interesting ' texts . Due to the complexity of separating relevant from non-relevant information for the MUC texts w e actually use three filters, two trained on sets of non-relevant and relevant paragraphs and one trained o n sets of relevant and non-relevant texts . The lists of relevant and non-relevant paragraphs were derived using the templates of the 1300 text test corpus . Any paragraph which contributed two or more string fills to a particular template was used as part of the relevant training set ; paragraphs contributing only one string fill were regarded as of dubious accuracy and were not placed in either set and all other paragraphs wer e considered as non-relevant . Word lists were derived automatically by finding those words in the relevan t training set which occurred within a threshold of most frequently occurring words in the relevant paragraphs and not in the non-relevant paragraphs, and vice versa to obtain a set of non-relevant words .","The relevant template marker consists of two processes, the first trained on a set of texts consistin g of paragraphs from the MUC corpus which produced two or more string fills against text consisting o f paragraphs which generated no string fills .","These allow us to determine, based on word counts taken at paragraph level, whether the whole tex t should be checked for specific template types . The second stage is activated if any single paragraph in the text is found to be r̀elevant' . This stage is trained on the set of texts which generated a particular templat e type against texts which produced no templates . There are separate relevant and non-relevant lists of word s used to determine each template type .","The result is a vector represented as a Prolog fact which determines whether the texts will be allowed t o generate templates of a particular type .

Any group containing a Spanish word or a known name is recognized , unknown words on their own must be preceded by a title of some kind (identified by the Known Items step) . Once an unknown item is identified as a name, however, it is added temporarily to the list of first and las t names, so if it occurs in isolation later in the text it will be recognized correctly . A further complication to the problem of name recognition was found in several names which contained text which had already bee n 228 identified as a place name .

For example : [ [0 , 'TST2-MUC4-0048 ' ,null] , [1, '6' ,null] , [4, 'ATTACK ',null] , [2,'19 APR 89',null] , [3,'EL SALVADOR : SAN SALVADOR (CITY)',null] , [6, 'null' ,\"BOMB\"] , [7, 'BOMB' ,null] , [18, 'null' , \"ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO\"] , [8, 'TERRORIST ACT' ,null] , [9, 'null' ,\"TERRORIST\"] , [10, 'null ' , \"THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT\"] , [12, 'null' ,\"VEHICLE\"] , [13, 'TRANSPORT VEHICLE' ,null] , [19, 'null' ,\"GENERAL\"] , [20, 'MILITARY' ,null] , [21, 'null' ,null] , [5, 'ACCOMPLISHED' ,null] , [16,'-',null] , [23, 'DEATH' ,null] ]","A sequence of paragraphs is assumed to generate a new template . The sentences in these paragraphs are examined for a sentence containing a key verb for the template type . Sentences before this sentence ar e held in reverse order and sentences after in normal order . Each sentence is stripped of any prefatory claus e terminated by \"that\" (e .g . GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REPORTED TODAY THAT) . The remainder of the sentence is reordered into lists containing texts marked with specific semantic types . These correspond to the appropriate fillers for the main sections of the template . The sentence is then marked as active or passive . A search is then made in the current sentence and either the previous or the succeeding ones fo r items satisfying the appropriate conditions to fill a template slot . Thus for an active sentence the perpetrator will be sought in the head of the sentence and then, if not found, in previous sentences . This provides a crude form of reference resolution as pronouns are not marked with any specific semantic information . The target is checked for in the tail of the sentence and then in subsequent sentences . This process is repeated for all the main fields of the template . It relies heavily on the fact that our text locating techniques are accurate . If no appropriate action word is found the template creation process is abandoned . The process is also abandoned if some of the template filling criteria are not satisfied (eg if the human target is a militar y officer) . The template construction program is written in Prolog and was compiled to run stand-alone usin g Quintus Prolog .","We obviously need to add more precise syntax and semantics at the sentence level and to provide a structure which allows the inter-relationship of a group of sentences to be captured . The advantage of the 229 method we are using at the moment is that it is robust and can be used as a fall-back whenever the mor e precise methods fail . A limited amount of semantic parsing was implemented before the final MUC-4 test . This over-rode the robust method whenever an appropriate parse was found . Due to the limited number of lexical entries we were able to generate before the test, it was not possible to accurately assess the impac t of the more precise grammar .","Below are given sample entries of the lexical structures used in the MUC-4 tests. The transitive ver b murder and gerundive nominal killing illustrate the current state of the integration of lexical semanti c information (seen in the qualia field) with corpus-related information derived from tuning (seen in th e cospec field) [Pustejovsky 1991] . Cospecifacaiion is a semantic tagging of what collocational patterns th e lexical item may enter into . The sem field specifies directly how to map the qualia values into the appropriat e slots in the MUC templates .","gls(\"MURDER\" , syn([type(v),subcati(H1),type(H1,np),subcat2(H2),type(H2,np) ,","subcat3(I1),type(I1,np)]) , qualia ( [agent iv e ( [human (H1)]),formal([human (H2),dead]) ,","const([instrument (I1)])]) , cospec ( [agentive ( [np (H1 ) , \"*\" , self] ) ,","formal( [self ,\"*\",np(H2)]) ,","const ( [self , \"*\" , \"WITH\" , np(I1)])]) , sem([type ('AMOK '),perp(H1),hum_tgt(H2),last (I1),hum_tgt_eff('DEATH')])) .","gls(\"KILLING\" , syn ( [type (n) , subcat 1 (H1 ) , type (H1 ,np ) , subcat2 (H2) , type (H2 , np ) ] ) , qualia ([agent ive([human(H1)]),formal([human(H2),dead] )]) , cospec([agentive([\"THE\",self,\"*\",\"BY\",np(H1)]) ,","formal([self,\"OF\",np(H2)])]) , sem([type('ATTACK'),perp(H1),hum_tgt(H2),inst(I1),hum_tgt_eff('DEATH')])) .","Parsing rules which allow indeterminate gaps are used to match the cospecification against the ke y sentences found . A parser-generator uses the cospec fields of the GLS's to construct the parsing rules, wit h type constraints obtained from the corresponding qualia fields . Certain operators within the rules (such as np() and \"*\") allow varying degrees of unspecified material to be considered in the constituents of the parse . The parsing rules can in this way be seen as specifying complex regular expressions . Because of thi s looseness, the parser will not break due to unknown items or intervening material .","These parsing rules are individually pre-compiled into compact Prolog code (each a small expressio n matching machine) before being included into the template constructor . The term-unification machinery of Prolog automatically relates the syntactic constituents of the parse with the type constraints from th e qualia and also with the arguments of the template semantics, avoiding the need for complex type matchin g and argument matching procedures .","Performance is degraded by the current partial implementation of the cospec field in the lexical structure definition . The statistical-based corpus-tuning program for the lexical structures was not included for th e MUC-4 test runs, but is on development-schedule for inclusion in the Tipster test run later this summer . The cospec for a lexical item ideally encodes corpus-based usage information for each semantic aspect of the word (e .g . its qualia, event type, and argument structure) . This is a statistically-encoded structure o f all admissible semantic collocations associated with the lexical item .","The initial seeding of the LS's is being done from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of Con - temporary English [Proctor et al 1978], largely using tools described in [Wilks et al 1990] . These are the n automatically adapted to the format of generative lexical structures . It is these lexical structures which ar e then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in [Pustejovsky 1992] and [Anic k and Pustejovsky 1990] . Semantic features for a lexical item which are missing or only partially specifie d from dictionary seeding are, where possible, induced from a semantic model of the corpus . 230 O .
