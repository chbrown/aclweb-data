For set fill slots, the Ci are the possible values (e .g . DEATH, SOME DAMAGE , etc.) . For the string fill slots, the Ci are yes or no answers to whether a particular item fills a slot, (e .g . HUMAN-TGT-NAME versus HUMAN-TGT-NAME-NOT). For typical Bayesian classifiers, the tunable parameter is th e prior probabilities for the Ci . In TTS-MUC4 we have two different settings, EQUI-PROS and REL-FREQ , respectively for probabilities that are equal for all classes and probabilities that reflect the relative frequency of classe s in the training data . EQUI-PROB favors recall, and REL-FREQ favors precision .","In addition, for text applications, there is an issue as to whether one includes only those features present i n the text, or, also, those that are absent. In TTS-MUC4 we used two different settings, PRESENT an d PRESENT&FREQUENT, where PRESENT&FREQUENT considers all those features which are present and als o those that are absent, but which occur very frequently in the texts . The threshold for whether a feature wa s considered frequent was set so that, for each slot, approximately 30 features were considered frequent . In the TTS-MUC4 conceptual hierarchy there are over 400 potential features .","For each slot, the parameter settings were optimized to balance recall and precision . The optimization wa s done using TST1 and TST2 . Table 3 gives the parameter settings for each slot. Balancing precision and recall for string fill slots is difficult in TTS-MUC4 . For example, in the training corpus, TTS-MUC4 detects over 4,000 potential HUMAN-TARGET-NAMES, but less than 10% of these are actual string fills."]},{"title":"TRAINING METHODOLOG Y","paragraphs":["To compute the conditional probabilities, the MUC-3 development (DEV) corpus and the associate d templates where used . Each sentence in the DEV corpus that contained a string fill for some template was used as a training sample . TI'S detects features for important domain words (e.g . explosion, report, etc .), and also for phrases that may map into string fills .

For example, \"SIX JESUITS\" would drive the creation of the phrase ( :NUMBER-W : RELIGIOUS-ORDER-W) . The type of the string fill served as the semantic feature for the phrase, which is : CIVILIAN-DESCR, in this example .","Improvement that occurred over time in TTS-MUC4 is attributable to two factors: the introduction of the Bayesian classifiers to replace the K-Neighbors technique from TTS-MUC3, and the tuning of the parameters of th e Bayesian classifiers for each slot.","All of the training for TTS-MUC4 is automated . As with TTS-MUC3, the only manual portion of th e process is choosing the conceptual classes for the lexicon ."]},{"title":"ALLOCATION OF EFFORT","paragraphs":["Two calendar months and approximately 2 .5 person months were spent on enhancing the TTS-MUC3 system to create TTS-MUC4.","TTS-MUC4 effort falls roughly into three categories : classifier evaluation, system training, and filte r development. Approximately 20% of our time was spent on developing and evaluating the performance of th e Bayesian classifier, and tuning the parameters used in this classifier . This classifier replaced the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier previously employed in TTS-MUC3 . 10% of the development effort focused on tuning other system parameters, such as the *fill-strength-threshold*, which provides a means for filtering out unlikely slot fillers . About 40% of our time was devoted to developing filters to improve the precision of the values of the templat e fillers, and evaluating their effects . Retraining of the system to take advantage of a modified lexicon and t o accommodate the revised templates took up about 10% of the time. The remaining 20% of the effort was spent o n developing code to extract information to fill the new and revised slots of the MUC-4 templates ."]},{"title":"LIMITING FACTOR S","paragraphs":["One limiting factor for the Hughes TTS-MUC4 system was time. The Bayesian classifier is effective for filling most slots, but the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier might provide better fills for others . However, time did not 10 6 permit us to experiment enough to identify the best classifier to use for each slot . Another aspect of TTS to which we would like to have devoted more attention is on dynamically weighting features retrieved from the knowledge base depending upon their relevance to the slot being processed . Our algorithm for grouping sentences into topic s was responsible for many of our errors . Improving the slot-dependent weighting portion of the system would take a considerable amount of additional time, and would require that domain knowledge be added into the processing ."]},{"title":"FUTURE WOR K","paragraphs":["The following enhancements are most relevant to the current MUC-oriented software : (1) filters for string fills based on linguistic knowledge, (2) reference resolution, and (3) better learningfpattem classification algorithms . TTS-MUC4 currently has a very limited amount of processing that is specialized for language . One of the feature s that we would have liked to detect in the MUC-4 corpus was the source of information in a story . Individuals who are the source of a report occurred frequently, and er oneously, as human targets . Another \"language specific\" portio n we would like to add is reference resolution for string fills . TTS-MUC4 currently suffers in its precision score because it lists each referent for a filler several times .","Additional changes would make a more usable \"real syste m\" , although they are not essential for the MUC task as it now stands. These include (1) the development of a user interface for corpus marking, and (2) integratio n with on-line data sources, such as map databases, to eliminate the burden of creating special data files for natura l language processing."]},{"title":"TRANSFERABILITY TO OTHER TASK S","paragraphs":["Currently, TTS only requires a lexicon and a training corpus with templates . Therefore, extension to terrorism in another locale or to a completely different domain would be easy .

TTS currently has very littl e processing specific to language ; most of the processing is simple feature detection followed, by pattern recognitio n algorithms .
