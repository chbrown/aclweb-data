LINK ' s performance on MUC-4's two test corpora is summarized in figure 1 .","Although we only tested LINK in a single configuration, there were several parameters tha t could have been varied in the system . They include the following :","1. What to do with undefined words . When the system identified a group of undefine d words as a likely noun phrase, it was assumed that this noun phrase referred to some kin d of HUMAN or PLACE . 1 Thus, these noun phrases were potential candidates to fill the LOCATION, PERP, PHYS TGT, or HUM TGT fields of a template .","2. When to generate templates . A template was only generated if an appropriate fille r for the PERP, PHYS TGT or HUM TGT field had been extracted from the text .","3. When to merge templates . Every time a new template was generated for an article, the system considered merging it with existing templates . A merge was performed if another template with the same INCIDENT TYPE already existed, and if there were no explicit contradictions between the existing template's filled fields and the new template . For example, if the two templates had different DATE fields, they were not merged . I n addition, BOMBING and ATTACK templates were merged if they had no contradictory fields ."]},{"title":"Amount of effort","paragraphs":["We estimate that 1 .5 person-years were spent on our MUC-4 effort . Figure 2 shows the breakdown of this effort on different parts of the system .","Prior to MUC-4, LINK had been used in several smaller-scale applications, including th e extraction of information from free-form textual descriptions of automobile malfunctions an d the repairs that were made to fix them ; as well as an application involving free-form textua l instructions for assembly line workers .","Little modification was required of the parser itself for MUC-4 .

Some of this development was partially automated, although not as much as w e had originally hoped . The answer keys contained a great deal of information about how variou s lexical items should map to the HUM TGT, PHYS TGT, and INSTRUMENT TYPE fields in th e MUC-4 templates . For example, the appearance of LAW ENFORCEMENT : \"POLICEMEN \" in field 20 of several answer key templates, along with PLURAL : \" POLICEMEN\" in field 21 , suggested that \"POLICEMEN\" should be defined in our lexicon as a plural noun which mean s LAW ENFORCEMENT . We were able to use this information to define a substantial percentag e of the nouns in our lexicon .","Unfortunately, there was no such source of information for other types of words that were o f interest in the domain, such as verbs, adjectives, prepositions, etc . An INCIDENT : DESCRIP-TION field in the template would have provided information for verbs, but no field existed in th e MUC-4 templates . Thus, the remainder of the lexicon was constructed entirely by hand . Ou r test configuration system contained a total of 6700 lexical entries, with 7532 distinct definition s (i .e ., some words were defined with more than one sense) .","The system's grammar was also developed by hand . The grammar in the test configuratio n of our system contained 565 rules . Although many rules were not related to the terrorism do - main, and thus could presumably be used in a different domain, about half of the rules wer e domain-specific, and could not transfer to a new domain without some inspection and modification . For example, rules about combining noun groups often contained semantic informatio n which was specific to the domain (e .g ., a noun meaning BOMB followed by a noun meaning ATTACK maps to a BOMBING with the INSTRUMENT field filled by the BOMB noun) ."]},{"title":"What worke d","paragraphs":["In a large-scale natural language application such as MUC-4, it is virtually certain that a n NLP system will not be able to produce a complete syntactic and semantic analysis for multi-sentence or multi-paragraph articles . Developing a complete lexicon, grammar, or set of semanti c interpretation rules for such an application is virtually impossible . Thus, it is very important for a system to have strategies to deal with texts which cannot be completely processed . Ou r system's strategies for incomplete processing were vital to its ability to perform at the level tha t it did . These strategies included the following:","1. Preprocessing : identifying noun phrases . The preprocessor, explained in detail in ou r system summary paper, grouped together words which were candidate noun phrases . These NP 's often included words which were not in the system ' s lexicon . As a result, undefine d words did not interfere with the system ' s ability to parse a sentence . Although our lexicon contained 6700 entries, we estimate that nearly 14,000 distinct lexical items appear in the MUC-3 training corpus . Thus, an effective approach for dealing with undefined words was critical to our system's performance .","2. Identifying important partial parses . Even with the enhancement provided by the preprocessor, our system did not succeed in parsing the majority of sentences that i t encountered . However, information was extracted from these sentences by examining the 161 constituents that were built, even though they did not lead to a complete parse . This ability was vital to the performance of our system, and is described in more detail in ou r system summary paper ."]},{"title":"What didn't wor k","paragraphs":["Our system's ability to correctly integrate information extracted from multiple sentences was its weakest point . Most of the decisions as to how information should be integrated were made in the postprocessor ; thus, this module is clearly the best candidate for rewriting .","Several problems existed in the postprocessor . First, its strategies for deciding when two templates should be merged were not very effective. As described earlier, this decision relied purely on the information contained in the two templates which were being considered for merging . B y default, templates were merged unless the information they contained explicitly contradicte d each other . This resulted in templates being merged even when the text contained obvious cue s that two separate events were being described . For example, if a BOMBING template had al - ready been generated for an article, a sentence beginning with \"Another bombing occurred . . . \" would not generate a second bombing template unless information about LOCATION, PHY S TGT, etc ., contradicted information in the first template .","Related to our system's poor merging heuristics was its lack of a sophisticated referenc e resolution strategy. Two kinds of reference resolution existed in the system, for names an d pronouns . Whenever a name of a person was identified in the text, a list was searched fo r previous occurrences of that name, or of a longer name containing the new name . If a match was found, additional information about the person, which could be used to fill the DESCRIPTIO N or TYPE field, could be obtained from the prior mention of that person .","Pronominal reference in our system was extremely simplistic . When a pronoun was encountered, its referent was resolved to the most recent NP prior to it in the text which met simpl e semantic restrictions . If the pronoun was assigned to be the PERP of an event, then its referen t had to be a type of TERRORIST . If it was assigned to be the HUM TGT, then its referent ha d to be a HUMAN who was not a TERRORIST . These simple heuristics obviously could have been improved greatly.","Finally, additional information about a template which appeared in a subsequent sentence often was not extracted . Lists of victims, additional information about perpetrators or victims , and so on that appeared in a separate sentence from the initial mention of a terrorist act wer e not usually added to the template ."]},{"title":"What we learne d","paragraphs":["Perhaps the most important lesson of MUC is that in a large-scale natural language application, it is not yet possible to construct a knowledge base which will enable complete processin g of even a majority of input texts . The domain is simply too large, and the possible variation s in language too great . Thus, as we said earlier, it is very important for a system to have robus t strategies for dealing with texts which cannot be completely processed .","Due to time constraints, we devoted very little effort to discourse processing . The lesson we learned here was twofold : on the one hand, we were a bit surprised that we could achieve eve n 40% recall with only the simplest heuristics for integrating information from multiple sentences . 162 Single sentences often contained enough information for our system to generate a template wit h sufficient information to match the answer key . On the other hand, we felt that we were nearin g the maximum score that we could have achieved without further developing this aspect of ou r system . Thus, in another MUC-like task our group would devote a great deal of our effort i n this area .","Finally, as we analyzed our system's results during development, we realized that the recall and precision scores used for evaluation would change significantly with relatively minor adjustments in the criteria used by the scoring program . Perhaps the prime factor that affected ou r own score was the criteria for what constituted a match between a response template and th e answer key. Our system often erroneously merged two templates into a single template . Thus , correct fills of PHYS TGT and HUM TGT fields were often split between two templates in th e answer key. At other times, our system generated two or more templates when a single templat e should have been generated . In this case, although correct information was split between th e response templates, the scoring program only allowed a single match between response template s and the answer key, and counted additional response templates as spurious, even though the y might have contained information which matched some of the information in the single templat e in the answer key. 163"]}]}
