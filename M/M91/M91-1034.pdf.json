In the context of the","paragraphs":["MUC-3"]},{"title":"task, slots fall into one of four categories depending on the typ e of fill that are applicable to them .

The subject area(s) of interest is imagined as a concept or a class . Example items relevant to a certain concept are assumed to be given . Based on this informatio n and using techniques for learning from examples, a concept characterization rule, that is optimal i n a certain precise sense, is derived . In other words, retrieval of relevant items is actually viewed as a \"recognition\" problem . Our system employs the above idea by mapping possible fill values of set-list type slots to","paragraphs":["concept s of interest."]},{"title":"For example, in the context of the","paragraphs":["TYPE OF INCIDENT"]},{"title":"slot, fill values such as","paragraphs":["ARSON , MURDER, BOMBING,"]},{"title":"etc . are the concepts to be learned . Note that the question of whether concep t","paragraphs":["ARSON"]},{"title":"is applicable to a message is equivalent to deciding whether a message belongs to the messag e class identified by the label","paragraphs":["ARSON ."]},{"title":"Thus, the template filling task and the decision of whether a message is relevant to","paragraphs":["MUC-3"]},{"title":"task are investigated as problems requiring conceptual categorization . For each concept that is considered by the system to be applicable to a message, the system als o keeps track of the extent to which each of the paragraphs in the message contributed to this decision . Judicious use of this information enables various important activities such as the resolution of th e \"best\" fill for a slot from among alternatives, the linking of the fills to templates when more tha n one template must be generated for the same message, and the filling of the two string type slots . The general architecture of the system is presented in Figure 1 . There are four major subsystems : Indexing Module, Learning Module, Filtering Module, and Template Filler Module . Each of thes e systems are outlined next . Indexing Modul e The function of the Indexing Module is to generate a representation for each message . A messag e is represented by a vector of weights . Each weight value either indicates the presence or absence o f a term in the message or the importance of a term to the message . A term is either a single-orde r term or a high-order term (i .e ., single terms or word combinations representing phrases) . For the assignment of single terms to messages, the indexing module from the","paragraphs":["SMART"]},{"title":"Retrieval System [1] is used . This module utilizes a stop list to filter out the common words and the \"no - stemming\" option is chosen . All terms that are assigned a weight larger than a threshold by thi s module are retained in the message representation vector . For the purpose of phrase extraction, a modified version of the","paragraphs":["INDEX"]},{"title":"software, developed and implemented by Jones, et al. [2,3], is used .","paragraphs":["INDEX"]},{"title":"is used mainly to extract all possible substring s that are within certain minimum and maximum length specifications and are not substrings of othe r previously selected substrings . Several strategies for filtering these to identify \"good\" phrases ar e provided as a part of the software developed for the","paragraphs":["MUC-3"]},{"title":"project . Thus, each element of the vector representing a message corresponds to either a single term o r a phrase . The phrase identification is expected to be important as a precision improving device . This module also generates the system vocabulary, which consists of all the distinct single terms an d phrases used in representing the messages . Learning Module The function of the learning module is to derive the concept categorization rules for the variou s concepts of interest . Each rule is a vector of numeric weights, where the elements correspond to th e terms in the system vocabulary. 235 s Trainin g Set Messages Indexing Module Syste m Vocabulary Indexed Training Set Message s Training Set Key Template Learning Module s. Concep t Rul e Vectors Test Message Filterin g Module Message Relevanc e Templat e Filler Module Slot fill vs Paragraph Relevance Fille d Templates Rul e Base Figure 1 : Block diagram of the system","paragraphs":["236"]},{"title":"This module also involves components for selecting a training set from the development set , identifying the concepts for which the training set has at least a minimum number of positiv e examples (i .e ., the learnable concepts) and preparing the grid file, which shows for each message i n the training set which of the learnable concepts are applicable . The source for this information is the set of key-templates manually generated for the 1300 messages in the development set . The concept rule vectors are derived by employing the perceptron -learning algorithm [4] . Th e algorithm is simple and efficient . The procedure is incremental in that the rule can be updated as new examples become available. As long as a decision boundary exists, this algorithm is guaranteed to find one and terminate . Usually, the decision boundary constructed is a hyper-plane . However, since the system vocabulary includes phrases, and phrases incorporate dependency information between single terms, ou r result is equivalent to constructing a non-linear boundary. In the terminology of the connectionis t networks, we employ a single-layer, high-order perceptron . The single-layer option facilitates fast learning time, while the higher-order option enables the use of more powerful separation boundaries . Furthermore, the concept rule vectors are connectionist, rather than symbolic in nature . Such rules are more attractive when a large number of features are involved and when robustness agains t noisyness in features is crucial . In addition to concepts associated with slot fills, another concept known as \"optimal-query \" is also derived . This rule vector distinguishes messages that are not relevant to Muc-3 task from those that generate at least one template. The system is set up in such a way that the training set of messages for deriving this optimal-query vector can be different from that used for the othe r concepts. Filtering modul e The Filtering Module is responsible for identifying concepts applicable to a set of test messages and deciding whether a message is relevant to the MuC-3 task . The major subsystems of this modul e are concerned with test message indexing, assessment of concept relevance and the evaluation of a rule base by means of an inference engine . The test message indexing involves the determination of which of the single terms and phrase s in the system vocabulary are contained in the message . This process generates a message vecto r that is matched against each of the concept rule vectors to determine the corresponding activatio n values . The distribution of the activation values for the test set of messages relative to each concept i s analyzed to determine a threshold . A concept is considered relevant to a message if the correspondin g activation value exceeds the threshold chosen for that concept . Depending on the concepts applicabl e to a message, the inference engine activates appropriate rules of the rule base, whose terminal symbol s correspond to the various concepts acquired . The rule base expresses the requirements in terms o f concept combinations that, when present in a message, imply that the message is relevant to Muc- 3 task . The module also identifies for each message, the extent to which its paragraphs contribute d to the activation values relative to the different concepts . This result is referred to as the concep t vs . paragraph relevance vector . For slots of string fill type, a database of possible fill values, grouped by slot name, is provide d as input to this module . For each string in the database for which at least one match is found i n the message, the paragraphs in which a match is found and the frequency of its occurrence in each paragraph is determined . Template Filler Modul e This module is responsible for generating one or more templates for each message determined to b e relevant by the Filtering Module and filling the slots on the basis of concepts and string filled tha t are activated . For each relevant message either the optimal-query concept is activated or one or more inciden t types are recognized along with a desired combination of concepts (or both) . In the case exactly one incident type is recognized, for each of the other slots the following is performed . If several concepts 237 are activated for this slot and only one value is permitted, the one with highest activation value i s chosen ; otherwise, all values are filled . In the case more than one incident type is activated, the system must decide, for each activate d concept, to which incident type it is the closest . For this purpose, the concept versus paragrap h relevance vector is used . This vector contains the contribution of the various paragraphs in a messag e to the activation value of the slot fill relative to this message . The paragraph relevance vector of an activated slot fill, say","paragraphs":["CIVILIAN"]},{"title":"(from","paragraphs":["HUMAN TARGET TYPE),"]},{"title":"is compared to the vector associated with each of the activated incident types, say KIDNAPPING and MURDER. The strength of this match is then used to decide whether the fill","paragraphs":["CIVILIAN"]},{"title":"will be used in the","paragraphs":["KIDNAPPING"]},{"title":"or the","paragraphs":["MURDER"]},{"title":"template . If a message becomes relevant only due to optimal-query, then it enables other slots having activated fills to be filled even though no TYPE OF INCIDENT may have been activated . SYSTEM WALKTHROUG H The system walkthrough explains how the message","paragraphs":["TsT1-MUC3-0099"]},{"title":"is processed . The result obtained corresponds to the parameter settings used in our Option 4 (see report on","paragraphs":["UNL/USL : Muc- 3"]},{"title":"Test Results and Analysis) . In this option, Training Set 2 is used for determining the rule vector fo r optimal-query and Training Set 3 is used for the other concepts . The threshold used for decidin g whether a concept is activated is based on an analysis of the distribution of the activation values o f this concept relative to the test set messages (threshold setting T1) . Table 1 shows a list of all set-list type fills and those that are actually learnable on the basis of training set 3 . The concept rule vectors for each of these fills are constructed by using the indexin g and the learning module . The test message is indexed and the dot product of its representation vecto r with each of the concept rule vectors is computed . The activation values so obtained are compare d to the corresponding threshold values . Table 2 shows that, for the current message, the following five concepts are activated :","paragraphs":["BOMBING, TERRORIST ACT, TRANSPORT VEHICLE, SOME DAMAGE,"]},{"title":"and th e optimal-query. These concepts activate the appropriate leaf nodes of the","paragraphs":["AND/OR"]},{"title":"tree associated with the rulebase shown in Table 4 . This results in the root node getting the value \"true\" an d therefore, this message is termed relevant . For the current testing, the rule base is defined with all the concept weights being either 0 or 1 . The inference engine is, however, capable of handlin g any numeric weights between 0 and 1 . The vector representation for each of the paragraphs in the message are also multiplied by the concept rule vectors to obtain the paragraph vs concept relevanc e vector (Table 3) . This paragraph information is not useful in this case since neither several fills are activated for a slot for which only one fill is permitted nor is there an indication, in terms o f","paragraphs":["INCIDENT TYPE"]},{"title":"activations, that multiple templates should be created . For the two string fill slots the matching strings along with their occurrence frequency in th e various paragraphs is shown in Table 5 . The paragraph vector for","paragraphs":["BOMBING"]},{"title":"is found to match the paragraph vector of","paragraphs":["\"POLICE\""]},{"title":"better (wrong decision!) .

However, since","paragraphs":["\"PRC\""]},{"title":"is not one of the South American countries, it is discarded . The filled template for this message is shown in Table 6 .
