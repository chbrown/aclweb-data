Many aspects of its design reflect its heritage in the Linguistic Strin g Parser, previously developed and still in use at New York University . The current system, including the Restriction Language compiler, the lexical analyzer, and the parser proper, comprise approximately 4500 lines of Common Lisp.","The Semantic Analyzer was initially developed in 1987 for the MUCK-I (RAINFORMs) application ,","extended for the MUCK-II (OPREPs) application, and further revised for the current evaluation . It currently con-","sists of about 3000 lines of Common Lisp (excluding the domain-specific information) .","The Template Generator was written from scratch for the MUC-3 task; it is about 1200 lines of Commo n Lisp. ."]},{"title":"STAGES OF PROCESSIN G","paragraphs":["The text goes through the five major stages of processing : lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semanti c analysis, reference resolution, and template generation (see Figure 1) . In addition, some restructuring of the logica l form is performed both after semantic analysis and after reference resolution (only the restructuring after referenc e resolution is shown in Figure 1) . Processing is basically sequential : each sentence goes through lexical, syntactic , and semantic analysis and reference resolution ; the logical form for the entire message is then fed to template generation . However, semantic (selectional) checking is performed during syntactic analysis, employing essentiall y the same code later used for semantic analysis .","Each of these stages is described in a section which follows ."]},{"title":"LEXICAL ANALYSIS Dictionary Forma t","paragraphs":["Our dictionaries contain only syntactic information : the parts of speech for each word, information about th e complement structure of verbs, distributional information (e .g ., for adjectives and adverbs), etc . We follow closely the set of syntactic features established for the NYU Linguistic String Parser . This information is entered in LIS P form using noun, verb, adjective, and adverb macros for the open-class words, and a word macro for other parts of speech : (ADVERB \"ABRUPTLY\" :ATTRIBUTES (DSA) ) (ADJECTIVE \"ABRUPT\" ) (NOUN :ROOT \"ABSCESS\" :ATTRIBUTES (NCOUNT) ) 183 Knowledge Sources \\t Text Dictionary Gramma r Semantic Model s Concept Hier.

Dictionary File s","The primary source of our dictionary information about open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, an d adverbs) is the machine-readable version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (\"OALD\") . We have written programs which take the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) version of the dictionary, extrac t information on inflections, parts of speech, and verb subcategorization (including information on adverbial particles and prepositions gleaned from the examples), and generate the LISP-ified form shown above . This is supplemented by a manually-coded dictionary (about 500 lines) for closed-class words and a few very common words . 184","For MUC-3 we used several additional dictionaries . There was a dictionary (about 800 lines) for Englis h words not defined in the OALD, or not adequately defined or too richly defined there . In addition, we extracted from the text and templates lists of organizations, locations, and proper names, and prepared small dictionaries fo r each (about 2000 lines total) ."]},{"title":"Looku p","paragraphs":["The text reader splits the input text into tokens and then attempts to assign to each token (or sequence o f tokens, in the case of an idiom) a definition (part of speech and syntactic attributes) . The matching proces s proceeds in four steps: dictionary lookup, lexical pattern matching, spelling correction, and prefix stripping . Dictionary lookup immediately retrieves definitions assigned by any of the dictionaries (including inflected forms) , while lexical pattern matching is used to identify a variety of specialized patterns, such as numbers, dates, times , and possessive forms .","If neither dictionary lookup nor lexical pattern matching is successful, spelling correction and prefix strippin g are attempted . Based on an analysis of the errors we found, we have used for MUC-3 a rather conservative spelling corrector, which identifies an input token as a misspelled form of a dictionary entry only if one of the two has a single instance of a letter while the other has a doubled instance of the letter (e .g ., \"mispelled\" and \"misspelled\") . 1","The prefix stripper attempts to identify the token as a combination of a prefix and a word defined in the dictionary . We currently use a list of 17 prefixes, including standard English ones like \"un\" and MUC-3 specials like \"narco-\" .","If all of these procedures fail, the word is tagged as a proper noun (name), since we found that most of our remaining undefined words were names ."]},{"title":"Filterin g","paragraphs":["In order to avoid full processing of sentences which would make no contribution to the templates, we per - form a keyword-based filtering at the sentence level : if a sentence contains no key terms, it is skipped. This filtering is done after lexical analysis because the lexical analysis has identified the root form of all inflected words ; these root forms provide links into the semantic hierarchy . The filtering can therefore be specified in terms of a small number of word classes, one of which must be present for the sentence to be worth processing ."]},{"title":"SYNTACTIC ANALYSI S","paragraphs":["Syntactic analysis involves two stages of processing : parsing and syntactic regularization. At the core of the system is an active chart parser. The grammar is an augmented context-free grammar, consisting of BNF rules plu s procedural restrictions which check grammatical constraints not easily captured in the BNF rules . Most restrictions are stated in PROTEUS Restriction Language (a variant of the language developed for the Linguistic String Parser ) and translated into LISP; a few are coded directly in LISP [1] . For example, the count noun restriction (that singular countable nouns have a determiner) is stated a s WCOUNT = IN LNR AFTER NVAR :","IF BOTH CORE Xcore IS NCOUNT AND Xcore IS SINGULA R","THEN IN LN, TPOS IS NOT EMPTY .","Associated with each BNF rule is a regularization rule, which computes the regularized form of each node i n the parse tree from the regularized forms of its immediate constituents . These regularization rules are based on lambda-reduction, as in GPSG . The primary function of syntactic regularization is to reduce all clauses to a standard form consisting of aspect and tense markers, the operator (verb or adjective), and syntactically marked cases . For example, the definition of assertion, the basic S structure in our grammar, i s <assertion> \\t : := <sa> <subject> <sa> <verb> <sa> <object> <sa >",":(s !(<object> <subject> <verb> <sa*>)) .","Here the portion after the single colon defines the regularized structure .","The more standard corrector we used for MUCK-2, which allowed for any single insertion, deletion, transposition, or substitution, gav e too many incorrect matches . 185","Coordinate conjunction is introduced by a metarule (as in GPSG), which is applied to the context-free components of the grammar prior to parsing . The regularization procedure expands any conjunction into a conjuntio n of clauses or of noun phrases .","The output of the parser for the first sentence of DEV-0099, \"POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT TER-RORISTS TONIGHT BOMBED THE EMBASSIES OF THE PRC AND THE SOVIET UNION . \" , is","(SENTENC E","(CENTERS","(CENTE R","(ASSERTION (SUBJECT (NSTG (LNR (NVAR (N \"POLICE\")))) )","(VERB (LTVR (TV \"HAVE\")) )","(OBJEC T","(VENO (LVENR (VEN \"REPORTED\") )","(OBJEC T (THATS (\"THAT\" \"THAT\" ) (ASSERTION (SUBJECT (NSTG (LNR (NVAR (N \"TERRORISTS\")))) )","(SA (SA-VAL (NSTGT (NSTG (LNF : (NVAR (N \"TONIGHT\")))))) )","(VERB (LTVR (TV \"BOMBED\")) )","(OBJEC T","(NSTGO","(NST G","(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T \"THE\")))) (NVAR (N \"EMBASSIES\") )","(RN","(RN-VA L","(PN (P \"OF\" )","(NSTG O","(NST G","(LN R","(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T \"THE\"))) )","(NVAR (NAMESTG (LNAMER (N \"PRC\")))) )","(CONJ-WORD (\"AND\" \"AND\") )","(LNR (LN (TPOS (LTR (T \"THE\"))) )","(NVAR (NAMESTG (LNAMER (N \"SOVIET\" \"UNION\")))))))))))))))))))))) )","(ENDMARK (\" .\" \" \")) )","and the corresponding regularized structure is","(S PERF REPORT (SUBJECT (NP POLICE PLURAL (SN NP1227)) )","(OBJEC T","(S PAST BOMB (SUBJECT (NP TERRORIST PLURAL (SN NP1238)) )","(OBJEC T","(NP EMBASSY PLURAL (SN NP1242) (T-POS THE )","(O F (AND (NP PRC SINGULAR (SN NP1231) (T-POS THE) )","(NP USSR SINGULAR (SN NP1235) (T-POS THE))))) )","(PREP (NP TONIGHT SINGULAR (SN NP1237))))) )","The system uses a chart parser operating top-down, left-to-right. As edges are completed (i .e., as nodes of the parse tree are built), restrictions associated with those productions are invoked to assign and test features of th e parse tree nodes . If a restriction fails, that edge is not added to the chart . When certain levels of the tree are complete (those producing noun phrase and clause structures), the regularization rules are invoked to compute a regularized structure for the partial parse, and selection is invoked to verify the semantic well-formedness of the structure (as noted earlier, selection uses the same \"semantic analysis\" code subsequently employed to translate the tre e into logical form) .","One unusual feature of the parser is its weighting capability . Restrictions may assign scores to nodes ; the parser will perform a best-first search for the parse tree with the highest score . This scoring is used to implement various preference mechanisms : 186","• closest attachment of modifiers (we penalize each modifier by the number of words separating it from it s head)","• preferred narrow conjoining for clauses (we penalize a conjoined clause structure by the number of words i t subsumes)","• preference semantics (selection does not reject a structure, but imposes a heavy penalty if the structure doe s not match any lexico-semantic model, and a lesser penalty if the structure matches a model but with som e operands or modifiers left over) [2,3 ]","• relaxation of certain syntactic constraints, such as the count noun constraint, adverb position constraints, an d comma constraints","• disfavoring (penalizing) headless noun phrases and headless relatives (this is important for parsin g efficiency)","The grammar is based on Harris's Linguistic String Theory and adapted from the larger Linguistic Strin g Parser (LSP) grammar developed by Naomi Sager at NYU [4] . The grammar is gradually being enlarged to cove r more of the LSP grammar . The current grammar is 1200 lines of BNF and Restriction Language plus 300 lines of Lisp ; it includes 150 non-terminals, 365 productions, and 103 restrictions .","Over the course of MUC-2 and MUC-3 we have added several mechanisms for recovering from sentence s the grammar cannot fully parse ; these are described in our site report."]},{"title":"SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND REFERENCE RESOLUTIO N","paragraphs":["The output of syntactic analysis goes through semantic analysis and reference resolution and is then added t o the accumulating logical form for the message . Following both semantic analysis and reference resolution certai n transformations are performed to simplify the logical form . All of this processing makes use of a concept hierarch y which captures the class/subclass/instance relations in the domain .","Semantic analysis uses a set of lexico-semantic models to map the regularized syntactic analysis into a semantic representation. Each model specifies a class of verbs, adjectives, or nouns and a set of operands ; for eac h operand it indicates the possible syntactic case markers, the semantic class of the operand, whether or not the operand is required, and the semantic case to be assigned to the operand in the output representation . For example , the model for \"<explosive-object> damages <target> \" is (add-clause-model :id 'clause-damage- 3",":parent 'clause-an y",":constraint 'damag e",":operands (list (make-specifie r",":marker 'subjec t",":class 'explosive-objec t",":case :instrument )","(make-specifie r",":marker 'objec t",":class 'target-entit y",":case :patien t",":essential-required 'required)) ) The models are arranged in a shallow hierarchy with inheritance, so that arguments and modifiers which are share d by a class of verbs need only be stated once . The model above inherits only from the most general clause model , clause-any, which includes general clausal modifiers such as negation, time, tense, modality, etc . The evaluated MUC-3 system had 98 clause models, 14 nominalization models, and 31 other noun phrase models, a total of about 2000 lines .
