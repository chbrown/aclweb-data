{"sections":[{"title":"APPENDIX B : TEST PROCEDURE S 1 . GENERAL INSTRUCTION S","paragraphs":["Testing may be done any time during the week of 6-12 May . The onl y requirement is that all reports (see section 4, below) be received by NOSC by firs t thing Monday morning, 13 May . Permission to attend MUC-3 at NOSC on 21-23 Ma y may be revoked if you do not meet this deadline !","To complete the required testing, you will need approximately the same amount o f time as it would normally take you to run 100 texts in DEV and interactively scor e them, plus some time to permit you to be extra careful doing the interactive scorin g (since the resulting history file is to be used for all passes through the scorin g program) and some time for the initializations of the scoring program with th e different configuration files required for the various linguistic phenomena tests . I f you carry out the optional testing, you will need to allow time to generate at least a couple new sets of response templates . In that case, you will also need time to add t o the history file as needed during the additional scoring runs .","IF YOU INTEND TO CARRY OUT ANY OF THE OPTIONAL TESTING, YOU MUST REPORT THE PLANNED \"PARAMETER SETTINGS\" TO NOSC FOR BOTH THE REQUIRED TEST AND TH E OPTIONAL TESTING BEFORE STARTING THE TEST PROCEDURE. This means that you shoul d describe, in some meaningful terms, SPECIFICALLY how you will alter the behavio r of the system so that it will produce each of the different tradeoffs in metric s described in the sections below . 1 .1 REQUIRED TESTING : MAXIMIZED RECALL/PRECISION TRADEOF F","To ensure comparability among the test results for all systems, THE REQUIRE D TESTING MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH THE SYSTEM SET TO MAXIMIZE THE TRADEOF F BETWEEN RECALL AND PRECISION IN THE MATCHED/MISSING ROW IN THE SCOR E SUMMARY REPORT . The maximum of recall and precision does not mean an ADDITIV E maximization, but that the total scores for each of the two metrics should be as clos e together and as high as possible . For most systems, this is probably the normal way the system operates .","Several passes through the scoring program will be required, one for the officia l test on generating templates for the whole test set and the others for th e experimental tests on generating the specific slots called out by the linguisti c phenomena tests . \\t","You generate only one set of system responses, and only the firs t pass through the scoring program will require user interaction . \\t","The history fil e produced during this interaction will be used in the scoring of the linguisti c phenomena tests . \\t (It will also serve as the basis for scoring any optional tests tha t are conducted . ) 1 .2 OPTIONAL TESTING : OTHER RECALL/PRECISION TRADEOFF S","The objective of the optional testing is to learn more about the tradeoffs that som e systems may be designed to make between recall and precision . It is intended to elici t B–1 extra data points only on those systems that are currently designed to make som e theoretically interesting tradeoffs in some controlled fashion .","Thus, we are interested in having you conduct the optional testing in either of th e two following cases, but not otherwise :","1) if the system can control the tradeoff between recall and precision in order t o produce a set of data points sufficient to plot the outline of a recall-precisio n curve ;","2) if the system's recall and precision can be consciously manipulated by th e loosening or tightening of analysis constraints, etc ., in order to produce a t least one data point that contrasts in an interesting way with the result s produced by the required testing .","To yield these additional data points, you will generate and score new syste m response templates, using the history file generated during the required testing . N O SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT IS PERMITTED BETWEEN OFFICIAL TESTING AND OPTIONA L TESTING -- ONLY MODIFICATION OF SYSTEM CONTROL PARAMETERS AND/O R REINSERTION OR DELETION OF EXISTING CODE THAT AFFECTS THE SYSTEM'S BEHAVIO R WITH RESPECT TO THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN RECALL AND PRECISION.","If, as a consequence of altering the system's behavior, templates are generate d that weren't generated during the required testing or slots are filled differently, yo u may find it necessary to add to the history file and to change some of the manua l template remappings . START THE SCORING OF EACH OPTIONAL TEST WITH THE HISTOR Y FILE GENERATED DURING THE REQUIRED TESTING, MINUS THE MANUAL TEMPLAT E REMAPPINGS ; SAVE ANY UPDATED HISTORIES TO NEW FILE NAMES .","In order to obtain these data points, you may wish to conduct a number of test s and throw out all but the best ones . Remember, however, that you are to notify NOS C of ALL the planned parameter settings in advance (see section 1) . Thus, it would b e wise to experiment on the training data and use the results to know what differen t runs are worth making during the test . If, among the \"throwaways\" there are som e results that you find significant, you may wish to include them in your site report fo r the MUC-3 proceedings, but they will not be part of the official record .","You may submit results for the experimental linguistic phenomena tests as part o f the optional testing if you wish, but please do so only if you find the differences i n scores to be significant."]},{"title":"2 . SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR THE REQUIRED TESTIN G 2 .1 FREEZING THE SYSTEM AND FTP'ING THE TEST PACKAG E","paragraphs":["When you are ready to run the test, ftp the files in the test package fro m /pub/tst2 . You are on your honor not to do this until you have completely froze n your system and are ready to conduct the test . You must stop all system developmen t once you have ftp'ed the test package . Note : If you expect to be running the test over the weekend and are concerned tha t a host or network problem might interfere with your ability to ftp, you may ftp the B—2 files on Friday . However, for your own sake, minimize the accessibility of those files , e .g ., put them in a protected directory of someone who is not directly involved i n system development . 2 .2 GENERATING THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TEMPLATE S","There are 100 texts in tst2-muc3, and the message IDs have the following format : TST2-MUC3-nnnn . Without looking at the texts, run your system against the file an d name the output file response-max-tradeoff.tst2 .","You are to run the required test only once -- you are not permitted to make an y changes to your system until the test is completed . If you get part way through the test and get an error that requires user intervention, you may intervene only to th e extent that you are able to continue processing with the NEXT message . You are no t allowed to back up ! Notes : 1) \\t If you run short on time and wish to break up tst2-muc3 and run portions of i t in parallel, that's fine as long \\t","as you are truly running in parallel with a single system or can completely simulate a parallel environment, \\t i .e ., th e systems are identically configured . \\t","You must also be sure to concatenate th e outputs before submitting them to the scoring program .","2) No debugging of linguistic capability can be done when the system breaks . For example, if your system breaks when it encounters an unknown word an d your only option for a graceful recovery is to define the word, then abor t processing and start it up again on the next test message .","3) If you get an error that requires that you reboot the system, you may do so, bu t you must pick up processing with the message FOLLOWING the one that wa s being processed when the error occurred . If, in order to pick up -processing a t that point, you need to create a new version of tst2-muc3 that excludes th e messages already processed or you need to start a new output file, that's ok . B e sure to concatenate the output files before submitting them to the scorin g program . 2 .3 SCORING THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TEMPLATE S 2 .3 .1 SCORING ALL SYSTEM RESPONSES FOR OFFICIAL, REQUIRED TES T","Run the scoring program on the system response templates, using key-tst2 as th e answer key and entering config .el as the argument to initialize-muc-scorer . (Th e config file contains arguments to the define-muc-configuration-options function , which you will have to edit to supply the proper pathnames) . When you enter th e scoring program, type \"is\" so that the score buffer will contain detail table s (template by template) as well as the final summary table . Save the score buffe r (*MUC Score Display*) to a file called scores-max-tradeoff .tst2 .","Note : During the interactive scoring, make use of the guidelines (supplie d separately) for interactively assigning full and partial credit .
