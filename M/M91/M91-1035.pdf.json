Lewis Center for Information and Language Studies University of Chicag o Chicago, IL 6063 7 lewis@orange .uchicago . edu INTRODUCTIO N","paragraphs":["The data extraction systems studied in the MUC-3 evaluation perform a variety of subtasks in fillin g out templates . Some of these tasks are quite complex, and seem to require a system to represen t the structure of a text in some detail to perform the task successfully . Capturing reference relation s between slot fillers, distinguishing between historic and recent events, and many other subtask s appear to have this character .","Other of the MUC-3 subtasks, however, appear amenable to simpler techniques . In particular , whenever a slot filling task involves making choices among a relatively small set of prespecifie d alternatives, the potential exists for modeling this task as text categorization [10] . Text categorization systems treat a document as a single unit, and make a decision to assign each document to zero , one or more of a fixed set of categories .","Text categorization techniques have played a role in previous text extraction systems, both for screening out documents which it is not desirable to process, and for directing documents t o category-specific extraction routines [2, 9, 15] . The role of categorization in these systems was relatively limited, however . Analyses of the behavior of these systems have given relatively littl e attention to how categorization operated or to what factors influenced categorization performance . Nor had performing data extraction solely by categorization techniques seen much attention before MUC-3 .","The study reported here is an initial exploration of the issues involved in using categorization a s part of the extraction process . As such it has two main goals . One goal is provide a measure of th e difficulty of the extraction task being performed by the MUC-3 systems . By evaluating the degre e to which various text to template mappings can be captured statistically as word to filler mappings , we gain a sense of where the linguistic and domain knowledge embedded in the NLP systems i s having the most effect .","A second goal is to identify aspects of the extraction task that categorization might plausibl y aid, or even take primary responsibility for . With respect to this second goal, this paper provides a n additional data point to be considered along with the results of several official MUC-3 sites which made greater or lesser use of categorization techniques .","In order to most clearly discover what characteristics of the extraction task impact categorization , we ran an experiment using an \"off-the-shelf\" categorization system, with access to no additiona l language processing capability or knowledge base . The technique investigated was a well-understood , domain independent statistical procedure . It should be pointed out that the method used is onl y one of a variety of methods, some quite knowledge intensive, that have been used in previous wor k on text categorization [12] .","The results presented here are not official MUC-3 results, and should be considered tentative . This paper is only a small step toward an understanding of the role of categorization methods i n data extraction . 245"]},{"title":"VIEWING MUC-3 AS TEXT CATEGORIZATIO N","paragraphs":["For a data extraction task to be viewed as text categorization, it must involve choosing among a finite, preferably small, set of categories that a document might be assigned to . We therefore nee d to consider which MUC-3 subtasks might fit this description .","The MUC-3 task can be broken into two main parts : deciding how many templates should b e generated for a document, and filling the slots within the generated templates . Deciding the numbe r of templates could conceivably be modeled as categorization, given some upper bound on the numbe r of allowed templates . (A more profitable view, if one wanted to use machine learning technique s for this subtask, might be to use multiple regression or some similar technique .) We chose not t o address this task directly, though indirectly it is dealt with by the rules we use to generate templates from a binary categorization .","Many of the slot filling tasks also could not be modeled as classifying a document with respec t to a fixed set of categories . For instance, all slot filling tasks that involve extracting strings from the text allow a range of answers that cannot be defined in advance . One might force string fillin g into a categorization mode by viewing the task as one of deciding, for each substring in a document , whether that substring falls into the class of fillers of a particular slot . In this paper, however, we chose to consider only the classification of entire document texts into categories .","The slots that appeared most amenable to categorization techniques were the set fill slots . Th e following slots were considered to be set fill slots in the MUC-3 documentation : 0 . MESSAGE ID 3. TYPE OF INCIDENT 4. CATEGORY OF INCIDEN T 7 . PERPETRATOR : CONFIDENC E 10 . PHYSICAL TARGET : TYPE(S ) 13. HUMAN TARGET : TYPE(S ) 14. TARGET : FOREIGN NATION(S ) 15. INSTRUMENT : TYPE(S ) 16. LOCATION OF INCIDENT 17. EFFECT ON PHYSICAL TARGET(S ) 18. EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S )","Of these, the MESSAGE-ID slot is assigned straightforwardly without reference to the articl e content . The foreign nation (14) and location (16) slots, are set fill slots only under the assumption that the set of relevant locations is known and fixed . This is appropriate for the MUC-3 evaluation , but might be problematical in an operational setting . In any case, filling of these slots is to such a large extent a function of recognizing particular names in the text that it appeared categorizatio n would have little to say about these slots .","This left eight slots (3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 18) which could plausibly be treated by categorization . Each of these slots has a finite set of possible fillers . The decision to fill a particula r slot for a particular document can therefore be modeled as deciding whether the document fits int o one or more of the 88 categories defined by combinations of these slots and their fillers . Even here , however, several factors, such as the necessity of distributing slot fillers among multiple templates , cause filling these slots to depart from a traditional categorization model . These issues are discusse d in the next section ."]},{"title":"FILLING SET FILL SLOTS WITH A STATISTICAL CAT-EGORIZE R","paragraphs":["To investigate the use of categorization techniques for filling set fill slots, we used the Maxcat syste m [11] . This is a suite of C programs and Unix shell scripts supporting machine learning using large , 246 sparse feature sets, such as are found in text retrieval and text categorization . Datasets are store d using sparsely nondefault matrices . A variety of programs for structural and arithmetic manipulatio n of these matrices are included, and several machine learning algorithms have been implemented using them.","In the following we discuss the processing of MUC-3 training and test documents, and ho w categorization and template generation were performed."]},{"title":"Modeling and Preparing the MUC-3 Dat a","paragraphs":["The training data available for the MUC-3 task was a set of 1400 document texts (1300 origina l training documents and the interim TST1 testset of 100 documents), along with one or more completed templates for each document . The 100 documents and corresponding templates from th e second MUC-3 testset (TST2) were used for testing .","Maxcat requires all data it operates on to be represented in the form of feature vectors . We therefore viewed the complete MUC-3 data set as consisting of two sets of 1500 feature vectors, tw o vectors for each document . One set of features, the predictor features, specified the presence o r absence of each English word from the corpus in each document . We defined a word as a sequenc e of alphanumeric characters separated by whitespace or punctuation . By this definition, there were a total of 16,755 distinct word types in the 1500 documents, and thus 16,755 predictor features . Most predictor features took on a value of 0 (not present) for most documents, and the Maxcat syste m took advantage of this by storing feature vectors in inverted file form . Information on the numbe r of occurrences and positions of words was not used in this experiment .","The second set of feature vectors specified the presence or absence of each of the 88 slot/fixed se t filler combinations in the templates for each document . As with words, information about multiple occurrences of a filler, in one or multiple templates for a document, was omitted since the particular categorization method used did not take make use of this information . The program which converted the training templates into feature vectors uncovered approximately 100 errors in these templates . Most of these were obviously typographical errors in filler names, and we corrected these by han d before training.","It should be noted that while the separation between training and test documents was stric t from the standpoint of the machine learning and evaluation procedures, it was not maintaine d implementationally . The entire set of training and test documents were processed together for th e purpose of defining the complete set of word features that would be used . Strict isolation, to official MUC-3 standards, could have been handled with the Maxcat software, given some additional codin g and a loss in efficiency."]},{"title":"Cat - . • '̂̀{ n .

The problem is that the probability estimates produced by the above formula vary widely between fillers . This is due to the different predictor features used for each filler, and the fact that the assumptions about independence of features made by the above model are not met in reality .","The result is that a different threshold is necessary for each category . Tying these thresholds to a single parameter that can be varied for a system is a difficult problem and has not receive d much attention in previous research on text categorization. For the current experiment, we used th e following ad hoc strategy. The categorization software multiplies the estimate of P(Fi = 1) from th e training corpus by 100 (the number of test documents) and by a constant k . The resulting product provides an estimate, N(F' = 1), of the number of test documents that Fj should be assigned to . For each F„ the software assigned the slot/filler pair F~ to the N(Fi = 1) test documents with th e highest estimated values of P(Fi = 11Dm) . The parameter k controls the tradeoff between recal l and precision, with higher values of k leading to more slot/filler pair assignments, higher recall and , usually, lower precision .","As implemented, this strategy requires processing test documents in batch mode . An incremental alternative would be to apply the classification function to the original training set and check th e relative position of the test document's score within the set of scores it produces on the training set . Even better would be to explicitly model the distribution of scores on the training set and derive a decision theoretic assignment rule with a cost parameter ."]},{"title":"Feature Selectio n","paragraphs":["Recall that, by our very simple definition of a word, the MUC-3 corpus contained 16,755 distinc t word types . In theory, all of these words could be used as features for each categorization, with th e actual quality of each feature being compensated for in the conditional probability estimates . In practice, the \"curse of dimensionality\" [3] limits the number of features that can be used effectively b y any statistical estimation method . The more parameters which need to be estimated by a learnin g procedure, the more samples which the procedure must see in order to avoid fitting noise in th e data . The relationship between the appropriate number of features and the appropriate number of samples varies with feature quality, the nature and amount of noise in the data, appropriatenes s of the statistical model being fit, and other concerns . For text categorization problems, Fuhr has suggested that 50-100 samples per parameter ,are necessary [5] .","With only 1400 training documents, it is clearly inappropriate to use 16,755 features . Maron [13] and Hamill [7] suggested, but did not try, information theoretic measures for selecting a subset o f words to be used in predicting each category.

As expected, feature selection was much more accurate for fillers which occurre d frequently on the training set than for the more rare fillers . In Table 4 we list, in alphabetical order , the top 10 features selected for the four most frequent fillers, as well as for two fillers that had only a single appearance apiece on the training set . Each word was required to occur in at least 2 trainin g documents to be a feature .","The selected features show a number of interesting properties of the feature selection algorithm . The features selected for BOMBING (an incident type filler) fit one's intuitions of what good feature s should look like . They are words that are associated with bombing and, in a semantic analysi s system, would undoubtedly be mapped to concepts closely related to bombing .","The features selected for MURDER (another incident type filler) are a mixture of words whic h are in general related to the concept of murder, and words connected to a particular murder that i s widely discussed in the MUC corpus . The influence of this incident, the murder of 6 Jesuit priests , is even more evident in the features selected for CIVILIAN (a human target type filler) . Since we would not expect these features to be good predictors for future articles, this suggests a need t o consider the composition of training sets carefully when machine learning or statistical methods ar e used in text processing .","Another interesting phenomenon shows up in the features selected for TERRORIST ACT ( a category of incident filler) . We see some contentful words, but also a number of grammatical functio n words (WE, ALL, CAN) . These clearly result from stylistic characteristics of a large class of article s reporting terrorist acts, rather than to the content of those articles . A \"stoplist\" is often used to screen out function words in text retrieval systems, but in the MUC-3 domain the use of such stylisti c clues may in fact be helpful .","For fillers such as KIDNAPPING THREAT and WATER with only one document occurrence , features were selected that occurred in that single document, and one other . These are poor predictors of the fillers, since their single cooccurrence is often an accident . Most fillers fell between th e two extremes presented in the table, and received a mixture of good and poor features .","The number of features used, d, was a smaller influence on performance than expected . A s Table 1 shows, performance was relatively constant across a range of feature set sizes from 5 to 80 . However, if we look at Table 5, which gives only those recall precision points from Table 1 whic h are not strictly dominated by some other point, a bit of a trend becomes clear . We can see that th e optimal number of features increases as the category assignment parameter increases . This means , not surprisingly, that more features should be used if higher recall is desired . 252","BOMBING CIVILIAN MURDER","(199 docs) ATTAC K BOMB CA R DESTROYE D DAMAG E DYNAMITE EXPLODED EXPLOSIO N POLIC E INJURED","(375 docs ) ELLACURIA INJURE D JESUI T JESUIT S KIDNAPPE D MURDERE D PRIESTS SIX TW O UNIVERSITY","(386 docs ) ASSASSINATIO N CRIM E DEATH ELLACURI A JESUIT JESUITS KILLED MURDE R MURDERE D PRIESTS","TERRORIST AC T (528 docs) AL L BOM B BOGOTA CA N DAMAG E DYNAMIT E EXPLODED MUST POLIC E WE KIDNAPPING THREA T","(1 docs ) ARGUETA BENITEZ BLANC O CRISTIAN O GILBERT O PAL O PERQUI N THREATIN G TROO P VELIZ","WATER","(1 docs ) ALLEY BOOT H DESCRIPTION S EYEWITNES S OSORN O PIPES SKETCHE S SPORT S TNT 125 Table 4 : Predictor features selected for six fillers .","Recall/ Number of Features (d)","Precisio n","k 5 10 20 40 8 0 0 .1 .03/1 .0* .03/1 . 0 0 .2 .07/ .82* .07/ .82 .07/ .8 2 0 .5 .20/ .71 * 1 .0 .37/ .60 * 1 .5 .48/ .51 * 2 .0 .55/ .43* .55/ .4 3 3 .0 .67/ .35 * 5 .0 .77/ .26 * 10 .0 .88/ .17 * 15 .0 .91/ .1 4 20 .0 .92/ .12 .92/ .12 .92/ .12 .92/ .12 .92/ .1 2 25 .0 .94/ .11* .94/ .1 1 Table 5 : Nondominated recall/precision pairs from Table 1 . 25 3"]},{"title":"CONCLUSION S","paragraphs":["The above results provide a measure of the extent to which the MUC-3 task can be viewed as one o f sorting documents into categories based on statistical word associations . Only a subset of slots, the set fill slots, can easily be treated in this way. Of those slots, high performance was reached only o n the two most associated with overall document content . However, a nontrivial level of performanc e was achieved on all the set fill slots, and provides an interesting point of comparison with knowledge - based techniques . An information theoretic method of choosing words to predict slot/filler pairs wa s shown to achieve reasonable results, and studying the output of this method raised some interestin g questions about the composition of the MUC-3 corpus .","The Maxcat categorization software used was the result of about 6 months of programmin g effort . However, applying Maxcat to the MUC-3 task required only about a week's effort on th e author's part, plus an additional two weeks' effort by a staff programmer to write the software fo r mapping MUC-3 texts and templates into and out of the format used by Maxcat . This suggest s that categorization techniques may be of practical use in situations where an extraction system fo r set fill slots must be brought into operation in a short period of time . In addition, the relativel y high performance on those slots related to overall document content suggests that categorizatio n may have an important role to play with respect to similar slots in any extraction system ."]},{"title":"Acknowledgment s","paragraphs":["Thanks to Peter Shoemaker for writing the software to map the MUC-3 data into and out o f Maxcat format .
