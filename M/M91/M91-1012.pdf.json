Non - interactive scores were 22% and 32%, respectively . Relative to other sites, we ranked 7th i n recall and 9th in precision .","Because we are in transition from one system (VOX) to another (INLET), our score s reflect the performance of a very new and incomplete analyzer, as well as a small vocabulary and knowledge base . To be able to participate in MUC3, we implemented only a skimmin g capability, rather than a full-fledged syntax-driven language analyzer . Considering the statu s of our project, we feel INLET's performance is highly commendable . We ourselves were surprised by the success of skimming alone in performance on the MUC3 task, especiall y considering the preliminary nature of our work in this area ."]},{"title":"TEST SETTING S","paragraphs":["Like many other developers of NLP systems, we have had no reason, up to now, t o parameterize the trade-off between recall and precision . At various points in the past fe w months, we had tested heuristics that increased recall while reducing precision .","Participation in MUC3 has led us to examine such a parameter more seriously . I n particular, a confidence metric, whereby the system assesses its own confidence i n understanding a text, seems to be a useful component of NLP system development . We can attac h such confidence factors to every action that the system takes in processing text, in extractin g information from text, and in correlating the information to produce output .","As an NLP system improves and its knowledge of linguistics and the domain become mor e complete, confidence factors can be raised . Additionally, an arsenal of heuristics could be mad e available, depending on the confidence threshold assigned to the language processing task .","Assignment of confidence ratings can be assisted by empirical data . For example, we can assign an overall system confidence in identifying the incident type by scoring performance fo r the entire MUC3 corpus . 92"]},{"title":"EXPENDITURE OF EFFOR T","paragraphs":["Once the skimmer was completed (April 22), we spent approximately 2 man-month s customizing INLET to the MUC3 domain and task . A substantial portion of that time was spent i n implementing code for filling the various slots in the MUC3 template and in developin g heuristics to improve recall and precision . Somewhat less time was spent in building an d applying generic and domain-specific grammar rules . System testing was relatively painless , because INLET typically processed 100 messages in 45 minutes, and several Sun Sparcstation s were typically available for running tests . Unfortunately, we allowed too little time fo r vocabulary addition, so that many important words and phrases were omitted (e .g . , \"machinegun\", \"automatic weapons\") ."]},{"title":"LIMITING FACTOR S","paragraphs":["Our main problems resulted from working with a new and incomplete system . Too ofte n we had to devote our time to fixing bugs or making improvements in the skimmer, in th e graphic representation tools, and in the knowledge addition tools . Starting with a smal l vocabulary and little linguistic and domain knowledge was disadvantageous . Adding a lot o f knowledge to the system over a short period of time caused many problems to surface (e .g . , initializing the system became a time-waster, system tables overflowed several times) . Lack o f an internal representation for information extracted from the text was yet another limitation o n development ."]},{"title":"TRAININ G","paragraphs":["We used the entire development corpus, including the key templates, for gatherin g domain information . For example, we used the key templates to get fairly complete lists o f perpetrators, targets, instruments, and so on . Similarly, we searched the corpus for keywords , temporal, locative, and other patterns . Many of our domain-specific grammar rules wer e crafted using the results of such searches .","The first 100 messages of the development set served as a primary development an d testing vehicle . TST1 messages were run occasionally in order to gauge progress on unseen message sets .","In order to shake out bugs in the system, we processed half the development set i n batches of 100 messages several days before the testing deadline ."]},{"title":"STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSE S","paragraphs":["In general, skimming worked much better than expected . Based merely on our initia l results for MUC3, we conclude that skimming is a powerful adjunct to deeper processing of text . We feel that with several months' work, continued development of skimming techniques , combined with knowledge base and vocabulary development, would substantially raise our MUC 3 score .","Skimming provides extremely fast, simple, and robust text processing . While keyword and pattern-based methods for NLP have usually met with scorn, we feel a review of thes e methods is called for .","On the other hand, we are aware of the limitations of any approach that doesn't analyz e text as deeply as possible . In order to segment incidents with great accuracy, linguistic contex t 93 as well as script-level understanding of the text are required . Many reference resolutio n problems also require such knowledge .","In the near future, we will merge our skimming capability with a bottom-up syntacti c analysis mechanism, and also incorporate script-based understanding mechanisms .","The INLET customization tools have proved their worth by supporting hierarchy , grammar rule, and vocabulary addition . Even our qualified success would have been impossibl e without the effectiveness of the knowledge addition framework ."]},{"title":"HITS AND MISSE S","paragraphs":["Our system is fairly good at determining the incident type, using a hierarchy of ke y words and patterns . With just a few specialized rules, the system is able to process appositive s to find perpetrators, perpetrator organizations, physical targets, and human targets . A n extensive temporal grammar was developed, though not much correlation of multiple tempora l references has been implemented . A similar situation holds for locative phrases .","Simple gaps in knowledge and vocabulary caused many misses on the TST2 messages . Missing vocabulary (e .g ., \"killings\"), missing domain rules (e .g ., \"explosion caused damage\") , missing generic rules (e .g ., \"actor participated in action on object\"), and missing mechanism s of various kinds led to substantially lower performance than we would expect of a more matur e INLET system . Missing mechanisms include lack of threat handling, lack of any inferencin g capability, lack of spelling correction, and lack of rejection of incidents for even simple reason s (e .g ., an abstract object such as the \"economy\" is attacked) ."]},{"title":"PORTABILIT Y","paragraphs":["Because INLET is a customization shell, portability of the specific knowledge added to th e system is not a major concern . In 2 man-months, we were able to achieve a 25% recall and 35% precision score with a relatively immature INLET system . When the system is completed , we expect similar customization time to result in a better system for the particular domain an d task .","The skimmer framework and knowledge addition framework are generic, as is the core knowledge base and vocabulary . On top of this layer is a substantial body of domain-specifi c code and knowledge, which would necessarily have to be replaced for a new domain and task ."]},{"title":"LESSONS LEARNE D","paragraphs":["We have demonstrated that the INLET knowledge addition framework and skimmer ca n quickly support customization to a new domain and task . We have found that the graphic interface for knowledge addition has speeded up customization over a system like VOX . Finally , we have found that skimming is a critical adjunct to deeper NLP .","Our participation in MUC3 has shown us the high value of formal testing and compariso n with other NLP efforts . We intend to continue using the MUC3 corpus and testing system for ou r system development, test, and evaluation . 94"]}]}
