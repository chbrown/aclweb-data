The experiment performed as part of the MUC-3 evaluation was aimed at determinin g whether linguistic phenomena can be tested in isolation for state-of-the-art dat a extraction . Although not all of the methods of data extraction used by the participants in MUC-3 directly process linguistic phenomena, the methods are dealing with those phenomena in some manner because they are present in the input . Phenomena testing in MUC-3 is testing according to the characteristics of th e messages rather than characteristics of the systems processing those messages . \\t","I n order to determine the validity of phenomena testing at the current level of syste m performance, an experiment was run . The results of the experiment indicate that linguistic phenomena are isolatable and that performance for linguistic phenomen a can be measured using the MUC-3 scoring system ."]},{"title":"DESIG N","paragraphs":["The problem is to devise a test to measure the performance of a data extractio n system with respect to a single linguistic phenomenon . The experiment took several approaches to devising such a test to determine whether the phenomenon had bee n isolated . The design of the experiment required the choice of a linguistic phenomenon frequently appearing in the messages and critical to the template fill task .","The slots from phrases exhibiting the phenomenon would be scored an d compared to the overall scores . If there was no correlation with the overall scores , then the possibility that overall scores were fully determining the phenomenon' s scores would be eliminated and isolating the phenomenon would be possible . Th e slots filled from the sentences were scored and compared to the overall scores as wel l as the scores obtained for the slots filled from the phrases . If the scores for the sentences correlated more closely with the scores for the phrases than they did with th e overall scores, then it would be more likely that the scoring was isolating th e phenomenon . Processing of the phrase can have an effect on the processing of th e entire sentence . If the results for the phrases and the sentences coincide, then i t would be feasible to use scores for slots from entire sentences for future phenomen a testing .","Slots from phrases exhibiting well-defined subsets of the phenomenon woul d be scored and compared to each other. The results of the comparisons that can b e predicted or explained would give us more confidence that we have isolated th e phenomenon . 31","Altered messages would be produced without the phenomenon for purposes o f a \"minimal pair\" type test .

An example of an appositive from the test corpus is \"David Lecky, Director of the Columbus School .\" Ther e , were approximately 60 sentences in the test corpus containing one or more appositives which were critical to slot fills . Preliminary phenomena testing for thre e other phenomena occurring with varying frequencies suggested that a frequency o f 20 was adequate for testing purposes . With more than 60 instances of apposition , subdividing the set for testing well-defined subsets would still leave adequate numbers in the subdivisions . Also, there many more cases of appositives which affected slot fills, but could not be included in the testing because there were other source s for the slot fills elsewhere in the message .

The configuration option files for the scorin g system were constructed to score just those slots directly affected by the presence o f an appositive .
