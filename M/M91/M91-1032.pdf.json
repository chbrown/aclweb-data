The Unisys MUC-3 system, however, consists primarily of components that are less than 7 months old and still in a developmental stage . Although the three-tiered processing approach that the MUC-3 system's architecture is based upon includes Pundit as its third level of (linguistic ) analysis, the incorporation of Pundit into the MUC-3 system was not achieved in time for the final MUC- 3 test in May, 1991 . A decision was made to focus on the development of a knowledge-based informatio n retrieval component, and this precluded the integration of Pundit into the prototype) The Unisys MUC- 3 system without its linguistic analysis component is depicted in Figure 1 .

Template Selection. The process of determining which template structures to build out of the fact s inferred by KBIRD begins by determining if any events at all have been predicted . If no event has been predicted, then an \"irrelevant template\" is created . If several events of the same type have been created , the template generator will attempt to merge them using a set of heuristics which hypothesize that two event descriptions refer to the same event . Some of the general heuristics used for merging events of the same class are : • Merge two events if there is a significant overlap in the text regions found by the event locator rules. • Merge two events if they share human targets whose scores are above a certain threshold . • Merge two events if they share physical targets whose scores are above a certain threshold . 215 Slot Filler Selection . After merging events, the template generator must select the final slot fille r values . The KBIRD rules which propose slot fillers attach a score (an integer between 0 and 100) to eac h candidate which represents the system's confidence in that value . If multiple candidate fillers exist for a given template, several general heuristics are used to select among them : • Candidate slot values with scores below a given threshold are dropped from consideration . • A set of synonymous expressions are dropped in favor of their canonical expression . • If one candidate expression is a substring of another, then the shorter one is dropped . • A generic description (e .g ., vehicles) is dropped in favor of one or more subsumed ones (e .g ., ambu-","lance, truck) . • If a slot can only take a single value then the candidate receiving the highest value is selected ."]},{"title":"A Linguistic Analysis Component (Pundit )","paragraphs":["The Pundit natural language processing system has been under development at Unisys for the last fiv e years and is capable of performing a detailed linguistic analysis of an input text . Unlike KBIRD, Pundit abstracts away from the actual strings used to convey information in a text at the very beginning of it s analysis process by determining to which syntactic properties and domain concepts the lexical items i n the text correspond . These syntactic properties and domain concepts are then processed without muc h attention being paid to their physical location in the text . In KBIRD, on the other hand, everything that is manipulated, even concepts that have been asserted, are explicitly associated with regions of text .","A key capability that the deeper linguistic processing of Pundit can provide is the determination o f the grammatical and thematic roles of expressions in a text . Thus, it can determine that in the sentenc e \"Castellar is the second mayor that has been murdered in Colombia in the last 3 days\" that Castellar is th e subject of the copular verb in the matrix clause, and that Castellar should inherit properties asserted of the predicate nominal argument . It can also recognize the passive voice of the relative/subordinate claus e headed by that and thus that it is Castellar that has been murdered (as the second mayor) in Columbia.","It would be possible to build a KBIRD rulebase that performs the sort of detailed linguistic analysis no w being performed by Pundit .

Predicting Additional Event Types . In some cases the co-occurrence of an instance of some even t type predicted by the keyword-based analysis component with words or inferred concepts that have bee n detected in a text will allow KBIRD to infer additional event types . For example, the following KBIR D rule, which was triggered in the processing of message 0099, asserts that the occurrence of \"BURNED\" in the active voice in a message for which an instance of a bombing event has been discovered is enough t o predict the likely occurrence of an arson event . \"BURNED\" < . be_word(W) , actual_event('BOMBING',_,_) , [\"predicted_event_type('ARSON') ]","__> probable_event('ARSON') .

The process of instantiating event types, or locating events, is initiated in KBIR D through a class of locator rules, which attempt to find \"hot spots\" in the text which seem to be discussin g events of the predicted type .

On the other hand, the second rule for inferring instances of bombing events will suddenly have all of its antecedent constraint s met when this latter phrase is encountered, and so it will fire to create a new instance of a bombing .
