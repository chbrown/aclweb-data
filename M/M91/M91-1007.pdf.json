In general, MUC-3 was a very successful effort for GE . The NLTooLsET, a suite of natural language tex t processing tools designed for easy application in new domains, proved its mettle, as we were quickly able t o show good results on the MUC-3 task . Even on TST2, where we experienced some system-level problems , all of our results were in the top group, and the program was especially accurate at filling out templates . There were, however, some surprises that resulted from MUC-3, including the major differences in syste m capabilities that are largely hidden in the scores, as well as the relative ease of sentence-level interpretation .","On the positive side, MUC-3 provided a thorough, fair test of system capabilities . The methodology of testing on a real task, along with the benefit of a common corpus, has produced advances in the fiel d as well as highlighting certain new aspects of text interpretation . Certain parts of our system, includin g a lexically-driven pre-processor and knowledge-based language analysis mechanism, worked extremely well , while other issues, such as our lack of an explicit discourse representation, prevented us from doing better . This recognition of strengths and weaknesses comes directly from the results of the MUC-3 experiment .","On the negative side, too much of each system's score, as well as the work involved in the task, is fro m applying \"rules of the game\", and future MUCs must try to minimize this component . Some of these rule s are not tied either to text processing capabilities or to the practical requirements of the task . Anothe r problem is how to determine from the results what a system is actually doing, as some major difference s between systems proved largely hidden in the MUC-3 scoring . In this report, we will attempt to relate th e evaluation results to system capabilities as well as to suggest some methods for attributing different aspect s of the scores to particular types of processing ."]},{"title":"RESULT S","paragraphs":["Our overall results on TST2 were very good in relation to other systems, but we devoted much of our analysi s to explaining why they were much lower than our expectations .","The GE results on TST2 are unusual in that we experienced a considerable drop in performance betwee n TST1 and TST2, in spite of enhancements to our system that showed substantial improvement on ou r testing prior to TST2 . Part of the drop is attributable to system-level problems introduced directly befor e the test . To determine the effect of these problems, we produced a revised run with two one-line changes i n the system code . However, even this revised run shows a significant difference between runs on TST1 an d the development corpus and the TST2 . 60","The following table summarizes our results on the second test, TST2, both officially and with the syste m problems corrected ."]},{"title":"Revised Run \\t Original Ru n REC PREC OVERGEN REC PREC OVERGE N 62 62 20 58","paragraphs":["63"]},{"title":"1 8 52 62 20 42","paragraphs":["63"]},{"title":"1 8 52 45 42 42","paragraphs":["46"]},{"title":"4 0 50 61 22 39","paragraphs":["60"]},{"title":"21","paragraphs":["Figure 1 : GE MUC-3 TST2 Revised Results* (Unofficial) vs .

The most likely hypothesis is that our program performed substantially lower on TST 2 than on other runs, because the strategy we chose in the final configuration was overly cautious in producin g templates, while the answer key had an unusually large number of templates . This hypothesis is supported b y the higher performance of our system in the MATCHED-ONLY row (see Figure 3 below) . The fact that ou r program produced less than half as many templates as the system with the highest MATCHED/MISSIN G recall, combined with the fact that the answer key contained more templates than other sets, adds to th e evidence that our program paid a \"recall penalty\" for generating fewer templates .","To test this theory, we conducted a number of experiments, two of which involved using different strategie s that we had viewed as being sub-optimal . In one test, we eliminated all portions of code that cut out spuriou s templates, causing the program to generate about twice as many templates per message set, where mos t of the additional templates were incorrect (because the code had been specifically designed to eliminat e incorrect templates, not correct ones) . This change, certainly not one that improved the program, resulte d in a 6-point gain in recall on the TST1 set (shown by TST1 ovg in Figure 2) with a 3-point loss in precision .","Then, we tried an experiment by blindly copying every template in our answer key (without changing th e program or the answers otherwise) . This resulted in a 6-point gain in recall with a 6-point loss in precision . Since these extra templates could not possibly be matching correctly (because no two events should b e alike), this experiment also shows that generating incorrect templates tends to result in higher recall than not generating enough templates, and suggests that overgenerating more intelligently tends to improve recal l more than it hurts precision .","The TST2 set contained far more templates, as well as far more optional templates, than TST1 or the average for 100 messages in the development set . The development answer key contained, on average , 8 optional templates per 100 messages, while TST1 had 7 and TST2 had 32 . The development answers averaged 83 filled templates per 100 messages, and TST1 and TST2 had 95 and 130, respectively .","Systems that overgenerate at the template level tend to be more impervious to changes in the percentag e of OPTIONAL templates because extra templates are more likely to match, perhaps felicitously . In addition , overgenerating at the template level helps to prevent missing non-optional templates, which have the greates t effect on MATCHED/1VIISSING recall . 6 2","Figure 3 gives a concise summary of the number of templates each system generated with respect t o their recall in MATCHED/MISSING (M/M REC) and MATCHED-ONLY (M-O REC) . Our system kep t its template overgeneration very low . Li fact, only 3 sites had lower template overgeneration, none o f them within 20 recall points . One system with slightly higher recall produced 148 additional spurious templates . Note that the systems with lower template overgeneration also tend to get a bigger gain in recal l in MATCHED-ONLY .","The results seem to show a surprising variation from one test set to another, as well as an importan t tradeoff between template overgeneration and recall, especially in the important MATCHED/MISSIN G column . In retrospect, we believe that our overall TST2 results would have been closer to the expecte d performance of our system had we been less cautious about avoiding spurious templates . On the other hand , it might have been a good idea to measure template overgeneration (as well as the \"accidental\" matchin g of templates) as part of the results, since these incorrect templates are not a good thing . In most systems , overgeneration probably came from trying to maximize MATCHED/MISSING recall, so the MUC-3 scor e reporting didn't suggest that template overgeneration was a real issue . Probably the test design for MUC- 4 should show the relationship between template performance and overall scores more clearly."]},{"title":"EFFORT","paragraphs":["We spent overall approximately between 1 and 1 .5 person-years on MUC-3 .

These tasks include event referenc e resolution and inference . For example, some correct templates in TST2 depended on distinguishing tw o events based on the knowledge that. Cartagena is a resort, assuming that two men leaving a package in a restaurant could be planting a bomb, and generating an extra template for a series of kidnappings because on e of them took place on a particular day . These many discourse and event-based issues overwhelm the relativel y minor problems of parsing and semantic interpretation . Robustness of linguistic processing for MUC-3 was surprisingly easy to achieve, while the intricacies of template generation were surprisingly difficult to master . 63"]},{"title":"Trainin g","paragraphs":["Our method of training was to run our system over the messages in the development and TST1 corpus . We used the results of these runs to detect problems and determine what new capabilities we needed to mak e these test stories work . We did not perform any automated training, although we did make heavy use of a keyword-in-context browser and some use of data from a tagged corpus .","As explained above, lexical coverage and parsing did not seem to stand in the way of major performance gains for MUC-3, so we did not focus our efforts in these areas .","Our system improved fairly steadily over time, as the graph shown in Figure 2 illustrates .","These improvements were gained through a combination of adding knowledge, fixing bugs, adding som e capabilities (like template splitting and merging) and coding MUC-specific tasks (like distinguishing guerrill a warfare from terrorist activity) ."]},{"title":"RETROSPECTIVE ON THE TASK AND RESULT S","paragraphs":["In retrospect, over the last six month period, there were no major changes to our system that we would hav e made for MUC as a result of our experience with this corpus and task .","With a minimum of customization (perhaps one or two person months of effort), our system quickl y reached the level of performance on MUC-3 achieved by the other top systems . This ultimately proved a bit discouraging, as progress from that point on was quite slow, but it is evidence that the NLTooLsET system , designed for easy adaptation to new tasks and domains, does what it is supposed to do .","The most successful portion of our system that was designed for this task was the text reduction mechanism [1] . The NLTooLsET now uses a lexico-semantic pattern matcher as a text pre-preprocessor to reduc e the complexity of the sentences passed to the parser . This allowed us to keep the system running in rea l time, prevented the parser from dealing with overly complex sentences, and achieved more accurate results . In addition, the pre-processor allowed a discourse processing module to divide the input text roughly int o events prior to parsing, which seemed to have a considerable positive effect on later processing (see the pape r on discourse in this volume )","The speed of our system, over 1000/words per minute on this task on conventional hardware without an y major optimizations, is already way ahead of human performance and suggests that this technology will b e able to process large volumes of text .","We were similarly pleased that the sentence-level performance of the NLTooLsET was as good as it was . While we fixed minor problems with the lexicon, grammar, parser, and semantic interpreter, robustness o f linguistic processing did not seem to be a major problem . In part, this seems to be because the MUC- 3 domain is still quite narrow . It is much broacler than MUCK-II, and the linguistic complexity is a challenge , but knowledge base and control issues are relatively minor because there are simply not that many differen t ways that bombings, murders, and kidnappings occur .","The fact that sentence-level interpretation wasn't a major barrier in MUC-3 has both good and ba d implications . Fortunately, we can expect that progress in new (perhaps extra-linguistic) areas will soo n bring system performance on this sort. of task ahead of human performance, and make this research pay off in real applications . Unfortunately, it. is unclear whether this new progress will spill over into other domain s and applications, or whether it will lead to narrowly-focused development for future MUCs . The combination of a narrow domain with broad linguistic issues could make non-linguistic solutions more attractive for thi s sort of task . The only way to test the degree to which these solutions are reusable is to keep testing syste m transportability and evaluating performance on new and broader tasks ."]},{"title":"ISSUES IN EVALUATIO N","paragraphs":["After analyzing the results of our system and the primary measures of comparison between systems (recall , precision and overgeneration in the MATCHED/MISSING row), we realized that several factors in syste m performance were being confounded and/or not being measured . We isolated six, interrelated measures o f system performance as follows : 1 . Recall : Gross, overall recall can be estimated by the MATCHED/MISSING column . 64 2. Precision : Gross, overall precision call be estimated by the MATCHED/MISSING column .","3 . Template Overgeneration : The OVERGENERATION column in the ALL-TEMPLATES score repor t is the best overall measure of template overgeneration .","4 . Slot Overgeneration : Subtracting the TEMPLATE-ID scores from the MATCHED/MISSING over - generation column results in slot overgeneration .","5 . Quality of Fills : Recall and precision in the MATCHED-ONLY row, when template-ID and spuriou s templates are subtracted, provides an approximation to how well the templates that are filled out ar e filled out .","6 . Template Match : There are two aspects to how well a system matches the templates that are in the answer key . One is the number of templates systems generate, and the other is how accurate the type s of those templates are . The precision of the TEMPLATE-ID row gives a measure of how close the number of answer templates were given . Precision and recall of the INCIDENT-TYPE slot also giv e the accuracy of the templates matched .","Any measure of the performance of a data extraction system must have a meaningful way of combining the effects of template level decisions with slot-filling ability, but must also distinguish slot-filling from templat e decisions for system comparison . Template-level decisions are : • When to create a templat e • What type of template to creat e • When to merge multiple templates • When to eliminate a templat e","Template-level decisions reflect a system's ability to carve out messages into discrete topics or individua l events . This includes text-level issues such as when a new event is being introduced as opposed to givin g further detail on an already mentioned event, and determining the topic or type of that event .","Slot-level decisions relate to the quality of the template fills once the decision has been made as to whic h and how many templates to generate . In general, slot-level decisions are closer to and represent more th e core language processing capabilities than template-level decisions .","The interaction of recall, precision and overgeneration presents additional challenges in evaluating systems, and MUC-3 should provide ample data to test the utility of combined metrics . In addition, it i s important to be able use the scores on the MUC task both for comparing systems and for proving th e ultimate utility of the systems . The MUC-3 results might seem low to those not really familiar with th e tests, while many of the systems could already be extremely useful even without major improvements i n performance .","Finally, estimates providing a margin of error for all the scores on a MUC-like task are necessary in order to compare results meaningfully . This error comes from the inherent imprecision in any \"right answer \" against which scores are computed, and the inevitable difference in the performance of systems from one tes t set to another ."]},{"title":"LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA TES T","paragraphs":["Our results on the linguistic test of apposition are interesting, as we estimate that we recognize 90% of thes e syntactic structures with regular expression patterns in a context-independent pre-processing stage, prior t o the application of any syntactic parsing using our context-free grammar .","The slot configuration files confounded the pure test of recall and precision with respect to appositio n by not factoring out entire templates that were missed (presumably an issue not related to the treatmen t of the appositive) . Also complicating a \"pure\" test is the penalty for spurious fills included in those slots where the appositives were present ; again, an error unr elated to the fill that contained the appositive . 65","We corrected for these interfering effects to get a truer measure of the performance . This was done by eliminating from the test score those slots not present because of missing templates, and eliminatin g the spurious slot fills . With these corrections, we calculated recall for the \"easy\" cases to be 96% from 72 % (unrevised) . The hard cases went from 43% recall to 89% recall (again, unrevised) . This difference is entirel y attributed to one example . Based on this, we would not want to draw any substantive conclusions on our performance of easy vs . hard appositives .","Our results on the linguistic phenomena tests show that our performance on the same sentence appositive s was better than the same information distributed across multiple sentences . This was expected, as our syste m does not use the semantic interpretation of \"to be\" sentences to modify the type assignments of targets . The cases here where the assignments were correct were cases of our default typing, CIVILIAN .","The preposed appositives were more accurate than the postposed . We would have expected that postposed would be easier because it is easier to determine their boundaries .

These techniques are detailed in the system walkthrough paper (cf . this volume) . We feel that a fair amount of effort has gone into system development for the apposition, so, from this regard, thes e tests seem to reflect that linguistic phenomena are not as important for overall performance as other factors .

Non-specific Events : Eliminate all templates that report in a non-specific events .","Template Splitting : Deciding on when to generate a separate template based on the granularity of th e reported locations and dates for any given incident .","We believe that, to test text processing systems, fine lines of distinction between relevant and irrelevan t texts should be left to human beings, and that the MUC task should focus on accurate information extraction , not subtle judgements of relevance or validity . One proposal, which has been tentatively adopted for MUC - 4, is to encode these distinctions as slot fills as opposed to template/no-template decisions ; for example , GUERRILLA-WARFARE could be a TYPE-OF-INCIDENT as opposed to an IRRELEVANT template .
