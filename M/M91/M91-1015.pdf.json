In particular, it refers to the various modules of the system which ar e described in that paper . Here only the overall results will be summarized . A more detailed, component-by-component analysis of the results is contained in the System Summary .","Our results for the TST2 corpus were as follows :","Recall Precisio n Matched Templates 44 6 5 Matched/Missing 25 6 5 All Templates 25 48","Our precision was the highest of any of the sites . Our recall was somewhere in the middle . It is as ye t unclear whether high recall-high precision systems will evolve more rapidly from low recall-high precisio n systems or high recall-low precision systems .","The significant drop in recall we experienced from Matched Templates Only to Matched/Missing is a n indication that we were failing on messages with a large number of template entries . Much of this is probabl y due to failures in handling lists of names, and could be improved by specialized handling of this phenomenon .","We also ran our system, configured identically to the TST2 run, on the first 100 messages of the development set . The results were as follows :","Recall Precision Matched Templates 46 64 Matched/Missing 37 64 All Templates 37 5 3","Here recall was considerably better, as would be expected since the messages were used for development .","While there are a number of parameter settings possible in our system, we decided upon optimal values , and those values were used . An explanation of the parameters and how we decided what was optimal is to o detailed and system-particular for this report . None of the decisions was made on the basis of total recal l and precision on a test set . All the decisions were made on a much more local basis ."]},{"title":"LEVEL OF EFFORT","paragraphs":["The only way of even approximating the amount of time spent on this effort is from figures on tim e charged to the project . All participants in the MUC-3 process will realize that this is not a very reliable wa y of estimating the level of effort .","Since the preliminary MUC-3 workshop in February, approximately 800 person-hours were spent on th e project . 105 The only possible way to break that down into subtasks is by personnel . Preprocessor, system development, testing : 180 hours Development of parsing algorithms : \\t 180 hours Grammar development : \\t 220 hours Pragmatics and template-generation : \\t 220 hours"]},{"title":"THE LIMITING FACTO R","paragraphs":["Time ."]},{"title":"TRAININ G","paragraphs":["The amount of the training corpus that was used varied with the component . For the relevance filter, al l 1400 available messages were used . For the lexicon, every word in the first 600 and last 200 messages and i n the TST1 corpus were entered . For the remaining messages, those words occurring more than once and al l non-nouns were entered .","For syntax and pragmatics, we were able only to focus on the first 100 messages in the developmen t corpus .","Tests were run almost entirely on the first 100 messages because those were the only ones for which a reliable key existed and because concentrating on those would give us a stable measure of progress .","The system improved over time . On the February TST1 run, our recall was 14% and our precision wa s 68% on Matched and Missing Templates . At the end of March, on the first 100 messages in the developmen t set, our recall was 22% and our precision was 63% . At the time of the TST2 evaluation, on the first 10 0 messages in the development set, our recall was 37% and our precision was 64% ."]},{"title":"WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT SUCCESSFU L","paragraphs":["As described in the System Summary, we felt that the treatment of unknown words was for the mos t part adequate .","The statistical relevance filter was extremely successful . The keyword antifilter, on the other hand, i s apparently far too coarse and needs to be refined or eliminated .","We felt syntactic analysis was a stunning success . At the beginning of this effort, we despaired of bein g able to handle sentences of the length and complexity of those in the MUC-3 corpus, and indeed man y sites abandoned syntactic analysis altogether . Now, however, we feel that the syntactic analysis of materia l such as this is very nearly a solved problem . The coverage of our grammar, our scheduling parser, and ou r heuristic of using the best sequence of fragments for failed parses combined to enable us to get a very hig h proportion of the propositional content out of every sentence . The mistakes that we found in the first 2 0 messages of TST2 can, for the most part, be attributed to about five or six causes, which could be remedie d with a few days work .","On the other hand, the results for terminal substring parsing, our method for dealing with sentences o f more than 60 words, are inconclusive, and we believe this technique could be improved .","In pragmatics, much work remains to be done . A large number of fairly simple axioms need to be written , as well as some more complex axioms . In the course of our preparation for MUC-2 and MUC-3, we hav e made sacrifices in robustness for the sake of efficiency, and we would like to re-examine the trade-offs . We would like to push more of the problems of syntactic and lexical ambiguity into the pragmatics component , rather than relying on syntactic heuristics . We would also like to further constrain factoring, which no w sometimes results in the incorrect identification of distinct events .","In template-generation, we feel our basic framework is adequate, but a great many details must be added .","The module we would most like to rewrite is in fact not now a module but should be . It consists of the various treatments of subcategorization, selectional constraints, generation of canonical predicate-argumen t relations, and the sort hierarchy in pragmatics . At the present time, due to various historical accidents an d compromises, these are all effectively separate . The new module would give a unified treatment to this whol e set of phenomena . 106"]},{"title":"USABILITY FOR OTHER APPLICATION S","paragraphs":["In the preprocessor, the spelling corrector and the morphological word assignment component are usabl e in other applications without change .","The methods used in the relevance filter are usable in other applications, but, of course, the particula r statistical model and set of keywords are not .","In the syntactic analysis component, the grammar and parsing programs and the vast majority of the core lexicon are usable without change in another application . Only about five or six grammar rules are particular to this domain, encoding the structure of the heading, interview conventions, \"[words indistinct]\" , and so on . The logical form produced is application-independent .","The theorem prover on which the pragmatics component is based is application-independent . All of the enhancements we have made in our 1VIUC-3 effort would have benefited our MUC-2 effort as well .","In the knowledge base, only about 20 core axioms carried over from the opreps domain to the terroris t domain . Since most of the current set of axioms is geared toward MUC-3 's particular task, there would ver y probably not be much more of a carry-over to a new domain .","The extent to which the template-generation component would carry over to a new application depend s on the extent to which the same baroque requirements are imposed on the output ."]},{"title":"WHAT WAS LEARNED ABOUT EVALUATIO N","paragraphs":["On the one hand, the mapping from texts to templates is discontinuous in the extreme . One mishandle d semicolon can cost 4% in recall in the overall score, for example . Therefore, the numerical results of thi s evaluation must he taken with a grain of salt . Things can he learned about the various systems only b y a deeper analysis of their performance . On the other hand, the task is difficult enough to provide a rea l challenge, so that pushing recall and precision both into the 70s or 80s will require the system to do virtuall y everything right .","Leading up to MUC-3 there were a great many difficulties to be worked out, diverting the attention o f researchers from research to the mechanics of evaluation . It is to be hoped that most of these problems hav e been settled and that for 1\\'IUC-4 they will constitute less of a. drain on researchers ' time .","We feel the task of the MUC-3 evaluation is both feasible and challenging in the relatively short term . How practical it is is for others to judge ."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S","paragraphs":["This research has been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Office of Nava l Research contracts N00014-85-C-0013 and N00014-90-C-0220 . 107"]}]}
