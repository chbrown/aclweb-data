{"sections":[{"title":"APPENDIX A : EVALUATION TASK DESCRIPTIO N 1 .0 WHAT CONSTITUTES","paragraphs":["A \"RELEVANT\" INCIDENT ?","Relevant incidents are, in general, violent acts perpetrated with political aim s and a motive of intimidation . These are acts of terrorism . Here is an official , \"schoolbook\" definition of terrorism : \"a sudden, unexpected act of shocking, calculated, and unlawful violence, o r the plausible threat of such violence, by an illegal, subnational, clandestin e group -- usually carried out in a peaceful, civilian environment, be i t urban, rural, in the air or on a body of water -- against certai n noncombatants or targets that represent or symbolize a certain country, bu t sometimes indiscrimately against bystanders or passersby at a particula r location, with the intention of garnering publicity, propagandizing a cause , and intimating as many people as possible in order to attain social, political , or strategic objectives . \" -Rex A . Hudson, \"Dealing with Internationa l Hostage-Taking : Alternatives to Reactiv e Counterterrorist Assaults,\" Internationa l Terrorism, Vol . 12, 1990 .","This has been turned into more of an operational definition by widening th e schoolbook definition somewhat and making some rather arbitrary distinctions . Your advice on how to improve on this operational definition is welcome . 1) \\t Terrorist acts may be perpetrated by an \"illegal, subnational, clandestin e group,\" which includes known guerrilla and drug-traffickin g organizations . Their targets may be just about anything/anybody except (a ) another such group or member of such a group or (b) a military/polic e installation or force (with the same nationality as the perpetrator), or a member of such a force, in which case the incident is presumed to be a purely guerrilla act and is not relevant to the MUC-3 terrorist inciden t database . Thus, killings of drug traffickers will not be included in th e database (by exception a, above), nor will \"clashes\" between guerrill a groups and the military (by exception b, above) . However, if a guerrilla warfare incident happens to affect civilia n personnel or property, whether intentionally or accidentally, the inciden t becomes relevant and should be included in the database . In these cases, th e database should contain information on both the military and th e nonmilitary targets . Similarly, the database will include incidents of sabotage on a nation' s infrastructure . It will also include incidents perpetrated against individual s who are former members of the military, e .g ., a murder perpetrated agains t a retired general . A—1 Sometimes an article gives mixed reports, e .g ., a \"terrorist attack\" on a bridge guarded by the national (military) police . In a case such as this , which could be interpreted as a case of terrorism (sabotage of the nation' s infrastructure) or of guerrilla warfare (attack on a physical target o f military importance), we will consider the physical target to be nonmilitar y and will include the incident in the database .","2) Under certain circumstances, the perpetrator may be a member of th e government, including the military . This is the case when the target i s civilian .","3) Sometimes the perpetrator is not identified and no language is used t o indicate that the act is *not* being attributed to \"terrorists,\" \"extremists, \" \"subversives,\" \"guerrillas,\" etc . In these cases, as long as the act itself is o f one of the expected types and the target(s) is/are not exclusively military , the incident will be presumed to be a possible terrorist act and is to b e included in the database .","4) The articles in the MUC-3 corpus originate in many different parts of th e world, but they all emphasize something about one of the nine Lati n American countries of interest (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras , Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) . However, only incident s whose perpetrator(s) or target(s) \"belong to\" one of the nine countries o f interest belong in the MUC-3 database . Thus, an incident perpetrated agains t a human target who is a citizen of one of those countries may belong in th e database even if that person is attacked while he's in a different country . O r an incident perpetrated against the embassy of one of those nine countrie s may belong in the database, no matter where that embassy is located .","5) Only terrorist acts (and attempted acts) that are reported as factual are to b e included in the database . An incident is *not* to be recorded in the database if the article discredits the story or cites a source that discredits the story . (However, if the article also cites a source that *supports* the story, tha t version of the story should go in the database .) Rumors are to be excluded .","6) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if it is \"recent .\" The inten t is to include only information that is new or updated . We define \"recent\" t o mean that either (a) it occurred within two months of the date of the articl e or (b) new information is being provided in the article on an incident tha t occured more than two months prior, such as new suspects being brough t forth as the perpetrators of an old crime . However, there are a number o f articles that fail to mention the date of the incidents, some of which are, i n fact, recent . Therefore, if there is no indication that the information is no t recent or if there is no indication that the information is being given onl y to provide historical context (as indicated by phrases such as \"Let us recal l that . . .\"), the incident should go in the database .","7) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if the article's descriptio n of it is \"specific .\" Generic descriptions of incidents like \"terrorist attacks o n the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline\" and summary descriptions like \"th e total persons kidnapped in Colombia over the last 6 weeks was 85\" are to b e excluded . A—2","The articles sometimes give useful information about a specific incident bu t provide very few details . Therefore, as long as all the other criteria are met, w e will include any incident that at least indicates the nature of the target or th e nature of the attack . Thus, an article whose only reference to an incident is \"a n attack perpetrated by a subversive group\" or \"the tragic incident at Uchiza\" woul d be excluded, but an article that says \"Last night there were fewer attacks on store s and electric towers in the capital\" or \"a UCR district headquarters in Buenos Aire s province was completely destroyed by a bomb explosion\" would be included .","Here are two further examples of texts that do *not* warrant generation o f templates : \"As of 0500 GMT today, the police had received reports of two othe r explosions in two La Paz neighborhoods\" (the nature of the explosion isn' t mentioned, and the target isn't mentioned either) ; \"the bombing on San Salvador' s neighborhoods\" (the prepositional phrase may be interpreted as conveying th e target as well as the location, but as a target, it's too general -- any location nam e that is on the set list cannot serve as a target ID, with the exception of farm names) . 2 .0 DEFINITIONS OF SLOT TYPE S","0 .

A question mark preceding a filler indicates that generation of this filler is optional, i .e ., that null (hyphen) is also a correct system response . 5 .0 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR GENERATING MORE THAN ONE TEMPLAT E PER ARTICL E","If an article discusses more than one relevant type of terrorist incident, eac h such incident should be captured in a separate template . If an article discusse s more than one instance of the same relevant type of terrorist incident, each suc h incident should be captured in a separate template . A \"separate instance\" is on e which has a different filler for the location, date, category, or perpetrator slot . I f no distinctions of these kinds are made in the text, the instances should b e incorporated into a single template, e .g ., if the article describes \"attacks\" b y \"rebels\" on \"ten power stations\" and does not give varying information on th e location of those targets, etc . Note that the level of granularity is defined by wha t can go in a slot ; thus, an article that describes two bombings on targets on different streets in the same neighborhood should be captured in one templat e rather than two, since the location slot cannot have a filler that is at the level o f granularity of a street . 6 .0 DATA TYPES FOR FILLER S 0 . \\t","MESSAGE ID 1.
