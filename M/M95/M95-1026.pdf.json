Example of Template Element Objects \\t 1 1 347 1 Overview of Information Extraction Task 1.1 Scenario-Dependent and Scenario-Independent Subtask s The overall goal of the Information Extraction (IE) task is to provide an evaluation of IE technology with reduced overhead and reduced non-NU requirements, as compared to recent MUCs . To enforce the requirements for reduced overhead, the participant preparation for the evaluation will consist of two stages . The first stage will be scenario-independent, and will begin well in advance of the evaluation ; the second stage of participant preparation , which is scenario-dependent, will start just one month prior to the evaluation . As currently envisioned, the task to be performed during test week will consist of two subtasks :","SUBTASK 1 . Scenario Template evaluation, the so-called \"Mini-MUC,\" is the traditional template-leve l subtask, where the participants are evaluated on whether the templates contain exactly the instantiated objects an d filled slots as specified in the scenario definition (and reflected in the answer key), with penalties for spurious , missing, and wrong objects and slot fills .","SUBTASK 2. Template Element evaluation, the so-called \"predefined objects\" evaluation . There are thre e types of Template Element objects, ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ARTIFACT . One difficulty with the Scenario Template subtask is that it is subject to the \"lynchpin\" or \"keystone\" effect, where a decision whether to instantiate an object carries a high penalty if wrong (points off for each slot fill in that object under the All Objects scorin g method) . We can reduce the lynchpin effect by having a subtask which does not involve scenario-dependen t relevance criteria . Furthermore, this subtask is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step u p from the aggregation of the Named Entity task and the Coreference task . For example, for the Template Element evaluation, an ORGANIZATION object and all possible slots defined fo r that object type are to be instantiated for each organization mentioned in a given text, even if a given Scenari o Template task confines itself to organizations which are airplane manufacturers and requires an organization's typ e but not its location . For the Scenario Template evaluation, only those Template Element object and slot types that appear in the scenario task definition will be tested . ARTIFACT objects are handled somewhat differently fro m ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects . For ARTIFACT objects, the Scenario Template will define the particula r kind of artifact to be reported and the particular slots to be used from the Template Element BNF for ARTIFACT . The Template Element test for ARTIFACT will be limited to that type of artifact and to the scenario-define d ARTIFACT slots . 1 .2 Evaluation Stage s","STAGE 1 (with the announcement of the evaluation) . The participants are given the definitions for th e scenario-independent and scenario-neutral template elements (defined in this document) . The definitions in thi s document do not reflect the requirements of any particular scenario . The participants are also given one or more example IE scenario definitions and data sets, similar in nature (but not in content) to the Scenario Template task(s ) to be used for the actual evaluation . During stage 1, it is expected that the participants will develop their systems to perform on the Template Element evaluation subtask (especially ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects) and wil l design their system to be able to accomodate the template design requirements of Scenario Template task definition s to be released during stage 2 of the evaluation .","STAGE 2 (one month prior to test week) . The participants are given one or two scenario definitions . During the course of this one-month period, the participants configure their system to produce the appropriate subset of the Template Elements and to produce the higher-level object(s) as defined in the scenario statement . The entire template for any given task is therefore fairly simple, consisting of one or more Template Element objects, only one scenario-specific (high-level) object, and perhaps a relational object . The number of slots (other than pointer slots ) that do not come from the set of Template Elements will be five or less . 1 .3 Levels of Template Structur e Four levels of template objects are defined :","LEVEL 1 (Template Element) . The objects and slots defined in this document. These are generic Templat e Elements which may play a role in virtually any task scenario . These template elements are not oriented toward s any particular task, but instead attempt to capture the sort of information that may be needed for a wide range of tasks . All of these objects are fairly simple and have no relational information (i .e., no pointers to other objects) . For 349 a given IE scenario, only a subset of the predefined Template Element objects will be used ; in addition, one or more slots might be ignored from the Template Element objects that are used .","LEVEL 2 (Relational Object -- optional). Objects which define a relation between generic Templat e Elements and scenario-specific ones . These relations are not included in the Template Element objects, for th e purpose of generality and simplicity. For example, a Relational object may consist of a pointer to a n ORGANIZATION object (generic), a pointer to a PERSON object (generic), a slot representing the role that the : person has in that organization (scenario-specific), and, perhaps, a slot containing temporal information (generic) .","LEVEL 3 (Scenario Template Object). For each IE scenario, it is envisioned that there will be exactly one scenario-specific object type. It captures the essential relation or event of interest in the task . This object type wil l have pointers to the Template Element object types appropriate for the task, as well as pointers to any Relationa l objects defined for the task . It may also contain slots that are defined as part of the Template Element subtask .","LEVEL 4 (Top-Level Template Object). For each text that is relevant to an IE scenario, there will be exactl y one Top-Level Template object . It will identify the text and will contain one or more pointers to Scenario Templat e objects . 2 Scenario-Dependent Subtask : General Descriptio n An IE scenario task is to identify all information in each input text that is defined to be relevant by the tas k definition in the scenario Fill Rules document, and to construct a representation of the relevant information in th e format specified by the BNF. For any given IE scenario, the following will be provided :","NARRATIVE . Paragraph that briefly describes the scenario topic and the relevance criteria . The narrative will be used by the evaluation designers in formulating a text retrieval query that will return candidate test se t documents from the MUC-6 corpus .","BNF DEFINITION . Will include one or more of the Template Element objects or slots defined in thi s document, plus any scenario-specific and relational objects needed for the scenario . Primarily defines the syntax o f the template .","FILL RULES. Will describe the reporting conditions and the semantics of each object and slot . The Template Element objects will have separate minimum conditions and slot descriptions that are available during the first stag e of evaluation ; additional reporting conditions may be imposed in the fill rules for a particular scenario (e .g ., instead of reporting all organizations, a scenario may only require reporting airplane manufacturing companies) .

It should be noted that for purposes of scoring, normalized fills and string fills are equivalent, i .e., the scoring software strips off external double quotes from fills for slots that are defined as taking normalized fills or string fills . SET FILL. To be filled in by selection from a prespecified list of categories defined in the fill rules for a give n slot . 35 1","STRING FILL. To be filled in with an exact copy of a text string from the article under analysis . The fill may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired . See the \"Tokenization Rules\" document for information on wha t counts as a word token in certain special cases .","NORMALIZED FILL . To be filled with a text string that is converted to a canonical form in accordance wit h the fill rules for a given slot. The fill may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired .","INDEX FILL (POINTER). To be filled with the index of an object, i .e ., a pointer to an object . The fill is to be enclosed in angled brackets . \\t 3 .1.2.2 \\t Object Identifiers All objects are identified by the object name (from the template BNF), the document number (from the DOCNO ta g in the text), and a one-up number ; a dash is used to separate those three elements . For Wall Street Journal articles , the dash internal to the value of DOCNO must be suppressed ; thus, a valid ORGANIZATION object identifier for DOCNO 891026-0100 would be <ORGANIZATION-8910260100-1> . \\t 3.1 .2.3 \\t Notation Reserved for Use in Answer Key s Legitimate ambiguity or vagueness in the text is reflected in the answer key by the presence of alternativ e acceptable fills . The \"I\" notation is reserved for this use ; such fills are *not* to be generated by the system unde r evaluation . The notation allows the answer key to present alternate acceptable single fills for a slot, alternate sets o f fills for a slot, optional fills (one fill or zero fills), and combinations thereof. An object is treated as optional if al l pointers to it are either optional or in a list of alternatives . Since the Template Element subtask does not include the creation of pointers to the template element objects, th e optionality of ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ARTIFACT objects is indicated via the OBJ_STATUS slot within the optional object itself. The OBJ_STATUS slot is not used for the Scenario Template subtask . The COMMENT slot may contain notes that the analyst wants to record concerning the answer key . The slot is not scored . (Analysts should avoid entering double quotes within the comment, as they will prevent the template-fillin g tool, Tabula Rasa, from being able to reload the template file .) 3.2 Fill Rules The input text contains some SGML tags, including TXT ; the IE task is to be performed on the text delimited by the TXT, HL, DATELINE, and DD tags . (Note, however, that the DD tag sometimes doesn't appear at all, sometime s appears once, and sometimes appears twice . ) Lines within the <TXT> portion of the article that start with the \"@\" sign signify a table or other special lin e formatting within the text and should NOT be used for extraction . (However, such lines may also appear within the <HL> portion of the article, and these should be analyzed for extractable material . ) 3.2.1 TEMPLATE Objec t DEFINITION : Top-level object .

It is possible for CONTENT to have multiple values, corresponding to different relevant events described . Relevant events are defined as bein g different when the value of one slot in the scenario object is incompatible with the value of another .

If a document contains more than one variant o f the name, the ORG_NAME slot is to be filled with the most complete variant . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The name must appear in the text . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1. This slot has a 0 or 1 valence to allow the situation where an unnamed organization participates in an even t (or relation) of interest and is perhaps referenced only by a descriptive phrase . 2. If an organization is changing name, report the current name as ORG_NAME and the past or future name a s ORG_ALIAS . 3.

Strings that are used in the article to describe a set o f organizations are not candidates for this slot, e .g ., \"the two new subsidiaries.\"","SPECIAL USAGE NOTES :","1. This slot is intended to capture information on the organization other than its name or alias . Therefore, the","string fill for this slot is not permitted to contain the name or alias, which means that the fill will sometimes be","a substring of a full noun phrase . The substring could be a premodifier noun or noun phrase or a head noun o r","noun phrase ; it cannot be a non-NP (e .g ., cannot be a possessive, prepositional phrase, or a pure adjective) .","Below are a few examples of complex NPs with descriptor substrings : \"the law firm Smith Blarney\" (descriptor is \"the law firm\" ) \"ABC Corp's XYZ subsidiary\" (descriptor is \"subsidiary \"","2.

Taking the word \"unit\" as an example, the following usages of it would be regarded as insubstantial, where the expressions constitute the complete NP :","\"unit\" (as a bare noun, perhaps in a headline )","\"the unit\"","\"his unit \"","\"that unit\"","\"the ABC Corp . unit\" (where \"unit\" refers to \"ABC Corp .\")","\"XYZ Corp .'s ABC Corp . unit\" (\"unit\" refers to \"ABC Corp.\" ) As a consequence of this guideline, an ORGANIZATION object will not be instantiated if the text provide s","no name and if the only descriptive information on it is an insubstantial descriptor .","3 . All other descriptive noun phrases will be included as alternatives in the answer key . Thus, even the","\"insubstantial\" head nouns listed above may occur in substantial noun phrases . For example, the following","usages of \"unit\" would be regarded as substantial, and the entire phrase would be generated a s","ORG_DESCRIPTOR :","\"a unit of ABC Corp . \"","\"the ABC Corp. unit\" (where \"unit\" refers to an org *other* than \"ABC Corp .\" )","\"the new unit\"","\"the New York unit\" (even though \"New York\" would also appear in ORG_LOCALE )","\"the unit based in New York\"","4 . The answer key will contain alternative fills when the full NP contains one of the following types o f","modifiers/adjuncts, which are considered to be either of no interest to the database or of questionable parse an d","limited interest to the database :","a. possessive pronoun premodifier, e .g., \"its most profitable subsidiary\" (alternate fill is \"most profitable","subsidiary\" )","b. temporal adverbials, e .g ., \"now the most profitable subsidiary\"(alternate fill is \"most profitabl e","subsidiary\" )","c. loose adjunct, e .g ., a nonrestrictive relative clause or similar type of full or reduced clause, as in \"th e","profitable subsidiary, which announced increased earnings again this quarter\" (alternative fill is \"the profitabl e","subsidiary\") or \"the profitable subsidiary, being the second-smallest of all the company's subsidiaries \"","(alternative fill is \"the profitable subsidiary\" )","5.
