Because we have a good, broad-coverage English grammar and a moderately effective method for recoverin g from parse failures, this approach held us in fairly good stead .","However, we were at a disadvantage with respect to groups which performed more local pattern recognition, in three regards : 1. our systems were quite slow In processing the language as a whole, our system is operating with only relatively weak semanti c preferences . As a result, the process of building a global syntactic analysis involves a large and relativel y unconstrained search space and is consequently quite expensive . In contrast, pattern matching system s assemble structure \"bottom-up\" and only in the face of compelling syntactic or semantic evidence, in a (nearly) deterministic manner . Speed was particularly an issue for MUC-6 because of the relatively short time frame (1 month fo r training) . With a slow system, which can analyze only a few sentences per minute, it is possible t o perform only one or at best two runs per day over the full training corpus, severely limiting debugging .","2. global parsing considerations sometimes led to local error s Our system was designed to attempt to generate a full sentence parse if at all possible . If not, i t attempted a parse covering the largest substring of the sentence which it could . This global goa l sometimes led to incorrect local choices of analyses ; an analyzer which trusted local decisions could i n many cases have done better.",":3 . adding syntactic constructs needed for a new scenario was har d Having a broad-coverage, linguistically-principled grammar meant that relatively few additions wer e needed when moving to a new scenario . However, when specialized constructs did have to be added, th e task was relatively difficult, since these constructs had to be integrated into a large and quite comple x grammar . We considered carefully whether these difficulties might be readily overcome using an approach which wa s still based on a comprehensive syntactic grammar . It appeared plausible, although not certain, that problem s (1) and (2) could be overcome within such an approach, by adopting a strategy of conservative parsing . A conservative parser would perform a reduction only if there was strong (usually, local) syntactic evidenc e or strong semantic support . In particular, chunking parsers, which built up small chunks using syntacti c criteria and then assembled larger structures only if they were semantically licensed, might provide a suitabl e candidate . Ideally, a parser might learn which decisions could be safely made based purely on syntacti c 167 evidence, but building such a parser would be a substantial research project not to be lightly undertaken i n the months leading up to a MUG .","In any case, problem (3) still loomed . Our Holy Grail, like that of many groups, is to eventually ge t the computational linguist out of the loop in adapting an information extraction system for a new scenario . This will be difficult, however, if the scenario requires the addition of some grammatical construct, albei t minor . It would require us to organize the grammar in such a"]},{"title":"way","paragraphs":["that limited additions could be made b y non-specialists without having to understand the entire grammar — again, not a simple task .","All these considerations led us to conclude that we should \"do a MUC\" ourselves using the patter n matching approach, in order to better appreciate its strengths and weaknesses . In particular, we carefull y studied the FASTUS system of Hobbs et al . [1], who have clearly and eloquently set forth the advantage s of this approach . This approach can be viewed as a form of conservative parsing, although the high-leve l structures which are created are not explicitly syntactic . At the end of this paper we return to the questio n of the relation of pattern matching to approaches which use a comprehensive grammar ."]},{"title":"THE SYSTE M","paragraphs":["We exaggerate, of course, the radicalness of our change since MUC-5 [4] (and since the MUC-6 dry run , which was conducted with our traditional syntactic system) . Several components were direct descendants of earlier modules : the dictionary was Comlex Syntax [3] ; the lexical analyzer (for names, etc .) had bee n gradually enhanced at least since MUC-3 ; the concept hierarchy code and reference resolution were essentiall y unchanged from earlier versions . In addition, our grammatical approach was not entirely abandoned ; ou r noun group patterns were a direct adaptation of the corresponding portion of our grammar, just as Hobbs ' patterns were an adaptation from his grammar .' And, as we shall see, more of the grammar crept in a s our effort progressed . In essence, one could say that our MUC-6 system was built (in late August and earl y September, 1995) by replacing the parser and semantic interpreter of our earlier system by additional sets o f finite-state patterns ."]},{"title":"Overall Structur e","paragraphs":["The same system was used for all four MUC tasks (NE, CO, TE, and ST) ; the only difference lies in th e information which is generated when the processing of a document is complete .","The text analysis operates in seven main stages : tokenization and dictionary look-up ; four stages of pattern matching (basically, for names, noun groups, verb groups, and larger patterns) ; reference resolution ; and output (template or SGML) generation ."]},{"title":"Tokenization and Dictionary Look-u p","paragraphs":["Processing begins with the reading of the document and the identification of the relevant SGML-marke r passages . The body of the document is divided into sentences and then into tokens . Each token is looked up in our dictionaries . For general vocabulary, we use Cornlex Syntax, a broad-coverage dictionary of Englis h developed at NYU, which provides detailed syntactic information, but does not include any proper names . This is supplemented by several specialized dictionaries, includin g • a small gazetteer, which contains the names of all countries and most \"major\" citie s • a company dictionary, derived from the Fortune 50 0 • a government agency dictionary • a dictionary of common first name s • a small dictionary of scenario-specific term s We also use the BBN POST tagger at this stage to determine the most likely part of speech of each worcl . 2 And, since both these grammars can trace their origins in part to the NYU Linguistic String Grammar, the approaches here","are very similar. 'We wish to thank BBN Systems and Technologies for providing us with this tagger. 168"]},{"title":"Name Recognitio n","paragraphs":["The input stage is followed by several stages of pattern matching . Each of these stages uses one or more set s of finite-state patterns to perform some reductions on the input string . The patterns are translated to LIS P procedures which are then compiled, so the pattern matching can proceed very efficiently .","Each set of patterns involves one left-to-right scan of the sentence . Starting at each word, we identify the longest matching pattern (if any), use it to reduce the input sequence, and then continue with the nex t unmatched word .","The first set of patterns corresponds essentially to Named Entity recognition : names of people ; names o f companies and other organizations ; locations ; dates ; and numeric expressions, including money and percent - ages .","A second, small set identifies possessive forms involving either common nouns or names as just identified .","For the MUG-6 scenario, we added a third set for names of executive positions, such as \"executive directo r for recall and precision\" .","The name recognition stage records the initial mention and type of each name ; subsequent mentions of a portion of that name will be recorded as aliases of the name . At this stage, a name will be recognized a s being of a specific type (person, company, government organization, or other organization) if it is defined i n the dictionary, if it has a distinctive form, or if it is an alias of a name of known type .

In most cases , once part of speech ambiguities have been resolved (using a tagger, as we noted above), most decision s regarding noun group boundaries and structure can be made deterministically using local syntactic information . In some cases, however, the attachment can not be decided locally ; in such cases, we leave the modifie r unattached . For example, a present or past participle may mark the beginning of a noun group : He enjoys driving ranges more than any golfer I know . or may be part of a verb phras e He enjoys driving cars . The noun group patterns are essentially a direct transcription of that portion of our English grammar int o our pattern language ."]},{"title":"Verb Group Recognitio n","paragraphs":["The third stage of pattern matching recognizes verb groups : simple tensed verbs (\"sleeps\"), and verbs with auxiliaries (\"will sleep\", \"has slept\", \"was sleeping\", etc .) .

These include patterns which recognize larger noun phrase structures than simple noun groups, and patterns which recognize clausa l structures .","The noun phrase patterns include noun phrase arguments, such as \"president of General Motors \" ; ap-position . such as \"Fred Smith, president of General Motors\" ; age modifiers, such as \"Fred Smith, 107 year s old\" : and relative clauses . Noun phrase conjunction is also handled at this stage .","The clausal patterns play the main role in this scenario, recognizing the basic events of executive succession : having jobs, starting jobs, leaving jobs, succeeding other people in jobs . Each recognized pattern is translated into an event predication in the logical form, with one of the following forms : • start-job(person, position) 169 • add-job(person, position) 3 • have job(person, position ) • leave-job(person, position ) • leave-a-job(person) [e .g ., where someone retires, but the position is not known ] • succeed(personl, person2)","For each subject-verb-object relationship, we create a separate pattern for each of the plausible syntacti c forms, including the active clause, the passive clause, the relative clause (active or passive), the reduce d relative clause, and the conjoined verb phrase . These patterns also serve to resolve some type ambiguities . If we have the sentenc e P . T . Barnum took the helm of F . W . Woolworth . the system will classify \"P. T .

' If the noun phrase has an indefinite determiner or quantifier (e .g ., \"a\", \" some\" , \"any\", \"most\") it is assume d to be new information . Otherwise a search is made through the prior discourse for possible antecedents .

A Tipster annotation includes a type, a set of start/end byte offsets, and a set of attributes [2] . The name recognition stage generates ENAMEX, PNAMEX, TIMEX, and NUMEX annotations as a by - product of the recognition process, so Named Entity response generation only requires that the annotation s be converted to SGML . For the Coreference task, the coreference links created by reference resolution ar e converted to annotations and thence to SGML . For the Template Element task, the set of discourse entities i s scanned for entities of the appropriate type (people and organizations), plurals and some indefinite reference s are eliminated, and the remainder are converted to templates .","The only substantial processing for response generation occurs in the Scenario Template task . Here a certain amount of inferencing is needed to extract the actual events from those explicitly stated in the article .

This is done using the inferences","add-job is used in situations where there is an explicit indication that the position being taken on is an additional position : \"Fred was appointed to the additional post of executive vice president . \" 'In some cases, such as apposition, the anaphoric relation is determined by the syntax .

If the article say s \"Fred was the president of Legal Beagle Inc . Fred was succeeded by Harry .\" we need to infer that Harry is becoming the president of Legal Beagle . If we have a predicate of the form succeeds(person 1,person2) , the system sees what other information it has about personl or person2 .

And the approach did indee d mitigate the shortcomings of the full parsing approach which we outlined in the introduction .","We also experienced first-hand some of the shortcomings of the partial-parsing, semantic pattern approach . Syntax analysis provides two main benefits : it provides generalizations of linguistic structure across differen t semantic relations (for example, that the structure of a main clause is basically the same whether the verb i s \"to succeed\" or \"to fire\"), and it captures paraphrastic relations between different syntactic structures (fo r example, between \"X succeeds Y\", \"Y was succeeded by X\", and \"Y, who succeeded X\") . These benefits are lost when we encode individual semantic structures . In particular, in our system, we had to separately encode the active, passive, relative, reduced relative, etc . patterns for each semantic structure . These issue s are hardly new ; they have been well known at least since the syntactic grammar vs . semantic grammar controversies of the 1970 's .","How, then, to gain the benefits of clause-level syntax within the context of a partial parsing system? On e approach, which we have implemented in the weeks since MUC, has been clause level patterns which ar e expanded by metarules .

We can expect a computational linguist to consider all syntactic variants, although it may be a small burden ; we cannot expect the same of a typical user .","We expect that users would enter patterns by example, and would answer queries to create variants o f the initial pattern . As a first step in this direction, we have coded a non-interactive pattern-by-exampl e procedure which takes a sentence which is prepared as an exemplar of a pattern, analyzes it with the stage s of pattern matching described above, and then converts the resulting units to elements of a pattern . Fo r example .","(pattern-by-exampl e",";exemplars (\"Fred Smith became president . \"","\"Fred Smith began as president . \"","\"Fred Smith assumed the position of president . \" 6 These have some kinship to the metarules of GPSG, which expand a small set of productions into a larger set involving the","different clause-level structures .
