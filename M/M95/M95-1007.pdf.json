The system is designed to provide NLP capabilities to support man y applications in multiple domains . It attempts to do this by providing a core platform upon which differen t applications can be built . This core platform provides two main facilities : analysis, which converts tex t to a logical representation of its meaning, and generation, which expresses information represented in thi s logical form as text . Unlike many of its contemporary NLP systems, the LOLITA system is not designe d as a framework that can be tailored to specific domains, but as system that brings its knowledge of specifi c domains to bear as and when appropriate .","The Laboratory for Natural Language Engineering (LNLE) at the University of Durham is focussed o n developing this core .

Figure 1 shows the MUC-relevant parts . The most important part of th e core is the large knowledge-base, which we call the Semantic Network, SemNet or net, for short . It is heavily used in most stages of analysis, and the results of analysis are added to it, as a disambiguated logical representation of the input . The analysis stages are fairly standard, and are arranged in a . pipeline. Each i s implemented in a rule-based way . We do not currently use any form of stochastic or adaptive techniques i n the main system .","Applications can then read the results of analysis from the SemNet, and generally interrogate the content s of the SemNet . Some central \"support\" facilities are provided to aid application writing, such as the genera l template mechanism and the NL generator - which translates pieces of the SemNet into English (or, recentl y added, into Spanish) . More detail on the architecture of LOLITA can be found in [6] ."]},{"title":"The Semantic Network","paragraphs":["The SemNet is a 100,000 node, directed hyper-graph . Each node has a set of links, plus a set of \"control variables\" (or controls) . Some nodes have an associated \"name \" : this is usually a single word which characterises the meaning of the node . Each link has an arc and a set of targets . Targets are other nodes , and the arc too is just a node . Nodes correspond to concepts of entities or events . Links correspond t o relationships between nodes . Since an arc is also a node, the concepts of the different kinds of relationshi p possible between nodes can be represented in the same formalism as more concrete concepts . In this system , the \"meaning\" of any particular node is given by its connections, its relative position in the net .","Controls indicate basic information about a node, such as its type (e .g . event, entity, relation), its famil y (e .g . human, inanimate, food, organisation), its lexical type (e .g . noun, preposition, adverb) - as appropriate . An important control is a node's rank: this encodes quantification information .

There are several other less important ranks, used for things like encoding script-lik e information or existential quantification . Controls could be represented using links, but for efficiency reason s this more compact form is used .","There are approximately 60 different arcs . The arcs subject ., act ion_, and object_ are used to represent the basic roles of an event . Events can have other arcs, such as those indicating temporal information , the status of the information (e .g ., known fact, hypothesis, etc), or arcs that indicate the source of the information . Most arcs also have inverses : e .g . the subject_ arc has the inverse subject of_, which allows determination of the events in which a particular concept played the subject role .","Concepts are connected with arcs such as specialisation_ (and its inverse, generalisation ), o r instance_ (inverse universal_) . Specialisation links a set to one possible subset ; for example, in figure 2 , chairman [U] represents the set of all possible chairmen, and old_chairman[U] the set of all possible old chairmen . Between the former and the latter is a specialisation_ link, indicating that old chairmen are a subset of chairmen . Conversely, the latter is linked to the former with a generalisat ion_ link, representin g a superset . Using the specialisation_ link, hierarchies of concepts are specified . The instance_ arc connects a concept to an instance of that concept : e .g ., a particular chairman chairman1 [I] would b e linked to chairman [U] by an instance_ link . Other links between concepts include synonym_ and antonym ._ The SemNet is used to hold several kinds of information :","• concept hierarchies : built with arcs such as generalisation_, concept hierarchies encodes knowledge like \"man is_a mammal is_a vertebrate\" etc . They prevent duplication of information by allowin g information to be inherited within the hierarchy .","• lexical information : actual words are represented in the net, and their properties are stored in the net , as opposed to having a separate lexicon . The lexical-level nodes are indexed via a simple dictionary : ie, a mapping from root words to all the senses of that word . Note that the lexical forms are distinc t from the concepts - they are linked by a concept_ arc . Concepts are linked to lexical forms by a link named after the language of interest . E .g ., dog[U] has a link english to the noun form of \"dog\", an d a link italian to the Italian word \"cane\" .","• prototypical events : these define restrictions on events by providing t̀emplates ' for events, e .g . by imposing selectional restrictions on the roles in an event . \"Human owners own things\" says that onl y humans can take the subject role in òwnership' events .","• general events : other kinds of information . For example, the content of a MUC article would come i n this class, when analysed .","The bulk of the net (70%) comes from WordNet, a database containing lexical and semantic informatio n about word forms in English [5] . More details about the formalism used in the net can be found in [4] ."]},{"title":"Referring back to the Original Tex t","paragraphs":["Before MUC, LOLITA did not have a method of referring back to its input : the previous orientation was to move from language-dependent surface forms to a language-independent logical representation . Therefore , information about the surface form was discarded . Since the ability of reference has many uses outside of th e MUC tasks, a more general mechanism was designed and added to the core . It allows fine-grain connectio n of the analysis results to the sections of the document giving rise to those results . The system allocates new SemNet nodes to components of the document (words, phrases, sentences, . . . ), which act as references int o the document . This is called the ̀Textref ' system and has several uses :","• It allows the core to analyse input which talks about surface components of the input text . For example, a user might be able to ask ̀What is meant by \" organisation\" in the second paragraph of th e document? ' , or make statements such as ̀When I wrote \" pointing \" , I was referring to brickwork ' . 74","• It enables applications to produce output which is highly related to the original text . Clearly, the MU C tasks are an example of this, since they require exact phrases . Another possibility is the provision of hypertext-style links to the relevant parts of the original documents in information extraction o r summarisation tasks .","• Previous LOLITA applications have relied on the core system 's generator [6] to produce output . This generator relies heavily on the core analysis, and although it performs well given a correct analysis , errors in the analysis can produce very strange output and a drastic reduction in the perceived performance of the system . Textrefs enable more robust reporting of results, as witnessed in a significan t performance improvement in our non-MUC template generation applications .","• The Textref system can also be used to provide convenient debugging information, since they allo w developers to relate internal structures produced by the system to the portions of the text from whic h they were derived .","Textrefs allow the document structure to be fully represe :ted in the net, and represented uniformly wit h the other information in the system . At the word level, a Textref signifies a specific occurrence of a word a t a certain position in the input, and is distinct from the nodes representing the lexical or semantic forms o f its root form . It is an instance_ of the universal concept of all occurrences of that word . Concept nodes and Textref nodes are linked by an event with the internal action words used . Two examples may be see n in figure 2 : single words are attached to the \"key \" words of the sentence (only ̀retire ' is shown), and all of the Textrefs in the sentence are attached to the node representing the whole event ."]},{"title":"Text Pre-processin g","paragraphs":["Core analysis of textual input starts from a LOLITA-specific SGML representation of the input (calle d an SGML tree) . Individual applications must-convert from their own formats (e .g . plain text, MUC WS J articles, LaTeX, HTML, . . .) into this internal format . The MUC converter is just a simple SGML parser . The preprocessor then adds additional structure to the internal SGML tree where necessary . In particular the following structures are handled in the order given : reported speech, paragraphs, sentences and words . Markers for reported speech are distributed over all sentences inside the quotes . Lastly, each word is allocate d a Textref."]},{"title":"Morphology","paragraphs":["Morphology is applied to an SGML tree whose leaves are individual word tokens, and whose node s represent the structure of the document . A few transformations are done on this structure to unpac k contractions (e .g . \"I'll\" expanded to \"I will\"), expand monetary and numeric expressions (eg \"$10 million \" to \" 10 million dollars \" ), and to transform certain surface-level idiomatic phrases (eg \"in charge of \" ) . Som e splitting of hyphenated words is also done . Then, the basic morphology function is mapped on to all leave s (with additional treatment provided for sentence initial words) .","Lookups in the dictionary are done with the root forms suggested by affix stripping . If successful, a wor d is linked to lexical and semantic nodes, allowing access to lexical and semantic information during the res t of morphology, parsing, and semantics . Affix stripping loses information such as number and case, so thi s information is represented using a Feature system . Features are used in parsing (described below) . Othe r Features include word class (Noun, Verb, . . .) and some semantic-based Features . Finally, possible syntacti c categories for a word are determined from the lexical (and sometimes semantic) node information . Thus , each leaf is mapped to a set of alternatives, varying in category and Features, which represent all possible interpretations of that leaf ."]},{"title":"Parsin g","paragraphs":["There are four stages in parsing : 75","sen -- sentence branc h full_propernoun -- proper noun phras e propernoun JOHN [Sexed] neg_copula -- copula verb phras e asCopulaN RETIRE [Fut ] comnoun CHAIRMAN [Sing,Per3] Figure 3 : Parse tree for \"John will retire as chairman\" .","• A pre-parser which identifies and provides structure for monetary expressions . This stage is currentl y underused, and would provide a measure of robustness for the kind of expressions used in Name d Entity, should parsing fail . It is implemented using a simple grammar of low ambiguity and a parse r which attempts to find the largest non-overlapping sequences which match the grammar (working fro m left to right) .","• Parsing of whole sentences using the Tomita algorithm [7] . The main system grammar is large an d highly ambiguous, so a powerful algorithm is required . Our grammar is written in a context-free style , using a simple feature system to parametrise pieces of grammar, and contains some rules for handlin g non-grammatical input . It is transformed into approximately 1900 rules of the type A —> X or A —> X Y, where A is a non-terminal, and X,Y can be terminals or non-terminals . The result of this stage is a \" parse forest \" , a directed acyclic graph which indicates all possible parses . Due to the complexity o f the grammar, this forest is frequently very large, implying many possible parses .","• Decoding of the parse forest . The forest is selectively explored from the topmost node, using heuristics such as Feature consistency and hand-assigned likelihoods of certain grammatical constructions . Feature errors and unlikely pieces of grammar involve a cost : the aim of the search is to extract the set of lowest-cost trees .","• Selection of best parse tree : subsequent analysis operates on a single tree . The lowest cost set is ordered on the basis of several heuristics on the form of the tree - for example, preferring a deeper tree . It is possible for the subsequent analysis to reject suggested trees, and try the next best, but this optio n is not used in our MUC system . Work is underway to improve the handling of structural ambiguity, possibly by passing a graph structure to subsequent analysis .","• Normalisation : syntax-based, meaning-preserving transformations are applied to the trees to reduc e the number of cases required in semantics . A prime example of this is passive to active, ie \"I wa s bitten by a dog\" changed to \"A dog bit me\" . Another class involves transformations such as \"You are surprised\" to \" *SOMETHING* surprised you \" , which makes explicit the object doing the surprising .","Parsing can sometimes fail on very large forests : decoding these requires a lot of resources (time, memory) . Rather than cause a crash due to overrunning limits, the parse is abandoned . This is implemented by fixin g a time-limit on the process - resource usage being proportional to time : we refer to expiry of the time limi t as a t̀imeout ' . It is also possible for parses to fail if the sentence can't be analysed with the main grammar . If the parse fails, analysis is discontinued on that sentence - so no semantic result is produced .","An example parse is given in figure 3 . Note that ẁil l ' and às ' are missing . As so-called function words , they don ' t carry much inherent semantic meaning, so the tense information of ẁill ' is transferred to th e Features of the main verb, and the copula function of às' is transformed into a syntactic construct . This simplifies the semantic rules . Analysis of Meanin g","This section describes how the parse tree is converted to a disambiguated piece of SemNet . There are two stages, which we call S̀emantic' and P̀ragmatic' . The Semantic analysis is compositional in general : 7 6 the meaning of a tree is built from the meanings of its subtrees . A mechanism goes through the parse tre e in depth-first, post-order traversal, applying semantic rules mainly on the basis of the syntactic phrase typ e of the current tree node . If the meaning of a particular subtree is unambiguous in role, the Textrefs for th e text in that subtree are connected to that meaning . Since the meanings can be nodes which already have Textrefs connected, then particular nodes can collect Textrefs for all occurrences of their mention . This Textref handling is completely invisible to the semantic rules .","A state value, the \"context\" , is passed around during traversal : this holds possible referents in order of occurrence, and is used to resolve anaphoric expressions . Use of this context prevents the semantics bein g purely compositional .","The ̀meaning' of most leaves is the semantic node associated with the word at the Morphology stage . The node is passed to the leaf ' s parent in the form of a ̀role ' structure, which indicates the role the nod e may play in the semantics of the parent . Often this is unknown, but in cases like verbs, it can be determine d as the act . The actual role structure allows for representation of semantic ambiguity .","Branches are associated with rules for combining the semantics of the subtrees . The following example rule handles phrases like \" Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber\", which is a propernoun phras e followed by a noun phrase describing the propernoun . Reading from the bottom, it labels the role from th e left as subject., and the right role becomes object.. Then, add a role indicating the action_ of èqualit y ' . Tense information about the phrase is added from the Features fs, and an \" internal \" event built from th e roles collected : this links Gottesman with the concept of the individual who is an analyst with PaineWebber . Finally, the subject_ of the event is returned as the meaning of that subtree . > meta_branch na f s > I na ìs_iǹ[\"full_propernoun_description \",\"description \" ] > \\t","= extractrole Subj c̀omposènewnodes_InternalEven t > c̀omposèadd_tense_info f s > c̀omposèaddroles (sourcerole j̀oin_arl_f̀is_a_role na ) > c̀omposèlabelboth Subj Obj","The main task of the Pragmatic stage is disambiguation and type checking . Lexical ambiguities and anaphora are resolved using a series of preference heuristics which are first applied to disambiguate th e action of the event . Once the action is known, any knowledge available from the prototype event associated with that action can be used to rule out pragmatically implausible readings, as well as to aid disambiguatio n of the remaining elements of the event (in the spirit of [8]) .","The contents of the current context together with the topic of the text (the latter is given to the syste m in advance) influence the choice of word senses : those meanings are preferred which are semantically close r to the meanings present in the context or the topic, where semantic closeness is computed on the basis of the distance between nodes in the network . Other factors may cause one concept to be preferred over others , such as the amount of knowledge the system has about a given concept, or the concept 's frequency of use .","Each heuristic eliminates any meanings which are not the ̀preferred ' ones . Given that the less favoure d meanings are rejected at once and no backtracking mechanism is used at present, the order of applicatio n of heuristics can have a big effect on the final interpretation . The order used has been developed by tria l and error to get the desired meaning in the majority of cases in a small test set . In general, the cheape r heuristics are applied first, before using the more powerful but more expensive deep heuristics .","Once an event is disambiguated, the system attempts to establish plausible connections between it an d the previously processed discourse . Co-reference links between entities and events are made and a set of ne w elements is added to the global context . Reference Resolution","An initial stage of this is done \"on the fly\" in semantics . The context structure holds possible referents , ordered by recency of occurrence and with semantic and feature information attached to aid disambiguation . 77 Anaphoric expressions result in this context structure being examined for possible candidates which hav e appropriate feature and semantic information attached ; if more than one candidate exists, then a new node is created to represent the alternatives and is linked to each of them . This new node is then returned as th e meaning of the anaphor ; later stages (eg Pragmatics) will attempt to disambiguate the reference, and wil l replace the new node with the chosen node .","A later stage of analysis examines the recently built pieces of net and attempts to unify those which ar e similar . This makes correspondences which were not picked up during the semantic analysis of individua l sentences . A similar stage was added to help unify certain occurrences of proper names - cases such as ̀FAA ' and ̀Federal Aviation Authority ' , and abbreviated forms such as ̀PanAm ' and P̀an American' . In brief, the method looks for correspondences in the surface text attached to Named Individual nodes (ie, resulting fro m proper nouns) . Furthermore, this process is used on titles : the grammar of article titles is quite different from that for normal text, so we avoided full analysis of titles and joined title Textrefs to nodes when a surface match was found ."]},{"title":"Template Suppor t","paragraphs":["The processes involved in producing templates can be generalised, hence the core contains a mechanism to help write templates at an abstract level . This mechanism handles search through the net, use of inferenc e rules to derive implicit facts, and general output formatting .

Some concept nodes may have more than one related Textref . In concept slots, som e default rules are used to pick the most appropriate one, but for situations in which more control i s required, the Textref slot allows its associated rule to define precisely the Textref to be used . • String Slot . The slot fill rule directly produces a list of the strings to fill the slot .","• Template Reference Slot . The output consists of a reference to another template, enabling hyper-templates . Currently, three classes of template exist :","• event-based templates - where one clearly identifiable event is the subject of the article .

Two resource - critical sections are written in C - the parser and the SemNet data structure and its access functions . Haskel l has some similarity to LISP, such as building programs by writing functions, a garbage-collected heap, list s as a basic type, and full higher-order use of functions . However, it provides excellent support for modern Software Engineering, such as modularity, constrained polymorphism, a strong but flexible type system . It also enforces referential transparency and allows coding in a ̀lazy ' style, which means code is not executed unless needed . Thus, whilst our system has the external appearance of a pipeline architecture, the evaluatio n of individual pieces of code need not occur in that strict order . We argue that Haskell allows us to writ e complex code much more easily than, say, C or LISP .","LOLITA occupies approx . 45,000 lines of Haskell, plus some 6,000 lines of C, in 300 modules . It can run on many machines (ie, those for which there is a Haskell compiler), and is normally given a heap size o f 60 megabytes . To give an idea of speed, the final evaluation, if run on a single 70MHz SUN machine, too k approximately 24 hours .

This caused several problems for the LOLITA system and was the principal factor in the low walk-through article score .","The most severe problem was associated with reported speech that covered more than one sentence . Th e LOLITA system handles these by creating a series of sentences, each of which is enclosed in quotation marks . Unfortunately this processing occurs before the document is stored in the SemNet, and as a result, additiona l quotation marks are added to the final output . Since the NE and CO scorers take notice of exact position s within the text, they were confused by these additional symbols and many of the markups after the firs t occurrence of these additional quotes, were scored as incorrect .

For example, a word like ǹow' has an adverbial sense, but only the sub-conjunctio n and temporal noun sense were available .

In several cases, clearly identifiable named entities are not recognised as such because the parser is attempting to produce a full parse of the sentence despite th e fact that some of the grammar is missing, and this can only be done by taking an alternative parse for the named entity . Further work on the pre-parser for named entities would have reduced this problem .","Another way of looking at parsing performance is examining the sequences of Textref that get attached t o net nodes .

The high precision technique is used first, and looks for specific relationships between the event node and node s that are connected to it . The type of relationship may vary depending on which of several categories the event belongs too . If the output from the core analysis is correct the related nodes will then be used to fil l in the appropriate templates or slots (for example, the subject of a s̀acking' event would be used to fill the SUCCESSION_ORG slot) . On it ' s own, this technique currently produces a low recall, largely because th e core analysis may not produce exactly the correct relationships between the relevant nodes . To overcome this, a high recall technique is used when the expected relationships are not present .

There is n o clear methodology for evaluation in the NLP field ; however, a well-established and well-known event such a s MUC presents an excellent challenge and provides important resources for evaluation . We wanted to see i f our system could be adapted to perform the MUC tasks, and then to see how well it could do them . Clearl y our general purpose ̀deep analysis ' approach to the tasks did not produce scores that compare well with th e best systems, however there are some general reasons why we believe this is the case . Firstly, the use of a system which aims to be general purpose rather than generic, means that it is not possible to start from a ̀clean slate' and populate the system with a set of rules ideally suited to just the MUC evaluation . Any modifications to rule bases in the system's core must be carried out with a careful view to their effect on al l aspects of the core . Given that the MUC tasks only test certain aspects of the core system, this means that much effort is expended on issues that will not affect the MUC performance . Secondly, the nature of the MUC-6 tasks is such that only a small percentage of the marks are available for d̀eep' analysis and so suc h an analysis is counter productive unless it achieves an extremely high level of robustness . We are workin g towards such a level of robustness, but our MUC-6 results make it clear that we are not there yet .","As well as providing impetus to develop the core system, the experience has taught us much about testin g and evaluation . This will help in subsequent development . Code-wise, several major extensions have bee n added, and much existing code has been improved . Very little of this work is MUC-specific, so the amoun t of reuse is high . Evaluation-wise, we have a set of measures with which to evaluate at least some aspects o f our progress .","We do not see the scores as a refutation of our approach . As is to be expected in a system of LOLITA ' s size and complexity, we see the effects of several small bugs in the analysis which obscure the potential scores : witness our recent improvement in the walk-through article . It is clear that increasing robustness , for example by providing backup strategies when the main analysis fails, is a good idea . We also plan t o improve our parsing and grammar techniques . During development, we have seen several examples of goo d scores being obtained when the system works to its full potential, and we are much encouraged by it .","In summary, we are pleased with our first participation in MUC . Not only have we successfully implemented all four tasks on our first attempt at MUC, but we managed to produce a deep analysis of a goo d part of the text in the formal evaluation set . Despite the hard work, MUC has been an extremely useful an d enjoyable experience, and we look forward to MUC-7 ."]},{"title":"REFERENCE S","paragraphs":["[1] Eric Brill .
