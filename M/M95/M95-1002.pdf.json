Participants were invited to enter their systems in as many as four different task-oriented evaluations . The Named Entity and Coreference tasks entailed Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) annotation of texts and were being conducted fo r the first time . The other two tasks, Template Element and Scenario Template, were information extraction task s that followed on from the MUC evaluations conducted in previous years . The evolution and design of the MUC-6 evaluation are discussed in the paper by Grishman and Sundheim in this volume . All except the Scenari o Template task are defined independently of any particular domain .","This paper surveys the results of the evaluation on each task and, to a more limited extent, across tasks . Discussion of the results for each task is organized generally under the following topics :","• Results on task as whole ;","• Results on some aspects of task ;","• Performance on \"walkthrough article . \" The walkthrough article is an article selected from the test set . Participants were asked to analyze their system' s performance on that article and comment on it in their presentations and papers . Permission has been granted by Dow Jones for the full text of the article to be reprinted in this proceedings . It appears in full in the first part of appendix A, and various site reports may contain excerpts from it or annotated versions of it. Also in appendix A are representations of the information contained in the answer key for the walkthrough article for each of the fou r tasks ."]},{"title":"EVALUATION TASKS","paragraphs":["Documentation of the four evaluation tasks is contained in appendices C-F to this volume . A basi c","characterization of the challenge presented by each task is as follows : • Named Entity (NE) -- Insert SGML tags into the text to mark each string that represents a person ,","organization, or location name, or a date or time stamp, or a currency or percentage figure . • Coreference (CO) -- Insert SGML tags into the text to link strings that represent coreferring nou n","phrases . • Template Element (TE) -- Extract basic information related to organization and person entities ,","drawing evidence from anywhere in the text. • Scenario Template (ST) -- Drawing evidence from anywhere in the text, extract prespecified event","information, and relate the event information to the particular organization and person entities involve d","in the event.","The two SGML-based tasks required innovations to tie system-internal data structures to the original text s o that the annotations could be inserted by the system without altering the original text in any other way . Thi s capability has other useful applications as well, e .g ., it enables text highlighting in a browser . It also facilitates information extraction, since some of the information in the extraction templates is in the form of literal tex t strings, which some systems have in the past had difficulty reproducing in their output .","The inclusion of four different tasks in the evaluation implicitly encouraged sites to design general-purpos e architectures that allow the production of a variety of types of output from a single internal representation in orde r 13 to allow use of the full range of analysis techniques for all tasks . Even the simplest of the tasks, Named Entity , occasionally requires in-depth processing, e .g ., to determine whether \"60 pounds\" is an expression of weight or of monetary value . Nearly half the sites chose to participate in all four tasks, and all but one site participated in a t least one SGML task and one extraction task .","The variety of tasks designed for MUC-6 reflects the interests of both participants and sponsors in assessin g and furthering research that can satisfy some urgent text processing needs in the very near term and can lead t o solutions to more challenging text understanding problems in the longer term . Identification of certain common types of names, which constitutes a large portion of the Named Entity task and a critical portion of the Templat e Element task, has proven to be largely a solved problem . Recognition of alternative ways of identifying an entit y constitutes a large portion of the Coreference task and another critical portion of the Template Element task an d has been shown to represent only a modest challenge when the referents are names or pronouns . The mix of challenges that the Scenario Template task represents has been shown to yield levels of performance that ar e smilar to those achieved in previous MUCs, but this time with a much shorter time required for porting .","Summary scores for all systems evaluated are contained in appendix B . Note that for each task, sites were assigned different \"code names\" that were used in lieu of the site names to identify systems up to the time of th e conference . Some of the site reports in the proceedings may refer to other sites by these code names whe n discussing cross-system performance figures ."]},{"title":"CORPU S","paragraphs":["Testing was conducted using Wall Street Journal texts provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium . The articles used in the evaluation were drawn from a corpus of approximately 58,000 articles spanning the period o f January 1993 through June 1994 . This period comprised the \"evaluation epoch .\" As a condition for participatio n in the evaluation, the sites agreed not to seek out and exploit Wall Street Journal articles from that epoch once th e training phase of the evaluation had begun, i .e ., once the scenario for the Scenario Template task had been disclosed to the participants .","The training set and test set each consisted of 100 articles and were drawn from the corpus using a tex t retrieval system called Managing Gigabytes, whose retrieval engine is based on a context-vector model, producing a ranked list of hits according to degree of match with a keyword search query . It can also be used to do unranked , Boolean retrievals . The Boolean retrieval method was used in the initial probing of the corpus to identif y candidates for the Scenario Template task, because the Boolean retrieval is relatively fast, and the unranked result s are easy to scan to get a feel for the variety of nonrelevant as well as relevant documents that match all or some o f the query terms . Once the scenario had been identified, the ranked retrieval method was used, and the ranked lis t was sampled at different points to collect approximately 200 relevant and 200 nonrelevant articles, representing a variety of article types (feature articles, brief notices, editorials, etc .) . From those candidate articles, the trainin g and test sets were selected blindly, with later checks and corrections for imbalances in the relevant/nonrelevan t categories and in article types .","From the 100 test articles, a subset of 30 articles (some relevant to the Scenario Template task, others not ) was selected for use as the test set for the Named Entity and Coreference tasks . The selection was again don e blindly, with later checks to ensure that the set was fairly representative in terms of article length and type . Note that although Named Entity, Coreference and Template Element are defined as domain-independent tasks, the articles that were used for MUC-6 testing were selected using domain-dependent criteria pertinent to the Scenari o Template task .

A TYPE attribute accompanies each tag element an d identifies the subtype of each tagged string : for ENAMEX, the TYPE value can be ORGANIZATION, PERSON , 14 or LOCATION ; for TIMEX, the TYPE value can be DATE or TIME ; and for NUMEX, the TYPE value can be MONEY or PERCENT .","Text strings that are to be annotated are termed markables .

Human performance was measured by comparing the 30 draft answer keys produced by the annotator at NRaD with those produced by the annotator at SAIC . This test measures the amount of variability between the annotators . When 1 5 the outputs are scored in \"key-to-response\" mode, as though one annotator's output represented the \"key\" and the other the \"response,\" the humans achieved an overall F-measure of 96 .68 and a corresponding error per response fill (ERR) score of 6% . The top-scoring system, the baseline configuration of the SRA system (labele d satie.base in appendix A), achieved an F-measure of 96 .42 and a corresponding error score of 5% .","In considering the significance of these results from a general standpoint, the following facts about the tes t","set need to be remembered : • It represents just one style of writing (journalistic) and has a basic basic toward financial news and","a specific bias toward the topic of the Scenario Template task . • It was very small (only 30 articles) . There were no markable time expressions in the test set, an d","there were only a few markable percentage expressions .","The results should also be qualified by saying that they reflect performance on data that makes accurate usag e of upper and lower case distinctions . What would performance be on data where case provided no (reliable) clue s and for languages where case doesn't distinguish names? SRA ran an experiment on an upper-case version of th e test set that showed 85% recall and 89% precision overall, with identification of organization names presentin g the greatest problem . That result represents nearly a 10-point decrease on the F-measure from their official baseline . The case-insensitive results would be slightly better if the task guidelines themselves didn't depend o n case distinctions in certain situations, as when identifying the right boundary for the organization name span in a string such as \"the Chrysler division\" (currently, only \"Chrysler\" would be tagged) .

As indicated in the table below, all systems performed better on identifying person name s than on identifying organization or location names, and all but a few systems performed better on location name s than on organization names . Organization names are varied in their form, consisting of proper nouns, general vocabulary, or a mixture of the two . They can also be quite long and complex and can even have interna l punctuation such as a commas or an ampersand . Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish them from names of other types, especially from person names . Common organization names, first names of people, and locatio n names can be handled by recourse to list lookup, although there are drawbacks : some names may be on more tha n one list, the lists will not be complete and may not match the name as it is realized in the text (e .g ., may not cover the needed abbreviated form of an organization name, may not cover the complete person name), etc . 16","1 ^ Measure Ng","cnamc k per loc c4 e timex time [none","nuinex percen t 96 .42 10 2 6 3 * 0 0 95 .66 11 3 9 7 * 1 0 94 .92 16 3 7 3 * 0 0 94 .00 16 3 15 9 * 3 0 93 .65 13 4 8 8 * 8 32 93 .33 16 6 12 9 * 4 6 92 .88 15 4 13 8 * 8 3 2 92 .74 16 4 9 16 * 2 0 92 .61 14 4","_","5 43 * 1 0","91 .20 18 9 19 8 * 6 3 6","90 .84 16 10","_","29 12 * 6 0 89 .06 22 17 18 10 * 3 0 88 .19 29 7 20 17 * 11 3 6 85 .82 29 9 16 13 * 6 3 2 85 .73 26 14 29 18 * 9 4 0 84 .95 45 4 31 10 * 4 32 Table 2.

The satie .nonames configuration resulted in a three point decrease in recal l and one point decrease in precision . The changes occurred only in performance on identifying organizations . BBN conducted a comparative test in which the extra configuration (gershwin.optional) used a larger lexicon than the basic configuration (gershwin.baseline), but the exact nature of the difference is not known and th e performance differences are very small . As with the SRA experiment, the only differences in performanc e between the two BBN configurations are with the organization type .

The general pattern i s for systems to have done better on the TEXT slot than on the TYPE slot for ENAMEX tags and for systems t o have done better on the TYPE slot than on the TEXT slot for NUMEX and TIMEX tags . Errors on the TEXT slot are errors in finding the right span for the tagged string, and this can be a problem for all three subcategorie s of tag . The TYPE slot, however, is a more difficult slot for ENAMEX than for the other subcategories . It involves a three-way distinction for ENAMEX and only a two-way distinction for NUMEX and TIMEX, and i t offers the possibility of confusing names of one type with names of another, especially the possibility o f confusing organization names with person names .","Looking at the document section scores in the table below, we see that the error score on the body of the text was much lower than on the headline for all but a few systems . There was just one system that posted a higher error score on the body than on the headline, the NMSU CRL ives.basic configuration, and the differenc e in scores is largely due to the fact that the system overgenerated to a greater extent on the body than on th e headline . Its basic strategy for headlines was a conservative one : tag a string in the headline as a name only if th e system had found it in the body of the text or if the system had predicted the name based on truncation of name s 1 7 found in the body of the text .

The ORG_COUNTRY slot is a special case in a way, since it is required to be filled when th e ORG_LOCALE slot is filled . (The reverse is not the case, i .e ., ORG_COUNTRY may be filled even i f ORG_LOCALE is not, but this situation is relatively rare.) Since a missing or spurious ORG_LOCALE i s likely to incur the same error in ORG_COUNTRY, the error scores for the two slots are understandably similar .","With respect to performance on ORG_DESCRIPTOR, note that there may be multiple descriptors (or none ) in the text . However, the task does not require the system to extract all descriptors of an entity that are containe d in the text ; it requires only that the system extract one (or none) . Frequently, at least one can be found in clos e proximity to an organization's name, e .g ., as an appositive (\"Creative Artists Agency, the big Hollywood talent agency\") . Nonetheless, performance is much lower on this slot than on others .","Leaving aside the fact that descriptors are common noun phrases, which makes them less obvious candidate s for extraction than proper noun phrases would be, what reasons can we find to account for the relatively lo w performance on the ORG_DESCRIPTOR slot? One reason for low performance is that an organization may b e identified in a text solely by a descriptor, i .e ., without a fill for the ORG_NAME slot and therefore without th e usual local clues that the NP is in fact a relevant descriptor . It is, of course, also possible that a text may identif y an organization solely by name .

The first scenario was used as an example of the general design of the ST task, the second was used for the MUC-6 dry ru n evaluation, and the third was used for the formal evauation .

The IN_AND_OUT object contains ST-specific information that relates the event with the persons . The ORGANIZATION Template Element objects are presen t at the lowest level along with the PERSON objects, and they are pointed to not only by the IN_AND_OU T object but also by the SUCCESSION_EVENT object.

The annotators' problems with VACANCY_REASON may have had more to do with understanding what th e scenario definition was saying than with understanding what the news articles were saying . The annotators ' problems with ON_THE_JOB were probably more substantive, since the heuristics documented in the appendi x were complex and sometimes hard to map onto the expressions found in the news articles .

The NE evaluation results serve mainly to document in the MUC context what was already strongly suspected : 1. Automated identification is extremely accurate when identification of lexical pattern types depends only o n","\"shallow\" information, such as the form of the string that satisfies the pattern and/or immediate context ; 2. Automated identification is significantly less accurate when identification is clouded by uncertainty o r","ambiguity (as when case distinctions are not made, when organizations are named after persons, etc .) and","must depend on one or more \"deep\" pieces of information (such as world knowledge, pragmatics, o r","inferences drawn from structural analysis at the sentential and suprasentential levels) . The vast majority of cases are simple ones ; thus, some systems score extremely well -- well enough, in fact, t o compete overall with human performance . Commercial systems are available already that include identification o f those defined for this MUC-6 task, and since a number of systems performed very well for MUC-6, it is eviden t that high performance is probably within reach of any development site that devotes enough effort to the task . Any participant in a future MUC evaluation faces the challenge of providing a named entity identificatio n capability that would score in the 90th percentile on the F-measure on a task such as the MUC-6 one .","The TE evaluation task makes explicit one aspect of extraction that is fundamental to a very broad range o f higher-level extraction tasks . The identification of a name as that of an organization (hence, instantiation of a n ORGANIZATION object) or as a person (PERSON object) is a named entity identification task . The association of shortened forms of the name with the full name depends on techniques that could be used for NE and CO a s well as for TE . The real challenge of TE comes from associating other bits of information with the entity . For PERSON objects, this challenge is small, since the only additional bit of information required is the person' s title (\"Mr.,\" \"Ms .,\" \"Dr .,\" etc .), which appears immediately before the name/alias in the text . Fo r ORGANIZATION objects, the challenge is greater, requiring extraction of location, description, and identification of the type of organization .","Performance on TE overall is as high as 80% on the F-measure, with performance on ORGANIZATIO N objects significantly lower (70th percentile) than on PERSON objects (90th percentile) . Top performance o n PERSON objects came close to human performance, while performance on ORGANIZATION objects fel l significantly short of human performance, with the caveat that human performance was measured on only a portion of the test set . Some of the shortfall in performance on the ORGANIZATION object is due to inadequat e discourse processing, which is needed in order to get some of the non-local instances of th e ORG_DESCRIPTOR, ORG_LOCALE and ORG_COUNTRY slot fills . In the case of ORG_DESCRIPTOR , the results of the CO evaluation seem to provide further evidence for the relative inadequacy of current technique s for relating entity descriptions with entity names .","Systems scored approximately 15-25 points lower (F-measure) on ST than on TE . As defined for MUC-6 , the ST task presents a significant challenge in terms of system portability, in that the test procedure required tha t all domain-specific development be done in a period of one month . For past MUC evaluations, the formal ru n had been conducted using the same scenario as the dry run, and the task definition was released well before the dr y run . Since the development time for the MUC-6 task was extremely short, it could be expected that the tes t would result in only modest performance levels . However, there were at least three factors that might lead one t o expect higher levels of performance than seen in previous MUC evaluations : 30 1. The standardized template structure minimizes the amount of idiosyncratic programming required t o","produce the expected types of objects, links, and slot fills . 2. The fact that the domain-neutral Template Element evaluation was being conducted led to increased","focus on getting the low-level information correct, which would carry over to the ST task, sinc e","approximately 25% of the expected information in the ST test set was contained in the low-level","objects . 3. Many of the veteran participating sites had gotten to the point in their ongoing development where the y","had fast and efficient methods for updating their systems and monitoring their progress .","It appears that there is a wide variety of sources of error that impose limits on system effectiveness, whatever th e","techniques employed by the system. In addition, the short time frame allocated for domain-specific developmen t","naturally makes it very difficult for developers to do sufficient development to fill complex slots that either ar e","not always expected to be filled or are not crucial elements in the template structure .","Sites have developed architectures that are at least as general-purpose techniques as ever, perhaps as a resul t of having to produce outputs for as many as four different tasks . Many of the sites have emphasized their pattern - matching techniques in discussing the strengths of their MUC-6 systems . However, we still have full-sentenc e parsing (e .g. USheffield, UDurham, UManitoba) ; we sometimes have expectations of \"deep understanding\" (cf. UDurham's use of a world model) and sometimes not (cf . UManitoba's production of ST output directly fro m dependency trees, with no semantic representation per se) . Some systems completed all stages of analysis befor e producing outputs for any of the tasks, including NE . Six of the seven sites that participated in the coreferenc e evaluation also participated in the MUC-6 information extraction evaluation, and five of the six made use of th e results of the processing that produced their coreference output in the processing that produced their informatio n extraction output.","The introduction of two new tasks into the MUC evaluations and the restructuring of information extractio n into two separate tasks have infused new life into the evaluations . Other sources of excitement are the spinoff efforts that the NE and CO tasks have inspired that bring these tasks and their potential applications to th e attention of new research groups and new customer groups . In addition, there are plans to put evaluations on line , with public access, starting with the NE evaluation ; this is intended to make the NE task familiar to new site s and to give them a convenient and low-pressure way to try their hand at following a standardized test procedure . Finally, a change in administration of the MUC evaluations is occurring that will bring fresh ideas . The author is turning over government leadership of the MUC work to Elaine Marsh at the Naval Research Laboratory i n Washington, D .C . Ms . Marsh has many years of experience in computational linguistics to offer, along wit h extensive familiarity with the MUC evaluations, and will undoubtedly lead the work exceptionally well ."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["The definition and implementation of the evaluations reported on at the Message Understanding Conferenc e were once again a \"community\" effort, requiring active involvement on the part of the evaluation participants a s well as the organizers and sponsors .
