NUMEX : SPECIFIC GUIDELINES \\t 1 2 319 1 INTRODUCTION 1 .1 Scop e The Named Entity task consists of three subtasks (entity names, temporal expressions, number expressions) . The expressions to be annotated are \"unique identifiers\" of entities (organizations, persons, locations), times (dates , times), and quantities (monetary values, percentages) . For many text processing systems, such identifiers are recognized primarily using local pattern-matchin g techniques . The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange cove r such identifiers (plus abbreviations) together in section 6 .4 and explain that the identifiers comprise \"textual feature s which it is often convenient to distinguish from their surrounding text . Names, dates and numbers are likely to be of particular importance to the scholar treating a text as source for a database ; distinguishing such items from the surrounding text is however equally important to the scholar primarily interested in lexis . \" The task is to identify all instances of the three types of expressions in each text in the test set and to subcategorize the expressions . The original texts contain some SGML tags already ; the Named Entity task is to be performe d within the text delimited by the TXT, HL, DATELINE, and DD tags . (Note, however, that the DD tag sometimes doesn't appear at all, sometimes appears once, and sometimes appears twice . When it appears twice, only th e second instance is to be marked up for the Named Entity task . ) Lines within the <TXT> portion of the article that start with the \"@\" sign signify a table or other special lin e formatting within the text and should NOT be annotated . (However, such lines may also appear within the <HL > portion of the article, and these should be annotated . The system must produce a single, unambiguous output for any relevant string in the text ; thus, this evaluation i s not based on a view of a pipelined system architecture in which Named Entity recognition would be completel y handled as a preprocess to sentence and discourse analysis . The task requires that the system recognize what a string represents, not just its superficial appearance . Sometimes, the right answer is superficially apparent, as in th e case of most, if not all, NUMEX expressions, and can be obtained by local pattern-matching techniques . In other cases, the right answer is not superficially apparent, as when a single capitalized word could represent the name of a location, person, or organization, and the answer may have to be obtained using techniques that draw informatio n from a larger context or from reference lists . The three subtasks correspond to three SGML tag elements : ENAMEX, TIMEX, and NUMEX. Th e subcategorization is captured by a SGML tag attribute called TYPE, which is defined to have a different set o f possible values for each tag element . The markup is described in section 2, below . 1 .2 Performance Evaluation Scoring of this task will be done using the same kinds of metrics that are used for scoring template-filling (information extraction) tasks . For specific information on the scoring, refer to \"MUC-6 Scoring System User' s Manual,\" prepared for MUC-6 by SAIC . Cumulative scores will be generated at several levels of description of the task, e .g . , • across subtasks , • for each subtask , • for the subcategorization aspect of each subtask , • for each part of the article that is included in the task (<HL>,<DATELINE>, <DD>, <TXT>) . 2 TASK OVERVIEW 2 .1 Markup Description The output of the systems to be evaluated will be in the form of SGML text markup . The only insertions allowed during tagging are tags enclosed in angled brackets . No extra whitespace or carriage returns are to be inserted ; otherwise, the offset count would change, which would adversely affect scoring . The markup will have the following form : 321 <ELEMENT-NAME ATTR-NAME=\"ATTR-VALUE\" . . .>text-string</ELEMENT-NAME > Example : <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION\">Taga Co .</ENAMEX> The markup is defined in SGML Document Type Descriptions (DTDs), written for MUC-6 use by personnel at MITRE and maintained by personnel at NRaD . The DTDs enable annotators and system developers to use SGML validation tools to check the correctness of the SGML-tagged texts produced by the annotator or the system . The validation tools are available to MUC-6 participants in the file called muc6-sgml-tools . Annotators are using a software tool provided for MUC-6 by SRA Corporation to assist in generating the answer keys to be used fo r system training and testing . 2.2 Named Entities (ENAMEX tag element ) This subtask is limited to proper names, acronyms, and perhaps miscellaneous other unique identifiers, which ar e categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : ORGANIZATION: named corporate, governmental, or other organizational entity PERSON : named person or famil y LOCATION : name of politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international","regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc . ) 2.3 Temporal Expressions (TIMEX tag element ) This subtask is for \"absolute\" temporal expressions only ; explanation is provided in appendix B . The tagged tokens are categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : DATE : complete or partial date expressio n TIME : complete or partial expression of time of da y 2.4 Number Expressions (NUMEX tag element) This subtask is for two useful types of numeric expressions, monetary expressions and percentages . The numbers may be expressed in either numeric or alphabetic form . The task covers the complete expression, which is categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : MONEY : monetary expressio n PERCENT : percentag e 3 NOTATION RESERVED FOR USE IN THE ANSWER KEY S 3 .1 Expressing Alternative Attribute Value s A vertical bar is being used to separate alternative TYPE attribute values in the answer key . Alternative values will be given when the annotator does not have enough information to make a uniqu e categorization, even considering the context and the annotator's knowledge of the world . 3 .2 Expressing Optional Markup (STATUS Attribute) When it is not certain that a string should be marked up, the annotator will include the STATUS attribute in th e markup to indicate that the markup is optional . The only value of the STATUS attribute is \"OPT .\" Examples of it s possible use can be found in the appendices, such as in appendix B (holiday names) . 3 .3 Expressing Alternative String Boundaries (ALT Attribute ) The ALT attribute will be used when the tagged string contains one or more substrings that should be considere d correct for the purposes of scoring the system response . Certain premodifiers (\"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\") are automatically ignored by the scoring program (via the \"configuration\" file) and thus do not need to be speciall y marked in the key. 322 The ALT attribute will be used sparingly . A possible TIMEX example is shown below . \"all of 1987 \" <TIMEX TYPE=\"DATE\" ALT=\"1987\">all of 1987</TIMEX > 4 GUIDELINES FOR MARKUP OF EXCEPTIONAL CONSTRUCTION S 4 .1 Expressions Involving Elision Multi-name expressions containing conjoined modifiers (with elision of the head of one conjunct) should be marke d up as separate expressions . \"North and South America \" <ENAMEX TYPE=\"LOCATION\">North</ENAMEX> an d","<ENAMEX TYPE=\"LOCATION\">South America</ENAMEX > A similar case involving elision with number expressions : \"10- and 20-dollar bills \" <NUMEX TYPE=\"MONEY\">10</NUMEX>- an d","<NUMEX TYPE=\"MONEY\">20-dollar</NUMEX> bill s In contrast, there is no elision in the case of single-name expressions containing conjoined modifiers ; such expressions should be marked up as a single expression . \"U .S . Fish and Wildlife Service \" <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION\">U .S . Fish and Wildlife Service</ENAMEX > The subparts of range expressions should be marked up as separate expressions . \"175 to 180 million Canadian dollars \" <NUMEX TYPE=\"MONEY\">175</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE=\"MONEY\">180 million Canadia n","dollars</NUMEX> \"the 1986-87 academic year\" the <TIMEX TYPE=\"DATE\">1986</TIMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE=\"DATE\" ALT=\"87\">8 7","academic year</TIMEX > 4 .2 Effects of Tokenization Conventions The systems must incorporate certain tokenization conventions . These conventions are contained in a separat e document titled \"Tokenization Rules . \" The tokenization conventions for MUC-6 have an impact on the boundaries of the strings to be tagged . For example, the conventions call for treating possessive forms, e .g ., \"California's,\" as multiple tokens, unless there is a name such as \"McDonald's [burger company]\" that is inherently possessive . See the separate documentation titled \"Tokenization Rules\" for further information and examples . 4.3 Nested Expression s There are cases where LOCATION (ENAMEX) expressions are to be tagged when they occur within TIMEX an d NUMEX expressions . See Appendices B and C for a description of cases where markup of nested expressions ma y occur . Entity names that appear within ENAMEX tags are *not* to be tagged . 323"]},{"title":"APPENDIX A .
