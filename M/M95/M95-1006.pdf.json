We began this research in 1991 and applied it that year i n MUC-3 . Since that time, we have successfully applied probabilistic models to the following : • part of speech tagging, using Hidden Markov Models (Weischedel, et al ., 1993) , • judgments of relevance of text (at the paragraph level) via a log odds model (Ayuso, et al ., 1992), • learning semantic information (selection restrictions, or case frames) from supervised training (Weischedel ,","et. al ., 1991, 1993) , • learning word and word group associations (Matsukawa, 1993) , • an example-based correction technique for segmentation and part-of-speech labeling for Japanes e","(Matsukawa, Miller, and Weischedel, 1993), an d • induction of a statistical grammar and parser from training data (Magerman, 1995) . Not all techniques are necessarily used in each domain, nor necessarily effective in each domain . In MUC-6, there was so little data that only domain-independent techniques were employed . More linguistically motivated knowledge bases are used in almost every domain, such as case frames for verbs and nouns, verb complementizer structure, etc ."]},{"title":"SUMMARY OF WHAT'S NE W","paragraphs":["In the last two years we have ported part or all of the PLUM system to several new languages (Chinese, German , Japanese, and Spanish) and new domains (law enforcement, name finding, heterogeneous newswire sources, and labo r negotiations) . Though we have a new, fully trainable, full parser of English (Magerman, 1995), there wa s insufficient time to integrate it into PLUM for the evaluation ; as an independent component, it appears to hav e achieved the highest published evaluation scores for parsers . The new software developments employed in MUC-6 are • a stand-alone, C-based name spotter (IdentiFinder T\"'), a rewrite of the initial components of PLUM , • a more robust message reader, • a revised discourse component and output generator to more cleanly separate discourse structures from th e","final template structure, and • a semantic inference component. We have begun making a distinction between lightweight techniques and heavyweight processing . IdentiFinder i s made up solely of lightweight techniques, i .e ., those that rely only on local processing, do not involve dee p understanding, and can be optimized. The lightweight procedures in IdentiFinder are SGML recognition, hidde n Markov models, finite state pattern recognition, and SGML output .","By heavyweight processing, we mean procedures that depend on global evidence and involve deeper understanding . The SPATTER full parser of English and the new semantic inference procedure are examples . 55"]},{"title":"KEY SYSTEM FEATURE S","paragraphs":["Two key design features of PLUM are : statistical language modeling with the associated learning algorithms, an d partial understanding . The first key feature is the use of statistical modeling to guide processing . For the version of PLUM used in MUC-6, part of speech information was determined by using well-known Markov modelin g techniques embodied in BBN's part-of-speech tagger POST (Weischedel, et al ., 1993) .","A second key feature is partial understanding, by which we mean that all components of PLUM are designed t o operate on partially interpretable input, taking advantage of information when available and not failing when it i s unavailable. Neither a complete grammatical analysis nor complete semantic interpretation is required. The system pieces together a model of the whole from the parts of the text it can understand ."]},{"title":"PLUM PROCESSING STAGE S","paragraphs":["The PLUM architecture is presented in Figures 1 and 2 .

Theref/ re, the entities mentioned and some relations between them are f rocessed in every sentence, whethe r syntactically ill-formed, complex, novel, or straightforward .

Parser Output: Partial parse found for the example sentences ."]},{"title":"Semantic Interprete r","paragraphs":["The semantic interpreter contains two sub-components : a rule-based fragment interpreter and a pattern-base d sentence interpreter. The first has been used since MUC-3 . The rule-based fragment interpreter applies semanti c rules to each fragment produced by FPP in a bottom-up, compositional fashion . Semantic rules are matched base d on general syntactic patterns, using wildcards and similar mechanisms to provide robustness . A semantic rul e creates a semantic representation of the phrase as an annotation on the syntactic parse . A semantic formula include s a variable (e.g ., ?13), its type and a collection of predicates on that variable . There are three basic types of semanti c forms : entities, events, and states of affairs . Each of these can be further categorized as known, unknown, an d referential . Entities correspond to the people, places, things, and time intervals of the domain . These are related i n various ways, such as through events (who did what to whom) and states of affairs (properties of the entities) . Entity descriptions typically arise from noun phrases ; events and states of affairs are often described in clauses . 58","The rule-based fragment interpreter encodes defaults so that missing semantic information does not produce errors , but marks elements or relationships as unknown. Partial understanding is critical to text processing systems, a s missing data is normal . For example, the generic predicate PP-MODIFIER indicates that two entities are connecte d via a certain preposition . In this way, the system has a \"placeholder\" for the information that a certain structura l relation holds, even though it does not know what the semantic relation is . Sometimes understanding the relatio n more fully is of no consequence, since the information does not contribute to the template-filling task. The information is maintained, however, so that later expectation-driven processing can use it if necessary .","Due to the fragmentation produced by FPP, top-level constituents are typically more shallow and less varied tha n full sentence parses . A fairly high level of semantics coverage can be obtained quite quickly when the system i s moved to a new domain . This would not be possible if the semantic rules were required to cover a wider variety o f syntactic structures before it could achieve reasonable performance . In this way, semantic coverage can be adde d gradually, while the rest of the system is progressing in parallel .","The second sub-component of the semantic interpreter module is a pattern-based sentence interpreter which applie s semantic pattern-action rules to the semantics of each fragment of the sentence . The semantic pattern matching 'omponent employs the same core engine as the lexical pattern matcher . These semantic rules can add additional long-distance relations between semantic entities in different fragments within a sentence . A typical TE-level pattern would seek to attach descriptions to organizations, while a ST-level rule would find a potential SUCCESSION an d attach the PERSON, ORGANIZATION and POST information related to it. Below is an example of a sentence-level rule which looks for the pattern [<PERSON> . . . <JOB-SITUATION-WORD> . . .<POST>+] . When matched against the sentence \"Mr . James, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and will retire as chairman at the end of the year .\", \"James\" would be <PERSON>, \"stepping down\" would be <JOB-SITUATION-WORD> and \"chief executive officer \" would be <POST>.","(def-sp-top-patt DEFAULT-PROMOTED","( :patter n ( :se q ( :star :anyword) ( :rule NAMED-PERSON $person ) ( :dontcare 0 2) ( :tag $succ ( :and-env ( :cat (VP) :high ) ( :concept JOB-SITUATION)) ) ( :dontcare 0 2 ) (macro (MULTI-POST) ) ( :star :anyword)) )","( :understanding ((type JOB-SITUATION $succ) ( :pred JOB-SITUATION-PERSON $succ $person ) ( :pred JOB-SITUATION-POSITION-PERSON $succ $postl) . . .)) ) The semantic lexicon is separate from the parser's lexicon and has much less coverage . We use multiple levels of semantic lexicons : first, a generic application-independent lexicon with very shallow semantic information, then th e TE lexicon which provides more detailed entity-related semantic information, and finally the ST-level lexicon whic h provides detailed succession-related entries . Lexical semantic entries indicate the word's semantic type (a domain model concept), as well as predicates pertaining to it . For example, here is the lexical semantic entry for \"step down\" :","(DEFVERB \"step down\"","(STEP-DOWN-V-1 JOB-SITUATIO N ( :preds (JOB-SITUATION-STATUS :self (make-form POSITION-STATUS-GEN-OUT))","(JOB-SITUATION-REASON :self (make-form RESIGNATION)) ) (:CASE (LOGICAL-SUBJECT PERSON JOB-SITUATION-PERSON)","(\"AS\" JOB-POSITION JOB-SITUATION-POSITION)","(\"AS\" TITLED-PERSON JOB-SITUATION-POSITION-PERSON)) )","(STEP-DOWN-V-2 JOB-SITUATION ( :preds (JOB-SITUATION-REASON :self (make-form RESIGNATION))) ( :CASE (LOGICAL-SUBJECT JOB-POSITION JOB-SITUATION-POSITION)","(LOGICAL-SUBJECT TITLED-PERSON JOB-SITUATION-POSITION-PERSON))) ) 59","In Figure 4, we show the semantic representation that is built for the sentence \"He will be succeeded by Mr . Dooner, 45 .\" in the walkthrough article . The whole sentence was parsed as a single fragment by FPP . The YOB-SITUATION event is a flat object combining information from both SUCCESSION and IN-AND-OUT objects fo r ease of processing . The POSmON-STATUS-GEN-IN state of affairs indicates that the system is unsure of whethe r the status should be \"IN\" or \"IN_ACTING\" . Note the link between the \"Unknown role\" in the JOB-SITUATIO N and the PERSON \"He\". The discourse component will resolve the reference for the pronoun and will further refin e the relationship between the PERSON and the JOB-SITUATION . Figure 4 . Semantic Structure : The semantic representation for \"He will be succeeded by Mr . Dooner, 45. \" Discourse Processin g PLUM's discourse component creates a meaning for the whole message from the meaning of each sentence . The message level representation is a list of discourse domain objects (DDOs) for the top-level events of interest in the message (e .g ., SUCCESSION events in the ST domain) . The semantic representation of a phrase in the text onl y includes information contained nearby ; the discourse module must infer other long-distance or indirect relations no t explicitly found by the semantic interpreter and resolve any references in the text .","The discourse component creates two primary structures : a discourse predicate database and the DDOs . The database contains all the predicates mentioned in the semantic representation of the message . When references are resolved, corresponding semantic variables are unified . Any other inferences are also added to the database . To create the DDOs, the discourse component processes each semantic form produced by the interpreter, adding it s information to the database . It performs reference resolution for pronouns and anaphoric definite NPs ; set- and member-type references may be treated. The discourse component then applies inference rules that may add more semantic information to the discourse predicate database . When a semantic form for an event of interest i s encountered, a DDO is generated and any slots already found by the interpreter are filled in . The discourse processo r then tries to merge the new DDO with a previous DDO, in order to account for the possibility that the new DD O might be a repeated reference to an earlier one .","Once all the semantic forms have been processed, heuristic rules are applied to fill any empty slots from the text surrounding the forms that triggered a given DDO . Each filler found in the text is assigned a confidence score base d on distance from trigger. Fillers found nearby are of high confidence, while those farther away receive worse score s (low numbers represent high confidence ; high numbers low confidence ; thus 0 is the \"highest\" confidence score) .","In the ST system, the discourse processor performs an additional task . In order to simplify intermediate processing (semantic interpretation, DDO merging, pattern matching), a flat DDO, JOB-SITUATION, was defined whic h contains the equivalent of the information in a particular SUCCESSION/IN-AND-OUT pair . The flat structure of the JOB-SITUATION object makes merging much simpler as well as making the case frame and semantic pattern s easier to define. These must be converted to SUCCESSION and IN-AND-OUT objects before the template generation step, since this is what the template generator expects . The discourse processor performs this conversion . Each trigger fragment contains one or more words whose semantics triggered the DDO. A DDO can have multiple trigger fragments if the discourse component determines that the triggers co-refer . In this example, \"stepping down\" in the first fragment and \"succeeded\" in the second fragment are judged by the discourse processor to be referring t o the same succession . A score of 0 indicates that the filler was found either directly by the semantics or by a sentence-level pattern ; 1 that it was found in the same fragment as a trigger form ; 2 in the same sentence ; 4 in th e Entity : PERSON NAME-OF :\"Dooner' State-of Affairs : POSIITONSTATUS-GEN-IN Entity : PERSON PRONOUN : \"He \" Event: JOB-SITUATION JOBStIUATION-PERSON: JOB-SITUATION-STATUS : Unknown-role : 60 same paragraph ; and 6 in an adjacent paragraph . The \"<=>\" indicates a reference resolution by the discourse processor . Note that in the first IN-AND OUT, the pronoun \"he\" has been determined to refer to \"James \" .

The template generator uses a combination of data-driven and expectation-driven strategies . First the DDOs found by the discourse module are used to produce template objects . Next, the slots in those objects are filled usin g information in the DDO, the discourse predicate database, other sources of information such as the message heade r (e .g ., document number), or from heuristics (e .g ., the type of an organization object is most likely to be COMPANY) .

This was created by retrieving article s using the University of Massachusetts document retrieval engine INQUERY . This gave us more training dat a (though presumably of a lesser quality) without violating the integrity of our high-quality blind test set . The blin d test set was used to measure our progress at least once a week, with the frequency increasing as the end of the evaluation approached .

The texts were examined for words or collocations which needed to be added to the domain-dependent lexicon . An automated tool generated n-tuples based on part-of-speech tag to aid this process . TE was slightly different as the training data from the dry run was still valid . Despite this, once the new training data arrived we concentrated almost exclusively on it, mainly using the older data as a \"sanity check\" before making system changes .

As with NE, many groups performed at a level higher than any previous template fill task i n MUC-3, -4, or -5 . It will be interesting to see if this general template task is broadly useful, and whethe r performance is at a level high enough to warrant deployment in some real task(s) . 1 Given the already ambitious nature of MUC-6, we do not disagree with the decision to consolidate on the fou r evaluation tasks, nor are we arguing to make parsing an evalution task in MUC-7 . 6 3","2. Given the little effort we invested in TE, we believe that another two person weeks could get PLUM's scores on blind test material over 80. To do this, we would improve NE performance (see discussion of NE above) an d would work further on the locale, country, and descriptor slots . An example of simple alias improvements is to recognize \"Mr . Smith\" as an alias after seeing \"John Smith,\" instead of merely predicting \"Smith\" and \"John\" a s possible aliases . We also believe that it is possible to achieve an F of 80 or better in TE using only lightweigh t processing .","3. To achieve an F above 90, on the other hand, is likely to require significant overall improvement and heavyweight processing in particular . We would incorporate the SPATTER parser, which parses far mor e accurately than FPP does, and would look to aid to our domain-independent semantic lexicon, so that there i s more semantic information to support merging of entity descriptions . Together, we believe these offer the best prospect for radically improved performance in the descriptor, locale and country slots .","4. Our TE system by design, employs no domain-specific knowledge . It therefore should work equall y well on other text, not specific to change in corporate officers .","5. PLUM's Performance had not peaked on TE, since we put the least effort on it of any of the evaluatio n dimension .

We would like to incorporate the SPATTER parser, which parses far more accurately than FP P does, and would look to add to our domain-independent semantic lexicon so as to improve merging of entit y descriptions. Together, this should improve overall recognition, merging and discrimination of all objects, an d may be a key to accurately recognizing events/relationships not detectable in a single sentence ."]},{"title":"OVERALL CONCLUSION S","paragraphs":["We make two general observations . First, the state of the art has progressed greatly in portability in the last fou r years . For MUC-3, some high performing groups invested a small number of person years . By contrast, several groups this year achieved an F in the 50s in 30 calendar days . Yet, we believe that we are only beginning to understand techniques for learning domain-independent knowledg e and domain-dependent knowledge . Far more can be achieved . BBN particularly would like to investigate ho w statistical algorithms over large unmarked corpora can effectively extrapolate from a few training examples, such a s in ST in MUC-6, to provide greater coverage. For example, statistical techniques may have suggested th e importance of \"hire,\" a verb which many groups did not define . Second, since there has been a marked improvement in the quality of full parsers, now achieving an F in the hig h 80s (Magerman, 1995), we believe it is now feasible to consider using full parsers again . The rationale i s straightforward : for full templates (e .g ., ST) scores have been mired with an F in the 50s ever since MUC-3 in 1991 . Pattern matching has given us very robust, very portable technology, but has not broken the performance barrier al l systems have run up against. Recent (statistical) full parsers (e .g ., BBN's, IBM's, and UPenn's) have such quantitatively better performance that they are qualitatively better . We believe this offers the opportunity to agai n 64 try heavyweight techniques to attempt deeper understanding . Pattern matching techniques will still have a crucia l role for domain-specific details, but we believe they can be greatly improved by deeper understanding . SYSTEM WALKTHROUGH S","No development was done on the walkthrough messages for any of the domains . The walkthrough message has 3 succession events . The first 2 successions come from 2 sentences (s1 & s2), where Mr . Dooner replaces Mr . James in two positions (CEO & chairman) . The third succession comes from a much later sentence (s3) having to do with a vice-presidency . (sl) alone does not completely define one of the successions (each of which has 2 in-and-ou t objects for the 2 people involved) . \"Now, Mr. James is preparing to sail into the sunset, and Mr . Dooner is poised to rev up the engines to guid e Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson into the 21 51 century. Yesterday, McCann made official what had been widely anticipated : (sl) Mr. James, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and will retire as chairma n at the end of the year. (s2) He will b succeeded by Mr. Dooner, 45 . \"","PLUM performed fairly well on this article . We found the right corporations, the right people, the right positions, etc . When we saw \"person p1 retires from positions y and z\" and \"person p2 will succeed him\" we don' t infer p2 takes over both positions, and in this case, we pair his succeeding with only position y, thus the firs t succession is completely correct and gets the 2 in-and-out objects, but the second only has one . In the TE output , we missed the alias \"John Dooner\", possibly due to a shortcoming in the aliasing algorithm ."]},{"title":"NE OUTPUT : (for sl, s2)","paragraphs":["Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON\">James</ENAMEX>, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on <TIME X TYPE=\"DATE\">July 1</TIMEX> and will retire as chairman at the end of the year .

For Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON\">Dooner</ENAMEX>, it means maintaining hi s running and exercise schedule, and for the agency, it means developing more global campaigns that nonetheles s reflect local cultures . One <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION'>McCann</ENAMEX> account, \"I Can't Believ e It ' s Not Butter,\" a butter substitute, is in 11 countries, for example . </p > <p > <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION'>McCann</ENAMEX> has initiated a new so-called global collaborativ e system, composed of world-wide account directors paired with creative partners .

Mr . <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON'>James</ENAMEX>, who has a reputation as an extraordinarily tough taskmaster , says that because he \"had a great time\" in advertising,\" he doesn't want to \"talk about the disappointments .\" In fact , when he is asked his opinion of the new batch of <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION\">Coke</ENAMEX> ad s 67 from CAA, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON\">James</ENAMEX> places his hands over his mouth . He shrugs . He doesn't utter a word.
