Some components are more effective than others, some have been under developmen t longer than others, but in all cases, we are working to eliminate manual knowledge engineering . Although UMas s has participated in previous MUC evaluations, all of our information extraction software has been redesigned an d rewritten since MUC-5, so we are evaluating a completely new system this year .","In particular, we are working with new string recognition specialists (for Named Entities), a new part-of-speech tagger, a new sentence analyzer, a new and fully automated dictionary construction algorithm, a new discours e analyzer, and a new coreference analyzer . The most interesting components in our system are CRYSTAL (whic h generates a concept node dictionary) [13], WRAP-UP (which establishes relational links between entities) [14, 15 , 16], and RESOLVE (the coreference analyzer) [8] . Each of these components utilizes machine learning techniques i n order to customize crucial extraction capabilities based on representative training texts .","Our preparations for MUC-6 began on June 19 (at the release of the Call for Participation) and ended on Octobe r 2 when we began our test runs . All of our ST-specific training began in September with the release of the ST keys . As much as we try to exploit trainable technologies, there are nevertheless places where some amount of manua l coding is still needed . For example, we needed to write string manipulation functions to trim output strings in a n effort to generate slot fills consistent with the MUC-6 slot fill guidelines . We also needed to create template parser s and text marking interfaces in order to map the MUC-6 training documents into data usable by our trainabl e components."]},{"title":"SYSTEM OVERVIE W","paragraphs":["At the foundation of all our system configurations are the string specialists : these are the pattern matchin g routines that attempt to recognize proper names, dates, and other stylized noun phrase descriptions . The specialists that we used for NE consist of separate routines designed to handle locations, organizations, people, dates, money , and percentages . The location, organization, and people specialists rely on dictionaries for their recognition . The organization and people specialists used for NE were based on code (heavily modified) developed in the Informatio n Retrieval Laboratory at UMass . The dictionaries supporting those specialists were also borrowed from the IR La b with some adjustments for MUC-6 . All other specialists were developed in the NLP Lab, and the location specialis t accessed a dictionary based on a subset of the Gazetteer entries .","The BADGER sentence analyzer refers to a collection of processes associated with part-of-speech (p-o-s) tagging , a trainable decision tree used to locate appositive constructions, local syntactic analysis, and semantic case fram e instantiation . The processing of BADGER is not significantly different than that of the CIRCUS system used i n previous MUC evaluations [4, 5, 6] . Concept node (CN) definitions are still used to create case frame instantiation s and multiple CN definitions can apply to the same text fragment . BADGER is domain/task independent and require s no adjustment in order to move from one application to another . It does depend on CN definitions that ar e appropriate for a given domain/task, but different CN dictionaries can be plugged into BADGER as fully portabl e dictionary files . BADGER also relies on a p-o-s dictionary as well as semantic feature tags, and we do customize a p - o-s dictionary and a semantic feature hierarchy for specific domains . This customization is handled manually, but it is not a difficult task . 127","BADGER currently recognizes 27 p-o-s tags and it took 24 hours to manually create a p-o-s dictionary fo r MUC-6 . We began with our domain independent core tags lexicon, which includes prepositions, determiners, and a number of common verbs . We then added terms that occurred 500 or more times in the six years of Wall Stree t Journal articles (1987-1992) from the Tipster collection, based on manual inspection . The p-o-s tag lexicon has 2084 entries . Semantic features were assigned to those same terms and also to those terms of interest to the ST tas k that appeared in the formal training set (100 texts) . The semantic lexicon has 5453 entries . We used 45 semantic features and the creation of this semantic tagging dictionary took 36 hours .","The creation of a CN dictionary is now fully automated and accomplished by CRYSTAL, an inductiv e dictionary construction system . In previous MUC evaluations we used the AutoSlog system to generate C N dictionaries [10, 11, 12], but AutoSlog required human interaction for a quality control assessment of proposed C N definitions . CRYSTAL requires no such human review, and creates CN dictionaries on the basis of machine learnin g techniques [13] .","In order to map BADGER output into MUC-6 text annotations, a number of decisions must be made abou t important noun phrases, including semantic type identification, concept attribute assignments, and coreferenc e recognition . These decisions are handled primarily by hand-coded consolidation routines, WRAP-UP, a trainabl e discourse analyzer designed to establish relational links between referents, and RESOLVE, a trainable coreference analyzer.","When WRAP-UP makes a decision about the proper role of a given noun phrase or a possible relationshi p between two noun phrases, it considers evidence from a variety of sources . All of the features used by WRAP-UP are extracted using a domain-independent mechanism to encode features from CN slot values, from the relativ e position of the referents, and from verb patterns in which the noun phrase appeared . Sometimes these variou s sources provide consistent interpretations, but they often disagree with one another . All of WRAP-UP's decision s are handled by trained decision trees so discrepancies in the incoming data are managed on the basis of simila r situations encountered during training . WRAP-UP is most effective when its training has given it the experience i t needs to deal with various kinds of incongruencies .","RESOLVE handles all the crucial merging decisions used by consolidation and WRAP-UP . It determines when two noun phrases refer to the same entity and should therefore be merged in order to consolidate feature descriptors into a single entity description . If RESOLVE merges entities too aggressively, recall will fall, and if RESOLVE is too passive in its merging decisions, precision will suffer due to spurious entities . RESOLVE's decisions are based on a decision tree induced from feature vector representations of noun phrases . Some of the features used in these representations are domain independent, and some are created for specific domains . The version of RESOLVE used for TE and ST relied on a subset of its domain-independent feature set rather than the larger, domain-enhanced featur e set used for the CO task. TE and ST would probably have benefited from the larger feature set used for the CO task , but there was not enough time to incorporate all of RESOLVE's features into the systems used for the TE and S T tasks .","Space prohibits us from going into much detail about each of the major components in our various MUC- 6 system configurations, so we will concentrate on the trainable components that were present in the TE, CO, and S T tasks . Since different tasks required different configurations, we summarize the relevant system components in th e table below : \\t NE CO TE \\t ST String specialists \\t x \\t x \\t x \\t x BADGER (sentence analysis) \\t x \\t x \\t x RESOLVE (coreference) \\t x \\t x \\t x CRYSTAL (dictionary construction) \\t x \\t x WRAP-UP (relational links) \\t x","We also note that some major system components were designed and implemented during our preparations fo r MUC-6, including all the string specialists, all the consolidation routines, template parsers and text-markin g interfaces to translate MUC-6 training documents into formats compatible with our various trainable components , and a completely new implementation of WRAP-UP . 128"]},{"title":"A SYSTEM WALK-THROUG H","paragraphs":["It always helps to look at concrete examples, and the designated walk-through text provides us with a n opportunity to describe some selected processing as it tackles a specific text . We will limit most of our discussio n to a single sentence as it was handled by RESOLVE, CRYSTAL, and WRAP-UP . \"Mr .

James\", \"chief executive officer\" and \"chairman\" are al l descriptions of the same person entity . RESOLVE succeeds here by examining pairwise combinations of nou n phrases (NPs) .","The pairwise examination of NPs is handled by a C4 .5 decision tree . This tree was created by an inductive algorithm in response to a collection of representative NP pairs extracted from available training data. The complete tree is large, containing 133 nodes or possible decisions points . To get a feel for the RESOLVE d-tree, we present a piece of the tree starting at the root node . The parenthetical numbers indicate how many training instances were encountered at each leaf nodes of the tree . Decision points are more reliable when a large number of trainin g instances are examined for a given condition .

This feature is true when an NP is a recognized alias of the othe r NP (e .g . \"GM\" is an alias of \"General Motors Corp .\") . After checking ALIAS and SAME-STRING, the featur e MOST-RECENT-COMPATIBLE-SUBJECT is checked . This feature is true when phrase-1 and phrase-2 ar e compatible (number and gender), and when phrase-1 is the most recent SUBJECT in the text . This feature was included specifically to handle pronoun resolution, and represents a variation on the well-known heuristic of mergin g with any referent found in the most recent compatible phrase . However, RESOLVE's version adds an extr a constraint: the previous phrase must be found in the SUBJECT buffer .","If phrase-1 is the MOST-RECENT-COMPATIBLE-SUBJECT, and NAME-2 = No (i .e., phrase-2 has no name information - meaning that its probably a pronoun or other anaphoric reference), then the phrases are judge d coreferent . If phrase-2 does have name information (NAME-2 = Yes), but phrase-1 does not have name information (NAME-1 = No), then they are also judged coreferent.","It is interesting to note that SAME-TYPE is not checked until the fourth layer of the tree : if SAME-TYPE = No, then they are not coreferent . One might reasonably expect to see this at the root node since incompatible type s should certainly be strong evidence for non coreference. But keep in mind that RESOLVE was not trained on perfec t data . If NPs were not processed correctly by the string specialists, then RESOLVE is right to reduce its confidence i n the SAME-TYPE feature accordingly . We know from our NE evaluation, that our string specialists sometime s 129 labeled an organization as a person or location by mistake . This created a significant noise level for SAME-TYPE , enough to render the feature questionable. Had SAME-TYPE been more reliable, it probably would have found its way to the top of the tree .","Here is a rundown of how the features at the top of RESOLVE's decision tree were operating during th e complete walkthrough text : ALIAS = YES was used for 25 instances . Every instance was correctly classified, though 4 instance s were scored incorrect due to faulty string trimming . SAME-STRING = YES was used for 19 instances . 14 of those were correctly classified ; all th e misclassified instances were \"it\" phrases, so a little contextual knowledge would have probably helpe d (all \"it\" phrases were attempted, but many were irrelevant) . MOST-RECENT-COMPATIBLE-SUBJECT = YES was used for 2 instances . Both times i t misclassified the instances . This feature was supposed to apply only to pronouns and generi c descriptions (\"the company\"), but in looking over the code for this feature extractor, we see that it wa s not properly constrained. PERSON-IS-ROLE = YES This feature was never used in the walk-through text . If the patterns used in this feature extractor were expanded (to include, for example, \"IS STEPPING DOWN AS\"), then i t might have been more useful .","To understand how RESOLVE handled our focus sentence, we have to examine portions of the tree further fro m the root. It appears that the following decision points were important for this sentence : Tree 2 : another portion of the coreference tre e I SAME-TYPE = YES : I I PRONOUN-2 = NO : I \\t I \\t 1111 PRONOUN-1= NO: I \\t I \\t I I I I I \\t NAME-2 = NO: I \\t I \\t I I I I I \\t I \\t I I SAME-SENTENCE = YES : I \\t I \\t I I I I I \\t I \\t I I I \\t NAME-1 = YES : \"+\" (20.0/8 .0 )","Some intermediate nodes have been removed (all had value \"NO\") . These branch points indicate that anytime w e had two references to the same type of object, neither phrase is a pronoun, the second phrase is not a proper name , both are in the same sentence, and the first phrase is a proper name, then RESOLVE classified the two references a s coreferent . The numbers at the leaf node (NAME-1 = YES) indicate that there were 20 instances that had the same feature values in the training set, and that 12 of these were positive and 8 were negative . Since the defaul t classification for an ambiguous leaf node -- a leaf node that contained both positive and negative instances -- was to take the \"majority class\", the tree returned \"+\" .","This may seem to be an unintuitive and risky pattern for coreference classification, but in fact, this processin g turned out to be correct in the walk-through text whenever RESOLVE received correctly extracted NPs . The onl y time it erred was when RESOLVE was handed badly trimmed phrases or phrases with incorrect semantic features . S o we've stumbled upon a rule induced by RESOLVE that probably wouldn't have been discovered manually . Yet i t appears to be effective on real data -- which is precisely why machine learning may be more effective in the long ru n than manual knowledge engineering . 130"]},{"title":"A Walk with CRYSTA L","paragraphs":["When we look at the full sentence analysis for our target sentence, we begin with a simple syntactic analysi s into two segments : Subj : Mr. James, 57 years old Verb : i s Obj : steppin g PP : \\t down as chief executive office r Conj : an d Verb : will retire PP : \\t as chairman PP : \\t at the end of the year","Note that BADGER recognized \"stepping\" as a noun . This is because our p-o-s dictionary (derived from WS J articles) didn't contain \"stepping\" as a verb form . Interestingly, this error does not cause us any difficultie s downstream because the exact same interpretation would have been applied during training . As long as the system i s handling noun/verb ambiguities consistently, we do not suffer substantially from these tagging errors .","BADGER then applies CN definitions from CRYSTAL's dictionary and finds four CNs that apply to the firs t segment, three that extract \"Mr .

WRAP-UP used 17 different C4 .5 decision trees in its processing . Eight of these identify specific relationships between entities, five of them attempt to filter out spurious entities that do not meet the scenario relevance guidelines, and four fill in default values for template element attributes . We will now look at two examples of selected trees in action .","Tree 3 shows a portion of a tree that considers relationships between Person and Status . Each Status o r Status_Evidence which has been identified in the text is paired with each Person to form an instance . An instance i s formed for \"Mr .

If both are found in the same noun phrase (which is the case for Mr . James and Status-Out), the tree returns a positive classification . An In-and - Out relationship is created with IO_Person = Mr .

For the MUC-6 evaluation, we used the C4 .5 decision tree induction system [9] . RESOLVE was designed to work in conjunction with an information extraction system ; as such, it s expected input is a set of phrases that are relevant to a specified information extraction task . The knowledg e RESOLVE uses in order to learn to classify coreferent phrases is based on the same shallow knowledge used by ou r other system components .","The MUC-6 CO task was defined to include nearly all noun phrases, not just those that were relevant to eithe r the TE or ST tasks . Competent analysis of coreferent relationships among all noun phrases requires a much mor e refined knowledge base and much deeper linguistic analysis than we employ in any of our current informatio n extraction components . However, we discovered that 66% of the recall in the CO dry-run test materials was based o n references to people and organizations . We also intended to use RESOLVE for coreference resolution within the T E and ST tasks, where it would have to deal with person and organization references .","With these factors in mind, we decided to run RESOLVE on the MUC-6 CO task, but to constrain its input s o that it only attempted to find coreferent relationships among references to people and organizations, references tha t were potentially relevant to the MUC-6 TE and ST tasks . We therefore expected that our recall would be lower tha n other systems that attempted to find coreferent relationships among the full set of noun phrases defined by the MUC - 6 CO task, but we hoped that the evaluation would be valuable nonetheless .","Our official CO scores were 44% recall and 51% precision . If 66% of the recall for the MUC-6 CO fina l evaluation was based on references to people and organizations, as it was for the dry-run evaluation, then RESOLVE was actually achieving approximately 67% of the total recall for which it was originally intended . Earlie r experiments with RESOVE in the MUC-5 EJV domain showed that our unpruned C4 .5 decision trees used fo r coreference resolution tend to get higher recall and lower precision than unpruned decision trees. Since RESOLV E was already handicapped with respect to potential recall -- focusing only on person and organization references -- w e decided to use unpruned trees in the final evaluation . After the official evaluation, we retrained RESOLVE based on a prepruning procedure in which only the \"easiest\" subset of the positive training instances (pairs of coreferent phrases ) are used . This version of RESOLVE suffered a small decrease in recall, 41%, but a much larger increase i n precision, 59% .","Although our recall and precision results are not among the best reported in this evaluation, we find the result s extremely encouraging given the fact that RESOLVE is a fully trainable system . RESOLVE was designed to find coreferent relationships among references to people and organizations ; since the MUC-6 CO training material included annotations for entities other than people and organizations, a special interface was used to mark 25 relevan t texts from the ST task for person and organization references (5 hours of work) . Another reason for specially marking ST texts was a hope that the CO training could also be used for coreference resolution in the TE and S T tasks ; unfortunately, time constraints prevented us from using this domain-specific coreference resolution training in the latter two tasks .","We spent 2 weeks on a system component that could reliably identify phrases from BADGER that wer e relevant candidates for the CO task, which in our view were phrases referring to people and organizations . Anothe r week was spent modifying feature extractors used in the MUC-5 English Joint Ventures domain and adding new features designed specifically for the MUC-6 CO task (especially resolution of pronominal references to people and organizations) and the ST task (especially associating persons with their roles) . The output generator, which was required to handle potentially nested COREF SGML tags, required nearly a week-long effort .","Given the nature of trainable decision tree technology, it is safe to assume that RESOLVE's performance woul d improve for both recall and precision with additional training .

WRAP-UP is responsible for all the relational links that describe successions and in-and-out instances . So it is fair to expect that TE will operate as an upper bound for ST . But we see significant drops in both recall and precision as we move from TE to ST .","Part of this drop in recall and precision comes from low recall for new status, which is critical to this scenario . Persons and organizations which are not involved in a change of job status are discarded as irrelevant . CRYSTAL learned CNs named STATUS-IN and STATUS-OUT to identify persons involved in a change of status . The S T training texts provided only about 150 instances each for STATUS-IN and STATUS-OUT, which was insufficien t training . CRYSTAL had limited recall for these CNs .","WRAP-UP takes as input the output from BADGER and forms In-and-Out relations and Succession events . WRAP-UP learns to discard as irrelevant any persons and organizations that are not attached to an In-and-Out or a Succession . When our system does not extract a new status due to low recall by domain-specific CNs, this ca n cause WRAP-UP to discard relevant persons and organizations, further lowering recall . We believe that the training available to CRYSTAL and WRAP-UP was too sparse to enable intelligent inferences about succession events .","The following graph shows the learning curve for CN definitions that identified Organization names . The 30 0 available TE texts were randomly partitioned into training set and a blind test set with training size ranging fro m 10% to 90% of the documents .

After 270 training texts it was getting half the or g names, but appears from the slope of the learning curve that it was not reaching saturation yet .","We expect that WRAP-UP would tell a similar story if we were to compute the learning curve for key relationa l decisions . Inductive learning algorithms eventually flatten out with enough training, but performance tends t o increase steadily up until that plateau is reached . 13 7","Although CRYSTAL was trained on 300 TE documents, WRAP-UP was only trained on 100 ST documents . The ST training corpus was undoubtedly much too small to support an inductive algorithm designed to lear n relational decisions .

We have rewritten all of our software in order to enhance cross - platform portability . In addition, we have exploited tagged text documents of the type used in MUC-6 . Ou r experiences with previous MUC evaluations gave us a clear understanding of the hurdles that lie ahead . We mad e progress in some areas and ignored others completely .","Over the years we have come to appreciate the significant difficulties of software evaluation and the uniqu e problems associated with language processing evaluations . We have pondered the lessons of previous MUCs an d worried about the wisdom of a research agenda dominated by score reports . Do performance evaluations succeed i n bringing theoretical ideas closer to real-world systems? Or do they inadvertently create a wedge between basi c research and applied research ?","These big questions are easier to ask than answer, but we have always found the MUC evaluations to b e valuable for our own system development efforts . There are always lessons to be learned and a few genuinely ne w ideas to ponder as well . Two of this year's lessons are painfully obvious to us . Most notably, it pays to engineer the best possible string specialists . If you fail to recognize half of the organizations in a test set, it will be difficul t to do well on extraction tasks involving organizations . It is also a mistake to rely on a trainable system componen t that is not given enough training . We learned that 100 documents do not provide enough training for our system .","Other lessons are more subtle and were not immediately obvious (at least to us) . Most notably, the TE task fo r MUC-6 could be effectively tackled without the benefit of a sentence analyzer . Noun phrase analysis was very important, and coreference resolution played a role, but we saw no benefit from CRYSTAL's dictionary for TE . I f the CN definitions had been operating at a finer level of granularity, we might have been able to acquire usefu l extraction rules for noun phrase analysis . Although our current version of CRYSTAL does not operate at this level , we are currently developing a version of CRYSTAL to learn finer-grained CN definitions .","BADGER's CN output was put to better use in ST where WRAP-UP used CN patterns in order to induc e relations between entities . Unfortunately, there was not enough training to produce effective decision trees, s o WRAP-UP didn't exactly get a fair trial here . We also noticed that CRYSTAL's dictionary was too sparse to cove r all the useful morphological variants for important verbs and verb phrases . In previous MUC evaluations, wher e 1,000 or more training documents were provided, our dictionary construction tool picked up the more importan t morphological variants because the training corpus contained examples of them . With only 100 ST trainin g documents this year, our dictionary was missing important verb constructions. For example, the training corpu s contained a past tense instance for a specific verb but no present progressive instance . It appears that 100 trainin g texts are not enough for CRYSTAL's dictionary induction algorithm . Or at the very least, a CRYSTAL dictionary based on so little training should be strengthened with recognition routines for morphological variants . Thes e problems do not reflect any essential weakness on the part of CRYSTAL's learning algorithm : they merely illustrate the importance of adequate training materials for machine learning algorithms .","In spite of these difficulties, we are quite pleased with the portability of our trainable system components . Th e one-month time frame for ST was not a problem for us as far as CRYSTAL, WRAP-UP, and RESOLVE were concerned . CRYSTAL and WRAP-UP could have trained on 1000 texts as easily as 100, and RESOLVE would hav e been in the same boat if it had been able to train from the MUC-annotated documents directly .","The manual text annotations required for RESOLVE provide us with our final observation about MUC-6 an d our MUC-6 system . When a trainable system relies on annotated texts for training, some annotations are mor e useful than others . Because RESOLVE was designed without any concern for the task definition of the MUC-6 C O task, the training annotations we developed for RESOLVE were not deducible from the annotation system used i n MUC-6. As other trainable text processing technologies emerge and develop independent from MUC-6, it may b e impossible to create an annotation system that is equally accommodating to all . The inevitable politics of such a 138 situation will be difficult to mediate unless all sites agree to follow the lead of MUC annotation conventions fo r their own internal development efforts . Although this would ease the problem of diverging systems, it might als o suppress imaginative new perspectives on the coreference problem . This conundrum has all the earmarks of a no-wi n situation .","In summary, our greatest concern after MUC-6 is that the preparation of adequate training corpora may be to o expensive or too labor-intensive to enable a fair evaluation of trainable text processing technologies . This wil l either drive those technologies \"underground\" (at least with rrespect to MUC meetings), or it may discourage a whol e line of research which we feel holds great promise . In our experience, it seems clear that annotated text document s are much less difficult to generate than the key templates used in previous MUC evaluations . It therefore seem s ironic to find such a small collection of training documents available to MUC-6 participants this year . We hope that this decision to minimize the training corpus can be reconsidered for future evaluations ."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["This research was supported by NSF Grant No .
