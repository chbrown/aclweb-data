One of our goals is t o experimentally demonstrate that an NLP system that closely parallels the representational and inferentia l characteristics of natural language allows one to achieve an in-depth processing (eg ., querring automaticall y from texts created knowledge bases or entity classification), with close-to-real-time, high-recall-and-precisio n performance ."]},{"title":"Why and What for MUC- 6 MUC6 Tasks Not Inconsistent with Our Goal s","paragraphs":["We view the MUC6 tasks as not inconsistent with our goal of providing further experimental evidence i n support of our research hypothesis . Also, we have been conducting experiments in non-committal processing with controlled resource allocation such as exploiting local interpretations, taking advantage of loca l contexts, and performing expensive computations such as disambiguation only if needed . We have also been experimenting with flexible processing such as undoing various decisions and independent processin g of related tasks . The NE MUC-6 task is a good test for such experiments . Coreference— Most Interesting Tas k We were particularly interested in the coreference task, with the NE task largely considered as a preparatio n stage for it because : 1. Reference resolution is critical for processing pretty much any text in any domain ;","2. We believe that mechanism for resolving references to named entities is basically the same regardles s of the entities' types . Identifying certain named entities and therefore resolving references to them may be facilitated by the availability of extra constraints on the beginning or the end of the name . For example, identifying personal and company names is facilitated by the fact that personal name s often start with a title such as \"Ms .\" and company names often end with a corporate extension suc h as \"Ltd\" . \\t 263","3 . We are in the process of demonstrating that it is natural language for acquiring knowledge, and no t acquiring knowledge in order to process natural language . Our very encouraging preliminary results show that definite anaphora facilitates acquisition of taxonomic knowledge [Iwanska, 1996a], includin g the \"type-subtype\" and \"part-subpart\" relations . These results demonstrate that approaches to definite anaphora resolution that rely primarily on the availability of such knowledge, a standard approach i n all NLP systems we are aware of, are misguided . Successful Techniques for Developing and Testing In-Depth Processing Large Number of Text s Finally, by participating in MUC6 we hoped to share our experience and learn from the other participant s about successful techniques for developing and testing in-depth processing for a large, more than two thou - sands, number of texts and for developing large knowledge bases ."]},{"title":"UNO MODEL OF NATURAL LANGUAG E Closely Mimics Representation and Reasoning Inherent in Natural Languag e","paragraphs":["The UNO model closely mimics the representation and reasoning inherent in natural language because it s translation procedure, data structures of the representation, and inference engine are motivated by th e semantics and pragmatics of natural language . One payoff of this close correspondence to natural languag e is the capability of automatically creating and querring knowledge bases from textual documents' .","Sentences asserting properties of (sets of) individuals, sentences describing subtyping relations, includin g extentional type definitions, as well as intensional definitions of concepts such a s 1. \" John is a neither good nor hard-working nurse \" , \"Not many students did welt' 2. \" Dobermans, poodles and terriers are dogs \"","3. \"Elephant— a huge, thick-skinned, mammal with very few hairs, with a long, flexible snout, and tw o ivory tusks\"","are uniformly represented by the following type equations : type == { < P1i TP1 >, < P2 ,TP2 >, . . .,"]},{"title":"<","paragraphs":["Pn,TPn"]},{"title":"> }","paragraphs":["Their left-hand side, \"type\", is the representation of a noun phrase, the largest type, or the name of a concept ; the right-hand side is a two-element set : a property value P, and TP- a set of < t, p > element s representing the fact that the property value P holds at a temporal interval t with the probability p .","Individual property values, temporal intervals and probabilities are represented by the sets [a l , a 2 , . . ., a n ] whose elements a, are terms, record-like structures consisting of a head, a type symbol, and a body, a list of attribute-value pairs : attribute => value .

Updating knowledge base and automated inferencing is done by the same semantically clea n computational mechanism of performing Boolean operations on the representation of natural language inpu t and the representation of previously obtained information stored in the knowledge base .","The underlying knowledge representation formalisms with the computable Boolean algebras with set - theoretic and interval-theoretic semantics allows one to capture semantics of different syntactic categorie s because sets and intervals underlie semantics of many syntactic categories : common nouns, intransitive verbs , and adjectives can be thought of as denoting sets of persons or objects that possess properties denoted b y the words ; adjectives and adverbs are functions mapping sets of objects into sets of objects ; determiners are functions mapping sets of objects into sets of sets of objects, and the denotations of proper nouns are set s of sets of objects [Dowty et al ., 1981] [Barwise and Cooper, 1981] [Keenan and Faltz, 1985] [Hamm, 1989] .","The same machinery is used as a metalanguage for describing and propagating arbitrary Boolean constraints, including dictionary entries describing morphological and grammatical constraints .

For example, we had decided to extenn the UNO model of natural language to handl e temporal information because virtually all real-life tasks involve handling some aspects of time . There is a large body of existing work on morphologically marked time and aspect, but we had decided against handling this type of temporal information because it necessarily requires high recall and precision of performin g sentential-level parsing, a task that no NLP system, including our system, can perform well . Instead, w e had decided to address temporal information from explicit temporal expressions because we can extremel y reliably recover such expressions via local parsing .","Our natural-language-based temporal reasoner was developed and tested on more than three hundred s 1989 \" Wall Street Journal' articles .

Fo r example, the UNO system does not need to explicitly store the entailment (subsumption) relation betwee n the complex disjunctive type \"power-boat or sail-boat' and the lexically-simple type \"boat\" because this relation is directly (and cheaply) computed from the UNO representation of these two expressions, commo n nouns in this case .","Flat taxonomies are highly desirable because, among others, they facilitate the ease and quality increas e of knowledge base maintenance .","Handling general negation in natural language allows the UNO system to correctly compute possibl e interpretations of the sentence \"Mr. Dooner doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency\", one of which is that Mr . Dooner sees something else . This correct interpretation is automatically preferred by th e system because of the context created by the immediately following sentence \"He points to several campaigns with pride, including the Taster's Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera \" . Adverbial and Adjectival Modification at All Syntactic Levels Adverbial and adjectival modification also contributes to the flatness of our taxonomies . For example, th e UNO system automatically computes the relations between the following pairs of expressions denoting types and qualitative frequency values :","\"smooth process\" \\t \"not very smooth process\" \"no immediate plans\" \\t \"plans\" \"huge models\" \\t \"small model? \"unusual\" \\t \"not extremely unusual\" Nonstandard Quantifiers Some of the nonstandard quantifiers that our system can handle include vague quantifiers involving th e determiner \"many\" . The UNO system automatically computes relations between the following expressions :","\"many differences\" \\t \" very many differences\" \\t \"not very many differences \" Reasoning with Uncertainty and Qualitative Probabilistic Reasoning without Underlying Numeric Values Just like the other systems participating in MUC-6, our system often misses a high-level relation betwee n entities described in a sentence because our parser does not attempt or fails to compute full sentential-leve l parsing . However, even without such a quality parse, the system is capable of automatically computin g relations such as the relation between the following two expression s","\"possible acquisition? \\t \"possible, but not very likely, acquisitions\" 266","While the lack of a quality parse may prevent the system from understanding a high-level relation, i n this case, what exactly was said about possible acquisitions, it understands the difference between \"possible , but not very likely\" and \"possible \" acquisitions . Temporal Reasoning The UNO system does not only identify explicit temporal expressions, but also automatically reasons wit h them . Some of the expressions uniquely handled by our system include the following : 1. Temporal frequency quantifier s \"Not very often\" \\t \"Very often \" 2. Infinite number of temporal relations \"Not in the immediate future\" \"immediately precedes \" \"Shortly before or after\" \\t \"Not long before\" \\t \"Five or sir days before \"","3. Uncertain and underspecified (explicitly negative) temporal information \"It did not happen on April 22, 1992\" \"X happened in April, 1992, or X happened in May, but not early May, 1992\" Reasoning with Underspecified Informatio n The UNO system computes the fact that the following expressions differ in their information content an d that the first has strictly more information than the second :","\" X happened in May, 1992\" \\t \" X happened in May, but not early May, 1992' Automatic Combination of Information Our system offers a highly efficient Boolean \"meet\" operation which is mathematically guaranteed to combine information in the most general way . This UNO operation provides an alternative to ad-hoc mergin g employed by many other systems . We must note, however, that currently this advantage of our system i s rarely realized in practise because it strongly depends on a correct, quality parse of input sentences . Uniform Natural-Language-Based Representation of Taxonomic and Temporal Reasonin g As we explain later, this uniformity of our representation greatly simplifies our architecture and control ."]},{"title":"Work Done during June-October 199 5","paragraphs":["Below we elaborate on the work done between the end of June and beginning of October 1995 . We briefly comment on the scope, importance and quantity of the tasks we had decided to do . 1 . Implemented changes necessary to participate in MUC 6 For example, before MUC-6, the UNO system was preserving the exact image of the input text, but i t did not keep track of the correspondence between the resulting knowledge base and the actual pieces o f input text from which the knowledge base resulted . For MUC-6, we had to redesign our bookkeepin g structures in order to be able to do this . We devoted a considerable effort to this task because such a change directly affects every processing stage . Another piece of code we had to develop were functions for chosing markables and outputting SGML - tagged text . 267","2 . Improved the accuracy of identifying unmarked sentential boundaries Our pre-MUG6 system was quite good in correctly identifying sentential boundaries in newspaper articles . A simple list of 200-or-so standard abbreviations and the sensitivity to the most commo n occurences of periods in numbers was largely responsible for this good performance . We wanted the system to perform this task near-perfectly because it would improve this generally needed capabilit y and because based on the existing literature, we expected the distance expressed in a number o f sentences to be a very important factor in computing pronominal referents .","3 . Improved handling punctuatio n It is fair to say that before MUC-6, we largely ignored, as opposed to handled, punctuaction . Now we can say that we can handle periods, exclamations, most unpaired singlequotes, most commas, an d some dashes . While handling punctuation is good in general, specifically for MUC-6, it is needed fo r processing numbers and facilitating identification of apposites .","4 . Completed half-built semantic hierarchy of structured geographical knowledge . The UNO NLP hierarchy of geographical knowledge contains major geographical information abou t all countries, including capital cities, major and important cities, towns, ports, suburbs, local settlements, geographical and political regions that divide land such as provinces, islands, major ports an d airports, landmarks, monetary, length, area, and volume systems, official languages, major politica l organizations, waters such as seas, lakes, and rivers, and geographical landmarks and points of interes t such as mountains, hills, woods, and national parks . This geographical knowledge is encoded in our uniform, general-purpose UNO knowledge representa - tion ; UNO NLP system supports geographical reasoning with its general inferencing mechanism . We certainly did not need to do this for MUC-6, a simple gazetteer list would do (an approach adopte d by most MUC-6 participants) . However, we put a lot of effort into encoding this hierarchy because :","(a) With the existence of this hierarchy, we further substantiate our claim that natural language i s a powerful and efficient knowledge representation system and add geographical knowledge to th e list of uniformly represented and reasoned about types of knowledge . Right now, our system ca n reason about geographical region containment in the exact analogous fashion as about type subse t relation and temporal interval containment .","(b) We wanted to demonstrate that the same in-depth mechanism of some aspects of geographica l reasoning can be efficiently used to perform a much lesser, MUG6-like task of marking locations . 5 . Identified common named types, including organization types and existing named entities We identified more than 100 types other than the type \"organization\" and developed sizable knowledg e bases and dictionaries with the actual existing, classified named entities of these types . We decided t o do it in order to experimentally substantiate our belief that reference mechanism for named entities o f different types is basically the same for all entity types, and that references can be computed by the same piece of code . 6 . Implemented numbers and personal name s Our effort of making the UNO system process numbers and improving handling personal names wa s strictly related to MUC-6 . 7 . Developed and tested a general approach to handling abbreviations, acronyms and aliases We spent much more effort on abbreviations, acronyms and aliases than originally planned . First , such short forms are very common in written language . Second, handling such short forms resemble s handling semantic ambiguity. And third, short forms fit with our ongoing research on context . 8 .
