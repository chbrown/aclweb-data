It is possible to vary the number o f transducers as a parameter of an application, as well as to control precisely how each transducer accepts and produces output . A transducer may handle input by nondeterministically starting at each point in the input stream, or sequentially by determining the final states reachable from th e first point of the input stream, and then restarting the transducer at the end of each successiv e \"best\" analysis . Typically, all FASTUS phases except the final phase follow the latter regimen , and the templates for all the fragments are merged to form the final analysis . Phases also have th e option of passing unanalyzable input to the next phase, or eliminating it from the stream . The MUC-6 system employs the following sequence of transducers :","1. Tokenizer. This phase accepts a stream of characters as input, and transforms it into a sequence of tokens . Most English text is tokenized in the same way, so applications that require heavy runtime optimization can replace this phase by one that is coded directl y in the implementation programming language . However, some domains that make unusual demands on tokenization, (i .e . the text contains frequent chemical or mathematical formulas , or names with internal structure, like names for chemical compounds or drugs) may requir e their own tokenizers, and FASTUS makes an excellent rapid-prototyping tool . In Japanese , where tokenization is problematic, we have replaced the tokenization phase by a standar d off-the-shelf segmenter (JUMAN) . The result of the tokenization is to ignore completely th e whitespace in the input text stream . The FASTUS system preserves whitespace informatio n internally to facilitate the analysis of spatially structured objects like tables and outlines, bu t this capability, much exercised in the Warbreaker Message Handler, was of no consequenc e for MUC-6 .","2. Multiword Analyzer . This phase is generated automatically by the lexicon to recognize toke n sequences (like \"because of\") that are combined to form single lexical items .","3. Preprocessor. The preprocessor is the point at which the application developer can insert a transducer to handle more complex or productive multiword constructs than could be handle d automatically from the lexicon . An example is the transformation of a sequence like \"twent y three\" into a single number, associated with its numeric value .","4. Name Recognizer. This phase recognizes word sequences that can be unambiguously identified as names (like \"ABC Corp .\" and \"John Smith\") . It also finds unknown words an d sequences of capitalized words that don't fit other known name patterns, and flags them s o that subsequent phases can determine their type, using broader context .","5. Parser. This phase constructs basic syntactic constituents of English, consisting only of thos e that can be nearly unambiguously constructed from the input using finite-state rules . The output of this phase consists of noun groups (the part of the noun phrase from the determine r through the head noun) and verb groups (the verb together with auxiliaries and adjacent an d intervening adverbs) .

Th e shortcoming remained, however, that writing FASTSPEC rules was not something that one coul d reasonably expect an analyst to do in response to an information extraction need . If information extraction systems are going to be used in a wide variety of applications, it will ultimately b e necessary for the end users to be able to customize the systems themselves in a relatively shor t time .","Customizing an extraction system to a domain has always been a long and tedious process . One must determine all the ways in which the target information is expressed in a given corpus , and then think of all the plausible variants of those ways, so that appropriate regular patterns ca n be written . Because computational linguists have been developing systems for a long time tha t employ grammars that capture the relevant linguistic generalizations, one might be led to believ e that systems that are based on linguistically-motivated English grammars would be much easier t o adapt to a new domain . 239","It has, however, been the experience at past MUC evaluations that systems based on genera l grammars have not performed as well as those that have been customized in a more application - dependent manner . The reasons for this are more practical than theoretical . General grammars of English, by virtue of being general, are also highly ambiguous . One consequence of this ambiguity i s that a relatively long processing time is required for each sentence ; this implies, in turn, a relatively long develop-test-debug cycle. Moreover, these systems have proved rather brittle when faced wit h the multitude of problems that arise when confronted by real-world text . (Lack of robustness may not be inherent in the approach, and much of the current work in corpus-based statistical model s is an attempt to overcome this problem) .","One might naturally wonder whether one can have the advantages of both worlds : tightl y defined, mostly unambiguous patterns that cover precisely the ways the target information is ex - pressed, and a way of capturing the linguistic generalizations that would make it unnecessary fo r an analyst to enumerate all the possible ways of expressing it . We feel that the FASTUS syste m developed for MUC-6 represents a major step toward achieving this synthesis .","In the current FASTUS system, we attempt to localize the domain-dependence of the rules t o the maximum extent possible . To this end, the FASTPEC rules of the domain phase have bee n divided into domain-dependent and domain-independent portions . The domain-independent par t of the domain-phase consists of a number of rules that one might characterize as parameterize d macros . The rules cover various syntactic constructs at a relatively coarse granularity, the objective being to construct the appropriate predicate-argument relations for verbs that behave accordin g to that pattern . The domain-dependent rules comprise the clusters of parameters that must b e instantiated by the m̀acros' to produce the actual rules . These domain-dependent rules specify precisely which verbs carry the domain-relevant information, and specify the domain-dependent restrictions on the arguments, as well as the semantics for the rule . An example of a typical macro rule is the rule called ActiveBase :","EVENT-PHRASE --> EVENT-ADJUNCT* (NG[??subj] ({COMPL I COMPL1}) ) VG[Active=T,Subcat=Basic,??head ] (NG [??obj] ) {P [??prep l] NG [??pob j 1] I P [??prep2] NG [??pob j 2] I P[??prep3] NG[??pobj3] I EVENT-AD JUNCT}* ; head = (head 2) ; rule-type = ActiveBase ; svo-pattern = ??label ;","??semantics ; ;","This rule describes the basic subject-verb-object pattern of a simple active-voice declarativ e sentence with a transitive verb . The EVENT-ADJUNCT non-terminal parses locative and tempora l adjuncts (as well as absorbing otherwise unknown constituents) . The next optional constituent i s the subject noun phrase, which optionally skips any complements that may be present, followed b y an active verb, an optional object, and up to three prepositional arguments, optionally intersperse d with temporal and locative adjuncts . The alert reader will notice that the only required element in this pattern is the verb—in analyzing a typical sentence, each pattern will be instantiated multipl e times as FASTUS nondeterministically ignores or recognizes the various arguments . The preferre d analysis is, of course, the one that is the most complete . 240","The tokens beginning with \"??\" in the above example are parameters that are specified by th e domain-specific rules when the macro is expanded . Thus, this pattern applies only to noun group s meeting the \"??sub j\" constraints, and to verbs meeting the \"??head\" restrictions, etc .","Currently, domain-specific rules are centered around verbs . In a typical information extraction task, one is interested in events and relationships holding among entities, and these are usually specified by verbs . Verbs, of course, have corresponding nominalizations, so the macros shoul d automatically instantiate nominalization patterns as well . Unfortunately, the current FASTU S lexicon is not rich enough reliably to make the connection between verbs and their correspondin g nominalizations, so the FASTUS system employed for the MUC-6 evaluation did not recognize any nominalized events (like \"resignation\" or \"promotion\") . This is an example of a large gap that i s easy to close .","The success of this general approach depends heavily on two prerequisites : reliable coreference resolution and a well-developed combiner phase . The coreference module is necessary because i t relieves the developer of the domain phase rules of the burden of anticipating all the variations tha t would result from pronominal and definite reference . Otherwise the developer must see to it tha t every rule that involves a company as subject also applies to \"it,\" when it refers to a company, a s well as to \"the company,\" \"the concern,\", etc . The FASTUS coreference module resolves pronouns , reflexives, definites, and some bare nominal temporal expressions, with simple algorithms . (There is a separate Alias Recognition module that also contributes to the overall coreference output . ) The entity associated with an anaphor gets merged with the first consistent entity found while traversing an ordered list of candidate phrases, each of which is associated with a set of entities . Different types of anaphors call for slightly different candidate phrase ordering and consistenc y checking algorithms . Our focus was on coreference of phrases that referred to individuals, no t types, for it is individual coreference that is needed in most information extraction tasks . Type coreference is both theoretically and practically more difficult, as evidenced by the difficulty o f reliable bare-nominal resolution, and its utility in information extraction tasks is unclear . Areas of future extensions are intrasentential coreference based on sentence patterns and limited plausibility inferences based on described events .","The combiner has the responsibility of correctly analyzing appositives and noun-phrase con - junction . This makes it possible for the domain phase to skip complements correctly . If all thi s work is done, then the specification of domain-specific rules can be a surprisingly simple task .","This system of compile-time transformations allowed us to cover with 12 macro rules and 1 5 domain-dependent rules what would otherwise require approximately one hundred patterns, wer e the patterns to be written out explicitly . (Not every macro rule applies to every domain-dependen t rule.) The domain phase for MUC-6 was developed in less than one person-day .","The set of FASTSPEC grammar rules resulting from the application of the domain-independen t macros to the domain-dependent parameters are very close to those that a developer would have written, had he or she been encoding them directly. Thus, the macro rules facility preserves th e ability to write patterns that are tightly constrained to fit the particular relevant sentences of th e domain, but with the additional advantage of automatically generating all of the possible linguisti c variations in an error-free manner . A developer need no longer lament having failed to includ e a p̀assive' variant of a particular pattern simply because no instance occurred in the trainin g corpus . Also, the information specified by the domain-dependent rules is relatively straightforwar d to provide, (although currently obscured by a rather opaque syntax) so that with the help of a 241"]},{"title":"suitable user interface, it is easy to imagine an analyst supplying the system with the informatio n needed to customize it to a new extraction task . Developing such tools is one of our next priorities . OVERALL PERFORMANCE ON MUC-6 TEST S FASTUS achieved an outstanding result of F 94 (Recall 92, Precision 96) on the named entit y recognition task . The scores for the Template Entity task were somewhat lower F 75 .0 (Recall 74 , Precision 76) . This is to be expected, because some of the named entities, such as percentages, ar e very easy to extract reliably, and some of the fields in the template entity task (e .g . descriptors ) are extremly difficult to extract reliably. The system consistently made certain errors in nam e recognition , and because these culprits popped up often, they had a substantial impact on th e score . • Although there were numerous instances in the test corpus in which \"White House\" was use d to refer straightforwardly to the building, the system always classified it as a government organization . • Company names that are identical to person names are a frequent source of error . Th e surname is sometimes categorized as an alias for the person and sometimes as an alias for th e company, depending on where the surname appears relative to the person name or compan y name in the text . • Newspapers are to be classified as companies only when the name is intended to refer to th e publishing company rather than the periodical . We currently have no overall strategy fo r distinguishing these cases, although we do pick them up as companies if they are involved i n succession events in the scenario template task . • Location names were to be treated as government entities when the intended referent of th e name was the government . We made no attempt to do this correctly. • When two named entities were combined in a phrase like an appositive that is recognize d by the combiner, one of the entites would frequently be lost . For example, \"John Smith, a Johnson & Johnson vice president,\" would lose Johnson & Johnson . This was due to some remaining bugs in the combiner grammar . FASTUS achieved one of the better results in the coreference task, with Recall of 59 an d Precision of 72 . In the scenario template task, SRI's FASTUS system achieved a score of F 51 .0 (Recall 44 , Precision 61) . The details of the scenario template task are discussed in the following section . SRI has been involved in information extraction research for over ten years . As mentione d earlier, the FASTUS System has been under development for a little over three years . SRI undertoo k a substantial effort prior to the MUC-6 evaluation to clean up all of the domain-independen t processing phases, so the domain-independent macro rules could be tested and validated . Thi s effort lasted well into the development period for the MUC-6 evaluation . In fact, we were not abl e to do a scoreable run of the development training corpus until September 22—two weeks befor e 242","paragraphs":["the test . During this period we were able to quickly bring the system from an F-measure of 32 . 2 to 55 .3 the day before the test . Nearly all the development effort was focused on the combine r phase and on merging and coreference . As noted above, the total amount of time spent on domai n patterns was less than a day . Examining the results of the test leads us to believe that many of the problems the system encountered represent not conceptual difficulties but easily fillable gaps , such as the nominalization problem referred to above, or missing domain-relevant lexical feature s on important words, that would disappear with a short period of additional development .","This experience also supports the view that customization of FASTUS to a new domain i s relatively easy and thus gives us reason for a good deal of optimisim about the future for practical applications of information extraction technology."]},{"title":"DISCUSSION OF THE EXAMPL E","paragraphs":["The difficulty of building an extraction system is determined to a significant extent by the desig n of the templates to be filled . Ideally, the structure of the templates will correspond in a systemati c way to the linguistic structures through which the relevant information is typically expressed i n natural language . Unfortunately this ideal is rarely met .","The MUC-6 template for the scenario template task presented certain problems . In particula r there was a lack of fit between the conceptualization of succession events embodied in the templat e and the typical expression of the corresponding events in language . For example, it is often th e case that a single event report (e .g . \"John Smith left Microsoft to head a new subsidiary a t Apple\") corresponds to multiple succession events . Conversely, it is (even more) typical to have a single succession event expressed by multiple sentences (events-reports), often far removed fro m one another . Also, static information (e .g . \"John Smith has been chairman for the last five years .\" ) is often essential to filling the final template, although the succession event structure provides n o way of representing this static information ."]},{"title":"The Representation of States and Transition s","paragraphs":["We feel that the proper template design, or ontology, is essential for the rapid development of a n information extraction application . For this reason we developed our own internal representation o f the domain that corresponded more closely with the ways the information is typically expressed i n the texts . A post processor was written to generate the official MUC-6 templates from this interna l representation .","We felt that a more appropriate representation of the domain involved two kinds of structures : states and transitions . A state consists of the association among a person, an organization, and a position at a given point in time . A transition is a ternary relation between states and reasons , associating a start state and and end state with a transition reason . In what follows, we will us e \"position\" to refer to position-organization pairs .","The system recognizes two kinds of transitions associated with a succession event : a perso n pivot, which is a transition in which a start state involving a person and a position is related a state involving the same person but a different position, and a position pivot (which is similar to a 243 succession event), which is a transition in which the start and end states involve a single positio n and two different people . If a sentence directly implies one of these transitions, then transitions o f the other type ('shadow' transitions) are also implied . For example, given the sentence \"John Smit h resigned as executive vice president of Microsoft\" the system represents the content of the sentenc e as a transition involving the state \"John Smith, executive vice president, Microsoft\" to \"Joh n Smith, some other position, some other company .\" The system then also generates the implie d position pivot, namely the transition from \"John Smith, executive vice president, Microsoft\" t o \"Some person, not John smith, executive vice president, Microsoft . \"","The shadow transitions provide a locus for merging of other states and transitions that may b e mentioned in the text . For example, if the next sentence were \"Joe Schmoe will assume the pos t of vice president next month,\" it would produce a shadow position pivot that would merge wit h the shadow position pivot from the previous sentence . States that are not otherwise associate d with transitions can be merged with transitions . If the next sentence were \"Joe Schmoe is the new executive vice president,\" this would also merge with the end state of the shadow position pivo t generated by the previous sentence ."]},{"title":"Mergin g","paragraphs":["We decided to augment the FASTUS merger, described in Section 2 above, to handle equalit y and inequality constraints among slots .

The merger will refuse to merge two templates for which the equalit y and inequality constraints are not satisfied by the resulting merge .

FASTU S did about as well on this message as on the test as a whole, which implies that this was a fairl y typical message, at least as far as the system's processing was concerned . It is thus quite instructive (even to us) to examine the system's response .","The key postulates three succession events for the text : James out, Dooner in as CEO o f McCann-Erickson, James out, Dooner in as chairman of McCann-Erickson, and Kim in as vice chairman of McCann-Erickson .","FASTUS missed the transition event regarding the chairmanship of McCann-Erickson . Th e key sentence, in paragraph 2, where this was introduced was misanalyzed due to a simple bug i n the lexicon . The succession event involving Kim was missed for the simple reason that the ver b \"hire\" was never considered as a domain-relevant verb . There is no conceptual problem here—thi s is merely a consequence of the short development time available . Adding a sub ject-verb-objec t pattern \"Company hires or recruits person from company as position\" and one more small gap i n the system's coverage is filled . 244","What was more disturbing was the second overgenerated succession event found by FASTUS , which was a succession involving Dooner out and Alan Gottesman in as president of Paine Webber . Inspection of the text reveals that Alan Gottesman was mentioned as an analyst with Paine Webber , and was not involved in any succession events . Closer analysis reveals precisely what happened : one sentence in the text is \"There are no immediate plans to replace Mr . Dooner as president . \" The subject of the sentence did not receive a domain analysis, bug the verb phrase \"replace Mr . Dooner as president\" did receive an analysis and produced a partially instantiated position pivo t transition with Dooner as president of something being replaced by somebody else as presiden t of something . The mention of Alan Gottesman as an analyst at Paine Webber produced a stat e (not associated with any transition) consisting simply of Alan Gottesman and Paine Webber (sinc e the position \"analyst\" was not a high corporate officer, it was simply ignored, and the position i n the template left uninstantiated) . When merging took place, this state merged with the sparsely instantiated end state of the position pivot, filling out the overgenerated transition and leadin g eventually to the incorrect succession event .","We were dismayed to discover what appeared to be a grevious but previously undetected bug : sparsely instantiated states and transitions were being allowed to merge, producing many spuriou s results . This bug was fixed by establishing some minimal instantiation requirements for state t o transition merges, and we reran the test and rescored the results . We discovered that our score with the b̀ug' fixed was F 47 .6, (Recall 36, Precision 69) . This bug had purchased us an increas e of nearly 4 points in F measure .","While it is tempting at this point to relabel the b̀ug' as a f̀eature' and consider the matte r no further, there is actually a rather interesting story to be told as to why our performance wa s helped so much by this bug, a story that suggests interesting lines for further investigation . High Recall, Low Precision Extractio n Hardly anyone has attempted to develop a high-recall low-precision extraction system . Part of the problem is that it is far from clear how to go about doing it . Typically, extraction systems ar e built by implementing some likely domain-relevant patterns that signal important information in the text, and then examining ever more texts to find the ever less frequent patterns that signal tas k relevance . This procedure naturally approaches the problem from the low-recall, high precisio n side . The first patterns that come to mind are likely to be the most reliable . As you add more an d more of the rare ones, eventually precision declines as recall creeps upward .","But, what if one wanted to approach the problem from the other angle? The basic idea woul d be the following : posit every entity of the right type as a candidate for participation in one of th e events/relationships of interest, merge to produce more fully instantianted events/relationships an d then filter according to some application-specific criteria . It is plausible to suppose that one woul d start with fairly high recall and gradually, by developing better filter criteria, one would eliminat e most of the clearly irrelevant hypotheses, while eliminating few of the relevant ones .","This is a quite reasonable approach for certain extraction tasks, even those tasks for which high recall and low precision is not an acceptable tradeoff. Such tasks are characterized by th e following features : (1) entities in the domain have easily determined types and (2) the template s are structured so that there is only one or a very small number of possible slots that an entit y of a given type can fill and only entities of a given type can fill those slots . The microelectronic s 245"]},{"title":"domain of the MUC-5 evaluation [6] was a good example of a domain with these characteristics , and techniques similar to these were successfully applied by at least one system in that evaluatio n [5] . Our own experience in working in the labor negotiation domain of the MUC-6 dry run ha s suggested that that domain was also reasonable to approach from this standpoint . We attempted to develop a system that approached the succession task in this manner . We called this approach the àtomistic' approach or the òne rule' approach, because it was based o n finding distinct atoms of relevant information and it was implemented by a single domain rule i n FASTUS . This single rule would look for any PERSON, COMPANY or POSITION in the text , and hypothesize a transition event involving that entity . These typically very partial transition s would be merged and finally a post processor would be invoked to filter the resulting hypothesize d transitions according to various experimental criteria . After experimenting with this approach for a while, it seemed to us that it would be difficul t to raise the F-score beyond the low 40s . The regular ('molecular') FASTUS approach with th e macro-expanded domain rules was already doing as well in tests and it appeared to have mor e promise . We began devoting all our efforts to it . We did realize that the two approaches raised interesting questions, however . In particular, if one has results from both high-recall and high precision systems, can these be combined in som e way to produce a result that would be better than either system taken on its own? The answe r was by no means obvious, and in the end we put aside both the atomic approach and any attemp t to combine the results . One way to view the bug we discovered in our system is that it accomplishes just that : th e bug embodied, quite accidentally, a not unreasonable strategy for selectively adding informatio n to the result, even though the domain phase did not detect a transition involving the entity . Although there was not enough information to actually determine what states the transition applie d to, FASTUS was extracting just enough information from the text to conclude that there was a transition . The system then picked some state to instantiate the transition, and this state was both (1) mentioned in general textual proximity to the transition, and (2) not involved in an y other known transition event . Although this occasionally produces ridiculous hypotheses, it i s frequently correct ; transition events are often mentioned in texts in clusters, and the proximit y heuristic works well . ASSESSMENT OF THE RESULT S We were generally pleased with the results of FASTUS in this evaluation . Our name recognition was close to the best of the among the participating systems and is approaching the practica l maximum performance level for this task . Our coreference module performed the best among all the participants . More important, the module played an important role in the scenario templat e system, and plays an important role in enabling the system to be easily customized to new domains .
