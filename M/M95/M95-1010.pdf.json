The NUBA system did not have a parser and relies on an abductive reasoner to construct the semantic relationships between domain specifi c concepts mentioned in a sentence . The PIE system, on the other hand, relies heavily on a principle-base d broad-coverage parser, called PRINCIPAR [2, 6, 8], that we have developed over the past three years . Most of the information extracted are directly \"read-off\" the parser outputs by a subtree pattern-matcher, bypassin g the usual step of constructing semantic representations .","In spite of the radical difference between the high-level approaches of our MUC-5 and MUC-6 systems , over 85% of the code of the MUC-5 system was reused . This is largely due to the unified abductive view o f different tasks in natural language understanding [7] . PRINCIPAR and the abductive semantic interprete r share the same message passing algorithm for abduction . They differ only in the contents of the messages and constraints on message propagation.","The architecture of the PIE system is shown in Figure 1 . The processing is sequential . A text is firs t broken up into sentences . The lexical analyzer turns a stream of tokens into a lattice of lexical items . The lexical items may then be combined or deleted by lexical rules, which are responsible for recognizing named entities . PRINCIPAR takes the lattice of lexical items and output a dependency tree between the words in a sentence . PRINCIPAR attempts to construct a parse for the full sentence . However, when it fails to do that , it retrieves parse fragments that cover the complete sentence . Information is extracted from the dependenc y trees by a subtree pattern matcher . The format of NE and CO outputs do not meet the standard of the scoring software because of arbitrary insertion and deletion of white spaces . A separate program is used t o resolved the differences .","The PIE system is implemented in about 38k lines of C++, about 33k to 34k lines were written befor e MUC-6 . It contains an interpreter for LISP-like expressions so that all the knowledge structures, such a s finite automata for finding sentence boundaries, the lexicon, the lexical rules, the grammar network, an d extraction rules, are written in LISP-like expressions ."]},{"title":"Performance in MUC- 6","paragraphs":["Considering the very limited time and human resources with which the PIE system was developed, it di d very well in all of the four evaluation tasks, especially in coreference recognition .

In Government-Binding theory [3], the c-command relationship is defined as follows : a node a c-commands another node /3 if (a) a does not dominate /3 and (b) the parent of a dominates O .

The TE and ST modules are trained on less than 25 of the 100 formal training articles, though they are tested with the complete set durin g development .","The greatest limiting factor in the development of PIE is the amount of time and human resources available to examine training articles to create domain specific vocabulary and dependency patterns, and to inspect the differences between the answer keys and the system responses to fine-tune the system . 124 The development of PIE system started in July 1995, when MUC-6 was announced . The developmen t prior to August 27, 1995 was mostly on general tools that can also be used in non-MUC applications . We estimate that 30 person-days were spent on the following components/tasks . • A sentence boundary identifier . • A subtree pattern matcher which works on any tree structure (not just dependency trees) . • A sequentially constructed equivalence classes . • Interface classes to the WordNet .","• A SGML markup generator that takes a set of tuples (low, high, type, contents) and generates SGML markups surrounding the words with indices from low to high . The generator guarantees tha t overlapping markups are nested . • Additional lexical rules for recognizing entity names . • Tuning up PRINCIPAR.","The development of MUC-specific components started on August 28 . Table 4 summarizes the process . The first training tests for the CO, TE and ST module were conducted as soon as the system was able t o process all the testing articles without crashing . The last training tests was conducted just before runnin g the formal test . The formal testing results for NE, CO and TE are quite close to the training test results . The F-measure for ST in formal testing is significantly lower than that of training tests because the recall dropped from about 50% to 39% . This was not totally unexpected, since the implementation of the S T module did not begin until September 29th . It did not reach a relatively stable state by the time of the formal testing on October 6th .","Person- First Training Test Last Training Test Formal Tes t","Category Days Date P&R Date P&R Date P&R NE 10 1-Sep 88 6-Oct 96 6-Oct 9 3 CO* 14 14-Sep (49,47) 6-Oct (65,58) 6-Oct (63,63 ) TE 6 25-Sep 67 6-Oct 78 6-Oct 7 4 ST 5 2-Oct 45 6-Oct 53 6-Oct 48","*The first number is precision, the second is recal l Table 4 : Summary of the MUC-6 development process"]},{"title":"Conclusion s","paragraphs":["We feel that we have achieved the following objectives in MUC-6 . • We developed and tested a domain independent algorithm for coreference recognition that turned ou t","to work quite well . • We showed that broad-coverage and efficiency can be achieved by principle-based parsing .","• We demonstrated that a broad-coverage parser can be very useful in information extraction .
