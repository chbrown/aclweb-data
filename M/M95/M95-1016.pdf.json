Such applications include extraction of bibliographic information, document indexing, competitiv e analyses based on open sources. technical information retrieval, foreign technology and politica l assessments, tracking financial and other resource transactions in the written media, and various types of link analyses based on text correlations .","Providing very accurate automated data-extraction capability for this type of application is th e objective of the DX project . Relative to the broad language understanding goals of many projects, thi s effort is clearly a niche one, but perhaps all the more ambitious in its accuracy goals for that reason .

In May, 1995, the first version of the language, DXL (for \"Data eXtraction In our view, data-classes comprise IDs and \"quantifications\".

The underlying text-processing syste m was adapted from an ongoing SAIC-Navy project to convert legacy technical manuals into a particula r data-base form suitable for interactive electronic use on a portable computer . 2 Numerous modifications have been made to this system including a new data-base access capability developed in September fo r rapid access to many millions of words and facts . The fact contents of the data-base (called the knowledge-bank), such as names of places, persons, and organizations, were acquired only in the last fe w months and entered using a coding scheme which represents their many syntactic and semantic features. Also recent is the accumulation of the large number of critical (for our approach) \"signal-words\" whic h mark the presence of certain data-classes -- for example, \"Mr .\", \"Ave .\", and \"Corp.\" suggest the nearby occurrence of person-names, street-names, and organization-names, respectively . Similarly, the needed linguistic infrastructure has also only recently been developed : the compilation from several sources of a large lexicon with parts-of-speech, the development of the capability to find the \"roots\" of words prior t o lexical look-up (e.g ., the root of \"placing\" is \"place\"), and the morphological analysis capability to permi t guessing at the part-of-speech of unknown words based on their suffixes .","The life-cycle of the DX project is thus independent of the MUC, which has been a very useful, i f not the best-timed, experience."]},{"title":"SYSTEM DESCRIPTIO N","paragraphs":["In this section we summarize the elements of our design objectives and provide extensive detail s of the general system implementation. Design Approac h","Two sets of considerations determined our selected approach to the data-extraction problem : our set of performance objectives, and the results of our analyses of data-classes . Concerning performance, we wanted a system that would most of all be highly accurate -- less than 5% misses and false alarms -- ye t robust in the sense of failing seldom, failing soft, and restoring easily. We also wanted a system that was easily extendible, serviceable by programmers, supportive of informed guessing (but giving confidenc e and basis), and eventually capable of learning extensions . Extremely rapid processing is not a requirement, in the belief that achieving the quality goals first could be followed subsequent speed-u p enhancements (e .g ., parallelization) .","Our analysis of a wide variety of data-classes indicates that the majority of classes, and of instances, do not require sentence-level linguistic information for their detection and identification . That is, it appears that having a good sentence parse would only infrequently be of value in determining the data-classes embedded in the sentences . The needed information seems to be primarily available withi n the data-class phrase itself, in the form of obligatory and optional elements . For the majority of \" difficult\" cases, it would appear that the semantic features of local adjacent contexts plus some global context (e.g. , the type of document) could resolve the identifications .","These considerations motivated the three-stage strategy we adopted for the DX project . The first is unabashedly a brute-force method and is to identify by look-up : for those data-classes like person-This conversion activity is part of the Navy program to develop the support technologies for producing and using Interactive Electroni c Technical Manuals (IETM) for new and existing systems, as governed by the MIL-M-87268 standard. In turn, DXL is now being used as the specification language for recognizing various components of existing Navy tech manuals in the SAIC IETM project. 194 names and organizations that are amenable to this app ; oach, get as many instances as possible and enter in the knowledge-bank and then check for them in any new input . Secondly, identify by pattern, using a language specially developed to have all the functionality useful for this approach, especially very powerful pattern-matching capability coupled with the facility of placing arbitrary constraints on th e patterns or local contexts. The final step is to identify using semantics-based contextual reasoning, wherein potential remaining data-class targets are fuzzily classified as one of several related data-classe s (e .g ., proper names) on the basis of suggestive cues (e .g., capitalization) . Then, reasoning heuristics (e .g. , \"names of people often have appositives whose heads or modifiers are marked semantically as bein g characteristic of people\") are used to direct the search for discriminating contextual clues .","This three-fold approach can be argued as meeting most of the performance goals and certainl y fits the finding of data-classes being pattern-based. However, it is an empirical question whether the desired accuracy levels -- particularly <5% misses -- can truly be achieved without at least a reasonabl e identification of the case-roles of the surface constituents . For this reason, an additional design requirement for the new pattern language was that it would have the capability to represent very powerfu l sentence-level parsing grammars (e .g., context-sensitive rules, unrestricted look-ahead, eas y representation of discontinuous constituents)."]},{"title":"Implementation Features System-level Overview.","paragraphs":["A much-simplified view of the DX system is given in Figure 1 . The first step is to convert the character-stream input into a stream of \"tokens\", essentially words, based primarily on the presence o f blanks between character-strings . Upon identification, each token is annotated with a set of \"prime\" attribute-values including : the most important attribute \"type\" (\"word\", \"num\", \"sgml\", \"punc\", or \"mix\"), start/stop character positions, \"chars\" (the token's character string), capitalization (\"capital\" , \"upper\", \"lower\", or \"mixed\"), and token number . The value of the \"chars\" attribute is that string which has all beginning brackets (or parentheses or braces) removed as well as all ending brackets an d punctuation of all kinds ; appropriate attributes are set to indicate what was removed . In addition, the singular possessive marking \" s̀ \" is also removed and a possessive attribute set. In this way, the toke n \"chars\" value can be looked up in the knowledge-bank without worrying about punctuation of any kind .","All of the subsequent system processing is accomplished with specific pattern-rules and involve s moving up and down the token stream, checking tokens for particular attribute values, and, whe n successful, either changing the attribute-values of single tokens or replacing several tokens with a new one (with a new \"type\" attribute, whose \"chars\" attribute is the concatenation of those replaced) . For any particular rule, the whole document is searched from the first token to the last .","The second major processing step is to check the knowledge-bank to see whether the \"chars\" value of tokens are known as an instance of a data-class of interest (e .g., known locations o r organizations) . If so, the tokens corresponding to the known data-class entry are replaced with a single token whose \"type\" is set to the name of the data-class . In addition, new attributes are added, includin g part-of-speech, the word-stem, number (singular or plural) . Token \"chars\" not recognized as data-classe s are analyzed morphologically to determine their part-of-speech, word-stem, and number .","In the third step, the major data-class recognition rules are applied . The knowledge-bank is again a major source of information but this time primarily for \"signal-words\" which usually preface o r terminate data-class patterns . For example, a number of organizations fit the canonical form of a \"prefix organizational title\" followed by \"of' or \"for\" followed by a location or unknown capitalized words (e .g. \"Bank of New York\") .

A token whose \" chars\" value is \"bank\" will not have these attribute-values alread y associated with it. Rather, only when some rule asks whether the token has the attribute values associated with an organizational title will the knowledge-bank be checked for these . As a result of checking for such attributes, the values returned will be set on the token . This process of adding values to a token onl y when a rule has inquired of the attributes is known as \"lazy annotation\" and is much more economica l than attaching all possible attribute-values slavishly to all known knowledge-bank entries .","An example of these processing steps is given in Figure 2 for the input \"Dr .

For a person-name recognition rule such as is shown in Figure 3 below, the likely result would be the replacement of the firs t three tokens (\"dr\", \"Joyce\", and \"smith\") with a new single token of type \"person\", with start/stop value s reflecting the span of coverage in the input, and with a new attribute giving the name of the rule that was successfully applied (\"cap-person\") . Outputs include both a tagging of the target in the input and th e inclusion of the target characters in a list of other such person targets ."]},{"title":"The Data-Extraction Language, DXL","paragraphs":["Five of the major features of DXL are : (1) extremely flexible pattern specification, (2 ) unrestricted rewrite capability, (3) the capability to put constraints on pattern elements or to invoke globa l constraints, (4) the capability to invoke, anywhere, the full power of the Scheme programming language , and (5) the ability to expand complex \"chars\" strings .","The first feature is illustrated by Figure 3, which shows a DXL rule for one of the PERSON canonical forms . DXL rules have three components : a left-hand-side (LHS) specifying the total pattern that is to be matched, a right-pointing arrow indicating that the LHS is to be rewritten, and a right-hand - side (RHS) indicating what is to be substituted for the LHS, with what actions . In Figure 2, the LHS has four elements : an optional pattern followed by an obligatory one, followed by two optional patterns . This rule would match instances such as \"Dr . Harry Morgan Raffler, Jr ., Vice President\" and \"Frank\". \" The meaning of the prefix symbols is given in the following table : * An optional operator, zero or more occurrences, match the minimu m ? An optional operator, zero or one occurrence, match the minimu m + Obligatory element, at least one, possibly more","When placed after the above, forces a match of the maximum number of specified pattern s","Indicates a defined pattern","The LHS therefore involves four defined patterns : 0 or more prefix titles for people (such as \"Prof.\"), at least one capitalized word (with no comma following it), an optional family title such as \"Jr .\" , and an optional suffix title, such as \"Director \" . Two of the four BNF pattern definitions are given at the bottom of the Figure . That for title_pref, for example, specifies that the \"chars \" value should have an initial capitalized letter, that the type of the title ought to be \"pref' (for prefix), and that the value of cl , the second hierarchical knowledge classification value (c0 is the first), should be \"person\" . 3 This would not actually be a good way of approaching recognition of person-name instances, but it does illustrate what additiona l attributes would be added as a result of consulting the knowledge-bank.

Single tokens bound to vl and v3 are modified by attribute-changing actions, and al l the bound tokens are finally reinserted back where they were in the token stream .","The second, rewrite, feature of DXL is illustrated by the abstract rule below, which, for clarity' s sake, omits the needed variable-assignments : \\ A \\ B [X] C D (Y) /E/ _> C F B This rule specifies a left-context of A after which three obligatory patterns are sought, B-D, where B has some additional condition X placed on it .

The fifth feature, expansion is very useful when the \"chars\" attribute is a mixture of letters/numbers/symbols . Expansion permits the components of a complex \"chars\" string to be broken apart and analyzed using the same rule formalisms employed for multiple tokens . For example, the following rule expands all tokens of \"type\" \"mix\" : type:\"mix\" ->vi => (expand vl ) The result of expanding a token whose \"chars\" are \"451bs ./sq.in .\", is to replace this token in the token stream with the following ones : .sot 45 tbs . / sq. in. .eo t The first and last tokens have special type values, \"start of (expanded) token\" and \"end of (expanded ) token\", but they have no start or stop attributes, being \"dimensionless\" with respect to characters .

The high frequency presence of appositives with person-names provide one powerful source of semanti c context resolution."]},{"title":"Things That Worked Wel l","paragraphs":["The knowledge-classification feature hierarchy works termendously well in supportin g identification and discrimination of data-classes (e .g ., people having the main branches of HUMENT-PERSON, while cities have the main branches of PLACE-CENTER-CITY, and signal words associate d with time references have the branches of MEAS-TIME-DATE-HOUR) .
