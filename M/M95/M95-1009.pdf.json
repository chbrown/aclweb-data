Box 804 8 Philadelphia Pa . 1910 1 BACKGROUN D","paragraphs":["During the 1980s, General Electric Corporate Research and Development began the desig n and implementation of a set of text-processing tools known as the NLToolset . This suite of tool s developed, over time, in cooperation with a subgroup of the Management and Data Systems Operations component of General Electric Aerospace . Through corporate mergers, this subgrou p has become the Language Exploitation Technologies group of the Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems division . Over the years, the toolset has evolved into a robust set of aids for tex t analysis . It has been used to build a variety of applications, and the knowledge gained from eac h application has been utilized to improve the toolset . The LOUELLA PARSING system was de - signed with the latest version of the NLToolset .","The Lockheed Martin group's LOUELLA PARSING system participated in three of the fou r MUC-6 evaluations : 1) The evaluation of systems that mark named entities (NE) in a text . In particular, systems were required to mark locations, dates, times, organizations, people, and currency phrases in a text . 2) The evaluation of systems that extract template elements (TE) corresponding to people an d organizations from the text . These templates can be thought of as index cards containing in - formation about people and organizations mentioned in a text . 3) The evaluation of systems that extract information about corporate management succession s from a text . This task is called the \"scenario template\" (ST), and requires a deeper anlysis of th e text than the other tasks .","This paper will give an overview of our systems, describe our performance on each of the task s and the walkthrough article, and discuss areas where our systems need to be improved .","LOUELLA's NE system was developed using the \"spotters\" from the NLToolset . The TE and ST systems were developed using a range of tools for reference resolution, for information extraction , for simple discourse processing, and for template generation, as well as a variety of spotters for spotting entities . Below we describe the processing stages that are used in LOUELLA's NE, TE an d ST systems . The first three stages are used in the NE task ."]},{"title":"PROCESSING STAGE S","paragraphs":["The NLToolset contains a core knowledge base, a large sense-disambiguated lexicon, and a variety of text-processing tools for extracting information, organizing information, and generating output . Typically, these tools are sequentially applied to text . 97"]},{"title":"Text Tokenization and Segmentatio n","paragraphs":["LOUELLA uses sequential processing which simplifies the text with each phase . The first text-processing module used is NLlex, a lexical-analyzer-development package which handles the character string to word translation and tokenizes the text. Next, the text segmenter interprets the SGML markers and common punctuation, and stores the text in a structure that holds the origina l version of the text as a whole ; it also stores each section of the text, such as paragraph, sentence , headline, dateline, etc . Throughout processing, the structure holds an original and a \"latest \" version of each sentence ; the \"latest\" version is updated with each processing phase ."]},{"title":"Lexical Look-u p","paragraphs":["At this point, the text is stored in tokenized form, and any unambiguous names and phrase s that are stored in the lexicon are identified . Named entities, such as organizations and people, ar e stored on an active token list to allow the system to link occurrences of the same entity, based o n name variations . Next, each word is analyzed morphologically and tagged with its possible parts o f speech, which are found in the lexicon . The following is an example of the first check against th e lexicon . Here the phrasal \"less than\" and the company \"Coke\" are identified and marked as multitokens (MT) : \"I would be [MT{LESS-THAN} : less than ] honest to say I'm not disappointed not to be able to clai m creative leadership for [MT{COCA-COLA} : Coke],\" Mr. Dooner says ."]},{"title":"Text Reduction","paragraphs":["LOUELLA uses a non-deterministic, lexico-semantic, finite-state pattern matcher . By thi s definition, we refer to the pattern matcher as a finite-state machine which matches against bot h syntactic and semantic features of text . The pattern matcher uses a knowledge base of pattern - action rules, grouped in rule packages . These rule packages are applied to the text in successiv e passes to mark primitive text elements such as time, money, locations, person, and compan y names. These marked phrases are then reduced into single tokens .","LOUELLA uses eight rule-packages to reduce elements ranging from the most primitive tim e expressions and organization noun phrases to the more complex IN_AND_OUT objects . Thi s phase of text processing extends from the Named Entity system through to the Template Element , and includes the Scenario Template phase . Here are several examples : Matches : (TIME-RULE-0 TIME-RULE-36 TIME-RULE-38 ) [TIME-ABSOLUTE{36} : Yesterday ], McCann made official what had been widely anticipated : Mr. James, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on [DATE{4} : July 1 ] and will retire as chairman [TIME-RELATIVE{38} : at the end of the year ] .

As soon as a named entity is recognized, it is stored—along with its variations—on an active token list so that variations of the nam e can be recognized and linked to the original occurrence . When organization names are recognized, they can often be directly linked to their appositives or prenominal phrases . In addition , noun-phrase recognition prompts a backward search through a stack of named entities in orde r to identify its referent. This search uses several tactics to find the correct referent . If the noun-phrase is semantically rich, a content filter is constructed and compared against content filters for known, named entities . If this is not successful, various heuristics are used based on entity typ e and position in text ."]},{"title":"Information Extraction","paragraphs":["LOUELLA uses the same pattern matcher for information extraction that it uses for text reduc - tion ; however, there is a difference in the way the pattern matcher is used . While extracting, the pattern matcher is allowed to overlap patterns because it is not changing the text found ; it is merely extracting information of interest and sending it to the text organizer. The text organize r tries to assemble the extracted information into a lucid account of events . It performs this assem - bly by using a model of the domain as delineated in the task specification . For example, it is per-missible to have more than one IN_AND_OUT object participating in a SUCCESSION_EVENT, bu t there must be one SUCCESSION_ORG involved ."]},{"title":"Postprocessing","paragraphs":["Postprocessing is the final review of the extracted information before the templates are gener - ated .

The script also contains pointers to the functions which print each slot fill ."]},{"title":"SYSTEM MODULE S","paragraphs":["For MUC-6, LOUELLA is comprised of three system modules, one for each of the MUC-6 tasks addressed : Named Entity (NE), Template Element (TE), and Scenario Template (ST) . Below, we give a brief description of each of these systems ."]},{"title":"The NE System","paragraphs":["LOUELLA's Named Entity system is a multi-pass process which builds upon entities whic h are found in previous passes . In addition to the segmentation and lexical look-up stages of ou r system, early passes of the reduction phase identify time, date, money, and percent components . The system then searches for locations, knowing that the entities found previously will not be par t of the location phrase . The person and company-name passes also use the previous informatio n to identify contexts which indicate the presence of a company name, such as : \"ABC stock ros e *percentage*\" . The NE system generates all possible variations for each person and compan y name it finds ; another pass tries to find these variations . 99","LOUELLA's NE system uses a variety of matching methods . Entities such as dates are found by combining structure format with a list of valid items, i .e . a valid month followed by a number . Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON\">James</ENAMEX>, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executiv e officer on <TIMEX TYPE=\"DATE\">July 1</TIMEX> and will retire as chairman at the end of the year. In cases where none of the entity parts are in a list of known things, we use surrounding con -","text to identify the name . One of the many differences between <ENAMEX TYPE=\"PERSON\">Robert L. James</ENAMEX>,","chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE=\"ORGANIZATION\">McCann-Erick-","son</ENAMEX>","In the above example, LOUELLA does not know what McCann-Erickson is, however, she does","know that people are \"chairman and chief executive officer of' an organization . Other widely","known companies such as \"Coca-Cola\" are identified through a list of known organizations . This","list also helps identify \"Coke\" as referring to the \"Coca-Cola\" company .","LOUELLA's NE system makes a basic assumption that any organizations that appear in th e headline are the same as, or variations of, the organizations found in the text . Therefore, the sys - tem does not examine the headline for organizations until it processes the body of the text . In th e previous example, the reference to \"McCann-Erickson\" in the headline of the walkthrough text i s found only after the body of the text is processed during the variation matching phase .","Each variation of a person or organization found is linked to the original name . This link i s used in the TE system to identify aliases found in the text for that entity . Only people and named companies found by the NE system will be processed by the TE system .","One additional NE system feature used by the TE system is a \"company rename function .\" If an organization changed—or plans to change—its name, the old or future name is linked to th e current name, and the system symbol for the current name is used by all references to eithe r name . The TE system then uses the current name to find all references to the current and old o r future names . The TE Syste m","The TE system builds an object for each organization and person name that contains all of th e related information it can find in the article .","An organization object consists of : 1) the organization's name 2) all aliases for that name found in the text 3) one descriptor phrase , 4) the organization type , 5) the organization's locale an d 6) country. A person object consists of : 1) the person's nam e 2) any aliases for that name in the article, an d 3) any titles for that individual which appear in the text . Much of the information related to the entity name is found during the initial phases of the NE","module in the context surrounding the entity name . Appositives, for example, are often good","descriptor phrases . The system also links other descriptive phrases and pronouns to the named","entity, and these additional descriptions are used to assist the ST system in its information-ex-","traction task . Later, these links will allow for the replacing of noun phrases with, for example ,","normalized organization template elements .","Once an organization noun-phrase or personal pronoun is identified, the reference resolutio n module seeks to find its referent . For persons, LOUELLA uses the simple heuristic of assigning th e 100 last person mentioned as the referent, keeping in mind gender constraints . For organizations, th e process involves several steps. First, the phrase is checked to make sure it hasn't already been recognized and linked by the NE system . If no match is recognized, a content filter for the phrase i s run against a content filtered version of each known organization name ; if there is a match, the link is made .","Content Filters :","\"the jewelry chain\" => ( jewelry jewel chain )","\"Smith Jewelers\" => ( smith jewelers jeweler jewel )","For example, if the organization noun phrase \"the jewelry chain\" is identified, its content filte r would be applied to the list of known company names . When it reaches \"Smith Jewelers,\" it wil l compare the filter against a filtered version of the name . The best match is considered the referent . If there is a tie, file position is considered as a factor, and the closest name is the most likely refer - ent . For generic phrases like \"the company,\" reference is currently determined solely by file position and type .","When a descriptor is linked to an organization name, the syntactic relationship of the descrip - tor to the organization name is also stored with the phrase . For example, appositives and prenom - inal phrases recognized by the NE system are tagged with \" :APP\" and \" :PRENOM\", respectively . Likewise, references resolved by the reference resolution module are appropriately tagged . Th e template generator uses a heuristic to choose the descriptor which is most likely correct . Th e choice is based on a hierarchy which begins with appositives, prenominals, and predicate nominatives, and ends with references resolved by the reference resolution module .","Once an organization or person has been linked to all its variations in the article, the TE sys - tem chooses the best name for the element and relegates the rest of the names to the alias catego - ry . Assigning the same symbol name to each instance of a template element greatly simplifies th e work of the subsequent ST system . The ST Syste m","The ST system extracts information about complex events that involve template elements lik e organizations and people . LOUELLA's scenario is about changes in corporate management .","The top-level template of interest is the SUCCESSION_EVENT, which is comprised of: SUCCESSION_ORG : \\t an organization template element , POST: \\t a string fill , IN_AND_OUT: \\t a relational object about each person involve d (may be more than one) , VACANCY REASON : \\t a set fill .","LOUELLA's strategy is to repeatedly simplify the text before information extraction take s place . This approach allows the most basic elements of the scenario to be identified first. The TE system identifies the primitive template elements (person and organization) involved in a particu - lar scenario . In addition, NE-style methods are applied, at this point, to recognize and tag management-position titles within the text .","The next level of complexity is to find the relational object, IN_AND_OUT. This object is filled by: a pointer to a person template element, the IO_PERSON ; a set-fill indicating whether the per - son is in or out, the NEW_STATUS ; a set fill indicating whether the person is currently on the job , the ON THE JOB ; a pointer to an organization template element representing another corporat e entity involved in the change, the OTHER_ORG, (if known) ; and a set-fill indicating the relation - ship of the other organization, the REL_OTHER_ORG .","It makes sense to first convert all person template elements into potential IN_AND_OUT objects . In most cases, the sentence clues which will tell the system whether a person is in or out of a position and whether the person is still on the job are also the clues for the succession event itself . 10 1 It is preferable, then, to instantiate an empty IN_AND_OUT object around each person element , and then to fill in the rest of the information if an event is extracted .","LOUELLA's ST application consists of three rule packages : ingress .k, which holds all rules for entering corporate posts ; egress .k, which holds all rules for leaving corporate posts ; and activations .k, which holds all macros for the ingress and egress rule packages .","The Lockheed Martin approach to information extraction is to build sets of floating phrases , i .e . rules, which can glide over each sentence, binding to the right configuration of information . This information is then extracted and reorganized into a lucid account of the events . This approach is similar to the model-based segmentation method used in image-understanding systems . Portions of images are recognized easily, and their configuration is ultimately used to iden - tify the complete image .","By examining a training set of articles for the sentences which report the events of interest , rules are developed . As training progresses, the rules are generalized to cover more and more pos - sible constructs . A typical ingress rule, made up of macros, might look something like this : $subjphr $conjphr ?IN=$appointvb { $postorg } => c-reassigning-templat e The binding macros are $subjphr, $appointvb, and an optional $postorg. $conjphr is a buffer macro allowing the pattern matcher to skip over irrelevant material . This rule contains a variable ?I N which is bound when the rule is matched . This binding is then conveyed to the IN_AND_OUT object as its NEW_STATUS . Other variables are also present within the macro definitions . Thes e variables, when bound, will convey information about VACANCY_REASON, ON THE JOB, an d the OTHER_ORG to the objects involved in the event. For example, if the ?ACTING, ?IN, and ?FU-TURE variables are all bound in a match, then the IN_AND_OUT's NEW_STATUS is IN an d ON THE JOB is NO, because the text is reporting that the person will be acting in a position .","A difficulty occurs with this method when a sentence identifies a person as leaving one position and entering another. For example, \"Judy Jones, president of Exxon, has been hired as CE O of GE .\" In this case, the person element will have two different NEW_STATUS values, dependin g on the position being discussed . When this happens, the person element must be re-instantiate d as an additional IN_AND_OUT object in order to collect the correct value .","Once an article's information has been extracted, it is then organized into a sensible accoun t based on a model of the domain . This model, along with the final template model (which guides th e system's template generator), is constructed at the beginning of training . Both models are base d on the scenario specifications .","In the postprocessing stage, we apply any heuristics learned during the course of system development. For this application, the OTHER_ORG portion of the IN_AND_OUT object was filled-in here, based on the information gathered about that person . For example, if at this point LOUELLA knows that a person is leaving one organization and joining another, she can conclud e that each organization can be the OTHER_ORG in the IN_AND_OUT object for the other organization's SUCCESSION_EVENT; in effect, the system swaps SUCCESSION_ORGs between succession events to supply their respective IN_AND_OUT objects with OTHER_ORG fillers ."]},{"title":"WALKTHROUGH PERFORMANC E Scenario Template","paragraphs":["WARNING : this message does not represent LOUELLA's typical performance .

First ,","our method of generalizing had not reached fruition by the time of the evaluation . This message","was improved by expanding the definition for one of the floating phrases, i .e . macros, which make","up all ingress and egress patterns, and by inserting a buffer phrase into one of the egress patterns .","Adding a buffer phrase allows the pattern matcher to jump over part of the conjunctive phrase in the following sentence :","James, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and will retire as chairman a t","the end of the year . The following sections show the extraction process taking place . The italicized words represen t the rule which is being matched and the variables which are being bound . The buffer additio n allows two rules to overlap the sentence, extracting both succession events .","EVALUATION EXTRACTION: [C-REASSIGNING-TEMPLATE{0} ?IN AND OUT=James, 57 years old, is ?OUT=< ?UN-CLEAR=?VACANCY REASON=stepping ?HEAD=down >=?OUT as ?POST=chief executive officer {OJ] on July 1 and will retire as chairman at the end of the year.","POST-EVALUATION - WITH BUFFER ADDITION : [C-REASSIGNING-TEMPLATE{1,0} ?IN AND OUT=James, 57 years old, is ?OUT=< ?UN-CLEAR=?VACANCY REASON=stepping ?HEAD=down >=?OUT as ?POST=chief executive officer {0}] on July 1 and ?FUTURE=will ?VACANCY REASON=?OUT=?HEAD=refire as ?POST-chairman {0}] at the end of the year.","The secondary factors that hurt LOUELLA's performance were unsatisfactory post-processin g decisions . During development, generic patterns were instantiated to extract organization s which would likely be involved in a succession event . These companies are usually in the act of announcing some event. Then, if succession events are extracted without an organization bein g directly involved in the event statement, the announcing organization can be tied to the organiza - tion-less events . This heuristic worked well ; however, no allowance had been made for the case in which a SUCCESSION_ EVENT was extracted in the absence of any SUCCESSION_ORG . This was remedied, post-evaluation, by allowing the system to collect all organizations, and to choose a n organization during postprocessing to act as a default SUCCESSION_ORG for all organization - less events . Even though post-processing chose the wrong organization for the walk-throug h message, it still got two extra points for having an organization .","The most striking effect of a deficient post-processing heuristic was the decision to eliminat e any succession events which contained only an IN_AND_OUT object, with no other information . 103 Removal of this heuristic alone, with no other pattern modifications, increased the recall on the walk-through message from 15R/80P to 44R/61P! This is due to the fact that LOUELLA was no w producing four succession events, instead of one, each with its own IN_AND_OUT object . This increased the number of correct slots from 8 to 23, even though the additional succession event s had no post and no succession organization .","Changes in post-processing, while prompted by performance on the walk-through message , affect system performance as a whole . Consequently, the entire evaluation set was rerun with th e changes made to improve the walk-through message . Performance increased from 43R/64P wit h a 51 .63 F-measure to 49R/60P with a 54 .04 F-measure .","Of course, the best performance occurs when LOUELLA recognizes all of the organization s present . When improvements were made to the Named Entity task for the walk-through message , the Scenario Template task scores were improved to 65R/56P on that message, for an F-measur e of 60 .1 .
