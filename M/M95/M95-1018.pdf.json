For the Named Entity task, SRA adapted a subset of NameTag ' s capabilities to the MUC–6 specification . For the Template Element task, SRA fed the full results of NameTag into HASTEN, which performed additional processing to extract and generate the organization and person templates . For the Scenario Template task, SRA fed NameTag's results into HASTEN, which used its full extraction capabilities t o extract and generate the management succession templates . Figure 1 illustrates the contribution of each system to the MUC–6 tasks .

Many systems, including ones from BBN, SRI, Lockheed Martin, University o f Massachusetts, and New Mexico State University, have made significant contributions in these areas . SRA has als o investigated these issues, and has renewed its effort with the development of HASTEN . The long-term objective of HASTEN is to provide a system that non-developers can easily customize to extract information from text . The target operating environment might consist of 50 users trying to use HASTEN on 50 different extraction scenarios . Therefore, HASTEN must be simple, flexible, robust, and trainable, and must minimize the customization effort . These requirements motivate HASTEN ' s vision of extraction, which is to use the simplest input from users : extraction examples. As illustrated in Figure 2, the user annotates examples of what to extract, labelling the important region s of text with their relationship (e .g . the successee) to the expressed concept (e .g . management succession) . <p> \\t Now, Mr .

HASTEN computes the similarity between an annotate d example and the subsequent text, and uses that computation to decide how to analyze it . As more examples are encoded, HASTEN's coverage and accuracy improve .","The HASTEN system has a simple architecture, consisting of four main modules shown in Figure 3 . Th e Analyzer extracts semantic information from the text, using a set of extraction examples and a supporting knowledg e base . The Reference Resolver supports the Analyzer by providing links from references to their referents . Concep t specifications define what concepts to extract, in what order, what semantic roles to fill, and determine how th e extraction examples are encoded . The Collector collects and merges the semantic information according to concep t specifications . The Generator uses an output script to convert the collected semantic information into an arbitrary output format, such as a database template . In addition to these core modules, HASTEN includes a tokenizer, a document structure facility, a lexical data facility, and an object-oriented (template) scoring program .","Figure 3 : HASTEN System Architecture","Each Collector concept represents a processing phase for the Analyzer. For each Collector concept, the Analyzer processes the text and creates a link from the text to the semantic representations, similar to the reference links created by the Reference Resolver. Each analysis phase can access the results of previous phases, thus enablin g complex embedded semantic representations to be created . For the MUC-6 Scenario Template task, the Analyzer first extracted person concepts, then organization concepts, then management post concepts, then succession events ."]},{"title":"Extraction by Example","paragraphs":["The key module of HASTEN is the Analyzer, which matches the extraction examples to incoming text an d decides what to extract .

Thus, a high threshold will result in less extracted semantics than a low threshold .

The major characteristic s of this representation are that it is straight forward to create, conducive to automated learning, easy to compare to each other, and easy to match against text . An Egraph contains three components: an extracted concept, structural elements attached to the original regions of text, and semantic labels attached to the structural elements, as illustrated in Figure 5 . In order to use the Egraph for matching other text, the structural element must be generalized into word classes , grammatical constituents, or arbitrarily—defined word sequences . This generalization is represented as a structura l class and a set of constraints . The actual definition of the structural class is maintained in the auxiliary knowledge base .

HASTEN first matches the structural elements, and binds the semantic labels of those elements that successfully matched . The metric computes the percent of the Egraph that matched, using a weighted sum of factors . The factors represent how well the elements match, how well they are ordered, how well the adjacent elements are joined, and how much semanti c content was bound .

After the training module has run, the results can be probed to construct an extraction bias, which consists of a number from 0 to 1 .0 for each Egraph . The similarity value is multiplied by this number to adjust the result . A bias of 0 effectively disables the Egraph, a bias of 1 .0 leaves the original value unchanged, and a bias in between reduces the value . The simplest bias is one that disables some of the Egraphs, and leaves the other Egraphs unchanged . This bias is useful since it can eliminate the Egraphs that predominately over-generate .

Currently, there are three mutation methods :","• cross-over - replace some structural elements of one Egraph with elements from another ;","• trim - eliminate structural elements from the ends of the Egraph ;","• merge - combine the structural elements of multiple Egraphs ; The mutation module compares every Egraph with each other, and for each pair of significantly similar Egraphs , applies the three methods .

HASTEN demonstrated a simple , flexible design using simple training examples with minimal customization for the Scenario Template task . Experimental results demonstrated the speed of customization, the relationship between the number of examples an d performance, the predicted potential performance, and performance on just the core scenario event.","In the near future, NameTag will continue to improve its coverage, accuracy, and speed. In addition, NameTag will provide foreign language versions, including French, Italian, Spanish, German and Japanese . SRA will strive to make HASTEN easier to customize by non-developers, while enhancing its features to improve its extractio n performance . Potential areas of experimentation are automatic Egraph construction, the utilization of negativ e examples, the utilization of mutated Egraphs, and user-in-the-loop feedback. HASTEN's modular design will also facilitate the integration of other supporting software modules such as syntactic parsers and discourse modules ."]},{"title":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS","paragraphs":["Kevin Hausman implemented all of the C++ code for the NameTag'engine .
