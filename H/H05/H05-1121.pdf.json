Although a user’s manual judgment of those documents would much help to select good expansion terms, it is difficult to get enough feedback from users in practical situations. In this paper we propose a query expansion technique which performs well even if a user notifies just a relevant document and a non-relevant document. In order to tackle this specific condition, we introduce two refinements to a well-known query expansion technique. One is application of a transductive learning technique in order to increase relevant documents. The other is a modified parameter estimation method which laps the predictions by multiple learning trials and try to differentiate the importance of candidate terms for expansion in relevant documents. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms some traditional query expansion methods in several evaluation measures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Query expansion is a simple but very useful technique to improve search performance by adding some terms to an initial query. While many query expansion techniques have been proposed so far, a standard method of performing is to use relevance information from a user (Ruthven, 2003). If we can use more relevant documents in query expansion, the likelihood of selecting query terms achiev-ing high search improvement increases. However it is impractical to expect enough relevance information. Some researchers said that a user usually notifies few relevance feedback or nothing (Dumais and et al., 2003).","In this paper we investigate the potential performance of query expansion under the condition that we can utilize little relevance information, especially we only know a relevant document and a non-relevant document. To overcome the lack of relevance information, we tentatively increase the number of relevant documents by a machine learning technique called Transductive Learning. Compared with ordinal inductive learning approach, this learning technique works even if there is few training examples. In our case, we can use many documents in a hit-list, however we know the relevancy of few documents. When applying query expansion, we use those increased documents as if they were true relevant ones. When applying the learning, there occurs some difficult problems of parameter settings. We also try to provide a reasonable resolution for the problems and show the effectiveness of our proposed method in experiments.","The point of our query expansion method is that we focus on the availability of relevance information in practical situations. There are several researches which deal with this problem. Pseudo relevance feedback which assumes top n documents as relevant ones is one example. This method is simple and relatively effective if a search engine returns a hit-963 list which contains a certain number of relative documents in the upper part. However, unless this assumption holds, it usually gives a worse ranking than the initial search. Thus several researchers propose some specific procedure to make pseudo feedback be effective (Yu and et al, 2003; Lam-Adesina and Jones, 2001). In another way, Onoda (Onoda et al., 2004) tried to apply one-class SVM (Support Vector Machine) to relevance feedback. Their purpose is to improve search performance by using only non-relevant documents. Though their motivation is similar to ours in terms of applying a machine learning method to complement the lack of relevance information, the assumption is somewhat different. Our assumption is to utilizes manual but the minimum relevance judgment.","Transductive leaning has already been applied in the field of image retrieval (He and et al., 2004). In this research, they proposed a transductive method called the manifold-ranking algorithm and showed its effectiveness by comparing with active learning based Support Vector Machine. However, their setting of relevance judgment is not different from many other traditional researches. They fix the total number of images that are marked by a user to 20. As we have already claimed, this setting is not practical because most users feel that 20 is too much for judgment. We think none of research has not yet an-swered the question. For relevance judgment, most of the researches have adopted either of the following settings. One is the setting of “Enough relevant documents are available”, and the other is “No relevant document is available”. In contrast to them, we adopt the setting of “Only one relevant document is available”. Our aim is to achieve performance improvement with the minimum effort of judging relevancy of documents.","The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes two fundamental techniques for our query expansion method. Section 3 explains a technique to complement the smallness of manual relevance judgment. Section 4 introduces a whole procedure of our query expansion method step by step. Section 5 shows empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our method compared with two traditional query expansion methods. Section 6 investigates the experimental results more in detail. Finally, Section 7 summarizes our findings."]},{"title":"2 Basic Methods 2.1 Query Expansion","paragraphs":["So far, many query expansion techniques have been proposed. While some techniques focus on the domain specific search which prepares expansion terms in advance using some domain specific training documents (Flake and et al, 2002; Oyama and et al, 2001), most of techniques are based on relevance feedback which is given automatically or manually.","In this technique, expansion terms are selected from relevant documents by a scoring function. The Robertson’s wpq method (Ruthven, 2003) is often used as such a scoring function in many researches (Yu and et al, 2003; Lam-Adesina and Jones, 2001). We also use it as our basic scoring function. It calculates the score of each term by the following formula. wpqt = ( r t R − nt − rt N − R ) ∗log","rt/(R − rt)","(nt − rt)/(N − nt − R + rt)","(1) where rt is the number of seen relevant documents containing term t. nt is the number of documents containing t. R is the number of seen relevant documents for a query. N is the number of documents in the collection. The second term of this formula is called the Robertson/Spark Jones weight (Robertson, 1990) which is the core of the term weighting function in the Okapi system (Robertson, 1997).","This formula is originated in the following formula. wpqt = (pt − qt) log pt(1 − qt) qt(1 − pt) (2) where pt is the probability that a term t appears in relevant documents. qt is the probability that a term t appears in non-relevant documents. We can easily notice that it is very important how the two probability of pt and qt should be estimated. The first formula estimates pt with rt","R and qt with Nt−Rt","N−R . For the good estimation of pt and qt, plenty of relevant document is necessary. Although pseudo feedback which automatically assumes top n documents as relevant is one method and is often used, its performance heavily depends on the quality of an initial search. As we show later, pseudo feedback has limited performance.","We here consider a query expansion technique which uses manual feedback. It is no wonder 964 manual feedback shows excellent and stable performance if enough relevant documents are available, hence the challenge is how it keeps high performance with less amount of manual relevance judgment. In particular, we restrict the manual judgment to the minimum amount, namely only a relevant document and a non-relevant document. In this assumption, the problem is how to find more relevant documents based on a relevant document and a non-relevant document. We use transductive learning technique which is suitable for the learning problem where there is small training examples. 2.2 Transductive Learning Transductive learning is a machine learning technique based on the transduction which directly derives the classification labels of test data without making any approximating function from training data (Vapnik, 1998). Because it does not need to make approximating function, it works well even if the number of training data is small.","The learning task is defined on a data set X of n points. X consists of training data set L = (⃗x1, ⃗x2, ..., ⃗xl) and test data set U = (⃗xl+1, ⃗xl+2, ..., ⃗xl+u); typically l ≪ u. The purpose of the learning is to assign a label to each data point in U under the condition that the label of each data point in L are given.","Recently, transductive learning or semisupervised learning is becoming an attractive subject in the machine learning field. Several algorithms have been proposed so far (Joachims, 1999; Zhu and et al., 2003; Blum and et al., 2004) and they show the advantage of this approach in various learning tasks. In order to apply transductive learning to our query expansion, we select an algorithm called “Spectral Graph Transducer (SGT)“ (Joachims, 2003), which is one of the state of the art and the best transductive learning algorithms. SGT formalizes the problem of assigning labels to U with an optimization problem of the constrained ratiocut. By solving the relaxed problem, it produces an approximation to the original solution.","When applying SGT to query expansion, X corresponds to a set of top n ranked documents in a hit-list. X does not corresponds to a whole document collection because the number of documents in a collection is too huge1","for any learning system to process. L corresponds to two documents with manual judgments, a relevant document and a non-relevant document. Furthermore, U corresponds to the documents of X ∩ L whose relevancy is unknown. SGT is used to produce the relevancy of documents in U . SGT actually assigns values around γ+ − θ for documents possibly be-ing relevant and γ− − θ for documents possibly be-ing non-relevant. γ+ = +√ 1−fp fp , γ− = −√ fp 1−fp , θ = 1","2 (γ+ + γ−), and fp is the fraction of relevant documents in X. We cannot know the true value of fp in advance, thus we have to estimate its approximation value before applying SGT.","According to Joachims, parameter k (the number of k-nearest points of a data ⃗x) and d (the number of eigen values to ...) give large influence to SGT’s learning performance. Of course those two parameters should be set carefully. However, besides them, fp is much more important for our task because it controls the learning performance. Since extremely small L (actually | L| = 2 is our setting) give no information to estimate the true value of fp, we do not strain to estimate its single approximation value but propose a new method to utilize the results of learning with some promising fp. We describe the method in the next section."]},{"title":"3 Parameter Estimations based on Multiple SGT Predictions 3.1 Sampling for Fraction of Positive Examples","paragraphs":["SGT prepares 2 estimation methods to set fp automatically. One is to estimate from the fraction of positive examples in training examples. This method is not suitable for our task because fp is always fixed to 0.5 by this method if the number of training examples changes despite the number of relevant documents is small in many practical situations. The other is to estimate with a heuristic that the difference between a setting of fp and the fraction of positive examples actually assigned by SGT should be as small as possible. The procedure provided by SGT starts from fp = 0.5 and the next fp is set to the fraction of documents assigned as relevant in the previous SGT trial. It repeats until fp changes 1 Normally it is more than ten thousand. 965 Input Ntr // the number of training examples Output S // a set of sampling points","piv = ln(Ntr); // sampling interval","nsp = 0; // the number of sampling points","for(i = piv; i ≤ Ntr − 1; i+ = piv){","add i to ;","nsp++;","if(nsp == 10){ exit; } } Figure 1: Pseudo code of sampling procedure for fp five times or the difference converges less than 0.01. This method is neither works well because the convergence is not guaranteed at all.","Presetting of fp is primarily very difficult problem and consequently we take another approach which laps the predictions of multiple SGT trials with some sampled fp instead of setting a single fp. This approach leads to represent a relevant document by not a binary value but a real value between 0 and 1. The sampling procedure for fp is illustrated in Figure 1. In this procedure, sampling interval changes according to the number of training examples. In our preliminary test, the number of sampling points should be around 10. However this number is adhoc one, thus we may need another value for another corpus. 3.2 Modified estimations for pt and qt Once we get a set of sampling points S = { f i","p : i = 1 ∼ 10} , we run SGT with each f i","p and laps each resultant of prediction to calculate pt and qt as follows. pt =","∑ i ri","t","∑ i Ri (3) qt =","∑ i nt − ri","t","∑ i N − Ri (4) Here, Ri is the number of documents which SGT predicts as relevant with ith value of f i","p, and ri","t is the number of documents in Ri where a term t appears. In each trial, SGT predicts the relevancy of documents by binary value of 1 (for relevant) and 0 (for non-relevant), yet by lapping multiple resultant of predictions, the binary prediction value changes to a real value which can represents the relevancy of documents in more detail. The main merit of this approach in comparison with fixing fp to a single value, it can differentiate a value of pt if Ntr is small."]},{"title":"4 Expansion Procedures","paragraphs":["We here explain a whole procedure of our query expansion method step by step.","1. Initial Search: A retrieval starts by inputting a query for a topic to an IR system.","2. Relevance Judgment for Documents in a Hit-List: The IR system returns a hit-list for the initial query. Then the hit-list is scanned to check whether each document is relevant or non-relevant in descending order of the ranking. In our assumption, this reviewing process terminates when a relevant document and a non-relevant one are found.","3. Finding more relevant documents by transductive learning: Because only two judged documents are too few to estimate pt and qt correctly, our query expansion tries to increase the number of relevant documents for the wpq formula using the SGT transductive learning algorithm. As shown in Figure2, SGT assigns a value of the possibility to be relevant for the topic to each document with no relevance judgment (documents under the dashed line in the Fig) based on two judged documents (documents above the dashed line in the Figure). 1. Document 1 2. Document 0 3. Document ? 4. Document ? : i. Document ? : Manually assigned Assigned by Transductive Learning Labels Hit list “1” means a positive label “0” means a negative label “?” means an unknown label Figure 2: A method to find tentative relevant documents 966","4. Selecting terms to expand the initial query: Our query expansion method calculates the score of each term appearing in relevant documents (including documents judged as relevant by SGT) using wpq formula, and then selects a certain number of expansion terms according to the ranking of the score. Selected terms are added to the initial query. Thus an expanded query consists of the initial terms and added terms.","5. The Next Search with an expanded query: The expanded query is inputted to the IR system and a new hit-list will be returned. One cycle of query expansion finishes at this step. In the above procedures, we naturally introduced transductive learning into query expansion as the effective way in order to automatically find some relevant documents. Thus we do not need to modify a basic query expansion procedure and can fully utilize the potential power of the basic query expansion. The computational cost of transductive learning is not so much. Actually transductive learning takes a few seconds to label 100 unlabeled documents and query expansion with all the labeled documents also takes a few seconds. Thus our system can expand queries sufficiently quick in practical applications."]},{"title":"5 Experiments","paragraphs":["This section provides empirical evidence on how our query expansion method can improve the performance of information retrieval.

Since our method is based on Okapi model, we represent it as Okapi sgt (with parameters k = 0.5 ∗ Ntr, d = 0.8 ∗ Ntr. k is the number of nearest neighbors, d is the number of eigen values to use and Ntr is the number of training examples).","Table 2-5 shows five evaluation measures of Okapi sgt when the number of expansion terms changes.

As for the number of training examples, performance of 20 and 50 does not differ so much in all the number of expansion terms. However performance of 100 is clearly worse than of 20 and 50. The number of expansion terms does not effect so much in every evaluation measures. In the following experiments, we compare the results of Okapi sgt when the number of training examples is 50 with other query expansion methods.","3","Topic numbers are 409, 410, 424, 425, 431, 432, 437 and 450 968 Table 6: Results of Manual Feedback Methods (MAP)","5 10 15 20 Okapi sgt 0.265 0.273 0.274 0.282 Okapi man 0.210 0.189 0.172 0.169 SMART man 0.209 0.222 0.220 0.219 Table 7: Results of Manual Feedback Methods (10 terms expanded)","P10 P30 RPREC MAP R05P Okapi sgt 0.520 0.387 0.294 0.273 0.208 Okapi man 0.420 0.285 0.212 0.189 0.132 SMART man 0.434 0.309 0.250 0.222 0.174","5.3 Comparison with other Manual Feedback Methods We next compare our query expansion method with the following manual feedback methods.","Okapi man : This method simply uses only one relevant document judged by hand.
