All are predicated on the concept of n-gram matching between the sentence hypothesized by the translation system and one or more reference translations—that is, human translations for the test sentence. Although the formulae underlying these metrics vary, each produces a single number representing the “goodness” of the MT system output over a set of reference documents. We can compare the numbers of competing systems to get a coarse estimate of their relative performance. However, this comparison is holistic. It provides no insight into the specific competencies or weaknesses of either system.","Ideally, we would like to use automatic methods to provide immediate diagnostic information about the translation output— what the system does well, and what it does poorly. At the most general level, we want to know how our system performs on the two most basic problems in translation – word translation and reordering. Holistic metrics are at odds with day-to-day hypothesis testing on these two problems. For instance, during the development of a new MT system we may may wish to compare competing reordering models. We can incorporate each model into the system in turn, and rank the results on a test corpus using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). We might then conclude that the model used in the highest-scoring system is best. However, this is merely an implicit test of the hypothesis; it does not tell us anything about the specificstrengths and weaknesses of each method, which may be different from our expectations. Furthermore, if we understand the relative strengths of each method, we may be able to devise good ways to combine them, rather than simply using the best one, or combining strictly by trial and error. In order to fine-tuneMT systems, we need fine-grainederror analysis.","What we would really like to know is how well the system is able to capture systematic reordering patterns in the input, which ones it is successful with, and which ones it has difficultywith. Word n-grams are little help here: they are too many, too sparse, and it is difficultto discern general patterns from them."]},{"title":"2 Part-of-Speech Sequence Recall","paragraphs":["In developing a new analysis method, we are motivated in part by recent studies suggesting that word reorderings follow general patterns with respect to syntax, although there remains a high degree of fle xibility (Fox, 2002; Hwa et al., 2002). This suggests that in a comparative analysis of two MT systems (or two versions of the same system), it may be useful to look for syntactic patterns that one system (or version) captures well in the target language and the other does not, using a syntaxbased, recall-oriented metric.","As an initial step, we would like to summarize reordering patterns using part-of-speech sequences. Unfortunately, recent work has confirmed the intuition that applying statistical analyzers trained on well-formed text to the noisy output of MT systems produces unuseable results (e.g. (Och et al., 2004)). Therefore, we make the conservative choice to apply annotation only to the reference corpus. Word n-gram correspondences with a reference translation are used to infer the part-of-speech tags for words in the system output.","The method: 1. Part-of-speech tag the reference corpus. We used"]},{"title":"12","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Comparing two systems that differ significantly in their recall for POS n-gram JJ NN IN DT NN.

We have used this method to analyze the output of two different statistical machine translation models (Chiang et al., 2005)."]},{"title":"3 Visualization","paragraphs":["Our demonstration system uses an HTML interface to summarize the observed pattern recall.
