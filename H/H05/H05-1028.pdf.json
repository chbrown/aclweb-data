Despite recent advances, interpreting what users communicate to the system is still a significant challenge due to insufficient recognition (e.g., speech recognition) and understanding (e.g., language understanding) performance. Significant improvement in the robustness of multimodal interpretation is crucial if multimodal systems are to be effective and practical for real world applications.","Previous studies have shown that, in multimodal conversation, multiple modalities tend to complement each other (Cassell et al. 1994). Fusing two or more modalities can be an effective means of reducing recognition uncertainties, for example, through mutual disambiguation (Oviatt 1999). For semantically-rich modalities such as speech and pen-based gesture, mutual disambiguation usually happens at the fusion stage where partial semantic representations from individual modalities are disambiguated and combined into an overall interpretation (Johnston 1998, Chai et al., 2004a). One problem is that some critical but low probability information from individual modalities (e.g., recognized alternatives with low probabilities) may never reach the fusion stage. Therefore, this paper addresses how to use information from one modality (e.g., deictic gesture) to directly influence the semantic processing of another modality (e.g., spoken language understanding) even before the fusion stage.","In particular we present a new salience driven approach that uses gesture to influence spoken language understanding. This approach is based on the observation that, during multimodal conversation, information from deictic gestures (e.g., point or circle) on a graphical interface can signal a part of the physical world (i.e., representation of the domain and task) of the application which is salient during the communication. This salient part of the physical world will prime what users tend to communicate in speech and thus in turn can be used to constrain hypotheses for spoken language understanding. In particular, this approach incorporates a notion of salience from deictic gestures into language models for spoken language processing. Our experimental results indicate the potential of this approach in reducing word error rate and improving concept identification from spoken utterances. 217","In the following sections, we first introduce the current architecture for multimodal interpretation. Then we describe our salience driven approach and present empirical results."]},{"title":"2 3 Input Interpretation","paragraphs":["Input interpretation is the identification of semantic meanings in user inputs. In multimodal conversation, user inputs can come from multiple channels (e.g., speech and gesture). Thus, most work on input interpretation is based on semantic fusion that includes individual recognizers and a sequential integration processes as shown in Figure 1. In this approach, a system first creates possible partial meaning representations from recognized hypotheses (e.g., N-best lists) independently of other modalities. For example, suppose a user says “what is the price of this painting” and at the same time points to a position on the screen. The partial meaning representations from the speech input and the gesture input are shown in (a-b) in Figure 1. The system uses the partial meaning representations to disambiguate each other and combines compatible partial representations together into an overall semantic representation as in Figure1(c).","In this architecture, the partial semantic representations from individual modalities are crucial for mutual disambiguation during multimodal fusion. The quality of partial semantic representations depends on how individual modalities are processed. For example, if the speech input is recognized as “what is the prize of this pant”, then the partial representation from the speech input will not be created in the first place. Without a candidate partial representation, it is not likely for multimodal fusion to reach an overall meaning of the input given this late fusion architecture.","Thus, a problem with the semantics-based fusion approach is that information from multiple modalities is only used during the fusion stage to disambiguate or combine partial semantic representations. This late use of information from other sources in the pipelined process can cause the loss of some low probability information (e.g., recognized alternatives with low probabilities which did not make it to the N-best list) which could be very crucial in terms of the overall interpretation. It is desirable to use information from multiple sources at an earlier stage before partial representations are created from individual modalities. For example, in ((Bangalore and Johnston 2000), a finite-state approach was applied to tightly couple multimodal language processing (e.g., gesture and speech) and speech recognition to improve recognition hypotheses. To further address this issue, in this paper, we present a salience driven approach that particularly applies gesture information (e.g., pen-based deictic gestures) to robust spoken language understanding before multimodal fusion."]},{"title":"Related Work on Salience Modeling","paragraphs":["We first give a brief overview on the notion of salience and how salience modeling is applied in earlier work on natural language and multimodal language processing.","Linguistic salience describes the accessibility of entities in a speaker/hearer’s memory and its implication in language production and interpretation. Many theories on linguistic salience have been developed, including how the salience of entities affects the form of referring expressions as in the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al., 1993) and the local coherence of discourse as in the Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995). Salience modeling is used for both language generation and language interpretation; the latter is more relevant to our work. Most salience-based interpretation has focused on reference resolution for both linguistic referring expressions (e.g., pronouns) (Lappin and Leass 1995) and multimodal expressions (Hul et al. 1995; Eisenstein and Christoudias 2004).

The cause of such attention depends on many factors including user intention, familiarity, and physical characteristics of objects. For example, an object may be salient when it has some properties the others do not have, such as it is the only one that is highlighted, or the only one of a certain size, category, or color 218 (Landragin et al., 2001). Visual salience can also be useful in input interpretation, for example, for multimodal reference resolution (Kehler 2000) and cross-modal coreference interpretation (Byron et al., 2005).","We believe that salience modeling should go beyond reference resolution. Our view is that the salience not only affects the use of referring expressions (and thus is useful for interpreting referring expressions), but also influences the linguistic context of the referring expressions. The spoken utterances that contain these expressions tend to describe information relating to the salient objects (e.g., properties or actions). Therefore, our goal in this paper is to take salience modeling a step further from reference resolution, towards overall language understanding."]},{"title":"4 4.1 A Salience Driven Approach","paragraphs":["The new salience driven approach is based on the cognitive theory of Conversation Implicature (Grice 1975) and earlier empirical findings of user speech and gesture behavior in multimodal conversation (Oviatt 1999). The theory of Conversation Implicature (Grice 1975) states that speakers tend to make their contribution as informative as is required (for the current purpose of communication) and not make their contribution more informative than is required. In the context of multimodal conversation that involves speech and pen-based gesture, this theory indicates that users most likely will not make any unnecessary deictic gestures unless those gestures help in communicating users’ intention. This is especially true since gestures usually take an extra effort from a user. When a pen-based gesture is intentionally delivered by a user, the information conveyed is often a crucial component in interpretation (Chai et al., 2005).

P(e) disco u r s e Speech Gesture Gesture Recognition Gesture Understanding Multimodal Fusion Semantic Representation Figure 2: The salience driven approach: the salience distribution calculated from gesture is used to tailor language models for spoken language understanding","Speech and gesture also tend to complement each other. For example, when a speech utterance is accompanied by a deictic gesture (e.g., point or circle) on a graphical display, the speech input tends to issue commands or inquiries about properties of objects, and the deictic gestures tend to indicate the objects of interest. In addition, as shown in (Oviatt 1999), the deictic gestures often occur before spoken utterances. Our previous work (Chai et al., 2004b) also showed that 85% of time gestures occurred before corresponding speech units. Therefore, gestures can be used as an earlier indicator to anticipate the content of communication in the subsequent spoken utterances. Overview The general idea of the salience based approach is shown in Figure 2. For each application domain, there is a physical world representation that captures domain knowledge (details are described later). A deictic gesture can activate several objects on the graphical display. This activation will signal a distribution of objects that are salient. The salient objects are mapped to the physical world representation to indicate a salient part of representation that includes relevant properties or tasks related to the salient objects. This salient part of the physical world is likely to be the potential content of the spoken communication, and thus can be used to tailor language models for spoken language understanding. This process is shown in the middle shaded box of Figure 2. It bridges gesture understanding and language understanding at a stage before multimodal fusion. Note that the use of gesture information can be applied at different stages: during speech recognition to generate hypotheses or post processing of recognized hypotheses before language understanding. In this paper, we focus on the latter.","The physical world representation includes the following components: • Domain Model. This component captures the relevant knowledge about the domain including domain objects, properties of the objects, relations between objects, and task models related to objects. Previous studies have shown that domain knowledge 219 can be used to improve spoken language understanding (Wai et al, 2001). Currently, we apply a frame-based representation where a frame represents an object (or a type of object) in the domain and frame elements represent attributes and tasks related to the objects. Each frame element is associated with a semantic tag which indicates the semantic content of that element. In the future, the domain model might also include knowledge about the interface, for example, visual properties and spatial relations between objects on the interface. w1 wn...... ......

This component specifies grammar and vocabularies used to process language inputs. There are two types of representation. The first type is a semantics-based context free grammar where each non-terminal symbol represents a semantic tag (indicating semantic information such as the semantic type of an object, etc). Each word (i.e., the terminal symbol) in the lexicon relates to one or more semantic tags. Some of these semantic tags are directly linked to the frame elements in the domain model since they represent certain properties or tasks. This grammar was manually developed."]},{"title":"4.2","paragraphs":["The second type of representation is based on annotated user spoken utterances. The data are annotated in terms of relevant semantic information (i.e., using semantic tags) in the utterance and the intended objects of interest (which are directly linked to the domain model). Based on the annotated data, N-grams can be learned to represent the dependency of language in our domain.","Based on the physical world representation, our approach supports the following operations: Salience modeling. This operation calculates a salience distribution of entities in the physical world. In our current investigation, we limit the scope of entities to a closed set of objects from our physical world representation since the system has knowledge about those objects. These entities could have different salience values depending on whether they are visible on the graphical display, gestured by a user, or mentioned in the prior conversation. In this paper, we focus on the salience modeling using gesture information only. Salience driven language understanding. This operation maps the salience distribution to the physical world representation and uses the salient world to influence spoken language understanding. Note that, in this paper, we are not concerned with acoustic models for speech recognition, but rather we are interested in the use of the salience distribution to prime language models and facilitate language understanding.

Note that although each gesture may have a short duration, here we only consider the beginning time of a gesture.

More specifically, for each onset of a spoken word at time t (i.e., the beginning time stamp of a spoken word), the salience distribution at t can be calculated based on a sequence of gestures that happen before t by Equation (1). This salience distribution can then be used to prime language models for spoken language processing. Language Modeling We first give a brief background of language modeling. Given an observed speech utterance O, the goal of speech recognition is to find a sequence of words W* so that WP , where P(O|W) is the acoustic model and P(W) is the language model.

This allows the development of powerful language models independent of the acoustic model, for example, utilizing topics of the utterances (Gildea and Hofmann 1999), syntactic or semantic labels (Heeman 1999), and linguistic structures (Chelba and Jelinek 2000, Wang and Harper 2002). Recently, we have seen work on language understanding based on environment (Schuler 2003) and language modeling using visual context (Roy and Mukherjee 2005). Our salience driven approach is inspired by this earlier work. Here, we do not address the acoustic model of speech recognition, but rather incorporate the salience distribution for language modeling. In particular, our focus is on investigating the effect of incorporating additional information from other modalities (e.g., gesture) with traditional language models.

For example, one task was to find the least expensive house in the most populated town. The data were recorded from eleven subjects including five nonnative speakers and six native speakers. Each user’s voice was individually trained before the study.
