Such approaches have largely focused on modeling the phone- or character-level processes that generate candidate lexical types, rather than tokens in context. For the full analysis of words in context, disambiguation is also required (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000; Hajič et al., 2001). In this paper, we apply a novel source-channel model to the problem of morphological disambiguation (segmentation into morphemes, lemmatization, and POS tagging) for concatenative, templatic, and inflectional languages. The channel model exploits an existing morphological dictionary, constraining each word’s analysis to be linguistically valid. The source model is a factored, conditionally-estimated random field (Lafferty et al., 2001) that learns to disambiguate the full sentence by modeling local contexts. Compared with baseline state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves statistically significant error rate reductions on Korean, Arabic, and Czech, for various training set sizes and accuracy measures."]},{"title":"1 Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the great successes in computational linguistics has been the construction of morphological analyzers for diverse languages. Such tools take in words and enumerate the possible morphological analyses—typically a sequence of morphemes, perhaps part-of-speech tagged. They are often encoded as finite-state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1981; Koskenniemi, 1983; Beesley and Karttunen, 2003).","What such tools do not provide is a means to disambiguate a word in context. For languages with complex morphological systems (inflective, agglutinative, and polysynthetic languages, for example), a word form may have many analyses. To pick the right one, we must consider the word’s context. This problem has been tackled using statistical sequence models for Turkish (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000) and Czech (Hajič et al., 2001); their approaches (and ours) are not unlike POS tagging, albeit with complex tags.","∗","This work was supported by a Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellowship, a NSF Fellowship, and a NDSEG Fellowship (sponsored by ARO and DOD).

These models are an instance of conditional random fields (CRFs; Lafferty et al., 2001) and include overlapping features. Our applications include diverse disambiguation frameworks and we make use of linguistically-inspired features, such as local lemma dependencies and inflectional agreement. We apply our model to Korean and Arabic, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both cases (§3). We then describe how our model can be expanded to complex, structured morphological tagging, including an efficient estimation method, demonstrating performance on Czech (§4)."]},{"title":"2 Modeling Framework","paragraphs":["Our framework is a source-channel model (Jelinek, 1976).

The Czech lattice has no lemma-ambiguity; this is typical in Czech (see §4). 2.1 Morphological dictionaries and the channel A great deal of research has gone into developing morphological analysis tools that enumerate valid analyses ⃗y ∈ Y+","for a particular word x ∈ X. Typically these tools are unweighted and therefore do not enable token disambiguation.2","They are available for many languages. We will refer to this source of categorial lexical information as a morphological dictionary d that maps X → 2Y+",". The set d(x) is the set of analyses for word x; the set d(x) is the set of whole-sentence analyses for sentence x = ⟨x1, x2, ...⟩.","d(x) can be represented as an acyclic lattice with a “sausage” shape familiar from work in speech recognition (Mangu et al., 1999). Note that for languages with bound morphemes, d(x) will consist of a set of sequences of tokens, so a given “link” in the sausage lattice may contain paths of different lengths. Fig. 1 shows sausage lattices for sentences in three languages.","In this paper, the dictionary defines the support set of the channel model. That is, pc(x | y) > 0 if and only if y ∈ d(x). This is a clean way to incorporate domain knowledge into the probabilistic model; this kind of constraint has been applied in previous work at decoding time (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000; Hajič et al., 2001). In such a model, each word is independent of its neighbors (because the dictionary ignores context). Estimation. A unigram channel model defines","2","Probabilistic modeling of what we call the morphological channel was first carried out by Levinger et al. (1995), who used unlabeled data to estimate p(⃗y | x) for Hebrew, with the support defined by a dictionary. pc(x | y) def = |x| ∏ i=1 p(xi | yi) (2) The simplest estimate of this model is to make p(·, ·) uniform over (x, ⃗y) such that ⃗y ∈ d(x). Doing so and marginalizing to get p(x | ⃗y) makes the channel model encode categorial information only, leaving all learning to the source model.3","Another way to estimate this model is, of course, from data. This is troublesome, because—modulo optionality—x is expected to be known given ⃗y, resulting in a huge model with mostly 1-valued probabilities. Our solution is to take a projection π of ⃗y and let p(· | ⃗y) ≈ p(· | π(⃗y)). In this paper, π maps the analysis to its morphological tag (or tag sequence). We will refer to this as the “tag channel.” OOV. Morphological dictionaries typically do not have complete coverage of a language. We can augment them in two ways using the training data. If a known word x (one for which d(x) is non-empty) appears in the training dataset with an analysis not in d(x), we add the entry to the dictionary. Unknown words (those not recognized by the dictionary) are replaced by an OOV symbol. d(OOV) is taken to be the set of all analyses for any OOV word seen in training. Rather than attempt to recover the morpheme sequence for an OOV word, in this paper we try only for the tag sequence, replacing all of an OOV’s morphemes with the OOV symbol. Since OOV symbols account for less than 2% of words in our corpora, we leave 3","Note that this makes the channel term in Eq. 1 a constant. Then decoding means maximizing ps(y) over y ∈ d(x), equivalently maximizing p(y | d(x))."]},{"title":"476","paragraphs":["more sophisticated channel models to future work. 2.2 The source model The source model ps defines a probability distribution over Y+",", sequences of (tag, morpheme) pairs. Our source models can be viewed as weighted multi-tape finite-state automata, where the weights are associated with local, often overlapping features of the path through the automaton. Estimation. We estimate the source conditionally from annotated data. That is, we maximize","∑","(x,y)∈X+ ×Y+ p̃(x, y) log ps ( y | d(x), ⃗θ) (3) where p̃(·, ·) is the empirical distribution defined by the training data and ⃗θ are the model parameters. In terms of Fig. 1, our learner maximizes the weight of the correct (solid) path through each lattice, at the expense of the other incorrect (dashed) paths. Note that log ps ( y | d(x), ⃗θ) = log ps ( y | ⃗θ)","∑ y′ ∈d(x) ps (","y′ | ⃗θ) (4) The sum in the denominator is computed using a dynamic programming algorithm (akin to the forward algorithm); it involves computing the sum of all paths through the “sausage” lattice of possible analyses for x. By doing this, we allow knowledge of the support of the channel model to enter into our estimation of the source model. It is important to note that the estimation of the model (the objective function used in training, Eq. 3) is distinct from the source-channel structure of the model (Eq. 1).","The lattice-conditional estimation approach was first used by Kudo et al. (2004) for Japanese segmentation and hierarchical POS-tagging and by Smith and Smith (2004) for Korean morphological disambiguation. The resulting model is an instance of a conditional random field (CRF; Lafferty et al., 2001). When training a CRF for POS tagging, IOB chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003), or word segmentation (Peng et al., 2004), one typically structures the conditional probabilities (in the objective function) using domain knowledge: in POS tagging, the set of allowed tags for a word is used; in IOB chunking, the bigram “O I” is disallowed; and in segmentation, a lexicon is used to enumerate the possible word boundaries.4","4","This refinement is in the same vein as the move from maximum likelihood estimation to conditional estimation. MLE would make the sum in the denominator of Eq. 4 Y+",", which for log-linear models is often intractable to compute (and for sequence models may not converge). Conditional estimation limits the sum to the subset of Y+","that is consistent with x, and our variant further stipulates consistency with the dictionary entries for x.","Our approach is the same, with two modifications. First, we model the relationship between labels yi and words xi in a separately-estimated channel model (§2.1). Second, our labels are complex. Each word xi is tagged with a sequence of one or more tagged morphemes; the tags may include multiple fields. This leads to models with more parameters. It also makes the dictionary especially important for limiting the size of the sum in the denominator, since a complex label set Y could in principle lead to a huge hypothesis space for a given sentence x. Importantly, it makes training conditions more closely match testing conditions, ruling out hypotheses a dictionary-aware decoder would never consider. Optimization. The objective function (Eq. 3) is concave and known to have a unique global maximum. Because log-linear models and CRFs have been widely described elsewhere (e.g., Lafferty, 2001), we note only that we apply a standard first-order numerical optimization method (L-BFGS; Liu and Nocedal, 1989). The structure, features, and regularization of our models will be described in §3 and §4. Prior work (morphological source models). Hakkani-Tür et al. (2000) described a system for Turkish that was essentially a source model; Hajič et al. (2001) described an HMM-based system for Czech that could be viewed as a combined source and channel. Both used dictionaries and estimated their (generative) models using maximum likelihood (with smoothing).5","Given enough data, a ML-estimated model will learn to recognize a good path y, but it may not learn to discriminate a good y from wrong alternatives per se. The generative framework is limiting as well, disallowing the straightforward inclusion of arbitrary overlapping features. We present a competitive Czech model in §4."]},{"title":"3 Concatenative Models","paragraphs":["The beauty of log-linear models is that estimation is straightforward given any features, even ones that are not orthogonal (i.e., “overlap”). This permits focusing on feature (or feature template) selection without worries about the mathematics of training.","We consider two languages modeled by concatenative processes with surface changes at morpheme boundaries: Korean and Arabic.","Our model includes features for tag n-grams, morpheme n-grams, and pairs of the two (possibly of different lengths and offsets).

For instance, a feature fires for each trigram of heads, even though there are (bound) morphemes between them. This increases the domain of locality for semantic content-bearing morphemes. This model requires slight changes to the dynamic programming algorithms for inference and training (the previous two heads must be remembered at each state).","Every instantiation of the templates seen in any lattice d(x) built from training data is included in the model, not just those seen in correct analyses y∗",".6 3.1 Experimental design In all of our experiments, we vary the training set size and the amount of smoothing, which is enforced by a diagonal Gaussian prior (L2 regularizer) with variance σ2",". The σ2","= ∞ case is equivalent to not smoothing. We compare performance to the expected performance of a randomized baseline that picks for each word token x an analysis from d(x); this gives a measure of the amount of ambiguity and is denoted “channel only.” Performance of unigram, bigram, and trigram HMMs estimated using maximum likelihood (barely smoothed, using add-10−14",") is also reported. (The unigram HMM simply picks the most likely ⃗y for each x, based on training data and is so marked.)","In the experiments in this section, we report three performance measures. Tagging accuracy is the fraction of words whose tag sequence was correctly identified in entirety; morpheme accuracy is defined analogously. 6 If we used only features observed to occur in y∗",", we would","not be able to learn negative weights for unlikely bits of structure","seen in the lattice d(x) but not in y∗",". Lemma accuracy is the fraction of words whose lemma was correctly identified. 3.2 Korean experiments We applied TM3 and TM3H to Korean. The dataset is the Korean Treebank (Han et al., 2002), with up to 90% used for training and 10% (5K words) for test. The morphological dictionary is klex (Han, 2004). There are 27 POS tags in the tag set; the corpus contains 10K word types and 3,272 morpheme types. There are 1.7 morphemes per word token on average (σ = 0.75). A Korean word generally consists of a head morpheme with a series of enclitic suffixes. In training the head-augmented model TM3H, we assume the first morpheme of every word is the head and lemma.","Results are shown in Tab. 1. TM3H achieved very slight gains over TM3, and the tag channel model was helpful only with the smaller training set. The oracle (last line of Tab. 1) demonstrates that the coverage of the dictionary remains an obstacle, particularly for recovering morphemes. Another limitation is the small amount of training data, which may be masking differences among estimation conditions. We report the performance of TM3H with “factored” estimation. This will be discussed in detail in §4; it means that a model containing only the head features was trained on its own, then combined with the independently trained TM3 model at test time. Factored training was slightly faster and did not affect performance at all; accuracy scores were identical with unfactored training. Prior work (Korean). Similar results were presented by Smith and Smith (2004), using a similar estimation strategy with a model that included far more feature templates. TM3 has about a third as many parameters and TM3H about half; performance is roughly the same (numbers omitted for space). Korean disambiguation results were also reported by Cha et al. (1998), who applied a deterministic morpheme pattern dictionary to segment words, then used a bigram HMM tagger. They also applied transformation-based learning to fix common errors. Due to differences in tag set and data, we cannot compare to that model; a bigram baseline is included. 3.3 Arabic experiments We applied TM3 and TM3H to Arabic.

Constraints in the language are expected to cause features like case, number, and gender to agree locally (on words that have such features) and somewhat independently of each other.

It is intended to learn to penalize morphological tags that are rare, or that are rare with a particular lemma. In our for-mulation, this is not a channel model, because it ignores the surface word forms.","Each model is estimated independently of the others. The lattice d(x) against which the conditional probabilities are estimated contains the relevant projection of the full morphological tags (with lemmas). To decode, we run a Viterbi-like algorithm that uses the union of all models’ features to pick the best analysis (full morphological tags and lemmas) allowed by the dictionary.","There are two important advantages of factored training. First, each model is faster to train alone than a model with all features merged; in fact, training the fully merged model takes far too long to be practical. Second, factored models can be held out at test time to measure their effect on the system, without retraining. Prior work (factored training). Separately training different models that predict the same variables (e.g., x and y) then combining them for consensus-based inference (either through a mixture or a product of probabilities) is an old idea (Genest and Zidek, 1986). Recent work in learning weights for the component “expert” models has turned to cooperative techniques (Hinton, 1999). Decoding that finds y (given x) to maximize some weighted average of log-probabilities is known as a logarithmic opinion pool (LOP). LOPs were applied to CRFs (for named entity recognition and tagging) by Smith et al. (2005), with an eye toward regularization. Their experts (each a CRF) contained overlapping feature sets, and the combined model achieved much the same effect as training a single model with smoothing. Note that our models, unlike theirs, partition the feature space; there is only one CRF, but some parameters are ignored when estimating other parameters. We have not estimated log-domain mixing coefficients—we weight all models’ contributions equally. Sutton and McCallum (2005) have applied factored estimation to CRFs, motivated (like us) by speed; they also describe how factored estimation 9 Lemma-trigram and fine POS-unigram/lemma-bigram fea-","tures were eliminated to limit model size."]},{"title":"480","paragraphs":["full morph. lemma POS OOV POS","accuracy accuracy accuracy accuracy σ2","376K 768K 376K 768K 376K 768K 376K 768K","channel only 61.4 60.3 85.1 84.2 88.5 87.2 17.8 16.4","most likely ⃗y 80.0 80.8 98.1 98.1 97.9 97.8 52.0 52.0","Hajič et al.

Smith and Smith (2004) applied factored estimation to a bilingual weighted grammar, driven by data limitations. 4.2 Experiments Our corpus is the PDT (Hajič, 1998), with up to 60% used for training and 10% (109K words) used for test.10","The morphological dictionary is the one packaged with the PDT; it covers about 98% of the tokens in the corpus. The remaining 2% have (unsurprisingly) a diverse set of 300– 400 distinct tags, depending on the training set size.11","Results are shown in Tab. 2.

At test-time, however, Viterbi search is quite difficult when OOV symbols occur consecutively. To handle this, we prune OOV arcs from the lattices using the factored POS and inflectional models. For each OOV, every model prunes a projection of the analysis (e.g., the POS model prunes POS tags) until 90% of the posterior mass or 3 arcs remain (whichever is more conservative). Viterbi decoding is run on a lattice containing OOV arcs consistent with the pruned projected lattices.","12","Results with the OOV component are also reported in Tab. 2, but we cannot guarantee their experimental validity, since the OOV component is pre-trained and may have been trained on data in our test set. racy on all words, and POS accuracy on OOV words. The channel model (not shown) tended to have a small, harmful effect on performance.","Without any explicit OOV treatment, our POS-only component model significantly reduces lemma and POS errors compared to Hajič et al.’s model. On recovering full morphological tags, our full model is close in performance to Hajič et al., but still significantly worse. It is likely that for many tasks, these performance gains are more helpful than the loss on full tagging is harmful.","Why doesn’t our full model perform as well as Hajič et al.’s model? An error analysis reveals that our full model (768K, σ2","= 1), compared to the HMM (768K) had 91% as many number errors but 0.1% more gender and 31% more case errors. Taking out those three models (“POS & tag-lemma” in Fig. 2) is helpful on all measures except full tagging accuracy, due in part to substantially increased errors on gender (87% increase), case (54%), and number (35%). The net effect of these components, then, is helpful, but not quite helpful enough to match a well-smoothed HMM on complex tagging. We compared the models on the training set and found the same pattern, demonstrating that this is not merely a matter of over-fitting."]},{"title":"5 Future Work","paragraphs":["Two clear ways to improve our models present them-selves.
