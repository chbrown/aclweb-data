However allowing reordering in translation is computationally expensive and in some cases even provably NP-complete (Knight, 1999). Therefore any translation scheme that incorporates reordering must necessarily balance model complexity against the ability to realize the model without approximation.

Although this model of reordering is somewhat limited and can-not capture all possible phrase movement, it forms a proper parameterized probability distribution over reorderings of phrase sequences. We show that with this model it is possible to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoding (with pruning) and Expectation Maximization (EM) style re-estimation of model parameters over large bitext collections.","We now discuss prior work on word and phrase reordering in translation. We focus on SMT systems that do not require phrases to form syntactic constituents.","The IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) describe word reordering via a distortion model defined over word positions within sentence pairs. The Alignment Template Model (Och et al., 1999) uses phrases rather than words as the basis for translation, and defines movement at the level of phrases. Phrase reordering is modeled as a first order Markov process with a single parameter that controls the de-gree of movement.","Our current work is inspired by the block (phrase-pair) orientation model introduced by Tillmann (2004) in which reordering allows neighbor-ing blocks to swap. This is described as a sequence of orientations (left, right, neutral) relative to the monotone block order. Model parameters are block-specific and estimated over word aligned trained bitext using simple heuristics.","Other researchers (Vogel, 2003; Zens and Ney, 2003; Zens et al., 2004) have reported performance gains in translation by allowing deviations from monotone word and phrase order.

The WFST incorporates the translation model P (x|u) and the reordering model P (b|x, u). The score on a self-loop with labels (u, x) is P (x|u) × (1 − β1(x, u)); on a 2-arc path with labels (u1, x1) and (u2, x2), the score on the 1st arc is P (x2|u1) × β1(x2, u1) and on the 2nd arc is P (x1|u2).","In this example, the input to this transducer is a single French phrase sequence V : a, b, c.

This latter condition implies that for an input sequence {a, b, c, d}, we disallow the three output sequences: {b, d, a, c; c, a, d, b; c, d, a, b; }.

The distribution Eqn 9 ensures that the sequences b, c, a and c, b, a are assigned equal probability. The distributions in Eqns 10-12 ensure that the maximum jump is 2 phrases and the reordering happens within a window of 3 phrases. By insisting that the process start and end at state 1 (Fig 5), we ensure that the model is not deficient. A WFST implementing the MJ-2 model can be easily constructed for both phrase alignment and translation, following the construction described for the MJ-1 model."]},{"title":"3 Estimation of the Reordering Models","paragraphs":["The Translation Template Model relies on an inventory of target language phrases and their source language translations. Our goal is to estimate the reordering model parameters P (b|x, u) for each phrase-pair (x, u) in this inventory. However, when translating a given test set, only a subset of the phrase-pairs is needed. Although there may be an advantage in estimating the model parameters under an inventory that covers all the training bitext, we fix the phrase-pair inventory to cover only the phrases on the test set. Estimation of the reordering model parameters over the training bitext is then performed under this test-set specific inventory. 164","We employ the EM algorithm to obtain Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates of the reordering model parameters.

Cx,u(φ, b) is the expected number of times the phrase-pair x, u is aligned with a jump of b phrases when the jump history is φ. We do not use full EM but a Viterbi training procedure that obtains the counts for the best (Viterbi) alignments. If a phrase-pair (x, u) is never seen in the Viterbi alignments, we back-off to a flat parameter β1(x, u) = 0.05.","The ML parameter estimates for the MJ-2 model are given in Table 2, with Cx,u(φ, b) defined similarly.

The counts Cx,u(s, b) are then obtained over the phrase alignments. Finally the ML estimates of the parameters are computed using Eqn 13 (MJ-1) or Eqn 14 (MJ-2).

Phrase-pairs are then extracted from the word alignments (Koehn et al., 2003). MJ-1 model parameters are estimated over all bitext on A-E and over the non-UN bitext on C-E. Finally we use Minimum Error Training (MET) (Och, 2003) to train log-linear scaling factors that are applied to the WFSTs in Equation 1. 04news (04n) is used as the MET training set.","Table 8 reports the performance of the system. Row 1 gives the performance without phrase reordering and Row 2 shows the effect of the MJ-1 VT model. The MJ-1 VT model is used in an initial decoding pass with the four-gram LM to generate translation lattices. These lattices are then rescored under parameters obtained using MET (MET-basic), and 1000-best lists are generated. The 1000-best lists are augmented with IBM Model-1 (Brown et al., 1993) scores and then rescored with a second set of MET parameters. Rows 3 and 4 show the performance of the MET-basic and MET-IBM1 models.","We observe that the maximum likelihood phrase reordering model (MJ-1 VT) yields significantly improved translation performance relative to the monotone phrase order translation baseline. This confirms the translation performance improvements found over smaller training bitexts.","We also find additional gains by applying MET to optimize the scaling parameters that are applied to the WFST component distributions within the TTM (Equation 1). In this procedure, the scale factor applied to the MJ-1 VT Phrase Translation and Reordering component is estimated along with scale factors applied to the other model components; in other words, the ML-estimated phrase reordering model itself is not affected by MET, but the likelihood that it assigns to a phrase sequence is scaled by a single, discriminatively optimized weight. The improvements from MET (see rows MET-Basic and MET- IBM1) demonstrate that the MJ-1 VT reordering models can be incorporated within a discriminative optimized translation system incorporating a variety of models and estimation procedures."]},{"title":"5 Discussion","paragraphs":["In this paper we have described local phrase reordering models developed for use in statistical machine translation. The models are carefully formulated so that they can be implemented as WFSTs, and we show how the models can be incorporated into the Translation Template Model to perform phrase alignment and translation using standard WFST operations. Previous approaches to WFST-based reordering (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Kumar and Byrne, 2003; Tsukada and Nagata, 2004) constructed permutation acceptors whose state spaces grow exponentially with the length of the sentence to be translated. As a result, these acceptors have to be pruned heavily for use in translation. In contrast, our models of local phrase movement do not grow explosively and do not require any pruning or approximation in their construction. In other related work, Bangalore and Ricardi (2001) have trained WFSTs for modeling reordering within translation; their WFST parses word sequences into trees containing reordering information, which are then checked for well-formed brackets. Unlike this approach, our model formulation does not use a tree representation and also ensures that the output sequences are valid permutations of input phrase sequences; we empha-size again that the probability distribution induced over reordered phrase sequences is not degenerate.","Our reordering models do resemble those of (Tillmann, 2004; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) in that we 167 treat the reordering as a sequence of jumps relative to the original phrase sequence, and that the likelihood of the reordering is assigned through phrase-pair specific parameterized models. We note that our implementation allows phrase reordering beyond simply a 1-phrase window, as was done by Tillmann. More importantly, our model implements a generative model of phrase reordering which can be incorporated directly into a generative model of the overall translation process. This allows us to perform ‘embedded’ EM-style parameter estimation, in which the parameters of the phrase reordering model are estimated using statistics gathered under the complete model that will actually be used in translation. We believe that this estimation of model parameters directly from phrase alignments obtained under the phrase translation model is a novel contribution; prior approaches derived the parameters of the reordering models from word aligned bitext, e.g. within the phrase pair extraction procedure.","We have shown that these models yield improvements in alignment and translation performance on Arabic-English and Chinese-English tasks, and that the reordering model can be integrated into large evaluation systems. Our experiments show that discriminative training procedures such Minimum Error Training also yield additive improvements by tuning TTM systems which incorporate ML-trained reordering models. This is essential for integrating our reordering model inside an evaluation system, where a variety of techniques are applied simultaneously.","The MJ-1 and MJ-2 models are extremely simple models of phrase reordering. Despite their simplicity, these models provide large improvements in BLEU score when incorporated into a monotone phrase order translation system. Moreover, they can be used to produced translation lattices for use by more sophisticated reordering models that allow longer phrase order movement. Future work will build on these simple structures to produce more powerful models of word and phrase movement in translation."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["P. F. Brown, S. A.
