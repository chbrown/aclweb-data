{"sections":[{"title":"Machine Translation Using Abductive Inference Jerry R. Hobbs and Megumi Kameyama","paragraphs":["SI:LI International 333 Ravenswood Ave. Menlo Park, CA 94025","Machine Translation and World Knowledge. Many existing approaches to machine translation take for granted that the information presented in the output is found somewhere in the input, and, moreover, that such information should be expressed at a single representational level, say, in terms of the parse trees or of \"semantic\" assertions. Languages, however, not only express the equivalent information by drastically different linguistic means, but also often disagree in what distinctions should be expressed linguistically at all. For example, in translating from Japanese to English, it is often necessary to supply determiners for noun phrases, and this in general cannot be done without deep understanding of the source text. Similarly, in translating from English to Japanese, politeness considerations, which in English are implicit in the social situation and explicit in very diffuse ways in, for example, the heavy use of hypotheticals, must be realized grammatically in Japanese. Machine translation therefore requires that the appropriate inferences be drawn and that the text be interpreted to some depth. Recently, an elegant approach to inference in discourse interpretation has been developed at a number of sites (e.g., Charniak and Goldman, 1988; Hobbs et al., 1990; Norvig, 1987), all based on the notion of abduction, and we have begun to explore its potential application to machine translation. We argue that this approach provides the possibility of deep reasoning and of mapping between the languages at a variety of levels)","Interpretation as Abduction.

In the TACITUS Project at SRI, we have developed a scheme for abductive inference that yields a significant simplification in the description of interpretation processes and a significant extension of the range of phenomena that can be captured. It has been implemented in the TACITUS System (Hobbs et ah, 1990; Stickel, 1989) and has been applied to several varieties of text. The framework suggests the integrated treatment of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics described below. Our principal aim in this paper is to examine the utility of this framework as a model for translation.","In the abductive framework, what the interpretation of a sentence is can be described very concisely: To interpret a sentence:","(1) Prove the logical form of the sentence, together with the constraints that","predicates impose on their","arguments, allowing for coercions,","Merging redundancies where possible,","Making assumptions where necessary. By the first line we mean \"prove from the predicate calculus axioms in the knowledge base, the logical form that has been produced by syntactic analysis and semantic translation of the sentence.\"","In a discourse situation, the speaker and hearer both have their sets of private beliefs, and there is a large overlapping set of mutual beliefs. An utterance stands with one foot in mutual belief and one foot in the speaker's private beliefs. It is a bid to extend the area of mutual belief to include some private beliefs of the speaker's. It is anchored referentially in mutual belief, and when we prove the logical form and the constraints, we are recognizing this referential anchor. This is the given information, the definite, the presupposed. W] ere it is 141 necessary to make assumptions, the information comes from the speaker's private beliefs, and hence is the new information, the indefinite, the asserted. Merging redundancies is a way of getting a minimal, and hence a best, interpretation.","An Example. This characterization, elegant though it may be, would be of no interest if it did not lead to the solution of the discourse problems we need to have solved. A brief example will illustrate that it indeed does. (2) The Tokyo office called. This example illustrates three problems in \"local pragmatics\", the reference problem (What does \"the Tokyo office\" refer to?), the compound nominal interpretation problem (What is the implicit relation between Tokyo and the office?), and the metonymy problem (How can we coerce from the office to the person at the office who did the calling?).","Let us put these problems aside, and interpret the sentence according to characterization (1).

This approach thus permits mixing in one framework both transfer and interlingual approaches to translation. One can state transfer rules between two languages at various levels of linguistic abstraction, and between different levels of the respective languages. Such freedom in transfer is exactly what is needed for translation, especially for such typologically dissimilar languages as English and Japanese. It is thus possible to build a single system for translating among more than two languages in this framework, incorporat-ing the labor savings of interlingual approaches while allowing the convenient specificities of transfer approaches.","We should note that other translations for sentence (2) are possible in different contexts. Two other possibilities are the following:","(26) Tokyo no office ga denwg shimashita.

Tokyo's office from's call Subj existed-Polite There was the call from the Tokyo office (that we were expecting). The difference between (12) and (26) is the speaker's viewpoint. The speaker takes the receiver's viewpoint in (12), while it is neutral between the caller and the receiver in (26). (27) is a more specific version of (12) where the call is mutually identifiable. All of (12), (26) and (27) are polite with the suffix \"-masu\". Non-polite variants are also possible translations.","On the other hand, in the following sentence","(28) Tokyo no office kara denwa shimashita. Tokyo's office from call did-Polite [] made [a/the] call from the Tokyo office. there is a strong inference that the caller is the speaker or someone else who is very salient in the current context.","The use of \"shimashita\" (\"did\")in (26) and (28)indicates the description from a neutral point of view of an event of some agent in the Tokyo office causing a tele-phone call to occur at the recipient's end. This neutral point of view is expressed in (26). In (28), the subject is omitted and hence must be salient, and consequently, the sentence is told from the caller's point of view. In (12) \"ari-mashita\" (\"existed\")is used, and since the tele-phone call exists primarily, or only, at the recipient's end, it is assumed the speaker, at least in point of view, is at the receiver's end.","Although we have not done it here, it looks as though these kinds of considerations can be formalized in our framework as well.","Hard Problems: If a new approach to machine translation is to be compelling, it must show promise of being able to handle some of the hard problems. We have identified four especially hard problems in translating between English and Japanese.","1. The lexical differences (that occur between any two languages). 2. Honorifics. 3. Definiteness and number. 4. The context-dependent \"information structure\". The last of these includes the use of \"wa\" versus \"ga\", the order of noun phrases, and the omission of arguments.","These are the areas where one language's morphosyntax requires distinctions that are only implicit in the commonsense knowledge or context in the other language. Such problems cannot be handled by existing sentence-by-sentence translation systems without unnecessarily complicating the representations for each language.","In this short paper, we can only give the briefest indication of why we think our framework will be productive in investigating the first three of these problems.","Lexical Differences.

Politeness is expressed in very different ways in English and Japanese. In Japanese it is grammaticized and lexicalized in sometimes very elaborate ways in the form of honorifics. One might think that the problem of honorifics does not arise in most practical translation tasks, such as translating computer manuals. English lacks honorifics and in Japanese technical literature they are conventionalized. But if we are translating business letters, this aspect of language becomes very important. It is realized in English, but in a very different way. When one is writing to one's superiors, there is, for example, much more embedding of requests in hypotheticals. Consider for example the following English sentence and its most idiomatic translation: 144 Would it perhaps be possible for you to lend","me your book? Go-hon o kashite-itadak-e-masu ka. Honorific-book Obj lending-receive-can-Polite? In Japanese, the object requested is preceded by the honorific particle \"go\", \"itadak\" is a verb used for a receiv-ing by a lower status person from a higher status person, and \"masu\" is a politeness ending for verbs. In English, by contrast, the speaker embeds the request in various modals, \"would\", \"perhaps\", and \"possible\", and uses a more formal register than normal, in his choice, for example, of \"perhaps\" rather than \"maybe\".","The facts about the use of honorifics can be encoded axiomatically, with predicates such as HigherStatus, where this information is known. Since all knowledge in this framework is expressed uniformly in predicate calculus axioms, it is straightforward to combine information from different \"knowledge sources\", such as syntax and the speech act situation, into single rules. It is therefore relatively easy to write axioms that, for example, restrict the use of certain verbs, depending on the relative status of the agent and object, or the speaker and hearer. For example, \"to give\" is translated into the Japanese verb \"kudasaru\" if the giver is of higher status than the recipient, but into the verb \"sashiageru\" if the giver is of lower status. Similarly, the grammatical fact about the use of the suffix \"-masu\" and the fact about the speech act situation that speaker wishes to be polite may also be expressed in the same axiom.","Definiteness and Number. The definiteness and number problem is illustrated by the fact that the Japanese word \"ki\" can be translated into \"the tree\" or \"a tree\" or \"the trees\" or \"trees\". It is not so straightforward to deal with this problem axiomatically. Nevertheless, our framework, based as it is on deep interpretation and on the distinction between given and new information, provides us with what we need to begin to address the problem. A first approximation of a method for translating Japanese NPs into English NPs is as follows:","1. Resolve deep, i.e., find the referrent of the Japanese NP.","2. Does the Japanese NP refer to a set of two or more? If so, translate it as a plural, otherwise as a singular.","3. Is the entity (or set) \"mutually identifiable\"? If so, then translate it as a definite, otherwise as an indefinite. \"Mutually identifiable\" means first of all that the description provided by the Japanese NP is mutually known, and secondly that there is a single most salient such entity. \"Most salient\" means that there are no other equally high-ranking interpretations of the Japanese sentence that resolve the NP in some other way. (Generic definite noun phrases are beyond the scope of this paper.)","Conclusion. We have sketched our solutions to the various problems in translation with a fairly broad brush 145 in this short paper. We recognize that many details need to be worked out, and that in fact most of the work in machine translation is in working out the details. But we felt that in proposing a new formalism for translation research, it was important to stand back and get a view of the forest before moving in to examine the individual trees.","Most machine translation systems today map the source language text into a logical form that is fairly close to the source language text, transform it into a logical form that is fairly close to a target language text, and generate the target language text. What is needed is first of all the possibility of doing deep interpretation when that is what is called for, and secondly the possibility of translating from the source to the target language at a variety of levels, from the most superficial to levels requiring deep interpretation and access to knowledge about the world, the context, and the speech act situation. This is precisely what the framework we have presented here makes possible.","References","[1] Charniak, Eugene, and Robert Goldman, 1988. \"A Logic for Semantic Interpretation\", Proceedings, 26th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 87-94, Buffalo, New York, June 1988.","[2] Hobbs, Jerry R., Mark Stickel, Douglas Appelt, and Paul Martin, 1988. \"Interpretation as Abduction\", SRI Technical Note 499, SRI International, Menlo Park, California.
