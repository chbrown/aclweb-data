FIobbs","paragraphs":["SR;I International 333 Ravenswood Ave. Menlo Park, CA 94025","TACITUS is a natural language processing system that is intended to be general and domain-independent. It performs a syntactic analysis of the sentences in the text, producing a logical form. Next, inferential pragmatics processing is applied to the logical form to solve problems of schema recognition, reference resolution, metonymy resolution, and the interpretation of vague predicates. An analysis component then produces the desired output for the application. TACITUS has been applied to several quite different domains, including naval equipment failure reports, naval operations reports, and terrorist reports.","Given a text to be analyzed, TACITUS first calls a preprocessor to do spelling correction and to translate domain-peculiar expressions of times, ranges, tables, and so on, into a canonical form. For the terrorist reports, we have also implemented a keyword-based statistical filter to select the relevant Sentences in the text. This eliminates 75% of the sentences from deeper analysis, but only eliminates about 10% of the relevant sentences.","The syntactic component is the DIALOGIC system, developed originally for the TEAM transportable, naturaI language interface to databases. The parser is bottom-up and produces all the parses at once, together with their logical forms. Its grammar is among the largest computer grammars of English in existence, giving nearly complete coverage of such phenomena as sentential complements, relative clauses, adverbials, sentence fragments, and the most common varieties of conjunction. Selectional constraints are applied, and there are a large number of heuristics for selecting the preferred parses of ambiguous sentences. The logical form produced is an \"ontologically promiscuous\" version of first-order predicate calculus, in which relations of grammatical subordination are represented. Optionally and where possible, the logical forms for different parses are merged into a neutral representation. Experiments are now being conducted to determine ways to speed up the parsing process, using probabilistic and other criteria for scheduling the parser. We are also experimenting with ways of extracting information from failed parses.","Pragmatics processing is based on abductive inference, implemented in the Prolog Technology Theorem Prover (PTTP), using a knowledge base encoding commonsense and domain-specific knowledge in the form of predicate-426 calculus axioms. The fundamental idea is that the interpretation of a sentence is the minimal proof from the knowledge base of the logical form of the sentence together with the constraints predicates impose on their arguments, allowing for coercions, where one merges redundancies where possible and makes assumptions where necessary. This formulation leads to an elegant, unified solution to the problems of schema recognition, reference resolution, metonymy resolution, and the interpretation of vague predicates. The output of this component is an elaborated logical form with the relevant inferences drawn and the identities of entities explicitly encoded.","Finally, an analysis component takes the interpretation produced by the pragmatics component and generates the required output. For the equipment failure reports, this is a diagnosis of the problem described. For the naval operations reports and the terrorist reports, this is entries for a database. With very little effort, analysis components could be constructed for a number of other applications, such as message routing and message prioritizing.","A number of convenient knowledge-acquisition facilities have been implemented for TACITUS. These include a menu-based lexical acquisition component, a sort hierarchy editor, and a component allowing entry of axioms in a subset of English.","The people working on this project include Douglas Appelt, John Bear, Jerry ttobbs, David Magerman, Mark Stickel, and Mabry Tyson."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] Hobbs, Jerry R., Mark Stickel, Douglas Appelt, and Paul Martin, 1988. \"Interpretation as Abduction\", SRI Technical Note 499, SP,.I International, Menlo Park, California.
