Robin Rohlicel¢","paragraphs":["Boston University Boston, MA 02215"]},{"title":"PROJECT GOALS","paragraphs":["The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independent recognition of continuous speech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate for use with these models. The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic, segment-based models that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (feature vectors) that correspond to a phoneme. Since the use of segment models is computationally complex, we are investigating multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficient search. Furthermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higher-order information. This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF."]},{"title":"RECENT RESULTS","paragraphs":["• Demonstrated improved phoneme classification performance (23% reduction of error) with left-context-dependent, gender-dependent segment models.","• Developed a new segment model for recognition based on a dynamical system representation of time correlation. Since classical approaches to system identification (parameter estimation) are too costly, an alternative algorithm was developed based on the Estimate-Maximize algorithm. Phoneme classification results show a significant improvement over previous approaches to time correlation modeling.","• Jointly with BBN, developed a methodology for in-tegrating recognition systems based on rescoring the N-best sentence hypotheses and combining scores to rerank the sentences. Demonstrated improved word recognition performance by combining the BBN Byblos system results with the BU segment model rescoring. Implemented a segment model rescoring system using context-dependent models which gives encouraging initial results.","• Applied Bayesian techniques for speaker-adaptation to the stochastic segment model. Adapting distributions means alone, with 30 sentences, yields a 16% re-","BBN Inc.
