We adopt a probabilistic parsing strategy to provide a hierarchical lexical analysis of a word, including information such as morphology, stress, syllabification, phonemics and graphemics. Long-distance constraints are propagated by enforcing local constraints throughout the hierarchy. Our training and testing corpora are derived from the high-frequency portion of the Brown Corpus (10,000 words), augmented with markers indicating stress and word morphology. We evaluated our performance based on an unseen test set. The percentage of nonparsable words for letter-to-sound and sound-to-letter generation were 6% and 5% respectively. Of the remaining words our system achieved a word accuracy of 71.8~0 and a phoneme accuracy of 92.5% for letter-to-sound generation, and a word accuracy of 55.8% and letter accuracy of 89.4% for sound-to-letter generation. We also compared our hierarchical approach with an alternative, single-layer approach to demonstrate how the hierarchy provides a parsimonious description for English orthographic-phonological regularities, while simultaneously attaining competitive generation accuracy."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["This paper describes a trainable probabilistic system for reversible letter-to-sound/sound-to-letter generation. Sound-to-letter generation is a crucial aspect in the problem of automatic detection/incorporation of new words, which is in turn critical for the development of large vocabulary speech understanding systems. Moreover, letter-to-sound generation will continue to be important for speech output, especially in applications such as read-ing machines. To successfully achieve our goal, several important issues must be addressed. First, what should be the inventory of linguistic or lexical units for describ-ing English orthographic-phonological regularities? Second, how should these units be incorporated into the representation of English orthography and phonology? Third, what algorithms can be used to synthesize and an-alyze the spelling and pronunciation of an English word","1This research was supported by ARPA under Contract N00014-89-J-1332, monitored through the Office of Naval Research, and a grant from Apple Computer Inc. in terms of these lexical units? These three issues will be addressed in detail in the following when we describe our approach and report on our system's performance for both letter-to-sound [1] and sound-to-letter generation [2]. The novel features of our approach include the reversibility of the combined parsing and generative processes, the ability to provide multiple output hypotheses, the capability of handling uncertainty in the input, as well as our treatment of non-parsab!e words."]},{"title":"PREVIOUS WORK","paragraphs":["Letter-to-Sound Generation","One of the first approaches adopted for letter-to-sound generation is typified by MITalk [8]. It follows the theories of generative grammar and the transformational cycle as proposed by Chomsky and Halle [3]. A large set of ordered cyclical rules are applied in turn to the word in question until a final pronunciation emerges. While the process of establishing the appropriate rule set was tedious and time-consuming, the resulting system achieved a degree of accuracy that, to our knowledge, has not yet been matched by other more automatic techniques.","Because the generation of cyclical rules is a difficult and complicated task, several research groups have at-tempted to acquire letter-to-sound generation systems through automatic or semi-automatic data-driven techniques, based on neural nets or on an information theoretic approach. Typically, the goal is to provide as little a priori information as possible, ideally, only a set of pairings of letter sequences with corresponding (aligned or unaligned) phone sequences. Iterative training algorithms then produce a probability model that is applied to predict the most likely pronunciation. Probably the best known of these systems is NETtalk [4], which learns a pronunciation of the current letter by considering the six surrounding letters as input to the neural network. Lucassen and Mercer [5] acquired a set of rules automatically from a large lexicon of phonetically labelled data by growing decision trees using a criterion based on mutual information. Although direct comparisons of performance of different systems is difficult due to the lack of standardized phone sets, data sets, or scoring algo-"]},{"title":"289","paragraphs":["rithms, these systems have reported phone accuracies in the low 90's in terms of the percent of letters correctly pronounced. Sound-to-Letter Generation","To our knowledge, there has been very little previous work reported in the literature addressing the problem of sound-to-letter generation. We are aware of only two prior research efforts in this area.","Lucas and Damper [6] developed a system for bi-directional text-phonetics translation using two neural networks to perform statistical string translation. This system does not require pre-aligned text-phonetic pairs for training, but instead tries to infer appropriate segmentations and alignments. In a phonetics-to-text translation task using two disjoint 2,000-word corpora for training mad testing, they reported a 71.3% letter and a 22.8% word accuracy.","Another related effort was conducted by Alleva and Lee [7], who used HMMs to model the"]},{"title":"acoustics","paragraphs":["of training sentences based on the orthographic transcriptions.

However, this result is not directly comparable to our work because the phonemic/phonetic representation is bypassed."]},{"title":"A HIERARCHICAL LEXICAL REPRESENTATION","paragraphs":["It has long been realized from research in speech synthesis that a variety of linguistic knowledge sources play an important role in determining English letter/sound correspondences [8]. For example, part-of-speech causes the noun and verb forms of \"record\" to be pronounced differently. A morphological boundary causes the letter sequence \"sch\" in \"discharge\" to be realized differently from that in \"school\" or \"scheme\". Stress changes the identity of vowels in a word, e.g. \"define\" vs. \"defini-tion\". Also, syllabic constraints are expressible in terms of the sequential ordering of distinctive features - sonority sequencing in manner features, and phonotactic constraints in place and voicing features. Furthermore, there are graphemic constraints for letter to letter transitions.

We have chosen a probabilistic parsing paradigm for four reasons: First, the probabilities serve to augment the known structural regularities that can be encoded in simple rules with other structural regularities which may be automatically discovered from a large body of training data. Secondly, since the more probable parse theories are distinguished from the less probable ones, search efforts can selectively concentrate on the high probability theories, which is an effective mechanism for perplexity reduction. Thirdly, probabilities are less rigid than rules, and adopting a probabilistic framework allows us to easily generate multiple parse theories. Fourthly, the flexibility of a probabilistic framework also enables us to automatically relax constraints to attain better coverage of the data. Training Procedure","The layered bigrams formalism attaches probabilities to sibling-sibling transitions in context-free grammar rules. It has been shown to achieve a low perplexity at the linguistic level within the ATIS domain [10]. For our current sub-word application, we have modified the layered-bigrams in two ways: (1) parse trees are generated in a bottom-up fashion instead of top-down, and (2) the contextual information used in bottom-up prediction includes the complete history in the immediate left column.","Our experimental corpus consists of the 10,000 most frequent words appearing in the Brown Corpus [11], where each word entry contains a spelling and a single unaligned phoneme string. We used about 8,000 words for training, and a disjoint set of about 800 words for testing.","The set of training probabilities are estimated by tabulating counts using the training parse trees. 4 It includes bottom-up prediction probabilities for each category in the parse tree, and column advancement probabilities for extending a column to the next terminal. The same set of probabilities are used for both letter-to-sound and sound-to-letter generation. Testing Procedure","In letter-to-sound generation, the system takes in a spelling as an input, generates a parse tree in a bottom-4See [1] for a more detailed description of this process. up left-to-right fashion, and derives a phonemic pronunciation from the complete parse: In sound-to-letter generation, the system accepts a string of phonemes as input, and generates letters. An inadmissible stack decoding search algorithm is adopted for its simplicity. If multiple hypotheses are desired, the algorithm can terminate after multiple complete hypotheses have been popped off the stack. These hypotheses are subsequently re-ranked according to their actual parse score. Though our search is inadmissible, we are able to obtain multiple hypotheses inexpensively with satisfactory performance."]},{"title":"EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS","paragraphs":["Experiments on both letter-to-sound and sound-to-letter generation were conducted using 26 letters, one graphemic place-holder and 52 phonemes (including several unstressed vowels and pseudo diphthongs such as/o r/). Each entry in the test corpus contains a spelling corresponding to a single pronunciation. The generation procedures use evaluation criteria that directly mirror one another. Word accuracy is the percentage of parsable words for which the top-ranking theory generates a spelling/pronunciation that matches the lexical entry exactly. Non-parsable words are those for which no sPelling/pronunciation output is produced. \"Top N\" word accuracy refers to the percentage of parsable words for which the correctly generated spelling/pronunciation appears in the top N complete theories. Letter/Phoneme accuracies include insertion, substitution and deletion error rates, and are obtained using the program provided by NIST for evaluating speech recognition systems. Results on Letter-to-Sound Generation","In letter-to-sound generation, about 6% of the test set was nonparsable. This set consists of compound words, proper names, and words that failed due to sparse data problems. Results for the parsable portion of the test set are shown in Table 2.

Results on Sound-to-Letter Generation","In sound-to-letter generation, about 4% of the test set was nonparsable. Results for the parsable words are shown in Table 3; top-choice word accuracy for sound-to-letter is about 52%. This corresponds to a letter accuracy of 88.6%, with an insertion error rate of 2.5% taken into account. This performance compares favorably with those reported in previous work.","Figure 3 is a plot of the cumulative percent correct (in sound-to-letter generation) of whole word theories as a function of N-best depth of the test set. The asymptote of the graph shows that the first 30 complete theories generated by the parser contain a correct theory for about 83% of the test words. Within this pool, resorting using the actual parse score has put the correct theory within the top 10 choices for about 81% of the cases, while the remaining 2% have their correct theories ranked between N = 10 and N = 30. Resorting seems to be less effective in the sound-to-letter case, presumably because many more \"promising\" theories can be generated than for letter-to-sound. A possible reason for this is the ambiguity in phoneme-to-letter mapping, and another reason is that geminant letters are often mapped to the same (consonantal) phoneme. For example, the generated spellings from the pronunciation of \"connector\" i.e., the phoneme string (k t n e k t a~), include: \"conecter\", \"conector\", \"connecter\", \"connector\", \"conectar\", \"conectyr\", \"conectur\", \"connectyr\", \"eonnectur\", \"conectter', \"connectter\" and \"cannecter'. Many of these hypotheses can be rejected with the avail-' ability of a large lexicon of legitimate English spellings. Error Analyses","Both of the cumulative plots shown above reach an asymptotic value well below 100%. The words that belong to the portion of the test set lying above the asymptote appear intractable - a correct pronunciation/spelling did not emerge as one of the 30 complete theories. Detailed analysis of these words shows that they fall into approximately 4 categories. (1) Generated pronunciations that have subtle deviations from the reference strings. (2) Unusual pronunciations due to influences from foreign languages. (3) Generated pronunciations which agree with the regularity of English letter-phoneme mappings, but were nevertheless incorrect. (4) Errors attributable to sparse data problems. Some examples are shown in Table 4.

Consequently, we would like to empirically assess: (1) the relative contribution of the different linguistic layers towards generation accuracy, and (2) the relative merits of the overall design of the hierarchical lexical representation. Our studies [13] are based on letter-to-sound generation only, although we expect that the implications of our study should carry over to sound-to-letter generation. Investigations on the Hierarchy","The implementation of our parser is flexible, in that it can train and test on a variable number of layers in the hierarchy. This enables us to explore the relative contribution of each linguistic level in the generation task. We conducted a series of experiments whereby an in-creasing amount of linguistic knowledge (in terms of the number of layers in the hierarchy) is omitted from the training parse trees. For each reduced configuration, the system is re-trained and re-tested on the same training and testing corpora as described earlier. For each experiment we compute the top-choice word accuracy and perplexity, which reflect the amount of constraint provided by the hierarchical representation. We also measure the coverage to show the extent to which the parser can generalize to account for previously unseen structures, and count the number off system parameters in order to observe the computational load, as well as the parsimony of the hierarchical framework in capturing English orthographic-phonological regularities. We found that for every layer omitted from the representation, linguistic constraints are lost, manifested as a lower generation accuracy, higher perplexity and greater coverage. Fewer layers also require fewer training parameters.","The significant exception was the case of omitting the layer of broad classes (layer 5), which seems to introduce additional constraints, thus giving the highest generation performance. The word accuracy based on the parsable portion of the test set was 71.8%, 5 which corresponds to a phoneme accuracy of 92.5%. This improvement 6 can be understood by realizing that broad classes can be predicted from phonemes with certainty, and the inclusion of the broad class layer probably led to excessive smoothing across the individual phonemes within each broad class7 Again, about 6% of the test set was nonparsable. When a robust parsing scheme is used to recover the nonparsable words, 100% coverage was achieved, but performance degrades to 69.2% word and 91.3% phoneme accuracy. Comparison with a Single-Layer Approach","We also compared our current hierarchical framework with an alternative approach which uses a single-layer representation. Here, a word is represented mainly by its spelling and an aligned phonemic transcription, using the"]},{"title":"[NULL]","paragraphs":["phoneme for silent letters. The alignment is based on the training parse trees from the hierarchical approach. For example, \"bright\" is transcribed as/b raY NULL NULL [/. The word is then fragmented exhaustively to obtain letter sequences (word fragments) shorter than a set maximum length. During training, bigram probabilities and phonemic transcription probabilities are computed for each letter sequence. Therefore this approach","5When normalized on the entire test set, the word accuracy becomes 67.5%.","6We also found improvement on sound-to-letter generation - 55.8% word accuracy on the parsable test words, corresponding to 89.4% letter accuracy, and 5% of the words were nonparsable.","7However, broad classes may still serve a role as a \"fast match\" layer in recognition experiments, where their predictions could no longer be certain, due to recognition errors."]},{"title":"293","paragraphs":["captures some graphemic constraints within the word fragment, but higher level linguistic knowledge is not explicitly incorporated. Letter-to-sound generation is accomplished by finding the \"best\" concatenation of letter sequences which constitutes the spelling of the test word.","TO facilitate comparison with the hierarchical approach, we use the same training and test sets to run letter-to-sound generation experiments with the single-layer approach. Several different value settings were used for the maximum word fragment length. We expect generation accuracy to improve as the maximum word fragment length increases, because longer letter sequences can capture more context. However, this should be accompanied by an increase in the number of system parameters due to the combinatorics of the letter sequences. Furthermore, there are no nonparsable test words in the single-layer approach, because it can always \"backolT' to mapping a single letter to its most probable phoneme.","The hierarchical approach (without the broad class layer) achieved the same performance as the highest per-forming single-layer approach, which allowed a maximum fragrnent length of 6. 8 The mean fragment length of the segmentations used in the test set by the single-layer approach was 3.7, while the mean grapheme length used by the hierarchical approach was only 1:2. The hierarchical approach is capable of reversible generation using about 32,000 parameters, while the single-layer approach requires 693,300 parameters (a 20-fold increase) for uni-directional letter-to-sound generation. In order to achieve reversibility, the number of parameters would have to be doubled."]},{"title":"DISCUSSION","paragraphs":["Our current work demonstrates the utility of a hierarchical framework, which is relatively rich in linguistic knowledge, for bi-directional letter-to-sound/sound-to-letter generation. The use of layered bigrams in our hierarchy is extendable to encompass natural language constraints [10], prosody, discourse and perhaps even dialogue modeling constraints on top, as well as phonetics and acoustics at the bottom. As such this paradigm should be particularly useful for applications in speech synthesis, recognition and understanding.","The versatility of our framework can lead to a variety of applications. These range from a lexical representation for large-vocabulary recognition, which provides semantic information, syntactic information, and a clustering mechanism for fast match [12], to a low-perplexity langnage model for character recogition tasks, where our system gives a test set perplexity of 8.0 as constrasted","Swe did not investigate the cases where maximum word fragment lengths are set beyond 6, due to computational limitations, and the vast number of training parameters required. with 11.3 from a standard letter bigram.
