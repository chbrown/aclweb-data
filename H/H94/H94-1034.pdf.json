Introduction","paragraphs":["Interactive spoken dialog provides many new challenges for spoken language systems. One of the most critical is the prevalence of speech repairs. Speech repairs are dysfluencies where some of the words that the speaker utters need to be removed in order to correctly understand the speaker's meaning. These repairs can be divided into three types:"]},{"title":"flesh starts, modifications, and abridged.","paragraphs":["A fresh start is where the speaker abandons what she was saying and starts again. the current plan is we take - okay let's say we start with the bananas (d91-2.2 uttl05) A modification repair is where the speech repair modifies what was said before. after the orange juice is at - the oranges are at the OJ factory (d93-193 utt59) An abridged repair is where the repair consists solely of a fragment and/or editing terms. we need to -um manage to get the bananas to Dansville more quickly (d93-14.3 utt50) In these examples, the \"-\" marks the interruption point, the point that marks the end of the removed text (including word fragments). and precedes the editing terms, if present. In our corpus of problem solving dialogs, 25% of turns contain at least one repair, 67% of repairs occur with at least one other repair in the ram, and repairs in the same turn occur on average within 6 words of each other. As a result, no spoken language system will perform well without an effective way to detect and correct speech repairs. We propose that speechrepairs can be detected and corrected within the local context of the repair. So, clues are needed for detecting repairs that do not depend on such global properties as the syntactic or semantic well-formedness of the entire utterance. But this does not mean that syntactic clues cannot be used. One powerfig predictor of modification repairs is the presence of a syntactic anomaly (c.f. Bear, Dowding and Shriberg, 1992) at the interruption point. The anomaly occurs because the text after the interruption point is not intended to follow the text before the interruption, but to replace it, so there is no reason why the text before and the text after need to be syntactically well-furmed. In this paper, we describe how the syntactic anomalies of modification repairs can be detected by a part-of-speech tagger, augmented with category transition probebilities for modification repairs. Because we use a statistical model, other clues, such as the presence of editing terms, word fragments, and word conespondence can be factored in by appropriately modifying the transition probabilities. Focusing on the detection of modification repairs does not mean we are ignoring abridged repairs. Assuming that word fragments and editing terms can be detected, abridged repairs are easy to detect and correct. What is not trivial about these repairs is differentiating them from modification repairs, especially where there are incidental word correspondences. It is this distinction that makes such repairs easy to detect, but potentially difficult to correcL Since our approach looks for syntactic anomalies, other than those caused by word fragments and editing terms, it can distinguish abridged repairs from modification repairs, which should make both types of repairs easier to correcL An ulterior motive for not using higher level syntactic or semantic knowledge is that the coverage of parsers and semantic interpreters is not sufficient for unrestricted dialogs. Recently, Dowding et al. (1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the Darpa Airline reservation corpus. Unrestricted dialogs will present even more difficulties; not only will the speech be more ungrammatical, but there is also the problem of segmenting the dialog into utterance units (c.f. Wang and Hirachberg, 1992). If speech repairs can be detected and corrected before parsing and semantic interpretation, this should simplify those modules as well as make them more robust."]},{"title":"2. Previous Work","paragraphs":["Several different strategies have been discussed in the literature for detecting and correcting speech repairs. One way to compare the effectiveness of these approaches is to look at their recall and precision rates. For detecting repairs, the recall rate is the number of correctly detected repairs compared to the number of repairs, and the precision rate is the number of detected repairs compared to the number of detections (including false positives). But the true measures of success are the correction rates. Correction recall is the number of repairs that were properly corrected compared to the number of repairs. Correction precision is the number of repairs that were properly corrected compared to the total number of corrections. One of the first computational approaches was that taken by 187 Hindle (I 983), who used a deterministic parser augmented with rules to look for matching categories and matching strings of words. Hindie achieved a correction recall rate of 97% on his corpus; however, this was olbtalned by assuming that speech repairs were marked by an explicit \"edit signal\" and with part-of-speech tags externally supplied. The SRI g~up (Bear, Dowding and Shn%erg, 1992) removed the assumptiml of an explicit edit signal, and employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs (they removed all utterances with abridged repairs from their corpus). For detection, they were able to achieve a recall rate of 76%, and a precision of 62%, and they were able to find the correct repair 57% of the time, leading to an overall correction recall of 43% and correetion precision of 50%. They also tried combining syntactic and semantic knowledge in a \"parser-first\" approach--first try to parse the input and if that fails, invoke repair strategies based on their pattern matehing technique. In a test set of 756 utterances containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al., 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a precision rate of 62%. Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) investigated using acoustic informarion to detect the interruption point of speech repairs. In their corpus, 74% of all repairs are marked by a word fragment. Using hand-transcribed prosodic annotations, they trained a classifier on a 172 utterance training set to identify the interruption point (each utterance contained at least one repair). On a test set of 186 utterantes containing 223 repairs, they obtained a recall rate of 83.4% and a precision of 93.9% in detecting speech repairs. The clues that they found relevant were duration of pause between words, presence of fragments, and lexical matching within a window of three words. However, they do not address the problem of determining the correction or distinguishing modification repairs from abridged repairs."]},{"title":"3. The Corpus","paragraphs":["As part of the TRAINS project (Allen and Schubert, 1991), which is a long term research pmjeet to build a conversationally proficient planning assistant, we are collecting a corpus of problem solving dialogs. The dialogs involve two participants, one who is playing the role of a user and has a certain task to accomplish, and another, who is playing the role of the system by acting as a planning assistant (Gross, Allen and Traum, 1992). The entire corpus consists of 112 dialogs totaling almost eight hours in length and containing about 62,000 words and 6300 speaker turns. These dialogs have been segmented into utterance files (c.f. Heeman and Allen, 1994¢); words have been transcribed and the speech repairs have been annotated. For a training set, we use 40 of the dialogs, consisting of 24,000 words; and for testing, 7 of the dialogs, consisting of 5800 words. In order to provide a large training corpus for the statistical model, we use a tagged version of the Brown corpus, from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini and Marcinklewicz, 1993). We removed all punch~on in order to more closely approximate unsegmented spoken speech. This corpus provides us with category transition probabilities fur fluent speech. These probabilities have also been used to bootstrap our algorithm in order to determine the category probabilities for speechrepalrs from our training corpus.*","* We found that the tagset used in the Penn Treebank did not always provide a fine onongh distinction for detecting syntactic anomalies.

Each pair is given a unique index. Other words in the removed text and resumed text are annotated with an x. Also, editing terms (filled pauses and clue words) are labeled with et, and the interruption point with Int, which will be before any editing terms associated with the repair, and after the fragment, if present. (Further details of our annotation scheme can be found in (Heeman and Allen, 1994a).)

Also, the percentage of repairs that include fragments and editing terms is also given. Two trends emerge from this data. First, fragments and editing terms mark less than 34% of all modification repairs. Second, the presence of a fragment or editing term does not give conclusive evidence as to whether the repair is a modification or an abridged repair."]},{"title":"4. Part.of-Speech Tagging","paragraphs":["Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning to a word the category that is most probable given the sentential context (Church, 1988).

Fragments","paragraphs":["Assuming; that fragments can be detected automatically (c.f. Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993), the question arises as to what the tagger should do with them. If the tagger treats them as lexical items, the words on either side of the fragment will be separated. This will cause two problems. First' if the fragment is part of an abridged repair, category assignment to these words will be hindered. Second, and more important to our work, is that the fragment will prevent the statistical model from judging the syntactic well-formedness of the word before the fragment and the word after, preventing it from distinguishing a modification repair from an abridged repair. So, the tagger needs to skip over fragments. However, the fragment can be viewed as the \"word\" that gets tagged as a modification repair or not. (The 'not' in this case means that the fragment is part of an abridged repair.) When no fragment is present between words, we view the interval as a null word.

Just as with editing terms, not all matches make the same predictions about the occurrence of a modification repair. Bear, Dowding and Shriberg (1992) looked at the number of matching words versus the number of intervening words. However, this ignores the category of the word matches. For instance, a matching verb (with some intervening words) is more likely to indicate a repair than say a matching preposition or determiner. So, we classify word matchings by category and number of intervening words. Further-more, if there are multiple matches in a repair, we only use one, the one that most predicts a repair. For instance in the following repair, the matching instances of \"take\" would be used over the matching instances of \"will\", since main verbs were found to more strongly signal a modification repair than do modals. how long will that take - will it take for engine one at Dansvifie (d93-183 utt43) Since the statistical model only uses one matching per repair, the same is done in collecting the statistics.

Correcting Repairs","paragraphs":["The actual goal of detecting speech repairs is to be able to correct them, so that the speaker's utterance can be understood. We have argued for the need to distinguish modification repairs from abridged repairs, because this distinction would be useful in determining the correction. We have implemented a pattern builder (Heeman and Allen, 1994b), which builds potential repair patterns based on word matches and word replacements. However, the pattom builder has only limited knowledge which it can use to decide which patterns are likely repairs. For instance, given the utterance \"pick up uh fill up the boxcars\" (d93-17.4 utt40), it will postulate that there is a single repair, in which \"pick up\" is replaced by \"fill up\". However, for an uuerance like \"we need to urn manage to get the bananas\" (d93-14-3 uttS0), it will postulate that \"manage to\" replaces \"need to\". So, we use the statistical model to filter repairs found by the pattern builder. This also removes a lot of the false positives of the statistical model, since no potential repair pattern would be found for them. On the training set, the model was queried by the pattern builder on 961 potential modification repairs, of which 397 contained repairs. The model predicted 365 of these, and incorrectly detected 33 more, giving a detection recall rate of 91.9% and a precision of 91.7%.

With the exception of identifying fresh starts, all other processing is automatic and does not require additional hand-tailored transcription. We will be incorporating this method of detecting and correcting speech repairs into the next version of the TRAINS system, which will use spoken input."]},{"title":"10.
