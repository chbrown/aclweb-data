Sponsored by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), it is the first of a series of similar data sets that will be colected for major languages of the world in a cooperative project called Polyphone. It is designed to provide telephone speech suitable for the development of automatic voice-interactive telephone services. In particular, Maerophone contains training material for applications in transportation, scheduling, ticketing, database access, shopping, and other automated telephone interactions. In addition to being phonetically balanced, the spoken material refers to times, locations, monetary amounts, and interactive operations. The utterances are spoken by respondents into telephone handsets and recorded directly in 8-bit mu-law digital form through a T1 connection to the usual switched telephone network. The entire corpus will be made available by LDC in 1994. The paper describes the design of the linguistic materials in the corpus, and the process of solicitation, collection, transcription, and file preparation for the Macrophone corpus."]},{"title":"1. MATERIAL DESIGN","paragraphs":["The prospective applications for the Macrophone data partly determined the linguistic design of the material and the population of speakers to be recorded. Examples of the applications include: • voice interactive systems to support telephone services like collect calls, third-party billing, or rate inquiries • database information retrieval services that might provide schedule or availability information about transportation or other public services in a limited semantic domain • systems for ordering theater or stadium tickets, or for making medical or other appointments • systems for manipulating bank accounts or other financial resources."]},{"title":"I.I. Goal","paragraphs":["The goal of the Macrophone project was to provide a basic set of common spoken material suitable for training and evaluation of speech recognition systems for telephone-based applications, particularly those that use names, places, times, and numbers in a North American context."]},{"title":"1.2.","paragraphs":["Sources","The material collected came from pools of prompt texts. Materials were selected from these pools automatically and combined into a prompting sheet that is mailed to a person. In the Macrophone corpus, 45 responses were solicited on each sheet. Of the 45 responses, 34 were read and 11 were spontaneous. The prompt material for the spontaneous utterances was designed to elicit particular responses or types or ranges of responses.

Spontaneous There were 11 prompts in the interaction that solicited spontaneous speech. Of these, ten were fixed and one was rotating. Some of the fixed questions provided additional demographic information about the speaker. Five of the fixed questions were designed to elicit an answer of yes or no. Six of the fixed questions were printed on each sheet: Are you ready to start7 (y/n) Are you calling from your home phone? (y/n) Do you speak any language besides English at home? (y/n) Please name a major city in your state. Would you be willing to participate in another study like this one?(y/n) We would appreciate any comments you may have about this","recording session. Please record your comments. The four unpfinted questions were: Are you using a cordless phone? (y/n) What is today's date? What time is it now? What is your date of birth? The rotating question was taken from the set: Please say any number from 1 to 100. Please say any number from one thousand to one million. What is your house number?

Dialogie hardware resident in an IBM-compatible PC provided a digital connection to 10 telephone lines that are available toll-free to callers. The Dialogie/PC system concentrated the data and sent it to the disk of a small Sun Microsystems SPARCstation. As convenient, the data was moved to an archive disk from which the data was archived onto Exabyte tapes and pressed onto CD-ROMs for further manipulation. The labor-intensive part of the Macrophone corpus development was the transcription and verification of the spoken material. This was performed with special-purpose software running on Sun ELCs."]},{"title":"2.3. Time and Resources Used","paragraphs":["The design and selection of material, set up and monitoring of the telephone collection system, the verification/transcription of the utterances, and finally the delivery of the resultant files took about seven months of professional labor and about eight months of semi-skilled labor. After the linguistic material had been decided upon, the project yielded 200,000 utterance files with verified transcriptions and demographic headers in five calendar months."]},{"title":"2.4. Material Distribution","paragraphs":["The data collection process began with the distribution of the material to prospective callers. The material was presented in the form of unique prompting sheets to guide the caller through the telephone interaction. The sheets were designed following a fixed format, but provide different read material. Each prompting sheet contained a different set of read material, and each caller received a different sheet.

Since no incentive was offered for placing the call, a conservative estimate of a 25% response rate was used.","Twenty thousand (20,000) prompting sheets were mailed, which resulted in 6700 calls, at a 33% response rate. The sheets were sent out as six separate mailings of 1000, 2000, 5000, 5000, 5000, and 2000 at approximately one-week intervals.","Calls typically started coming in the day following a mailing and peaked three days after a mailing.

The target population was also specified to be gengraphieally balanced according to the latest census figures. The sample population was selected by the market research firm to compensate for different expected response rates.

As a half duplex system, the data collection system was only capable of either playing out a prompt or recording a response.

The sheet identifier was in the form of a 10-digit telephone number and was transcribed in a first pass along with three other responses. These items were then propagated to the headers of all 45 speech files produced from that call. In addition to the demographic responses, a gender indication was included (decision made by the transcriber). The demographic information items are responses to the following prompts:","Do you speak any language besides English at home?","Are you using a cordless phone?","What is your date of birth?","The second step of data verification involved providing an orthographic transcription of each utterance. Each utterance waveform was displayed on the transcriber's console and played through the computer's audio port. Default transcriptions were provided for read data, previously transcribed demographic ,d, ata, and predictable responses to spontaneous questions such as' Are you :ready to start?\", \"What is today's date?\", \"Would you be willing to participate in another study like this one?\".","Utterance files which did not contain any speech or contained truncated speech (approximately 7.5% of the total) were discarded. Utterances which were difficult to transcribe -- those containing word fragments, mispronunciations, and other disflueneies -- were set aside for a linguist to review.
