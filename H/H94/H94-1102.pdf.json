Paul, Principal Investi#ators Lincoln Laboratory, MIT Lexington, Ma. 02173-9108 PROGRAM GOALS","paragraphs":["The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high performance continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques focussed on application in Spoken Language Systems (SLS) which will enhance the effectiveness of military and civilian computer-based systems. A key complementary objective is to define and develop applications of robust speech recognition and understanding systems, and to help catalyze the transition of spoken language technology into military and civilian systems, with particular focus on application of robust CSR to mobile military command and control. The research effort focusses on developing advanced acoustic modelling, rapid search, and recognition-time adaptation techniques for robust large-vocabulary CSR, and on applying these techniques to the new ARPA large-vocabulary CSR corpora and to military application tasks."]},{"title":"BACKGROUND","paragraphs":["The Lincoln program began with s focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighter aircraft environment. A robust HMM isolated-word recognizer (IWR) was developed with very high performance under stress conditions. The robust HMM techniques were then developed and extended to large-vocabulary CSR with state-of-the-art performance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speakerindependent (SI) tasks on the ARPA resource management (RM) database.","More recently, the HMM CSR has been extended to tasks with much larger vocabularies (5,000 - 64,000 words) and higher perplexities (50 - 250) with focus on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. Improved acoustic modelling techniques for the tied-mixture CSR have been developed and applied, including multiple observation streams, semiphone models, sex- dependent acoustic models, cross-word triphone models, and improved duration modelling. For the large-vocabulary tasks, the Lincoln HMM CSR has been converted to use a stack decoder search algorithm with integrated acoustic fast match and detailed match algorithms.","*This work was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency.
