INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["When automated part of speech tagging was initially explored [Klein and Simmons 63, Harris 62], people manually engineered rules for tagging, sometimes with the aid of a corpus. As large corpora became available, it became clear that simple Markov-model based stochastic taggers that were automatically trained could achieve high rates of tagging accuracy [Jelinek 85]. These stochastic taggers have a number of advantages over the manually built taggers, including obviating the need for laborious manual rule construction, and possibly capturing useful information that may not have been noticed by the human engineer. However, stochastic taggers have the disadvantage that linguistic information is only captured indirectly, in large tables of statistics. Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part of speech taggers has been on further exploring Markov-model based tagging [Jetinek 85, Church 88, DeRose 88, DeMarcken 90, Merialdo 91, Cutting et al. 92, Kupiec 92, Charniak et al. 93, Weischedel et al. 93]. 1 In [Brill 92], a trainable rule-based tagger is described","*This research was supported by ARPA under contract N00014-89-J-1332, monitored through the Office of Naval Research.","1Markov-model based taggers assign a sentence the tag sequence that maximizes Prob(word[tag) * Prob(taglprevious n tags)."]},{"title":"256 2. TRANSFORMATION-BASED ERROR-DRIVEN LEARNING","paragraphs":["Transformation-based error-driven learning has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part of speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing [Brill 92, Brill 93, Brill 93a]. A similar approach is being explored for machine translation [Su et al. 92]. Figure 1 illustrates the learning process. First, unannotated text is passed through the initial-state annotator. The initial-state annotator can range in complexity from assigning random structure to assigning the output of a so-phisticated manually created annotator. Once text has been passed through the initial-state annotator, it is then compared to the truth, 3 and transformations are learned that can be applied to the output of the initial state annotator to make it better resemble the truth. In all of the applications described in this paper, the following greedy search is applied: at each iteration of learning, the transformation is found whose application resuits in the highest score; that transformation is then added to the ordered transformation list and the training corpus is updated by applying the learned transformation. To define a specific application of transformation-2The programs described in this paper are freely available. 3As specified in a manually annotated corpus."]},{"title":"UNANNOTATEDTExT I STATE ANNO~TAJD I TRUTH","paragraphs":["RULES Figure 1: Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning. based learning, one must specify the following: (1) the start state annotator, (2) the space of transformations the learner is allowed to examine, and (3) the scoring function for comparing the corpus to the"]},{"title":"lrulh","paragraphs":["and choos-ing a transformation. Once an ordered list of transformations is learned, new text can be annotated by first applying the initial state annotator to it and then applying each of the learned transformations, in order. 3. AN EARLIER ATTEMPT The original tranformation-based tagger [Brill 92] works as follows. The start state annotator assigns each word its most likely tag as indicated in the training corpus. The most likely tag for unknown words is guessed based on a number of features, such as whether the word is capitalized, and what the last three letters of the word are. The allowable transformation templates are: Change tag a to tag b when: 1. The preceding (following) word is tagged z. 2. The word two before (after) is tagged z. 3.

To learn a transformation, the learner in essence applies every possible transformation, a counts the number of tagging errors after that transformation is applied, and chooses that transformation resulting in the greatest error reduction. 5 Learning stops when no transformations can be found whose application reduces errors beyond some prespecified threshold. An example of a transformation that was learned is: change the tagging of a word from noun to verb if the previous word is tagged as a modal. Once the system is trained, a new sentence is tagged by applying the start state annotator and then applying each transformation, in turn, to the sentence. 4.

Many useful relationships, such as that between a word and the previous word, or between a tag and the following word, are not directly captured by Markov-model based taggers. The same is true of the earlier transformation-based tagger, where transformation templates did not make reference to words. To remedy this problem, the transformation-based tagger was extended by adding contextual transformations that could make reference to words as well as part of speech tags. The transformation templates that were added are: Change tag a to tag b when: 1. The preceding (following) word is w. 2. The word two before (after) is w. 3.

Since as is most frequently tagged as a preposition in the training corpus, the start state tagger will mistag the phrase as ~all as as:","as/preposition tall/adjective as/preposition The first lexicalized transformation corrects this mistagging. Note that a stochastic tagger trained on our training set would not correctly tag the first occurrence of as. Although adverbs are more likely than prepositions to follow some verb form tags, the fact that P(aslprcposition ) is much greater than P(as[adverb), and P(adjectiveIpreposition ) is much greater than P(adjective]adverb) lead to as being incorrectly tagged as a preposition by a stochastic tagger. A trigram tagger will correctly tag this collocation in some instances, due to the fact that P(preposition[adverb adjective) is greater than P(prepositionlpreposition adjective), but the outcome will be highly dependent upon the context in which this collocation appears. The second transformation arises from the fact that when a verb appears in a context such as We do n'~ __ or We did n't usually ___, the verb is in base form.

In [Weischedel et al. 93], results are given when training and testing a Markov-model based tagger on the Penn Treebank Tagged Wall Street Journal Corpus. They cite results making the closed vocabulary assumption that all possible tags for all words in the test set are known. When training contextual probabilities on 1 million words, an accuracy of 96.7% was achieved. Accuracy dropped to 96.3% when contextual probabilities were trained on 64,000 words. We trained the transformation-based tagger on 600,000 words from the same corpus, making the same closed vocabulary assumption, 9 and achieved an accuracy of 97.2% on a separate 150,000 word test set. The transformation-based learner achieved better performance, despite the fact that contextual information was captured in only 267 simple nonstochastic rules, as opposed to 10,000 contextual probabilities that were learned by the stochastic tagger. To see whether lexicalized transformations were contributing to the accuracy rate, we ran the exact same test using the tagger trained using the earlier transformation template set, which contained no transformations making reference to words. Accuracy of that tagger was 96.9%. Disallowing lexicalized transformations resulted in an 11% increase in the error rate. These results are summarized in table 1.","9In both [Weischedel et al. 93] and here, the test set was incorporated into the lexicon, but was not used in learning contextual information.

We have done so for three reasons (We show results when unknown words are included later in the paper): (1) to allow for a comparison with previously quoted results, (2) to isolate known word accuracy from unknown word accuracy, and (3) in some systems, such as a closed vocabulary speech recognition system, the assumption that all words are known is valid."]},{"title":"258","paragraphs":["When transformations are allowed to make reference to words and word pairs, some relevant information is probably missed due to sparse data. we are currently exploring the possibility of incorporating word classes into the rule-based learner in hopes of overcoming this problem.

In khe original formulation of the rule-based tagger, a rather ad-hoc algorithm was used to guess the most likely tag for words not appearing in the training corpus. To try to improve upon unknown word tagging accuracy, we built a transformation-based learner to learn rules for more accurately guessing the most likely tag for words not seen in the training corpus. If the most likely tag for unknown words can be assigned with high accuracy, then the contexual rules can be used to improve accuracy, as described above.
