Boston, MA 02215 Cambridge, MA 02138","ABSTRACT This paperintroduces a simple mixtare language model that attempts to capture long distance conslraints in a sentence or paragraph. The model is an m-component mixture of Irigram models. The models were constructed using a 5K vocabulary and trained using a 76 million word Wail Street Journal text corpus. Using the BU recognition system, experiments show a 7% improvement in recognition accuracy with the mixture trigram models as compared to using a Irigram model. 1. INTRODUCTION The overall performance of a large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer is greatly impacted by the constraints imposed by a language model, or the effective constraints of a stochastic language model that provides the a priori probability estimates of the word sequence P(wz,...,wr). The most commonly used statistical language model assumes that the word sequence can be described as a high order Marker process, typically referred to as an n-gram model, where the probability of a word sequence is given by: T","P(w , .... = O) i=I The standard n-gram models that are commonly used are the bigram (n = 2) and the trigram (n = 3) models, where n is limited primarily because of insufficient training data. However, with such low order dependencies, these models fail to take advantage of 'long distance constraints' over the sentence or paragraph. Such long distance dependencies may be grammatical, as in verb tense agreement or singnlar/pinral quantifier-noun agreement. Or, they may also be a consequence of the inhomogeneous nature of language; different words or word sequences are more likely for particular broad topics or tasks. Consider, for example, the following respouses made by the combined BU-BBN recognition system on the 1993 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) benchmark H1-C1 (20K) test: REF: the first recipient joseph webster junior ** ****** a PHI BETA KAPPA chemistry GRAD who plans to take courses this fall in ART RELIGION **** music and political science HYP: the first recipient joseph webster junior HE FRI-DAY a CAP OF ***** chemislzy GRANT who plans to take comes this fall in AREN'T REALLY CHIN music and pofitical science REF: *** COCAINE doesn't require a SYRINGE THE symbol of drug abuse and CURRENT aids risk YET can be just as ADDICTIVE and deadly as HEROIN HYP: THE KING doesn't require a"]},{"title":"STRANGE","paragraphs":["A symbel of drug abuse and TRADE aids risk IT can be just as ADDICTED and deadly as CHAIRMAN In the first example, \"art\" and \"refigion\" make more sense in the context of \"courses\" than \"aren't really"]},{"title":"chin\",","paragraphs":["and similarly \"heroin\" should be more likely than \"chairman\" in the context of \"drug abuse\". The problem of representing long-distance dependencies has been explored in other stochastic language models, though they tend to address only one or the other of the two is-sues raised here, i.e. either sentence-level or task-level dependence. Language model adaptation (e.g. [1, 2, 3]) addresses the problem of inhomogeneity of n-gram statistics, but mainly represents task level dependencies and does little to account for dependencies within a sentence. A context-free grammar could account for sentenco level dependencies, but it is costly to build task-specific grammars as well as costly to implement in recognition. A few automatic learning techniques, which are straight-forward to apply to new tasks, have been investigated for designing static models of long term dependence.

Other efforts include models that integrate n-grams with context-free grammars (e.g., [5, 6, 7]). Our approach to representing long term dependence attempts to address both issues, while still using a very simple model. We propose to use a mixture of n-gram language models, but unlike previous work in mixture language modeling our mixture components are combined at the sentence level. The component n-grams enable us to capture topic dependence, while using mixtures at the sentence level captures the notion that topics do not change mid-sentence. Like the model proposed by Kneser and Stcinbiss [8], our language model uses m component language models, each of which can be identified with the n-gram statistics of a speeific topic or broad class 82 of sentences. However, unlike [8], which uses mixtures at the n-gram level with dynamically adapted mixture coefficients, we use sentence-level mixtures to capture within-sentcnce dependencies. Thus, the probability of a word sequence is the weighted combination: m T -- Ak"]},{"title":"n","paragraphs":["k=l i=1"]},{"title":"(2)","paragraphs":["Our approach has the advantage that it can be used either as a static or a dynamic model, and can easily leverage the techniques that have been developed for e~ptive language modeling, particularly cache [1, 9] and trigger [2, 3] models. One might raise the issue of recognition search cost for a model of mixtures at the sentence level, but in the N-best rescoring framework [10] the additional cost of the mixture language model is minimal. The general framework and mechanism for designing the mixture language model will be described in the next section, including descriptions of automatic topic clustering and robust.estimation techniques. Following this discussion, we will present some experimental results on mixture language modeling obtained using the BU recognition system. Finally, the paper will conclude with a discussion of the possible extensions of mixture language models, to dynamic language modeling and to applications other than speech transcription. 2. MIXTURE LANGUAGE MODEL 2.1. General Framework The sentence-level mixture language model was originally motivated by an observation that news stories (and certainly other domains as well) often reflect the characteristics of different topics or sub-domains, such as sports, finance, national news and local news. The likelihood of different words or n-grams could be very different in different sub-domains, and it is unlikely that one would switch sub-domains mid-sentence. A model with sentence-level mixtures of topic-dependent component models would address this problem, but the model would be more general ff it also allowed for n-gram level mixtures within the components (e.g. for robust estimation). Thus, we propose a model using mixtures at two levels: the sentence and the n-gram level. Using trigram components, this model is described by m T k=l i---1 +(1 -"]},{"title":"Ok)P1(w, lwi-1,","paragraphs":["w,-2)], (3) where k is an index to the particular topic described by the component language model Pk(']'), PI(-]') is a topic-independent model that is interpolated with the topic-dependent model for purposes of robust estimation or dynamic language model adaptation, and At and 0k are the sentence-level and n-gram level mixture weights, respectively. (Note that the component-dependent term Pk (toi Item_ 1, w~-2) could itself be a mixtme.) Two important aspects of the model are the definition of \"'topics\" and robust parameter estimation. The m component distributions of the language model correspond to different \"topics\", where topic can mean any broad class of sentences, such as subject area (as in the examples given above) or verb tense. Topics can be specified by hand, according to text labels ff they are available, or by heuristic rules associated with known characteristics of a task domain. Topics can also be determined automatically, which is the approach taken here, using any of a variety of clustering methods to initialiTc the component models. Robust parameter estimation is another important issue in mixture language modeling, because the process of partitioning the d,tA into topic-dependent subsets reduces the amount of training available to estimate each component language model. These two issues, automatic clnstering for topic initialization and robust parameter estimation, are described further in the next two subsections. 2.2. Clustering Algorithm Since the standard WSJ language model training d~t~ does not have topic labels associated with the text, it was necessary to use automatic clustering to identify natural groupings of the d~t~ into \"topics\". Because of its conceptual simplicity, agglomerative clustering is used to partition the training dAt. intO the desired number of clusters. The clustering is at the paragraph level, relying on the assumption that an entire paragraph comes from a single topic. Each paragraph begins as a singleton cluster. Paragraph pairs are then progressively grouped into clusters by computing the similarity between clusters and grouping the two most similar clusters. The basic clustering algorithm is as follows:","1. Let the desired number of clusters be C* and the initial number of clusters C be the number of singleton da!~ samples, or paragraphs.","2. Find the best matched clusters, say Ai and Aj, to minimize the similarity criterion S~. 3. Merge Ai and Aj and decrement C.","4. If current number of clusters C = C*, then stop; otherwise go to Step 2. At the end of this stage, we have the desired number of partitions of the training datz: To save computation, we run agglomerative clustering first on subsets of the dnt~; and then continue by agglomerating resulting clusters into a final set of m clusters. 83 A variety of similarity measures can be envisioned. We use a normalized measure of the number of content words in common between the two clusters. (Paragraphs comprise both function words (e.g. is, that, bu0 and content words (e.g stocks, theater, trading), but the function words do not contribute towards the identification of a paragraph as belonging to a particular topic so they are ignored in the similarity criterion.) Letting"]},{"title":"Ai be the","paragraphs":["set of unique content words in cluster"]},{"title":"i, lAd the","paragraphs":["number of elements in"]},{"title":"Ai, and Ni the","paragraphs":["number of paragraplas in cluster i, then the specific measure of similarity of two clusters i and j is","&~ = Ni~ I& n At[ I& u Ail ' (4) where"]},{"title":"/ N, + = (5)","paragraphs":["is a normalization factor used to avoid the tendency for small clusters to group with one large cluster rather than other small clusters. At this point, we have only experimented with a small number of clusters, so it is difficult to see coherent topics in them. However, it appears that the current models are putting news related to foreign affairs (politics, as well as travel) into one cluster and news relating to finance (stocks, prices, loans) in another."]},{"title":"2.3. Parameter Estimation","paragraphs":["Each component model is a conventional n-gram model. Initial n-gram estimates for the component models are based on the partitions of the training data, obtained by using the above clustering algorithm. The initial component models are estimated separately for each cluster, where the Witten-Bell back-off [11] is used to compute the probabilities of n-grams not observed in training, based on distributing a certain amount of the total probability mass among unseen n-grams. This method was chosen based on the results of [12] and our own comparative experiments with different back-off methods for WSJ n-gram language models. The parameters of the component models can be re-estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [13]. However, since the EM algorithm was computationally intensive, an it-erative re-labeling re-estimation technique was used. At each iteration, the training data is re-partitioned, by re-labeling each utterance according to which component model maximizes the likelihood of that utterance. Then, the component n-gram statistics are re-computed using the new subsets of the training data, again using the Witten-Bell back-off technique. The iterations continue until a steady state size for the clusters is reached. Since the component models are built on partitioned training data, there is a danger of them being undertrained. There are two main mechanisms we have explored for robust parameter estimation, in addition to using standard back-off techniques. One approach is to include a general model"]},{"title":"PG","paragraphs":["trained on all the data as one of the mixture components. This approach has the advantage that the general model will be more appropriate for recognizing sentences that do not fall clearly into any of the topic-dependent components, but the possible disadvantage that the component models may be underutilized because they are relatively undertrained. An alternative is to interpolate the general model with each component model at the n-gram level, but this may force the component models to be too general in order to allow for unforeseen topics. Given these trade-offs, we chose to implement a compromise between the two approaches, i.e. to include a general model as one of the components, as well as some component level smoothing via interpolation with a general model. Specifically, the model is given by T"]},{"title":"P(w,,...,wT)---- ~ ~k I~(okPk(wilwi-,,wl-2)","paragraphs":["k=I,...,C,G i=1 +(1 -"]},{"title":"Ok)Pa,(wilwi-l,wi-2))","paragraphs":["(6) where"]},{"title":"Pa,","paragraphs":["is a general model (which may or may not be the same as"]},{"title":"Pa),","paragraphs":["{Ak} provide weights for the different topics, and {Ok } serve to smooth the component models.

In this formalism, the BYBLOS system, a speaker-independent Hidden Markov Model System [14] 1, is used to compute the top N sentence hypotheses of which the top 100 are subsequently rescored by the SSM. A five-pass search strategy is used to generate the N-best hypotheses, and these are re.scored with thirteen state HMMs. A weighted combination of scores from different knowledge sources is used to re-rank the hypotheses and the top ranking hypothesis is used as the recognized output. The weights for recombination are estimated on one test set (in this case the 93 H2 development test data) and held fixed for all other test sets.","No. of % Word","components error Perplexity 1 7.3 118 5 7.1 116 8 7.2 114 Table 1: Dependence on number of components: evaluation on the '93 ARPA 5k WSJ development test set.

All language models were estimated from the same training a,!8: The results show a 7% reduction in error rate on the evaluation test set, comparing the combined language models to the BBN trigram. It is interesting that the combination of the trigram and the mixture model yielded a small improvement in performance (not significant, but consistent across lest sets), since the trigram is a component of the mixture model. The difference between the mixture model and the two combined models corresponds to a linear vs. non-linear combination of component probabilities, respectively. For reference, we also include the best case system performance, which corresponds the the case where all acoustic and language model scores. Even with all the acoustic model scores, adding the mixture language model improves performance, giving a best case result of 5.3% word error on the '93 5k WSJ evalnnt_ion lest set. We conducted a series of experiments in the rescoring paradigm to assess the usefulness of the mixture model. Unless otherwise noted, the only acoustic model score used was based on the stochastic segment model. The language model scores used varied with the experiments.

The model is actually a two-level mixture model, with separate mixture weights at the n-gram and sentence levels. Training involves either automatic clustering or heuristic rule, s to determine the initial topic-dependent models, and an iterative algorithm for estimating mixture-weights at the different levels. Recognition experiments on the WSJ task showed a significant improvement in the accuracy for the BU-SSM recognition system. This work can be extended in several ways. First, time limitations ,did not permit us to explore the use of the complete EM algorithm for estimating mixture components and weights jointly, ~xid we hope to investigate that approach in the future. In addition, it may be useful to consider other metrics for automatic topic clustering, such as a word count weighted by inverse document frequencies or a multinomial distribution assumption with a likelihood clustering criterion. Of course, it would also be interesting to see ff further performance gains could be achieved with more clusters. Much more could also be done in the area of robust parameter estimation. For example, one could use an n-gram part-of-speech sequence model as the base for all component models and topic-dependent word likelihoods given the part-of-speech label, a natural extension of [16]. Dynamic language model adaptation, which makes use of the previous document history to tune the language model to that particular topic, can easily fit into the mixture model framework in two ways. First, the sentence-level mixture weights can be adapted according to the likelihood of the respective mixture components in the previous utterance, as in [8] for n-gram level mixture weights. Second, the dynamic n-gram cache model [I, 9] can easily be incorporated into the mixture language model. However, in the mixture model, it is possible to have component-dependent cache models, where each component cache would be updated after each sentence according to the likelihood of that component given the recognized word string. Trigger models [2, 3] could also be component dependenL The simple static mixture language model can also be useful in applications other than continuous speech transcription. For example, topic -dependent models could be used for topic spotting. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the notion of topic need not be related to subject area, it can be related to speaking style or speaker goal. In the ATIS task, for example, the goal of the speaker (e.g. flight information request, respouse clarification, error correction) is likely to be reflected in the language of the utterance. Representing this structure explicitly has the double benefit of improving recognition performance and providing information for a dialog model. From a cursory look at our recognition errors from the recent WSJ benchmark tests, it is clear that topic-dependent models will not be enough to dramatically reduce word error rate. Out-of-vocabulary words and function words also represent a major source of errors. However, an important advantage of this framework is that it is a simple extension of existing language modeling techniques that can easily be integrated with other language modeling advances.
