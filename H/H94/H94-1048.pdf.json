For this example, a human annotator's attachment decision, which for our purposes is the \"correct\" attachment, is to the noun phrase. We present in this paper methods for constructing statistical models for computing the probability of attachment decisions. These models could be then integrated into scoring the probability of an overall parse. We present our methods in the context of prepositional phrase (PP) attachment. Earlier work [11 ] on PP-attachment for verb phrases (whether the PP attaches to the preceding noun phrase or to the verb phrase) used statistics on co-occurences of two bigrams: the main verb (V) and preposition (P) bigram and the main noun in the object noun phrase (N1) and preposition bigram. In this paper, we explore the use of more features to help in modeling the distribution of the binary PP-attachment decision. We also describe a search procedure for selecting a \"good\" subset of features from a much larger pool of features for PP-attachment. Obviously, the feature search cannot be","* Jeff Reynar, from University of Pennsylvania, worked on this project as a summer student at I.B.M. guaranteed to be optimal but appears experimentally to yield a good subset of features as judged by the accuracy rate in making the PP-attachment decisons. These search strategies can be applied to other attachment decisions. We use data from two treebanks: the IBM-Lancaster Treebank of Computer Manuals and the University of Pennsylvania WSJ treebank. We extract the verb phrases which include PP phrases either attached to the verb or to an object noun phrase. Then our model assigns a probability to either of the possible attachments. We consider models of the exponential family that are derived using the Maximum Entropy Principle [1].

Given a binary class hierarchy, we can associate a bit string with every word in the vocabulary. Then, by querying the value of certain bit positions we can constmct binary questions. For example, we can ask whether about a bit position for any of the four head words, e.g., Bit 5 of Preposition == i. We discuss be-low a richer set of these questions. Features comprised solely of questions about class bits are denoted as \"class\" features, and features containing questions about both class bits and words are denoted as \"mixed\" features 1. Before discussing, feature selection and construction, we give a brief overview of the mutual information clustering of words. Mutual Information Bits Mutual information clustering, as described in [10], creates a a class \"tree\" for a given vocabulary. Initially, we take the C most frequent words (usually 1000) and assign each one to its own class. We then take the (C + 1)st word, assign it to its own class, and merge the pair of classes that minimize the loss of average mutual information. This repeats until all the words in the vocabulary have been exhausted. We then take our C classes, and use the same algorithm to merge classes that minimize the loss of mutual information, until one class remains. If we trace the order in which words and classes are merged, we can form a binary tree whose leaves consists of words and whose root is the class which spans the entire vocabulary. Consequently, we uniquely identify each word by its path from the root, which 1 See Table 7 for examples of features"]},{"title":"251","paragraphs":["can be represented by a string of binary digits.

Feature Search The search problem here is to find an optimal set of features A4 for use in the ME model.

The results in Table 2 are achieved in the neighborhood of about 200 features. As can be seen in Figure 1, performance improves quickly as features are added and improves rather very slowly after the 60-th feature. The performance is fairly close for the various feature sets when a sufficient number of features are added. We also compared these results to a decision tree grown on the same 4 head-word events.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["The Maximum Entropy model predicts prepositional phrase attachment 10 percentage points less accurately than a tree-banker, but it performs comparably to a non-expert, assuming that only only the head words of the history are available in both cases. The biggest improvements to the ME model will come from better utilization of classes, and a larger history. Currently, the use of the mutual information class bits gives us a few percentage points in performance, but the ME model should gain more from other word classing schemes which are better tuned to the PP-attachment problem. A scheme in which the word classes are built from the observed attachment preferences of words ought to outperform the mutual information clustering method, which uses only word bigram distributions[10]."]},{"title":"254","paragraphs":["I Average Human I 77-3% ] ME Model 83.5% Table 7: Average Performance of Human & ME Model on 200 Events of Computer Manuals Data Secondly, the ME model does not use information contained in the rest of the sentence, although it is apparently useful in predicting the attachment, as evidenced by a 5% average gain in the treebankers' accuracy. Any implementation of this model using the rest of the sentence would require features on other words, and perhaps features on the sentence's parse tree structure, coupled with an efficient incremental search. Such improvements should boost the performance of the model to that of treebankers. Already, the ME model outperforms a decision tree confronted with the same task.
