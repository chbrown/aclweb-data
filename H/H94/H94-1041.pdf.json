Data were collected during three empirical studies in which people spoke or wrote to a highly interactive simulated system. The studies involved within-subject factorial designs in which input modality and presentation format were varied. Spoken disfluency rates during human-computer interaction were documented to be substantially lower than rates typically observed during comparable human-human speech. Two separate factors, both associated with increased planning demands, were statistically related to increased speech disfluency rates: (1) length of utterance, and (2) lack of structure in the presentation format. Regression techniques revealed that a linear model based simply on utterance length accounts for over 77% of the variability in spoken disfluencies. Therefore, design techniques capable of channeling users' speech into briefer sentences potentially could eliminate most spoken disfluencies. In addition, the degree of structure in the presentation format was manipulated in a manner that successfully elimluated 60 to 70% of all disfluent speech. The long-term goal of this research is to provide empirical guidance for the design of robust spoken language technology."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Recently, researchers interested in spoken language processing have begun searching for reliable methods to detect and correct disfluent input automatically during interactions with spoken language systems [2, 4, 9]. In general, this research has focused on identifying acoustic-prosodic cues for detect-ing self-repairs, either alone or in combination with syntactic, semantic, and pattern matching information. To date, however, possible avenues for simply reducing or eliminating disfluencies through manipulation of basic interface features have not been explored. Another underdeveloped but central theme in disfluency research is the relation between spoken disfluencies and planning demands. Although it is frequently claimed that disfluencies rise with increased planning demands of different kinds [3], the nature of this relation remains poorly understood. The major factors contributing to planning have yet","*This research was supported by Grant No. IRI-9213472 from the National Science Foundation, contracts from USWest, AT&T/NCR, and ATR International to SRI International, and equipment donations from Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Wacom Inc. to be identified and defined in any comprehensive manner, or linked to disfluencies and self-repairs. From the viewpoint of designing systems, information on the dynarnics of what produces disfluencies, and how to structure interfaces to minimize them, could improve the robust performance of spoken language systems. A related research issue is the extent to which qualitatively different types of speech may differ in their disfluency rates. That is, does the rate of spoken disfluencies tend to be stable, or variable? If variable, do disfluency rates differ systematically between human-human and human-computer speech? And are disfluency rates sufficiently variable that techniques for designing spoken language interfaces might exert much leverage in reducing them? To compare disfluency rates directly across different types of human-human and human-computer interactions, research needs to be based on comparable rate-per-word measures, the same definition of disfluencies and self-repairs, and so forth, in order to obtain meaningful comparisons. For the purpose of the present research, past studies by the author and colleagues [1, 6, 7] were reanalyzed: (1) to yield data on the rate of disfluencies for four different types of human-human speech, and (2) to conduct comparative analyses of whether human-human disfluencies .differ from human-computer ones. In addition, three simulation studies of human-computer interaction were conducted, which generated data on spoken and handwritten disfluencies. Apart from comparing disfluencies in different communication modalities, two separate factors associated with planning demands were examined. First, presentation format was manipulated to investigate whether degree of structure might be associated with disfluencies. It was predicted that a relatively unconstrained format, which requires the speaker to self-structure and plan to a greater degree, would lead to a higher rate of speech disfluencies. Second, the rate of disfluencies was examined in sentences of varying length. Spoken utterances graduated in length were compared to determine whether longer sentences have an elevated rate of disfluencies per word, since they theoretically require more planning. Finally, implications are outlined for designing future interfaces capable of substantially reducing disfluent input."]},{"title":"2.

Method","paragraphs":["Subjects, Tasks, and Procedure- Forty-four subjects participated in this research as paid volunteers. A UService 'l~ansaction System\" was simulated that could assist users with tasks that were either (1) verbal-temporal (e.g., conference registration or cax rental exchanges, in which proper names and scheduling information predominated), or (2) computational-numeric (e.g., personal banking or scientific calculations, in which digits and symbol/sign information predominated). During the study, subjects first received a general orientation to the Service Transaction System, and then were given practice using it to complete tasks. They received instructions on how to enter information on the LCD tablet when writing, speaking, and free to use both moralities. When speaking, subjects held a stylus on the tablet as they spoke. People also were instructed on completing tasks in two different presentation formats. In an unconstrained format, they expressed information in an open workspace, with no specific system prompts used to direct their speech or writing. People simply continued providing information while the system responded interactively with confirmations. For example, in this format they spoke digits, computational signs, and requested totals while holding their stylus on an open %cratch pad\" area of their LCD screen. During other interactions, the presentation format was explicitly structured, with linguistic and graphical cues used to structure the content and order of people's input as they worked. For example, in the verbal-temporal simulations, form-based prompts were used to elicit input (e.g., Car pickup location I 0, and in the computational-numeric simulation, patterned graphical layouts were used to elicit specific digits and symbols/signs. Other than specifying the input modality and format, an effort was made not to influence the manner in which people expressed themselves. People's input was received by an in-formed assistant, who performed the role of interpreting ~nd responding as a fully functional system would. Essentially, the assistant tracked the subject's written or spoken input, and clicked on predefined fields at a Sun SPARCstation to send confirmations back to the subject. Semi-Automatic Simulation Technique- In developing this simulation, an emphasis was placed on providing automated support for streamlining the simul~ttion to the extent needed to create facile, subject-paced interactions with deax feedback, and to have compaxable specifications for the different input modalities. In the present simulation environment, response delays averaged 0.4 second, with less than a 1-second delay in all conditions. In addition, the simulation was or-ganized to transmit analogues of human backchannel and propositional confirmations, with propositional-level combinations embedded in a compact transaction receipt. The simulation also was designed to be sufficiently automated so that the assistant could concentrate attention on monitor-ing the accuracy of incoming information, and on maintain-ing sufficient vigilance to ensure prompt responding. This semi-automation contributed to the fast pace of the simulation, and to a low rate of technical errors. Details of the simulation technique and its capabilities have been detailed elsewhere [8]. Research Design and Data Capture- Three studies were completed in which the research design was a completely crossed factorial with repeated measures. In all studies, the main factors of interest included: (1) communication modality - speech-only, pen-only, combined pen/voice, and (2) presentation format - form-based, unconstrained. The first two studies exmmined disfluencies during communication of verbal-temporal content. To test the generality of certain findings, a third study was conducted that compared disfluencies in computational-numeric content. In total, data were available from 528 tasks for analysis of spoken and written disfluencies. All human-computer interactions were videotaped. Hardcopy transcripts also were created, with the subject's handwritten input captured automatically, and spoken input transcribed onto the printouts. Transcript Coding- To summarize briefly, spontaneously occurring disfluencies and self-corrections were totaled for each subject and condition. The total number of disfluencies per condition then was converted to a rate per 100 words, and average disfluency rates were summaxized as a function of condition and utterance length. Disfluencies were classified into the following types: (1) content self-corrections- task-content errors that were spontaneously corrected as the subject spoke or wrote, (2) false starts-- alt~ations to the grammatical structure of an utterance that occurred spontaneously as the subject spoke or wrote, (3) verbatim repetitions-- retracings or repetitions of a letter, phoneme, syllable, word, or phrase that occurred spontaneously as the subject spoke or wrote, (4) frilled pauses-- spontaneous nonlexical sounds that frill pauses in running speech, which have no analogue in writing, (5) self-corrected sp~lllngs and abbreviations-- spontaneously corrected misspelled words or further specification of abbreviations, which occur in writing but have no analogue in speech."]},{"title":"2.2. Results","paragraphs":["Figure 1 summarizes the percentage of all spoken and written distiuencies representing different categories during communication of verbal-temporal content (i.e., studies 1 and 2). However, when people communicated digits (i.e., study 3), disfluencies representing the diiferent categories were distributed differently. Filled pauses dropped from 46% to 15.5% of all observed disfluencies. In contrast, content corrections of digits increased from 25% to 34%, repetitions increased from 21% to 31.5%, and false staxts increased from 8% to 19% of all disfluencies. This drop in frilled pauses and increase in other types of disfluency is niost likely related to the much briefer utterance lengths observed during the computational-numeric tasks. CCleaxly, the relative distribu-tion of different types of disfluency fluctuates with the content and structure of the information presented. The overall baseline rate of spontaneous disfluencies and self-corrections was 1.33 per 100 words in the verbal-ten~poral simulations, or a total of 1.51 disfluencies per task set.

Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests revealed no significant modality difference in the rate of disfluent input, which averaged 1.26 per 100 words for speech and 1.39 for writing, T+ = 75 (N = 17), z < 1. However, the rate of disfluencies was 1.68 per 100 words in the unconstrained format, in comparison with a reduced .98 per 100 words during form-based interactions. Followup analyses revealed no significant difference in the disfluency rate between formats when people wrote, T+ = 64.5 (N = 14), p > .20. However, significantly increased disfluencies were evident in the unconstrained format compared to the form-based one when people spoke, T+ = 88 (N = 14), p < .015, one-tailed.

For studies 1 and 2, disfluency rates were examined further for specific utterances that were graduated in length from 1 to 18 words. I First, these analyses indicated that the average rate of disfluencies per 100 words increased as a function of utterance length for spoken disfluencies, although not for written ones. When the rate of spoken disfluencies was compared for short (I-6 words), medium (7-12 words), and long utterances (13-18 words), it increased from 0.66, to 2.14, to 3.80 disfluencies per 100 words, respectively.

These analyses revealed that the rate of spoken disfluencies also was significantly higher in the unconstrained format than in form-based speech, even with utterance length controlled, t (paired) -- 2.42 (df = 5), p < .03, one-tailed. That is, independent of utterance length, lack of structure in the presentation format also was associated with elevated disfluency rates. From a pragmatic viewpoint, it also is informative to compare the total number of disfluencies that would require processing during an application. Different design alternatives can be compared with respect to effective reduction of total disfluencies, which then would require neither processing nor repair. In studies 1 and 2, a comparison of the total number of spoken disfiuencies revealed that people averaged 3.33 per task set when using the unconstrained format, which reduced to an average of 1.00 per task set when speaking to a form. That is, 70% of all disfluencies were eliminated by using a more structured form. Likewise, in study 3, the average number of disfluencies per subject per task set dropped from 1.75 in the unconstrained format to 0.72 in the structured one. In this simulation, a more structured presentation format successfully eliminated 59% of people's disfluencies as they spoke digits, in comparison with the same people completing the same tasks via an unconstrained format. During post-experimental interviews, people reported their preference to interact with the two different presentation formats. Results indicated that approximately two-thirds of the subjects preferred using the more structured format. This 2-to-1 preference for the structured format replicated across both the verbal and numeric simulations."]},{"title":"3.

One study focused on telephone speech, providing data on both: (1) two-person telephone conversations, and (2) three-person interpreted telephone conversations, with a professional telephone interpreter intermedinting. Methodological details of this study are provided elsewhere [7]. Essentially, within-subject data were collected from 12 native speakers while they participated in task-oriented dialogues about conference registration and travel arrangements. In the second study, also outlined elsewhere [1, 6], speech data were collected on task-oriented dialogues conducted in each of five different communication modalities. For the present comparison, data from two of these modalities were reanalyzed: (1) two-party face-to-face dialogues, and (2) single-party monologues into an audiotape machine. A between-subject design was used, in which 10 subjects described how to assemble a water pump. All four types of speech were reanalyzed from tape-recordings for the same categories of disfluency and self-correction as those coded during the simulation studies, and a rate of spoken disfluencies per 100 words was calculated."]},{"title":"3.2.

Of all the variance in spoken disfluencies in the first two studies, 77% was predictable simply by knowing an utterance's specific length. A linear model was provided, Y = -0.32 -F 0.26X, to summarize the predicted rate of spoken disiluencies as a function of utterance length. Knowledge of utterance length alone, therefore, is a powerful predictor of speech disfiuencies in human-computer interaction. Spoken disfluencies also are influenced substantially by the presentation format used during human-computer interaction. An unconstrained format, which required the speaker to self-structure and plan to a. greater degree, led speakers to produce over twice the rate of disfluencies as & more structured interaction. Furthermore, this format effect was replicated across unimodal and multimodal spoken input, and across qualitatively very different spoken content. Since the observed difference between formats occurred in samples matched for length, it is clear that presentation format and utterance length each exert an independent influence on spoken disfluency levels. In these three studies, a substantial 60 to 70% of all spoken disfluencies were eliminated simply by using a more structured format. That is, selection of presentation format was remarkably effective at channeling a speaker's language to be less disfluent. In part, this was accomplished by reducing sentential planning demands during use of the structured formats - i.e., reducing the need for people to plan the content and order of information delivered (see Oviatt, forthcoming [5]). It also was accomplished in part by the relative brevity of people's sentences in the structured formats. The percentage of moderate to long sentences increased from 5% of all sentences during structured interactions to 20% during unconstrained speech-- a 4-fold or 300% increase. In addition, whereas the average disfluency rate was only 0.66 for short sentences, this rate increased to 2.81 for sentences categorized as moderate or lengthy-- a 326% increase. The structured format not only was effective at reducing disfluencies, it also was preferred by a factor of 2-to-1. Wide variability can be expected in the disfluency rates typical of qualitatively different types of spoken language. Based on the six categories compared here, rates were found to vary by a magnitude of 2-to-11-fold between individual categories, with the highest rates occurring in telephone speech, and the lowest in human-computer interaction. This variability suggests that further categories of spoken language should be studied individually to evaluate how prone they may be to disfluencies, rather than assuming that the phenomenon is stable throughout spoken language. Future work explor-ing disfluency patterns during more complex multimodal exchanges will be of special interest. Finally, future work needs to investigate other major human-computer interface features that may serve to decrease planning load on users, and to estimate how much impact they have on reducing disfluencies. Such information would permit proactive system design aimed at supporting more robust spoken language processing. For future applications in which an unconstrained format is preferred, or disfluencies and selfrepairs otherwise are unavoidable, methods for correctly detecting and processing the ones that occur also will be required. To the extent that promising work on this topic can incorporate probabilistic information on the relative likelihood of a disfluency for a particular utterance (e.g., of length N), based on either the present or future predictive models, correct detection and judicious repair of actual disfluencies may become feasible."]},{"title":"5.
