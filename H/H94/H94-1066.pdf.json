The first algorithm, phone-dependent cepstral compensation, is similar in concept to the previously-described MFCDCN method, except that cepstral compensation vectors are selected according to the current phonetic hypothesis, rather than on the basis of SNR or VQ codeword identity. We also describe two procedures to accomplish adaptation of the VQ codebook for new environments, as well as the use of reduced-bandwidth f~equency analysis to process telephone-bandwidth speech. Use of the various compensation algorithms in consort produces a reduction of error rates for SPHINX-II by as much as 40 percent relative to the rate achieved with eepstral mean norrealization alone, in both development test sets and in the context of the 1993 ARPA CSR evaluations."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["A continuing problem with current speech recognition technology is that of lack of robustness with respect to environmental variability.

Applications such as speech recognition in automobiles, over telephones, on a factory floor, or outdoors demand an even greater degree of environmental robustness. In this paper we describe and compare the performance of a series of cepstrum-based procedures that enable the CMU SPHINX-II [8] speech recognition system to maintain a high level of recognition accuracy over a wide variety of acoustical environments. We also discuss the aspects of these algorithms that appear to have contributed most significantly to the success of the SPHINX-II system in the 1993 ARPA CSR evaluations for microphone independence (Spoke 5) and calibrated noise sources (Spoke 8). In previous years we described the performance of cepstral mapping procedures such as the CDCN algorithm, which is effective but fairly computationally costly [2]. More recently we discussed the use of eepstral highpass-filtering algorithms [such as the populax RASTA and cepstral-mean-normalization algorithms (CMN) [6]. These algorithms are very simple to implement but somewhat limited in effectiveness, and CMN is now part of baseline processing for the CMU and many other systems. In this paper we describe several new procedures that when used in consort can provide as much as an additional 40 percent improvement over baseline processing with CMN. These techniques include: • Phone-dependent cepstral compensation • Environmental interpolation of compensation vectors • Codebook adaptation • Reduced-band analysis for telephone-bandwidth speech. • Silence codebook adaptation In Sec. 2 we describe these compensation procedures in detail, and we examine their effect on recognition accuracy in Secs. 3 and 4."]},{"title":"2.

We close this section with brief description of reduced-bandwidth analysis and silence-codebook adaptation, which are very beneficial in processing telephone-bandwidth speech and speech recorded in the presence of strong background noise, respectively."]},{"title":"2.1.

At higher SNRs, the algorithm compensates for linear filtering, while at intermediate SNRs, they compensate for both of these effects.

Blind Environment Selection","paragraphs":["In several of the compensation procedures used, including MFCDCN, one of a set of environments must be selected as part of the compensation process. We considered three procedures for environment selection in our experiments. The first procedure, referred to as selection by compensation, applies compensation vectors from each possible environment successively to the incoming test utterance. The environment e is chosen that minimizes the average residual VQ distortion over the entire utterance. In the second approach, referred to as environmerit-specific VQ, environment-specific cookbooks are generated from the original uncompensated speech. By vector quantizing the test data using each environment-specific codebook in turn, the environment with the minimum VQ distortion is chosen. The third procedure, referred to as Gaassian environment classifier, models each environment with mixtures of Gaussian densities. Environ-ment selection is accomplished so that the test data has the highest probability from the corresponding classifier. ~ latter approach is similar to one proposed previously by BBN [7]. All three methods produce similar speech recognition accuracy."]},{"title":"2.3.

Estimation of PDCN compensation Vectors. In the current implementation of phone-dependent cepstral normalization (PDCN), we develop compensation vectors that are specific to individual phonetical events, using a base phone set of 51 phonemes, including silence but excluding other types of non-lexical events. This is accomplished by running the decoder in supervised mode using CLSTLK data and correction transcriptions. All CLSTLK utterances are divided into phonetic segments.

Reduced Bandwidth Analysis for Telephone Speech The conventional SPHINX-II system uses signal processing that extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) over an analysis range of 130 to 6800 Hz. This choice of analysis bandwidth is appropriate when the system processes speech recorded through goed-quality microphones such as the CLSTLK microphone. Nevertheless, when speech is recorded from telephone lines, previous research at CMU [9] indicates that error rates are sharply decreased when the analysis bandwidth is reduced. This is accomplished by performing the normal DFT analysis with the normal 16,000-Hz sampling rate, but only retaining DFT coefficients after the triangular frequency smothing from center frequencies of 200 to 3700 Hz.

We refer to the faster system as SPHINX-IIa in this paper. SPHINX-Ha differs from SPHINX-II in two ways: it uses a bigram grammar (rather than a trigram grammar) and it uses only one codebook (rather than 27 phone-dependent codebooks).
