INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["The Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) collects and transcribes telephone-speech data to enable research activities at CSLU and elsewhere. Corpus development a~ctivities are performed by four full-time staff, aided by graduate students and paxt-time employees. In 1994, we an-ticipate collecting and transcribing speech from 10,000 callers in twenty languages. Corpus development activities are supported by industrial memberships and research grants. Corpus development activities at CSLU include: (a) collecting telephone speech data in different languages; (b) transcribing speech at word and phonetic levels; (c) developing and documenting transcription conventions for each level; (d) measuring the level of agreement among transcribers; (e) developing interactive speech tools for labeling; (f) distributing the speech corpora to academic institutions free of charge; and (g) placing speech tools and labeling conventions in the public domain for use by others. In this section, we present some general information about our corpus development activities. In the following sections, we will describe individual corpora. Data Collection. telephone-speech data are collected over analog and digital telephone lines. Prior to November, 1993, speech data were collected over analog lines using several Gradient Technology Desldabs. Since November, 1993, the majority of our data has been collected using a 24 channel T1 line connected to three LINKON FC3000 Communica-tion Boards. We are also using an Apple GeoPort Telecom Adapter connected to a Macintosh Quadra A]V to collect analog speech data for one of the corpora to be described. aligned phonetic level. Non-time-aligned word level transcription involves producing an orthographic representation of the utterance, including indications of extra-speech events such as breathes or lip smacks, without time markings. Time-aligned word level transcription provides the same orthographic transcription augmented with time alignment markings. Time-aligned phonetic transcription involves aligning phonetic symbols to the acoustic signal. A precise description of the conventions used for all levels of labeling, including a complete list of all phonetic labels for each language, is presented in the CSLU conventions document[l] Transcription Reliability. We are conducting experiments to determine the level of agreement among labelers. In these experiments, CSLU staff and professional phoneticians axe using Worldbet [5] to transcribe the same intervals of speech. Initial results for English indicate overall agreement of approximately 80% across all labels, ranging from approximately 70% for vowels to greater than 90% for stops and nasals. Speech Tools. The OGI Speech Tools support data manipulation, analysis and display[2]. All corpus development activities are performed using these tools. They were developed at CSLU, then made portable and documented for distribution with support from NSF. The tools have been made available to the reseaxch community through anonymous ftp."]},{"title":"2. CORPORA","paragraphs":["The first three corpora described in this section are considered to be complete and are now available from CSLU. They were collected over an analog telephone line using a Gradient Technology Desldab connected via the SCSI port to a workstation. The data were digitized at 8000 samples per second with a 14 bit resolution. All data are stored in the NIST way file format, some with MIT shortpack compression. The remaining corpora are under development and estimated release dates are provided for each."]},{"title":"2.1. Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus","paragraphs":["Transcription. Each call is processed by one or more listeners. Calls are verified to determine that the caller followed instructions and in some cases, transcribed at some level. Transcription of corpora occurs at three different levels: non-time-aligned word level, time-aligned word level, and time The Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus [3] contains utterances from 3667 calls. Callers were solicited through computer newsgroups and a public relations campaign initiated by OGI. The majority of callers were from the Pacific Northwest. The proportion of male to female callers is 1.15 : 1."]},{"title":"31","paragraphs":["The goal was to collect samples of spoken English letters and spoken words to support a research project funded by U S WEST. Callers received the following prompts: • What city are you calling from? • What is your last name? • Please spell your last name. • Please spell your last name with short pauses between","letters. • Does your last name contain the letter A as in apple? • What is your first name? • Please spell your first name, with short pauses between","letters. • What city and state did you grow up in? • We will now ask you to say the alphabet.

Please","begin speaking now. • Would you like to receive more information about the results of this project? • If you would like more information about this project, #ease leave your name and address at the tone. Documentation of the Spelled and Spoken Name Corpus in-cludes a speaker-by-speaker log file containing orthographic transcriptions of each utterance. Each utterance was transcribed by two separate listeners. The log also contains the global judgments of gender, age, connection quality, accent, and intelligibility. In addition, occurrences of extraneous speech, environmental noise, excessive breath, or line noise are indicated in the log file for each utterance. A subset of the data was transcribed at the time-Migned phonetic level. The utterances were labeled by hand then labels and time-aLignments with the speech spectrogram were verified by an expert spectrogram reader. The subsets of phonetically labeled utterances available to date are as follows: • What is your native language? • What language do you speak most of the time? • Please recite the seven days of the week. • Please say the numbers zero through ten. • Tell us something that you like about your hometown. • Tell us about the climate in your hometown. • Describe the room that you are calling from. • Describe your most recent meal. In addition, unconstrained speech was obtained by asking callers to speak for 1 minute on any topic of their choice. Each utterance was listened to by a native speaker of the language to verify that the caller responded appropriately. The native speaker also made judgments concerning the caller's gender, the caller's age, and the line quality. The enhanced corpus is augmented with: (a) 200 Hindi calls; (b) speech files that were collected during the original collection but were not included in the original distribution; and (c) time-aligned phonetic transcriptions of over five hours of speech (up to 50 sec per call) in six languages--English, Japanese, German, Spanish, Hindi, and Mandarin. For the broad phonetic transcription, we have adopted the Worldbet labeling scheme, a set of orthographic symbols for multi-language transcription that correspond to IPA symbols [5]. The rationale for using Worldbet and the inventory of symbols for each language is provided in [1]."]},{"title":"2.3.

English Census Corpus","paragraphs":["In conjunction with the U.S. Bureau of the Census, CSLU is collecting data to develop a prototype automated census system. Callers were solicited by the Census Bureau; a memorandum was sent to regional offices asking Census Bureau employees, their family members and family friends to call an 800 number on a voluntary basis to provide speech data for the study. A different 800 number was provided for each city. The cities are Dallas, Chicago, Boston, Charlotte, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver, Kansas City, Detroit, and Seattle. Two protocols were used that differed in the wording of some of the prompts. Each protocol was recorded by both male and female speakers. In addition, male and female synthesized voices were used. Incoming calls were assigned to the eight conditions (prompt X gender X source) in rotation. An interesting feature of the data collection was the use of automatic recognition to control the protocol. Recognition of \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"other,\" and \"American Indian\" was performed at certain decision points to determine subsequent prompts. This is illustrated in the following protocol:","• Thank you for calling the OGI census project. We appreciate your help.
