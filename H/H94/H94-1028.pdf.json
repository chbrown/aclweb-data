Candide uses methods of information theory and statistics to develop a probability model of the translation process. This model, which is made to accord as closely as possible with a large body of French and English sentence pairs, is then used to generate English translations of previously unseen French sentences. This paper provides a tutorial in these methods, discussions of the training and operation of the system, and a summary of test results."]},{"title":"1. Introduction","paragraphs":["Candide is an experimental computer program, now in its fifth year of development at IBM, for translation of French text to Enghsh text. Our goal is to perform fuRy-automatic, high-quality text-to-text translation. However, because we are still far from achieving this goal, the program can be used in both fully-automatic and translator's-assistant modes. Our approach is founded upon the statistical analysis of language. Our chief tools axe the source-channel model of communication, parametric probability models of language and translation, and an assortment of numerical algorithms for training such models from examples. This paper presents el-ementary expositions of each of these ideas, and explains how they have been assembled to produce Caadide. In Section 2 we introduce the necessary ideas from information theory and statistics. The reader is assumed to know el-ementary probability theory at the level of [1]. In Sections 3 and 4 we discuss our language and translation models. In Section 5 we describe the operation of Candide as it translates a French document. In Section 6 we present results of our internal evaluations and the AB.PA Machine Translation Project evaluations. Section 7 is a summary and conclusion."]},{"title":"2. Statistical Translation","paragraphs":["Consider the problem of translating French text to English text. Given a French sentence f, we imagine that it was originally rendered as an equivalent Enghsh sentence e. To obtain the French, the Enghsh was transmitted over a noisy communication channel, which has the curious property that English sentences sent into it emerge as their French translations. The central assumption of Candide's design is that the characteristics of this channel can be determined experimentally, and expressed mathematically. *Current address: Renaissance Technologies, Stony Brook, NY","~ English-to-French I f e Channel \" _[ French-to-English -] Decoder 6 Figure 1: The Source-Channel Formalism of Translation. Here f is the French text to be translated, e is the putative original English rendering, and 6 is the English translation. This formalism can be exploited to yield French-to-English translations as follows. Let us write Pr(e I f) for the probability that e was the original English rendering of the French f. Given a French sentence f, the problem of automatic translation reduces to finding the English sentence that maximizes P.r(e I f). That is, we seek 6 = argmsx e Pr(e I f). By virtue of Bayes' Theorem, we have"]},{"title":"= argmax Pr(e If) = argmax Pr(f I e)Pr(e) (1)","paragraphs":["e e The term Pr(fle ) models the probability that f emerges from the channel when e is its input. We call this function the translation model; its domain is all pairs (f, e) of French and English word-strings. The term Pr(e) models the a priori probability that e was suppled as the channel input. We call this function the language model. Each of these factors--the translation model and the language model--independently produces a score for a candidate English translation e. The translation model ensures that the words of e express the ideas of f, and the language model ensures that e is a grammatical sentence. Candide sehcts as its translation the e that maximizes their product. This discussion begs two important questions. First, where do the models Pr(f[ e) and Pr(e) come from? Second, even if we can get our hands on them, how can we search the set of all English strings to find 6? These questions are addressed in the next two sections."]},{"title":"2.1. Probability Models","paragraphs":["We begin with a brief detour into probability theory. A probability model is a mathematical formula that purports to express the chance of some observation. A parametric model is a probability model with adjustable parameters, which can be changed to make the model better match some body of data. Let us write c for a body of data to be modeled, and 0 for a vector of parameters. The quantity Prs(c), computed according to some formula involving c and 0, is called the hkelihood"]},{"title":"157","paragraphs":["of c.

Consider the problem of"]},{"title":"training","paragraphs":["this parametric model to the data c; that is, adjusting the 0 to maximize Pr0(c). Finding the maximizing 0 is an exercise in constrained optimization. If the expression for Pr0(c) is of a suitable (simple) form, the maximizing parameter vector 0 can be solved for directly. The key elements of this problem are • a vector 0 of adjustable parameters,","• constraints on these parameters to ensure that we have a model, • a vector c of observations, and","• the adjustment of 0, subject to constraints, to maximize the likelihood Pr0(c). We often seek more than a probability model of some observed data c. There may be some hidden statistics h, which are related to c, but which are never directly revealed; in general h itself is restricted to some set 7f of admissible values. For instance, c may be a large corpus of grammatical text, and h an assignment of parts-of-speech to each of its words. model Pr(e). Consider the translation model. As any first-year language student knows, word-for-word translation of English to French does not work. The dictionary equivalents of the Enghsh words can move forward or backward in the sentence, they may disappear completely, and new French words may appear to arise spontaneously. Guided by this observation, our approach has been to write down an enormous parametric expression, Pr0(f I e), for the translation model. To give the reader some idea of the scale of the computation, there is a parameter, ~(/[e), for the probability that any given English word e will translate as any given French word f. There are parameters for the probability that any f may arise spontaneously, and that any e may simply disappear. There are parameters that words may move forward or backward 1, 2, 3, ... positions. And so on. We use a similar approach to write an expression for Pr0(e). In this case the parameters express things like the probability that a word e/may appear in a sentence after some word sequence eta2.., e~-t. In general, the parameters are of the form Pr(e/Iv), where the vector v is a combination of observable statistics like the identities of nearby words, and hidden statistics like the grammatical structure of the sentence. We refer to v as a"]},{"title":"historyd,","paragraphs":["from which we predict e¢. The parameter values of both models are determined by EM training. For the translation model, the training data consists of English-French sentence pairs (e, f), where e and f are translations of one another. For the language model, it consists exclusively of Enghsh text. In such cases, we proceed as follows. First we write down a parametric model Pr0(c, h). Then we attempt to adjust the parameter vector 0 to maximize the likelihood Pr0(c), where this latter is obtained as the sum ~he~ Pr0(c, h). Unfortunately, when we attempt to solve this more complicated problem, we often discover that we cannot find a closed-form solution for 0. Instead we obtain formulae that express each of the desired parameters in terms of all the others, and also in terms of the observation vector c.

Decoding","paragraphs":["We do not actually search the infinite set of all English word strings to find the 6 that maximizes equation (1). Even if we restricted ourselves to word strings of length h or less, for any realistic length and English vocabulary C, this is far too large a set to search exhaustively. Instead we adapt the well-known stack decoding algorithm [5] of speech recognition. Though we will say more about decoding in Section 6 below, most of our research effort has been devoted to the two modeling problems. This is not without reason. The translation scheme we have just described can fail in only two ways. The first way is a search error, which means that our decoding procedure did not yield the fi that maximizes Pr(f I e)Pr(e ). The second way is a modeling error, which means that the best English translation, as supplied by a competent human, did not maximize this same product.

But for shnplicity, we restrict ourselves to alignments in which each French word is connected to a unique English word. We cannot hope to discover alignments with certainty. Our strategy is to train a parametric model for the joint distribution Pr(f, a [ e), where the alignment a is hidden. In principle, the desired conditional Pr(f I e) may then be obtained as ~aPr(f, a le), where the sum is taken over all possible alignments of e and f.

For instance, two French words may be assigned to lie at the same position in the sentence. Words may be placed before the start of the sentence, or after its end. This model eliminates such spurious alignments. These five models are trained in succession on the same data, with the final parameter values of one model serving as the starting point for the next. For the current version of Candide, we used a corpus of 2,205,733 English-French sentence pairs, drawn mostly from the Hansards, which are the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. The entire computation took a total of approximately 3600 processor-hours distributed over fifteen IBM Model 530H POWERstations. The reader may be wondering why we have five translation models instead of one. This is because the EM algorithm, though guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, need not converge to a global one. A weakness of the algorithm is that it may yield a parameter vector 8 that is indeed a local maximum, but which does not model the data well. It so happens though that model 1 has a special form that ensures that EM training is guaranteed to converge to a global maximum. By using model l's final parameter vector as the initial vector for model 2, we are assured that we are at a reasonably good starting point for training the latter.

Both the English and the French analysis steps consist of five classes of operations: segmentation, name and number detection, case and spelling correction, morphological analysis, and linguistic normalization. During segmentation, the French is divided (if possible) into shorter phrases that represent distinct concepts. This does not modify the text, but the translation model, used later, respects this division by ignoring alignments that cross segment boundaries. During name and number detection, numbers and proper names--word strings such as Ethiopie, Grande Bretagne and $.85 era--are removed from the French text and replaced by generic name and number markers. Removing names and numbers greatly reduces the size of £ and .T. The excised texts are translated by rule and kept in a table, to be substituted back into the English sentence during synthesis. During case and spelling correction, we correct any obvious spelling errors, and suppress the case variations in word spellings that arise from the conventions of English and French typography. During morphological analysis, we first use a hidden Maxkov model [8] to assign part-of-speech labels to the French, then use these labels to replace inflected verb forms with their in-fiuitives, preceded by an appropriate tense marker. We also put nouns into singular form and precede them by number markers, and perform a variety of other morphological transformations. Finally, during linguistic normalization we perform a series of word reorderings, insertions and rewritings intended to regularize each language, and to make the two languages more closely resemble each other. For example, the contractions au and du are rewritten as d le and de le. Constructions such as il y a and he...pus are replaced with one-word tokens. The English possessive construction is made to resemble French by removing the's or 'sutfix, reordering noun phrases, and inserting an additional token. Thus my aunt's pen becomes intermediate English dummy-article pen's my aunt; note the similarity to the French le stylo de ma tante."]},{"title":"6. Operation of Candide","paragraphs":["In previous sections we have indicated how the parameters of Candide's various models are determined via the EM algorithm and ma~c_imum-entropy methods. We now outline the steps involved in the execution of Candide as it translates a French passage into English. The process of translation, divided into analysis, transfer, and synthesis stages, is depicted in Figure 3. In the analysis stage, the French input string f is converted into f~, as discussed above. The output of this stage is de-noted in Figure 3 as Intermediate French. The transfer stage constitutes the decoding process sketched in Section 2.2 above. Decoding consists of two steps. In the first step, Candide develops a set H* of candidate decodings, using coarse versions of our translation and language models to select its elements. In the second step, the system expands H* and rescores the enlarged set using more sophisticated models. We now describe both steps in greater detail. In the first step, Candide applies a variation of the stack decoding algorithm to generate candidate decodings. Decoding proceeds left-to-right, one intermediate English word at a time. At each stage we maintain a ranked set H (~) of partial hypotheses for the intermediate English ~. In general, the elements of H (~) are partial decodings of f~; that is, only the leading i words of ~t have been filled in, and these account for only some of the words of f~. To advance the decoding, some elements of H (i) are selected to be extended by one word. The translation and language models work together to generate the i + 1st word; the resulting partial decodings are ranked; this ranked set is H (~+l). An hypothesis is complete when all words of f~ have been accounted for. Note that while the intermediate English is generated left-to-right, the treatment of intermediate French words does not necessarily proceed left-to-right, due to the word-reordering property of the channel. This is one of the key ways that translation differs from speech--a difference that greatly complicates the decoding process. The ranking of hypotheses is according to the product Pr(f~ I e~)Pr(e~). In the interest of speed, and because we must deal with partial rather than complete sentences, we employ the EM-tralned translation model and the smoothed trigram language model. The output of this step is a ranked set H* of the 140 best intermediate English sentences. During the second step, called perturbation search, we enlarge H* by considering sequences of single-word deletions, insertions or replacements to its elements. Then we rerank the enlarged set using the link grammar language model and the maximum-entropy translation model. The highest-scoring intermediate English sentence that we encounter during perturbation search is the output ~ of the transfer stage. The final stage, synthesis, converts the intermediate English ~ into a plain English sentence ~."]},{"title":"7.

Summary","paragraphs":["We began with a review of the source-channel formalism of information theory, and how it may be applied to translation. Our approach reduces to formulating and training two parametric probability models: the language model Pr(e), and the translation model Pr(f I e). We described the structure of both models, and how they are trained. We explained the use of the analysis-transfer-synthesis paradigm, and sketched the system's operation. Finally, we gave performance results for Candide, in both its human-assisted and fully-automatic operating modes. In our opinion, the most promising avenues for exploration are: the continued elaboration of the link grammar language model, more sophisticated translation models, the maximum-entropy modeling technique, and a more systematic approach to French and English morphological and syntactic analysis.","References","1.
