The model is a piecewise nonfinear transformation appfied to the noisy speech feature. The transformation is a set of multidimensional linear least-squares filters whose outputs are combined using a conditional Gaussian model. The algorithm was tested using SRI's DECIPHER TM speech recognition system [1-5]. Experimental results show how the mapping is used to reduce recognition errors when the training and testing acoustic environments do not match. 1."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["In many practical situations an automatic speech recognizer has to operate in several different but well-defined acoustic environments. For example, the same recognition task may be implemented using different microphones or transmission channels. In this situation it may not be practical to recollect a speech corpus to train the acoustic models of the recognizer. To alleviate this problem, we propose an algorithm that maps speech features between two acoustic spaces. The models of the mapping algorithm are trained using a small database recorded simultaneously in both environments. In the case of steady-state additive homogenous noise, we can derive a MMSE estimate of the clean speech filterbank-log energy features using a model for how the features change in the presence of this noise [6-7]. In these algorithms, the estimated speech spectrum is a function of the global spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the instantaneous spectral SNR, and the overall spectral shape of the speech signal. However, after studying simultaneous recordings made with two microphones, we befieve that the relationship between the two simultaneous features is nonlinear. We therefore propose to use a piecewise-nonlinear model to relate the two feature spaces."]},{"title":"1.1. Related Work on Feature Mapping","paragraphs":["Several algorithms in the literature have focused on experimentally training a mapping between the noisy features and the clean features [8-13]. The proposed algorithm differs from previous algorithms in several ways:","• The MMSE estimate of the clean speech features in noise is trained experimentally rather than with a model as in [6, 7].","• Several frames are joined together similar to [13].","• The conditional PDF is based on a generic noisy feature not necessarily related to the feature that we are trying to estimate. For example, we could condition the estimate of the cepstral energy on the instantaneous spectral SNR vector. • Multidimensional least-squares filters are used for the mapping transformation. This exploits the correlation of the features over time and among components of the spectral ,features at the same time.","• Linear transformations are combined together without hard decisions.","• All delta parameters are computed after mapping the cepstrum and cepstral energy.","• The mapping parameters are trained using stereo recordings with two different microphones. Once trained, the mapping parameters are fixed.","• The algorithm can either map noisy speech features to clean features during training, or clean features to noisy features during recognition. 1.2. Related Work on Adaptation The algorithm used to map the incoming features into a more robust representation has some similarities to work on model adaptation. Some of the high-level differences between hidden Markov model (HMM) adaptation and the mapping algorithms proposed in this paper are:","• The mapping algorithm works by primarily correcting shifts in the mean of the feature set that are correlated with observable information. Adapting HMM model parameters has certain degrees of freedom that the mapping algorithm does not have- for example the ability to change state variances, and mixture weights.","• Two HMM states that have identical probability distributions and are not tied can have different distributions after adaptation. These distributions cannot be differentiated by mapping features.","• The mapping algorithms described in this paper are able to incoiporate many pieces of information that have been tra-"]},{"title":"336","paragraphs":["difionaUy difficult to incorporate into HMM models and into adaptation algorithms. These include observations that span across several frames and the correlation of the state features with global characteristics of the speech waveform. These two techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used together to achieve robust speech recognition performance. The boundary between these two techniques can be blurred when the mapping algorithm is dependent on the speech recognizer's hypothesis. 2.

Single Microphone To test the POF algorithm on a single target acoustic environment we used the DARPA Wall Street Journal database [15] on SRI's DECIPHER TM phonetically tied-mixture speech recognition system [2]. The signal processing consisted of a filterbank-based front end that generated six feature streams: cepstrum (cl-c12), cepstral energy (cO), and their first- and second-order derivatives. Cepstral-mean normalization [16] was used to equalize the channel. We used simultaneous recordings of high-quality speech (Sennheiser 414 head-mounted microphone with a noise-canceling element) along with speech recorded by a standard speaker phone (AT&T 720) and transmitted over local telephone lines. We will refer to this stereo data as clean and noisy speech, respectively. The models of the recognizer were trained using 42 male WSJ0 training talkers (3500 sentences) recorded with a Sennheiser microphone. The models of the mapping algorithm were trained using 240 development training sentences recorded by three speakers. The test set consisted of 100 sentences (not included in the training set) recorded by the same three speakers. In this experiment we mapped two of the six features: the cepstrum (cl-c12) and the cepstral energy (cO) separately. The derivatives were computed from the mapped vectors of the cepstral features. For the conditioning feature we used a 13-dimensional cepstral vector (c0-c12) modeled with 512 Gaussians with diagonal ¢ovariance matrices.

A 34% improvement in recognition performance was obtained when using only the additive filter coefficient b i. (Recognition error goes down to 18.1%.) The best result (15.9% recognition error) was obtained for the condition p=3, in which six neighboring noisy frames are being used to estimate the feature vector for the current frame. The correlation between the average relative distortion between the six clean and noisy features and the recognition error is 0.9. 3.2. ATIS Simultaneous Corpus To test the performance of the POF algorithm on multiple microphones we used SRI's stereo-ATIS database. (See [1] for details.) A corpus of both training and testing speech was collected using simultaneous recordings made from subjects wearing a Sennheiser HMD 414 microphone and holding a telephone handset. The speech from the telephone handset was transmitted over local telephone lines during data collection. Ten different telephone handsets were used. Ten male speakers were designated as training speakers, and three male speakers were designated as the test set. The training set consisted of 3,000 simultaneous recordings of Sennheiser microphone and telephone speech. The test set consisted of 400 simultaneous recordings of Sennheiser and telephone speech.

This is due to the loss of information in reducing the bandwidth from 100-6400 Hz to 300-3300 Hz. However, when we are using a telephone front end, there is only a 7.8% increase in word error when testing on telephone speech compared to testing on Sennheiser speech (9.7% versus 9.0%).

WSJ EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Another series of experiments was performed on the WSJ Speech Corpus [15]. We evaluated our system on the 5000-word-recognition closed-vocabulary speaker-independent speech-recognition tasks: Spoke $5 Unknown Microphone, Spoke $6: Known Microphone, and Spoke $7 Noisy Environment. The version of the DECIPHER speaker-independent continuous speech :recognition system used for these experiments is based on a progressive-search strategy [3] and continuous-density, genonic HMMs [2]. Gender-dependent models are used in all passes. Gender selection uses the models with the higher recognition likelihood. The acoustic models used by the HMM system were trained with 37,000 sentences of Sennheiser data from 280 speakers, a set officially designated as the WSJ0+WSJ1 many-speaker baseline training. A 5,000 closed-vocabulary back-off trigram language model provided by M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory for the WSJ task was used. Gender-dependent HMM acoustic models were used. The front-end processing extracts one long spectral vector consisting of the following six feature components: cepstrum, energy, and their first and second order derivatives. The dimensionality of this feature is 39 (13 * 3) for the wide-bandwidth spectral analysis and 27 (9 * 3) for the telephone-bandwidth spectral analysis. The cepstral features are computed from an FFI\" filterbank, and subsequent cepstral-mean normalization on a sentence-by-sentence basis is performed. Before using wide-bandwidth context-dependent genonie HMMs, a robust estimate of the Sennheiser cepstral parameters is computed using POE The robust front-end analysis is designed for an unknown microphone condition. The POF mapping algorithm estimates are conditioned on the noisy cepstral observations. Separate mappings are trained for each of the 14 microphones in the baseline WSJ0+WS/1 si_tr_s stereo training, and one mapping for the overall ease of single nontelephone mapping. When the default no-transformation zero-mean eepstra are included, this makes a total of 15 estimated feature streams. These feature streams are computed on each test waveform, and the two feature streams with the highest likelihoods (using a simplified HMM for scoring the features) are averaged together (Top2). In all cases the first and second delta parameters are computed on these estimated cepstral values.

There is an increase in the word-error rate of 66% when testing on Sennheiser recordings with a wide-bandwidth analysis (5.8%) compared to testing with a telephone-bandwidth analysis (9.6%). The loss in performance when switching from Sennheiser recordings to telephone recordings is small in comparison to the loss of information due to bandwidth restrictions.
