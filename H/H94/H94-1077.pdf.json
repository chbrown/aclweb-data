INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["One of the main problems with very-large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition is how to accurately and efficiently reduce the search space without pruning the correct candidate. Our speech recognition system is based on the HMM-LR algorithm [1] which utilizes a generalized LR parser [2] as a language model and hidden Markov models (HMMs) as phoneme models. Applying this algorithm to large-vocabulary continuous speech requires: (1) accurate scoring for phoneme sequences, (2) reduction of trellis calculation, and (3) efficient pruning of phoneme sequence candidates. For the first requirement, several speech recognition algorithms that calculate the backward trelhs likelihood from the end of the utterance, as well as the forward trellis likehhood, have been proposed [3][41 . We also use forward and backward trellis likelihoods for accurate scoring. For the second requirement, we use an adjusting window, which chooses only the probable part of the trellis according to the predicted phoneme. For the third requirement, we use an algorithm for merging candidates which have the same allophonle phoneme sequences and the same context-free grammar states [5]. In addition, candidates are also merged at the meaning level [6]. Speech HMMs are sensitive to incoming noise and this often results in a large decrease in the recognition. One solution is to train HMMs on noisy speech to obtain the corresponding optimum HMMs. For large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition, however, the computation load of this so-lution becomes too high, because all the HMMs need to be retrained each time the characteristics of the background noise (such as its level) change. Taking inspiration from I-IMM decomposition [7], we proposed an HMM-composition technique to easily adapt the speech recognition system based on clean-speech HMMs to background noise [8]. This technique is similar to the technique of Nolasco Flores et al. [9] which was investigated independently. Providing access to directory information via spoken names and addresses is an interesting and useful application of large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition technology in telecommunication networks. Although many systems based on recognizing spoken spelled names are being investigated, it is unreasonable to expect users to correctly spell the names of the persons whose telephone number they want. In addition, there are several sets of letters having similar pronunciations, such as the English E-rhyming letters, and pronunciation of the spelling of another person's names is often unstable, since this is not a familiar action for people. Therefore, it is not easy to correctly recognize alphabetically spelled names, and a more successful approach might be to recognize naturally spoken names, even if the machine has to recognize hundreds of thousand names. We applied our speech recognition technology to a directory assistance system recognizing names and addresses continuously spoken in Japanese. This system was evaluated from the human-machine-interface point of view."]},{"title":"2. SPEECH RECOGNITION ALGORITHM 2.1. Two-Stage LR Parser","paragraphs":["Figure 1 shows the structure of our continuous speech recognition system for telephone directory assistance. We have developed a two-stage LR parser that uses two classes of LR tables: \"a main grammar table and several sub-grammar tables. These grammar tables are separately compiled from a context-free grammar. The sub-grammar tables deal with semantically classified items, such as city names, town names, block numbers, and subscriber names. The main grammar table controls the relationships between these semantic items."]},{"title":"387","paragraphs":["Dividing the grammar into two classes has two advantages: since each grammar can be compiled separately, the time needed for compiling the LR table is reduced, and the system cart easily be adapted to many types of utterances by changing the main grammar rules.

Accurate Scoring","paragraphs":["Figure 2 shows the search algorithm. Our algorithm uses a backward trellis as well as a forward trellis so as to accurately calculate the score of a phoneme sequence candidate. The backward trellis likelihood is calculated without any grammatical constraints on the phoneme sequences; it is used as a likelihood estimate of potential succeeding phoneme sequences."]},{"title":"2.3. Adjusting Window","paragraphs":["We proposed an algorithm for determining an adjusting window that restricts calculation to a probable part of the trellis for each predicted phoneme. The adjusting window (shaded rectangle in Fig. 2) has a length of 50 frames (400 ms). The score within the adjusting window is calculated by taking the convolution of the forward and backward trdlises. In this procedure, the likelihood in the backward trellis is multiplied by (1-~), where ~ is a small positive value."]},{"title":"2.4. Merging Candidates","paragraphs":["The LR tables need multiple pronunciation rules to cover allophonic phonemes, such as devoicing a~ad long vowels in Japanese pronunciation. These multiple rules cause an explosion of the search space. To make the search space smaller, we merge phoneme sequence candidates as well as grammatical states when they are phonetically and semantically the same. We further merge the candidate word sequences having the same meaning, ignoring the differences in non-keywords."]},{"title":"3. RECOGNITION EXPERIMENTS 3.1.

MULTI-MODAL TELEPHONE DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE SYSTEM 5.1. System Structure","paragraphs":["We designed a multi-modal speech dialog system for telephone directory assistance with three input devices (microphone, keyboard and mouse) and two output devices (speaker and display), based on the above-mentioned continuous speech recognition and NOVO HMM techniques. Figure 7 shows the basic structure of the dialog system [10]. Since the interaction time, that is, the recognition speed is crucially important in testing dialog systems, we reduced the number of subscribers to 2,300 in this experimental system. The vocabulary size was roughly 4,000 as shown in Table 1. The corresponding beam width was also reduced to 200. This recognition system uses context-independent HMMs and does not use merging at the meaning level. Implemented on an HP-9000-735, the recognition currently takes about 20 seconds per sentence. Figure 8 shows an output window example in our system. The numbers on the left side of the window show the order of candidates. This window displays five potential subscriber candidates. For each candidate, the system displays five slots: city, town, block number, subscriber name, and telephone number. A simple example of how this dialog system is used is as follows:","1. After clicking the speech button, a user states an address and subscriber name.","2. The system recognizes the input speech and displays five candidates.","3. If one of the candidates is correct, the user obtains the telephone number by clicking the telephone number slot of the correct candidate."]},{"title":"5.2. Dialog Controller","paragraphs":["The main functions of the dialog controller are as follows. Display Candidates After speech recognition, four potential candidates are displayed in order of their likelihood scores. The telephone directory assistance database constraint is not usually used in selecting these candidates. However, the fifth candidate is the candidate that satisfies the constraint in the telephone directory assistance database, because there is a high possibility that the candidate that satisfies the constraint is correct, even if it has a low likelihood score.

Error Correction If there is no correct candidate among the five candidates, the user corrects the input error by choosing the candidate closest to the correct subscriber address and name, clicking the wrong keyword slot, and uttering a sentence with the specified semantic item. In the error correction mode, the system switches the main grammar to the grammar in which the clicked item must be uttered. For example, if a user clicks the subscriber name slot, the system switches the main grammar to the grammar for utterances that need to include a subscriber name. The user can include some new information in the sentence, in addition to the specified item. The beam width is also increased to raise the recognition accuracy."]},{"title":"5.3. Evaluation","paragraphs":["This system was evaluated from the human-machine-interface point of view. We asked 20 researchers in our laboratory to try to use this system. Dialog experiments were performed to evaluate the following issues: 1. System performance (task completion rate, sentence un-","derstanding rate, task completion time, etc), 2. User evaluation of the system, 3. Content and manner of user utterances, and 4. Problems encountered with the system. Training The users were first requested to practice operat-ing this system by themselves using a tutorial system, which was an interactive system implemented on a workstation. The tutorial system was designed to control and unify the guidance as well as knowledge given to each user. One sequence of the practice, including examples of correct recognition and incorrect recognition, takes roughly 10 minutes, in which users operate the system following instructions displayed on the screen. A typical way of speaking is also displayed and practiced in this stage. Pauses and speaking rates are not controlled. Testing 20 sheets of paper indicating the tasks using sketch maps were given to each user. Each task was indicated by the name and location of the person whose telephone number had to be requested on the map. Figure 9 shows an example of a sheet. The amount of information indicated on the sheet varied; for exumple, the first name or the town name of the person was sometimes not given. The users were requested to make inquiries based on the information given in each sheet. We used maps for indicating the tasks to avoid controlling the structure of the spoken sentences. When the user could obtain the desired telephone number, he/she wrote down the number on the answer sheet, and proceeded to the next task.

The average number of utterances for each task was 1.4, and the average sentence understanding rate was 57.87o. The average rate for the correct recognition result being indicated in the top five candidates was 77.5%. We found that the higher the top five recognition rate was, the lower the average number of utterances became. The average time needed to complete each task was 57.2 seconds, and it decreased as the users became mote experienced. About 75% of the users said that they prefered using the computer-based dialog system to a telephone directory. About 55% of the users said that the system was easy to use. The main reason for negative answers to this question was highly related to the feeling that the response time of the system was too slow.
