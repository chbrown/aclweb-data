After a small amount of modification, the parser was able to parse about 80% of the sentences in those two messages into reasonable representations. With some additional work this percentage can be improved. Given the lexically driven nature of the parser, extending the system to cover a larger subset of the Navy message database rests primarily on expansion of the lexicon. For demonstration purposes, an X Windows Interface to the parser was developed.","We are also integrating the ViewGen belief manipulation system with the conceptual graph + MGR knowledge representation, so as to provide a system that can both guide the message parsers and represent the results of message extraction. The immediate goal is re-implementing ViewGen in conceptual graphs. This has led to the following recent developments: (1) Investigating the benefits of using CG to express ViewGen. (2) Representing the environments, lambda formulas, and propositions of ViewGen in","CG. (3) Using examples from Navy messages to specify belief ascription in CG. 421"]}]}
