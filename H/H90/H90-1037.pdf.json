Our approach to the problem is twofold: first, we present a fast segment classification method that reduces computation by a factor of 2 to 4, depending on the confidence of choosing the most probable model. Second, we propose a Split and Merge segmentation algorithm as an alternative to the typical Dynamic Programming solution of the segmentation and recognition problem, with computation savings increasing proportionally with model complexity. Even though our current recognizer uses context-independent phone models, the results that we report on the TIMIT database for speaker independent joint segmentation and recognition are comparable to that of systems that use context information."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["The Stochastic Segment Model [6, 10, 9] was proposed as an alternative to hidden Markov models (HMMs), in order to overcome the limiting assumptions of the latter that observation features are conditionally independent given the underlying state sequence. The main disadvantage of the SSM over other methods is its computational complexity, which can be attributed to the fact that dropping the conditional independence assumption on the state sequence increases the size of the effective state space. Having addressed several issues on the classification accuracy of the SSM in our previous work [2], we now move to speaker independent connected phone recognition and choose to concentrate on the important issue of computational complexity of the SSM recognition algorithm. We present two new algorithms which together achieve a significant computation reduction.","This paper is organized as follows. A brief overview of the SSM is given in this section. For a more detailed description of the model the reader is referred to [6, 10]. In the next section, we present a new algorithm for fast phone classification with the SSM. Next, we address the issue of joint segmentation and recognition. The originally proposed solution for this problem used a Dynamic Programming algorithm to find the globally maximum likelihood phone sequence. After we examine the computational complexity of this method, we look at an alternative approach to this problem based on local search algorithms. We propose a different search strategy that reduces the computation significantly, and can be used in conjunction with the classification algorithm. Although theoretically the new algorithm may not find the global maximum, experimental results on the TIMIT database, show that the recognition performance of the fast algorithm is very close to the optimum one.","An observed segment of speech (e.g., a phoneme) is represented by a sequence of q-dimensional feature vectors Y = [Yx Y2 ...

Such a method has originally been used for image segmentation [3]. This approach has a search neighborhood that is the union of the neighborhoods of the splitting and merging methods discussed previously. The advantages of such a method are first that it is harder to fall into local optima because of the larger neighborhood size and second that it converges faster, if we assume that we start from a point closer to the true segmentation than the top or the bottom.","To relate this algorithm to the general family of local search algorithms, consider the neighborhood that consists of segmentations with segments restricted to be not smaller than half the size of the segments in the current segmentation. In Figure 1 we show the corresponding single and two segment neighbors over one and two segments that also belong to the exact neighborhood. In the same way, we can define the \"half segment\" neighbors over three or more consecutive segments. As we shall see though, we found that extending the search above two-segment neighbors was unnecessary. The original split and merge neighborhood consists of neighbors 1 and 2 in Figure 1.

We found it useful to change our splitting scheme to a two step process: first, the decision for a split at the middle point is taken, and then the boundary between the two children segments is adjusted by examining the likelihood ratio of the last and first distributions of the corresponding models. The boundary is finally adjusted to the new frame if this action increases the likelihood. This method does not actually increase the search neighborhood, because boundary adjustment will be clone only ff the decision for a split was originally taken. However, it was adopted as a good compromise between computational load and performance.","A second method that helped avoid local optima was the use of combined actions. In addition to single splits or merges, we search over segmentations produced by splitting a segment and merging the first or second half with the previous or next segment respectively. In essence, this expands the search neighborhood by including the neighbors 3 and 4 in figure 1.","We also considered several other methods to escape local optima, like taking random or negative steps at the end.

A suboptimal search can be performed with the split and merge segmentation algorithm as follows:","At each iteration of the algorithm, the scores of all the candidate phones are computed and stored for all segments"]},{"title":"176","paragraphs":["and all segmentations in the search neighborhood, without using the constraint probabilities (we make the assumption that we have probabilistic constraints, in the form of a statistical grammar as above). Next, an action (split or merge) is taken if by changing only the phone labels of the segments the global likelihood is increased, this time including the constraint probabilities. This guarantees that the likelihood of the new segmentation is bigger than the previous one. If the decision is to take the action, we fix the segmentation and then perform a search over the phone labels only. For example, if we use bigram probabilities, this can be done with a Dynamic Programming search over the phonetic labels with the acoustic scores of the current segmentation. This last step is necessary, because once an action is taken and a local change is made, we are not guaranteed that the current scenario is globally optimum for the given segmentation because of the constraints (e.g. independent phones).","As in the independent phone case, convergence of the algorithm is ensured because after each iteration of the algorithm a new configuration will be adopted only if it increases the likelihood.","In the case of non-independent phones, the exact minimal search neighborhood can be shown to be the set of all segmentations. It is therefore much easier for a local search algorithm to get trapped into local optima. For this reason, it is important that for constrained searches the above mentioned algorithm starts with a good initial segmentation.

The phone-classifier that we used in our experiments was identical to the baseline system described in [2]. We used Mel-warped cepstra and their derivatives together with the derivative of log power. The length of the segment model was M = 5 and had independent samples. We used 61 phonetic models, but in counting errors we folded homophones together and effectively used the reduced CMU/MIT 39 symbol set. However, we did not remove the glottal stop Q in either training or recognition, and allowed substitutions of a closure-stop pair by the corresponding single closure or stop as acceptable errors. Those two differences from the conditions used in [5, 8] have effects on the performance estimates which offset one another.","The training and test sets that we used consist of 317 speakers (2536 sentences) and 103 speakers (824 sentences) respectively. We report our baseline results on this large test set, but our algorithm development was done on a subset of this set, with 12 speakers (96 sentences), and the comparison of the split and merge algorithm to the DP search is done on this small test set."]},{"title":"DP / Split and Merge comparison","paragraphs":["The average sentence length in our small test set was 3 seconds, or 300 flames when the cepstral analysis is done every 10 msec. The number of segment score evaluations per sentence for a DP search is 15,000 when we restrict the length of the phones to be less than 50 frames, and can be reduced to approximately 4,000 if we further restrict the accuracy of the search to 2 frames. In addition, for 61 phone models and a M = 5 long segment, there are 90,000 different Gaussian score evaluations under the frame independence assumption that will eventually be computed during the DP search.","The average number of iterations for the non-constrained split and merge search over these sentences was 114, with 750 segment and 40,000 Gaussian score evaluations, when we also include the fast classification scheme. The split and merge search was on average 3 times faster than a two frame accurate DP search under these conditions, and 5 times faster than a single frame accurate DP search. Furthermore, the savings increase with the length of the model: we verified experimentally that doubling the length of the model had little effect on the split and merge search, whereas it doubled the recognition time of the DP search.","The computation savings remain the same in the case of constrained searches also. The additional segment and frame score evaluations in the second phase of the split and merge are offset by the increased search space in the DP search. Finally, we should notice that the fast classification scheme has only a small effect when a DP search is used.","A fast suboptimal search for the JSR problem is justified if the solutions it provides are not far from the global optimum. Starting with a uniform initial segmentation near the bottom of the tree, we found that the split and merge search had almost identical performance to the DP search, without and with the bigram probabilities.
