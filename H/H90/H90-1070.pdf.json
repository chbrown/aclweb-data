Considerable research has addressed the transportability of natural language systems, but not generic text processing capabilities. For example, previous DARPA-sponsored work [1, 2] produced transportable interfaces to database systems. Each new application of these interfaces generally required modifications to lexicons, new semantic knowledge bases, and other specialized features. The most that natural language text processing systems have accomplished has been the parsing of arbitrary text, without any real semantic analysis.","Our text processing work at GE, like the earlier efforts in interfaces, has emphasized transportability. We have applied the same core of natural language tools, including the grammar, lexicon, parser, and semantic interpreter (collectively known as the NLToolset [3]), to domains ranging from personnel directories to aircraft engine service reports. Some other applications of the NLToolset are the SCISOR news story reader [4] and the GE effort in the MUCK-II evaluation [5]. These prototypes process texts at a rate of several hundred paragraphs per hour, synthesize a structured representation for each text, and answer English questions about the contents.","This transportable text processing effort has provided successful proof-of-concept demonstrations for applications with only a few person-months of effort, often with only minor assistance from the NLToolset developers. Unfortunately, even this anaount of customization is far too much for most potential text processing applications, which continue to use more robust but far more superficial methods, such as keyword indexing, pattern match-ing, and statistical retrieval.","Our effort at GE currently aims at developing generic text processing capabilities. Building on the techniques previously used for a wide variety of applications, we are extending our methods to the semantic analysis of unrestricted text. This has placed the greatest stress on enhanced lexical processing. Most importantly, the system must now apply lexical information that is rich enough to cover the content words of arbitrary text, while providing enough information about words in context to control ambiguity and produce \"preferred\" interpretations. In the near term, we expect at least to reduce future customization efforts while experimenting with the effects of \"text coding\" or word sense-tagging without customization.","We will report on some preliminary results in generic text processing, including the development of a 10,000-root core sense-disambiguated lexicon, the use of text preprocessing (including tagging and bracketing) to help control parsing, and the design of a module for collecting sense preferences from different, knowledge sources in text analysis. The program currently discriminates word senses (albeit somewhat, roughly) in arbitrary text. We will report on the current state of this effort and describe the key unresolved issues."]},{"title":"Lexical inadequacy","paragraphs":["Most problems in natural language processing-- including information retrieval, database generation, and machine translation--hinge on relating words to other words that are similar in mneaning. Because of the extreme difficulty of producing any accurate deep-level analysis of text, many of these strategies are inherently word-based. In the case of information retrieval, current methods match words in a query with words in documents, with the degree of match weighted according to the frequency of words in the texts. In database generation, programns map individual words into names of frames or database records. In language translation, systems use mappings between words in a \"source\" language and words in a \"target\" language to guide lexical choice (word choice). In all these applications, current methods are limited in their accuracy by the fact that many words have multiple senses, although different words often have similar meanings.","We will refer to this as the problem of lexical inadequacy, including the issue of genuinely ambiguous words as well as vague tern~s and derivative words (words that have a common root but vary slightly in meaning). Previous approaches to the problem of lexical inadequacy fall into two basic categories-word-based approaches and deep-level approaches. Word-based approaches have ad-"]},{"title":"359","paragraphs":["dressed the problem in several general ways, including using co-occurrence and other contextual information as an indicator of text content to try to filter out inaccuracies, using word roots rather thau words by stripping affixes, and using a thesaurus or synonym list that matches words to other words. Deep-level approaches use a knowledge representation, or interlingua, to reflect text content, thereby separating text representation from the individual words. Deep-level approaches caJ~ be more accurate than word-based approaches, but have not been sufficiently robust to perform any practical text processing task. This lack of robustness is generally due to the difficulty in building knowledge bases that are sufficient for broad-scale processing. Text coding Our approach tries to take advantage of the main benefit of word-based analysis, i.e. the explicit recognition in text representation of the relationship between words that derive from a common root, while overcom-ing the main limitation, i.e. the loss of information between complete text and word roots. The idea is that the first step in text processing should be to develop a \"recoding\" or sense-tagging of the source text that captures word-level knowledge as well as any deeper information the system is able to produce. In theory, this approach would lead to capabilities that are no worse, with zero customization, than word-based methods for information retrieval, but allow for easy improvement using more knowledge-intensive methods. This theory is still untested, although there is some preliminary evidence that word sense tagging could improve information retrieval system performance [6].","As an example of the input and output of the system, the following is an arbitrary segment of Wall Street ,Journal text with the resulting coding.

By allowing systems to specify key portions of the knowledge base for certain domains (about 300 word senses for MUCK-II), we derived a benefit from the core lexicon (i. e. reducing lexicon-building effort) without introducing many spurious senses. However, the main goal of the effort was to achieve some sort of useful semantic results without any customization. The same algorithms applying the core lexicon to arbitrary samples of the Wall Street Journal, not surprisingly, caused some serious problems. After three \"easy\" sentences, the program encountered the following typical input:","A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported. While producing over 100 parses for the above sentence, the program did quite poorly at first in determining the \"preferred\" sense of each word and even at distinguishing noun forms from verb forms without any \"do-main\" knowledge. This seemed to be a practical example of the \"I see a cow\" problem (i.e. a large dictionary greatly increases the degree of ambiguity by introducing low-frequency possibilities). After analyzing the program's performance on many examples of this type, we found that we had already reached diminishing returns in adding words and word senses to the lexicon, and that most of the problems with the sense tagging task broke down into three categories: (1) local syntactic preferences, such as that \"make\" is a verb (as opposed to \"a make of car\") and \"filters\" is a noun, (2) simple attachment preferences (such as minimal attachment), and (3) recognition of \"senseless\" parsing distinctions, such as the multiple attachments of \"once used\", \"among a group...\", and \"exposed to it\" (e. g. whether \"among a group\" modifies \"deaths\", \"percentage\", or \"caused\" does not affect semantic preferences).","Word sense preferences are only loosely coupled to \"traditional\" syntactic and semantic preferences. Because many preferences depend on local constraints and lexical relations, we chose to handle some of these issues by using text pre-processing to limit parsing and lexical ambiguity. The next section briefly describes the division of effort between pre-processing and traditional parsing. applying semantic constraints as selectional restrictions and pruning off paths with low semantic \"scores\".","The motivation for pre-processing, of course, is that ambiguity at the word level is such a problem. Even with our moderate-size lexicon, almost any English content word has more than one part of speech. \"Obvious\" nouns such as table and case can appear as verbs, and almost all verbs can appear as nouns. Tagging has emerged as an essential component in corpus-processing systems, removing or reducing this part-of-speech ambiguity. Our effort uses a tagger to perform dynamic part-of-speech tagging based on lexical and morphological analysis. The tagger is in some ways similar to Church's method [9], but is lexicon-dependent (Church's system does not use morphology) and combines statistics with heuristics (such as knowing that words following determiners are nouns, rather than relying only on specific rules). The tagger tags only content words, and processes input at a rate of 500,000 words per hour.","While the tagger uses a simple lexical lookup, we found it useful to use another pre-processing procedure to correct some grammar-specific tagging problems as well as to fetch collocations from the lexicon before parsing. In a few cases, this post-tagging procedure re-introduces ambiguity where the tagger gives a specific choice. While the accuracy of the tagger is highest when it is heavily biased toward nouns, the accuracy of the parser depends on having some verbs.","After pre-processing, the TRUMP parser and semantic interpreter [8] go to work on the tagged text, collecting relations (such as modification and verb-complement) at the level of each clause. The sense preference mechanism assigns a total score to each relation to help with attachment, as well as maintaining a weighted vector of preference information that determines the final sense tagging of the text. The final sense tag thus does not depend on having a single final correct parse.","The following list describes the vector of five preference scores for each word sense, along with the five contributing preferences for each role filler:","Sense preferences: - frequency preference (zero-context) - morphological pref. (primary or secondary) - cluster preference (based on topic, etc.) - collocation (phrase) preference - syntactic preference of sense Processing and pre-processing The current style of processing separates both syntactic and semantic analysis into two stages. The pre-processing stage performs a morphological analysis and quick lexical lookup of the text, followed by tagging and bracketing (including stochastic tagging with correction) and col]ocational analysis. The result of this pre-processing is a pre-filtered version of the text, with some of the lexical amnbiguity eliminated as well as base-line semantic preferences. In the second stage, a more complete analysis parses the text in a chart style [8], Roel-filler preferences: - preference for filer, independent of attachment - role pref. (how well filler fills role) - rel pref. (how well frame \"likes\" role) - base preference (how well role likes frame) - syntactic preference of filler","Since each word sense can have roles, the relations between head and filler reflect the interactions among sense preferences in the text. The final choice of sense tags thus indirectly reflects correct attachment and syntactic analysis. 363","Certainly, the bulk of work that remains is in \"filling out\" these sparse preference vectors. The next section comments on the results produced using the still-sparse preference information. system to sense tagging of arbitrary text. We expect to evaluate these results on tasks in information retrieval, and, later, machine translation, to determine the likelihood of achieving substantive improvements through sense-based semantic analysis."]},{"title":"Current status and interim results","paragraphs":["It is still difficult to evaluate the results of this sort of effort. The new lexicon and sense preference mechanism at least shows strong evidence of improved transportability, since the task of customizing the lexicon to a limited do-main now takes no more than a day or two. The system also shows excellent lexical and morphological coverage, with well over 90% of non-proper-noun word occurrences covered. When tested on the Wall Street Journal texts (for which there has been no adaptation or customization aside from a company-name recognizer), it rarely produces a single correct parse; however, the partial parses produced generally cover most of the text at the clause level.","The examples of sense-coded text shown earlier are produced by combining clause-level fragments produced by the analyzer. Since most semantic preferences appear at this level (and those that do not, do not depend on syntactic analysis), the results of this sense-coding are encouraging. At least, we have never before been able to produce any partial semantic results from processing arbitrary text.","We made an unsuccessful attempt at evaluating the accuracy of sense-tagging over a corpus. First, we discovered that a human \"expert\" had great difficulty identifying each sense, and that this task was far more tedious than manual part-of-speech tagging or bracketing. Second, we questioned what we would learn from the evaluation of these partial results, and have since turned our attention back to task-oriented evaluation.","Our next step is to evaluate the effect of text coding on an information retrieval task, by applying traditional term-weighted statistical retrieval methods to the recoded text. One intriguing aspect of this approach is that errors in distinguishing sense preferences should not be too costly in this task, so long as the program is fairly consistent in its disambiguation of terms in both the source texts and the input queries.
