Hobbs","paragraphs":["SRI International Menlo Park, California"]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["The TACITUS system uses a cost-based abduction scheme for finding and choosing among possible interpretations for natural language texts. Ordinary Prologstyle, backchaining deduction is augmented with the capability of making assumptions and of factoring two goal literals that are unifiable (see Hobbs et al., 1988).","Deduction is combinatorially explosive, and since the abduction scheme augments deduction with two more options at each node--assumption and factoring--it is even more explosive. We have been engaged in an empirical investigation of the behavior of this abductive scheme on a knowledge base of nearly 400 axioms, performing relatively sophisticated linguistic processing. So far, we have begun to experiment, with good results, with three different techniques for controlling abduction--a type hierarchy, unwinding or avoiding transitivity axioms, and various heuristics for reducing the branch factor of the search."]},{"title":"The Type Hierarchy","paragraphs":["The first example on which we tested the abductive scheme was the sentence There was adequate lube oil. The system got the correct interpretation, that the lube oil was the lube oil in the lube oil system of the air compressor, and it assumed that that lube oil was adequate. But it also got another interpretation. There is a mention in the knowledge base of the adequacy of the lube oil pressure, so it identified that adequacy with the adequacy mentioned in the sentence. It then assumed that the pressure was lube oil.","It is clear what went wrong here. Pressure is a magnitude whereas lube oil is a material, and magnitudes can't be materials. In principle, abduction requires a check for the consistency of what is assumed, and our knowledge base should have contained axioms from which it could be inferred that a magnitude is not a material. In practice, unconstrained consistency checking is undecidable and, at best, may take a long time. Nevertheless, one can, through the use of a type hierarchy, eliminate a very large number of possible assumptions that are likely to result in an inconsistency. We have consequently implemented a module that specifies the types that various predicate-argument positions can take on, and the likely disjointness relations among types. This is a way of exploiting the specificity of the English lexicon for computational purposes. This addition led to a speed-up of two orders of magnitude.","A further use of the type hierarchy speeds up processing by a factor of 2 to 4. The types provide prefiltering of relevant axioms for compound nominal, coercion, and other very general relations. Suppose, for example, that we wish to prove"]},{"title":"rel(a, b),","paragraphs":["and we have the two axioms Without a type hierarchy we would have to backchain on both of these axioms. If, however, the first of the axioms is valid only when x and y are of types tl and t2, respectively, and the second is valid only when x and y are of types t3 and t4, respectively, and a and b have already been determined to be of types tl and t2, respectively, then we need only backchain on the first of the axioms.","There is a problem with the type hierarchy, however. In an ontologically promiscuous notation, there is no commitment in a primed proposition to truth or existence in the real world. Thus,"]},{"title":"lube-oill(e,o)","paragraphs":["does not say that o is lube oil or even that it exists; rather it says that e is the eventuality of o's being lube oil.

We cannot properly restrict that argument position tobe lube oil, or fluid, or even a material, for that would rule out perfectly true sentences like \"Truth is not lube oil.\"","Generally, when one uses a type hierarchy, one assumes the types to be disjoint sets with cleanly defined boundaries, and one assumes that predicates take arguments of only certain types. There are a lot of problems with this idea. In any case, in our work, we are not buying into this notion that the universe is typed. Rather we are using the type hierarchy strictly as a heuristic, as a set of guesses not about what could or could not"]},{"title":"be","paragraphs":["but about what it would or would not occur to someone to"]},{"title":"say.","paragraphs":["When two types are declared to be disjoint, we are saying that they are certainly disjoint in the real world, and that they are very probably disjoint everywhere except in certain bizarre modal contexts.

We are better off if at any node, rather than having either to prove an atomic formula or to assume it, we only have to prove it. Some predicates are therefore marked as nonassumable.

In the naval operations domain, the task is to characterize the participants in incidents described in the message. This is done, as described in Section 5.4. A schema is encoded by means of a schema predication, with an argument for each role in the schema. Lexical realizations and other consequences of schemas are encoded by means of schema axioms.

As explained above, it is a very powerful method for coreference resolution. It is based on the principle that where it can be inferred that two entities have the same property, there is a good possibility that the two entities are identical.
