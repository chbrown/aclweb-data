Current recognition algorithms can most directly use finite-state acceptor (FSA) language models. However, these models are inadequate for language interpretation, since they cannot express the relevant syntactic and semantic regularities. Augmented phrase structure grammar (APSG) formalisms, such as unification grammars, can express many of those regularities, but they are computationally less suitable for language modeling, because of the inherent cost of computing state transitions in APSG parsers.","The above problems might be circumvented by using separate grammars for language modeling and language interpretation. Ideally, the recognition grammar should not reject sentences acceptable by the interpretation grammar, but it should contain as much as possible of the constraints built into the interpretation grammar. However, if the two grammars are built independently, those constraints are difficult to maintain. For this reason, we have developed a method for constructing automatically a finite-state approximation for an 'APSG. Since the purpose of the approximation is to serve as a filter in a speech-recognition front-end to the real parser, the approximation language is a superset of the language accepted by the APSG. The term \"approximation\" will always be used in this sense in what follows.","If no further constraints were placed on the closeness of the approximation, the trivial algorithm that assigns to any APSG over alphabet ~ the regular language ~* would do. Clearly, this is not what is required. One possible criterion for \"goodness\" of approximation arises from the observation that many interesting phrase-structure grammars have substantial parts that accept regular languages. That does not mean that the grammar rules are in the standard forms for defining :regular languages (left-linear or right-linear), because syntactic and semantic considerations often require that strings in a regular set be assigned structural descriptions not definable by regular productions. A useful criterion is thus that if a grammar generates a regular language, the approximation algorithm yields an acceptor for that :regular language. In other words, one would like the algorithm to be exact for APSGs yielding regular languages.","We have not yet proved that our method satisfies the above exactness criterion, but some experiments have shown that the method is exact for a variety of interesting grammars."]},{"title":"The Algorithm","paragraphs":["Our approximation method applies to any context-free grammar (CFG), or any unification grammar that can be fully expanded into a context-free grammar) The resulting FSA accepts a superset of the sentences accepted by the input grammar.","The current implementation accepts as input a form of unification grammar in which features can take only atomic values drawn from a specified finite set. It is clear that such grammars can only generate context-free languages, since an equivalent CFG can be obtained by instantiating features in rules in all possible ways.","The heart of our approximation method is an algorithm to convert the LR(0) characteristic machine AA(G) (Aho and Ullman, 1977; Uackhouse, 1979) of a CFG G into an FSA for a superset of the language L(G) defined by G. The characteristic machine for a CFG G is an FSA for the viable prefixes of G, which are just the possible stacks built by the standard shift-reduce recognizer for G when recognizing strings in L(G).","This is not the place to review the characteristic machine construction in detail. However, to explain the approximation algorithm we will need to recall the main aspects of the construction. The states of .hA(G) are sets of dotted rules A ---+ or. fl where A ---+ aft is some rule of G..A4(G) is the determinization by the standard subset construction (Aho and Ullman, 1977) of the FSA defined as follows:","• The initial state is the dotted rule S' ~ S. where S is the start symbol of G and S' is a new auxiliary start symbol. • The final state is S' ---, S..","1 Unification grammars not in this class must first be weakened using techniques such as Shieber's restrictor (Shieber, 1985). 20"]},{"title":"1 S'->.S ~,, S'->S.

B/3 to B ~ \"7, where B is a nonterminal symbol and B ~ \"7 a rule in G.",".M(G) can be seen as a finite state control for a nondeterministic shift-reduce pushdown recognizer for G. A state transition labeled by a terminal symbol z from state s to state s' licenses a shift move, pushing onto the stack of the recognizer the pair (s, Ix). Arrival at a state containing a completed dotted rule A ~ a. licenses a reduction move. This pops from the stack as many pairs as the symbols in a, checking that the symbols in the pairs match the corresponding elements of a, and then takes the transition out of the last state popped s labeled by A, pushing (s, A) onto the stack.","The basic ingredient of our approximation algorithm is the flattening of a shift-reduce recognizer for a grammar G into an FSA by eliminating the stack and turning reduce moves into e-transitions. However, as we will see below, flattening the characteristic machine recognizer directly will lead to poor approximations in many interesting cases. Instead, the characteristic machine must be unfolded into a larger machine whose states carry information about the possible shift-reduce stacks at states of the characteristic machine. The quality of the approximation is crucially influenced by how much stack information is encoded in the states of the unfolded machine: too little leads to coarse approximations, while too much leads to redundant automata needing very expensive optimization.","The algorithm is best understood with a simple example. Consider the left-linear grammar G1 S---tAb A---+ Aale .M(G1) is shown on Figure 1. Unfolding is not required for this simple example, so the approximating FSA is obtained from .A//(G1) by the flattening method outlined above. The reducing states in .h4(G1), those containing completed dotted rules, are states 0, 3 and 4. For instance, the reduction at state 4 would lead to a transition on nonterminal A, to state 2, from the state that Figure 2: Flattened FSA activated the rule being reduced. Thus the corresponding e-transition goes from state 4 to state 2. Adding all the transitions that arise in this way we obtain the FSA in Figure 2. From this point on, the arcs labeled with nonterminals can be deleted. Doing that and simplify-ing, we get finally the FSA in Figure 3. which is the minimal FSA for the input left-linear grammar.","If flattening were applied to the LR(0) characteristic machine as in the example above, even simple grammars defining regular languages might be inexactly approximated by the algorithm. The reason for this is that in general the reduction at a given reducing state in the characteristic machine transfers to different states depending on stack contents. In other words, the reducing state might be reached by different routes which use the result of the reduction in different ways. Consider for example the grammar G2 S --~ aXa [ bXb X ---~ c which accepts the two strings aca and bcb. Flattening .A4(G2) will produce an FSA that will also accept acb and bca, clearly an undesirable outcome. The reason for this is that the e-transitions leaving the reducing state containing X ~ c. do not distinguish between the different ways of reaching that state, which are encoded in the stack of the characteristic recognizer.","One way of solving the above problem is to unfold each state of the characteristic machine into a set of states corresponding to different stacks at that state, and flattening the unfolded acceptor rather than the original one. However, the set of possible stacks at a state is in general infinite. Therefore, it is necessary to do the unfolding not with respect to stacks, but with respect to a finite par-"]},{"title":"®","paragraphs":["a"]},{"title":"b-©","paragraphs":["Figure 3: Minimal Acceptor 21 tition of the set of stacks possible at the state, induced by an appropriate equivalence relation.

Other work on finite state approximations of phrase structure grammars has typically relied on arbitrary depth cutoffs in rule application. While this is reasonable for psycholinguistic modeling of performance restrictions on center embedding (Pulman, 1986), it does not seem appropriate for speeech recognition where the approximating FSA is intended to work as a filter and not reject inputs acceptable by the given grammar. For instance, depth cutoffs in the method described by Black (1989) lead to approximating FSAs whose language is neither a subset nor a superset of the language of the given phrase-structure grammar, In contrast, our method will produce an exact FSA for many interesting grammars generating regular languages, such as those arising from systematic attachment ambiguities (Church and Patil, 1982). It important to note, however, that even when the result FSA accepts the same language, the original grammar is still necessary because interpretation algorithms are generally expressed in terms of phrase structures described by that grammar, not in terms of the states of the FSA.","The current algorithm can be combinatorially explosive in two places: the instantiation of unification grammar rules to derive an equivalent CFG, and the unfolding of the characteristic machine, in particular for right-recursive rules. The former problem can be alleviated by avoiding full instantiation of unification grammar rules with respect to \"don't care\" features, that is, features that are not constrained by the rule. This can also help decrease the right-recursion unfolding explosion discussed earlier. As for the cost of unfolding, preliminary experiments suggest that dividing the grammar into nonmutually-recursive components and applying the LR(0) construction and unfolding separately to those components could lead to much smaller unfolded automata."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["Thanks are due to Mark Liberman for suggesting that finite-state approximations might be worth investigating to David Roe and Pedro Moreno for using the grammar compiler prototype and patiently putting up with its bugs and inefficiencies."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["Alfred V.
