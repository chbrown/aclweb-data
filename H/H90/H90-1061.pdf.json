Rabiner","Speech Research Department AT&T Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, NJ 07974 ABSTRACT Most large vocabulary speech recognition systems essentially consist of a training algorithm and a recognition structure which is essentially a search for the best path through a rather large decoding network. Although the performance of the recognizer is crucially tied to the details of the training procedure, it is absolutely essential that the recognition structure be efficient in terms of computation and memory, and accurate in terms of actually determining the best path through the lattice, so that a wide range of training (sub-word unit creation) strategies can be efficiently evaluated in a reasonable time period. We have considered an architecture in which we incorporate several well known procedures (beam search, compiled network, etc.) with some new ideas (stacks of active network nodes, likelihood computation on demand, guided search, etc.) to implement a search procedure which maintains the accuracy of the full search but which can decode a single sentence in about one minute of computing time (about 20 times real time) on a vectorized, concurrent processor. The ways in which we have realized this significant computational reduction are described in this paper. I. INTRODUCTION Most large vocabulary speech recognition systems are implemented as network searches for the best path through a large, but finite grid. The best path generally corresponds to the most likely sequence of words as constrained by a finite state network which implements the grammar or syntactic component of the system. When the number of basic speech (sub-word) units is small (i.e., on the order of 50-200 units), the details of implementation of the search strategy don't have a major impact on the overall complexity of the recognition task and experimental tuning and assessment of different training strategies and overall performance of the recognizer is relatively straightforward. However, when t Now with CSELT, Torino, Italy. highly detailed (context dependent) speech units are used, including both intraword and interword context dependent units, the complexity of the overall implementation often increases quadratically with the number of basic units, and correspondingly the details of how the network search is implemented become of major importance in accessing the suitability of various network structures. We have especially found this to be the case when we use context dependent interword speech units where the fan-out at the end of a word and the fan-in at the beginning of the next word are both very high, and the bookkeeping to keep track of all possible phonetic contexts in which a word occurs can dominate the computation (to the extent that it can make even the likelihood computation with mixture density HMM's be negligible compared to the bookkeeping overhead), since at every frame, all possible connections between every valid pair of words in the grammar must be examined. When this is the case, a full search implementation of the speech recognition algorithm is totally impractical, if not impossible. For a task like the DARPA resource management task, the number of grid points to be examined is on the order of tens of millions while the number of connections between grid points ranges in the hundreds of millions. An effective solution to this problem consists of performing an intelligent search through the grid and using reasonable but effective heuristics to eliminate unlikely path candidates from consideration. There are several ways for reducing the computational cost of a search for the most likely path through a finite but large grid of points, including different versions of stack decoding [1]"]},{"title":"[2], and","paragraphs":["A* algorithms[3] [4] Perhaps the most widely used search algorithm for large vocabulary speech recognition is the so called beam search algorithm introduced first by Bruce Lowerre in the Harpy system Is] . In its original form the algorithm carries out the search by exploring, at every step, only a fixed number, N, of best scoring paths (beam). The 311 assumption behind this heuristic is that the globally optimal path is very unlikely to lie outside of the N best paths at each stage during the search. The implementation of this form of beam search presents some computational problems in finding the N best paths, since all explored paths must be sorted according to their likelihoods. An approximation to the original beam search consists in finding the current best scoring path among the active ones and extending only those paths for which the difference between their score and the best score is less than a given threshold (the so called beam width). In this case the number of preserved (active) paths is variable during the search and depends on the distribution of the likelihoods among the paths themselves. Again, a sufficiently large value of the threshold can make the probability of missing the globally optimal path sufficiently small. An advantage of the beam search strategy, over other strategies, is that being a breadth first search it can be conveniently implemented in a real time fashion, in the sense that the processing can proceed frame synchronously. Also, since all active paths at every step of the search have the santo length, the scores of all active paths can be compared on an equal basis. For the reasons described above, a beam strategy is generally the one used in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems. Although the algorithm is simple and straightforward to implement in theory, in practice there are a number of factors which strongly affect the overall efficiency of the implementation. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss these factors and show how proper design lead to an efficient and accurate implementation of a large vocabulary recognition system. The resulting recognizer structure has been designed to take advantage of the capabilities of a vectofized concurrent processor (an Alliant FX/80) which consists of a cluster of up to 8 computing elements (CE's) that can execute code in vector concurrent mode. The iterations of a loop within a program can execute concurrendy provided that there is no data dependency within the loop itself, i.e. operations in one iteration don't use and are independent of results obtained in other iterations. Moreover, since every CE works as an array processor that pipelines operations performed on data vectors, vector operations, instead of single scalar operations, are actually distributed across processors for concurrent execution. Of course, for taking advantage of the vector capabilities of each processor, the code must be structured so that the heart of the computation is performed in such a way that it can be distributed to the concurrent processors and can readily be performed in vector mode. Thus the algorithms must be implemented as a sequence of simple vector operations which are iterafively applied to a set of computing elements sharing the same data structure. Furthermore the size of the data structure, required by each CE for computation, must be small enough to fit within a local CE cache so that the inherent speed of the processor is not compromised by excessive memory faults outside the cache. Based on the above discussion it should be clear that a single HMM state constitutes a data structure that is simple enough simple to be used as a basic element for vectofized processing. Since there is no difference in the processing of HMM states with regard to their position within the model (with the exception of word initial or word final states), the operations performed on single states can be easily expressed in vectorized form. Hence a vector is the ideal structure for storing the information related to the states in the decoding network. Depending on the size of the task, the algorithm can be implemented with static or dynamic state allocation. In the static memory case, when the memory needed to allocate all the states of the decoding network is sufficiently small, each state is assigned an address within the state vector at the beginning of the program, and the address remains constant. When the number of states of the decoding network is very large, hence the amount of memory needed for static allocation is too big for practical implementation, a different solution is required to avoid memory faults within individual processors. The solution to this problem is to allocate memory only for those states that are active at any particular time, i.e. stack the alive nodes within a small memory stack. The address of a state within the state vector is therefore not predictable a priori. Hence a more sophisticated addressing scheme is needed to perform the decoding. This scheme, unfortunately, is not well suited to a parallel and vectorized implementation. The amount of memory needed in the DARPA resource management task, both in the no grammar case and with the word pair grammar, permits a static state allocation. However for more complex tasks (e.g. vocabularies of the order of 10,000 words) a dynamic allocation of states should be implemented. In our implementation of the DARPA resource management task all the states are sequentially allocated in the same order as they appear in the HMM chains that represent the words. Given the simple HMM structure used to represent the units, the local path optimization in the Viterbi decoding has to be performed between states that are stored m consecutive locations of the state vector, except for those states that are at the boundaries of word segments. In this way, the decoding problem is split into two sub-problems, namely processing of internal word segment states and processing of word boundary states. The method of path extension, during the Viterbi decoding, involving boundary states that coincide with the beginning and end of a word model, is","33_2 driven by the syntactic constraints used in the recognition system as well as by the phonological constraints imposed at the word junction level. Since the word models used in the recognition system have a number of possible different beginning and end segments (heads and tails) represented by individual interword context dependent phones, and since the language may be represented by a finite state network with word pair constraints, the connection scheme between the boundary states may be fairly complex. The check of all the connection conditions (syntactic and phonological) for every word beginning and word ending state is thus very expensive computationally. Hence we use a compiled form of the list of possible connections between boundary states. This gives a significantly more efficient implementation of the recognition algorithm. A final issue in the recognizer implementation concerns the use of a guided search algorithm which is used only for evaluation and assessment of different recognition and training strategies. When the uttered sentence is known, as is the case during the phase of development and performance evaluation of a speech recognition system, the beam search threshold can be based on the best path obtained through a forced alignment of the input speech with the HMM representation of the true sentence. This allows a further reduction of the search space, since the beam search threshold will be greatly reduced whenever the correct path is the same as the best path found by the forced alignment. This occurs often during long content words, and rarely during short function words. Overall it leads to a useful reduction in computation. 2. REVIEW OF THE RECOGNIZER STRUCTURE A more detailed description of the large vocabulary continuous"]},{"title":"speech","paragraphs":["recognition system implemented by the algorithms described in this paper can be found in Refs[6] [7]. Three state, continuous density, HMM's are used to represent each of the units (except silence which is represented by a single state HMM). There are only two transitions leaving from a state, a self loop transition and a transition to the next state. Transition probabilities are not used during the likelihood computation, since it has been experimentally shown that they don't affect the recognition performance. Within each state S~ of each model, the spectral observation probability density is represented by a weighted mixture of My multivariate normal density functions. In addition, each state has associated with it a log energy histogram El(e) representing the logarithm of the probability of observing a frame with log-energy e while in state S~. 313 3.

The body of each word is a simple linear sequence of units and is assumed to be independent of the neighboring words.

THE GRAMMAR COMPONENT The sequence of words defining legal sentences within the task grammar are expressed through a finite state network (FSN) and a list of permitted word pairs. In the FSN used in the experiments, the entire vocabulary is divided into four independent sets, with no overlap. These sets consist of the following: BE which includes the words that can he spo_ken at the beginning of a sentence but not at the end;"]},{"title":"BE","paragraphs":["which includes the words that can he spoken at the end of a sentence but not at the beginning;"]},{"title":"BE","paragraphs":["which includes the words that can he s_p_oken either at the beginning or end of a sentence; and"]},{"title":"BE,","paragraphs":["which includes the words that cannot be spoken either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. Language constraints, in the form of word occurrence statistics such as bigrams or word pairs, can be used in the recognition algorithm. The word pair grammar, specifying the words that are allowed to follow a given word, has a perplexity of about 60 for the resource management task. The language perplexity is equal to the number of different words (i.e. 991) when no word constraints are used. 5. STATIC INFORMATION USED IN THE DECODER The decoding (recognition) algorithm uses a network (decoding network) that integrates acoustic, phonological, lexical, and syntactical models, in order to find the sequence of words that gives the best interpretation of the input sentence in terms of likelihood. The decoding network is obtained by substituting the corresponding lexical models along every arc of the FSN that represents the language. Of course, if interword units are used, the connections between words at the FSN nodes must be made according to the phonological rules defined for those units. The use of a word pair grammar greatly increases the complexity of the decoding network since new nodes must be added to the original FSN in order to allow only the valid sequences of word pairs. Thus, even a simple FSN can become very large when interword units and word pairs are taken into account. Generally speaking, one can always trade off memory for computing time. In this particular case the network does not have to be completely compiled (i.e. a detailed list made of all nodes and arcs) but, for instance, word pair constraints can be taken into account by saving the run time decoding information associated with every arc of the network which joins at a given node of the original FSN at a given flame, and using this information to check the word pair constraints before extending new paths out of the same node. This procedure, that we call"]},{"title":"interpreted decoding","paragraphs":["as opposed to"]},{"title":"compiled decoding,","paragraphs":["has been used in preliminary versions of the algorithm. The interpreted decoding leads to a highly inefficient implementation in terms of computing time, to decode a given string. This is because the basic operation for decoding, namely checking matches for word pair constraints, cannot generally be coded in a form that can be efficiently parallelized and vectofized. Thus, as stated in the introduction of this paper, a vectofized compiled representation of the decoding networks is necessary for taking advantage of the parallel and vectofized architecture of the computer used for the recognition experiments.

The first set are those units that must always be followed by silence, i.e. they are constrained to have silence as the right context. In order to avoid problems when using a word pair grammar, these units are realized by appending the silence model (consisting of a one state HMM) to the specific unit model and considering the sequence of the two models as a single model. 1 Units I States I Heads I Tails I Connections 1 I I I I 1769 1 47641 1 8082 1 3486 1 274863 TABLE","paragraphs":["1."]},{"title":"Statistics on static information with two different unit sets The second set includes all those units that are followed by an optional silence. Again, for ease of implementation, these units are duplicated when they appear in the tail of a word and a silence model is appended to one of the two instantiations. 6. DYNAMIC INFORMATION IN THE DECODER The information related to active states in the state vector must be stored at each step of the decoding algorithm. This information includes: the current score (SCORE), the pointer to the previous lexical item (BPO) on the best path reaching that state at the current time, and a time marker (BEG) indicating when the current best path entered into the current lexical item. Due to the Markovian property of the models, the decoding process needs only the score and the pointers relative to the last processed frame. Hence the three arrays are doubled in size, the OLD version of each array is relative to the previously processed frame, while the NEW version is relative to the current frame. At the end of the processing for the current frame, the pointers NEW and OLD are flipped. In order to be able to backtrack the best path from the last frame to the beginning of the sentence and decode the recognized sequence of words, we have to store the back pointers and the time markers along the whole decodmg process. The amount of memory needed for keeping this information is not negligible as this information must be recorded for every arc of the FSN","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"for every frame of the decoded sentence. A possible solution to reduce the amount of memory for the backtracking information consists in implementing a partial backtracking strategyLg1,","paragraphs":["[lo]."]},{"title":"In the partial backtracking, the backpointers are checked during the decoding in order to find some past node that is the only ancestor of all the currently active nodes (immortal node). Hence a partial section of the global optimal path can be tracked back from the current immortal node to a previously detected immortal node, and all the backtracking information in the time segment between the two immortal nodes can be deleted, making memory available for new data. The partial backtracking strategy is advisable for a real time, continuously running, implementation of the decoding algorithm, where we do not know in advance the maximum duration of sentences. Since in the version of the system used for speech recognizer performance evaluation we know the maximum duration of any sentence and the memory needed for the backtracking information is within the capability of the computers we use, we didn't implement the partial backtracking strategy. For a given frame and a given arc, the backtracking information has to be recorded when a unique interpretation of the back-pointers is available for that arc. Since arcs have head segments joining at the first state of the body segment and each head segment may have a different back pointer at a given stage of the decoding, the only place where the information relative to the previous arc is unique is along the body segment. Thus the backpointers of the first state of the body segment of each arc are recorded at each time frame. For two phone words, that don't have a body segment, the recorded backpointers are those relative to the best path among those exiting from the last state of every head segment. 7. THE FINAL DECODING ALGORITHM The diagram in Fig.2 shows the breakdown of the decoding process for one frame of input speech into functional blocks. In the remainder of this section we analyze the main implementation characteristics of each block. 7.1 Internal states This block performs the dynamic programming optimization for all the active states in the state vector.

The operation performed in this block is completely parallelized and vectorized.","I INTERNAL STATES ]","V","I INNER CONNECTIONS I","V"]},{"title":"I otrrER CONNECTIONS t","paragraphs":["I LIST UPDATING I","V I LOCAL LIKELH\"IOOD I Figure 2.

Propagates the path corresponding to the last state of the body to the first state of each tail of the word, if it has a greater score. This is a parallelized operation. 7.3 Outer connections Outer connections are those among the tails of a word and the heads of another word. This operation is performed only for active arcs. An arc is considered active when at least one tail end state is active. The pointers to active arcs are kept in a list LSTC(i), i=l,N~cave c that is updated at the end of the processing of each frame. In the most efficient implementation the connections are compiled into a vector. The elements of this vector are the locations, within the state vector, of the states that are connected to a given word tail. 7.4 List updating The beam search pruning of states is performed in this block. In the standard implementation, at the i-th frame, a prumng threshold O; is set as: O i = AinU'_ A where A m~' is the maximum likelihood among the active states at the i-th frame and A is a fixed constant. Hence the likelihood of all states that are active at the i-th frame is compared with (9,.. A state is then included in the new list if its likelihood is greater than the threshold O i. The list updating operation is computationally demanding due to the sequential nature of the operations to he performed. There are five sets of states that are potentially active at the i-th frame. They are all the states that were active at the previous frame, all the successors of the states that were active at the previous frame, all body initial states, all head initial states, and all tail initial states. For computing the maximum state likelihood A max', and for the subsequent state pruning and list updating, it is necessary to check all five sets of states. This produces a computational overhead for the intersection of the different sets of states (e.g. a state in the first set may also he in the second set; hence the checking operation is performed twice for that state) which leads to an inefficient implementation. A solution is to keep an additional vector LIVE (i) whose generic j-th element is set to true any time the j-th state in the state vector is set to a new likelihood value during the decoding (all the elements of LIVE(i) are set to false before the decoding of each frame). To further improve the implementation of this block, the list updating operation is performed in a concurrent mode, first generating partial lists of active states, and then merging the partial lists into the final list. Moreover, whenever a state is put into the active state list, the corresponding phonetic unit is marked as active setting to true the corresponding location of a vector USE(i), i=l ..... Nunit s. This is done in order to restrict the local likelihood computation only to active units. An additional operation is performed by this block and consists in updating the list of active arcs. An arc is considered to be active, for the purpose of propagating its score through outer connections, if at least a tail final state is active. Again, in the parallel implementation, partial active arc lists are computed first, and then merged into the final active arc list. 3!6 7.5 Local likelihood While local likelihood computation in discrete density HMM's is a simple table lookup, with mixture density HMM's it becomes one of the major computational loads of the entire decoding procedure. A particularly optimized version of the state local likelihood computation has been implemented, enhancing the vectorized structure of the computation. Also, the local likelihood is computed only for active units, i.e. when the value of"]},{"title":"USE(i)","paragraphs":["is set to true. 7.6 Guided search We have also developed a particularly efficient version of the recognizer suited only for experimental assessment of speech recognition accuracy. When assessing performance on a test database, the correct string that has to be recognized is known a priori for every uttered sentence. The forced alignment of the test speech, with the network representing the actually uttered sentence, produces a path whose frame-by-frame score (self score) may be used to further reduce the size of the search space. The concept behind the guided search is that the overall best path will have a final score that cannot be inferior to the final score of the forced alignment procedure. This is not true for the local score along the overall best path and the forced alignment path. It may happen that the overall best path drops below the score of the forced alignment path at a certain point in the search, eventually attaining a better score later in the search. Moreover, if the guided search is performed in a frame synchronous fashion, i.e. the forced alignment is carried out frame synchronously with the recognition, we actually don't know which is the best path in the forced alignment. A non frame synchronous version that first performs the forced alignment, then performs a backtracking along the best path and saves all the local score values, would require too much memory to store the backtracking information during the alignment phase. Thus, only the score of the locally (not globally) best path is available during the frame synchronous alignment. The threshold is computed by decrementing the score of the locally best path by a fixed amount in order to take into account the above mentioned sources of error. 7.7 Timing experiments Timing experiments have been performed during the development of the algorithm to assess the efficiency of the entire speech recognition system. All the performance scores reported in this section were obtained during the recognition of several sentences using a phone set of 1172 sub-word units. The maximum number of mixture components per state was 16, while the dimension of the observation vector was 24. The guided search strategy was used in all the experiments. Table 3 shows the average time (in seconds) per sentence (TPS), and average time per decoded frame (TPF), in 3 different versions of the recognizer.

CONCLUSIONS This paper provided a detailed presentation of all aspects of the implementation of a large vocabulary speaker independent continuous speech recognizer to be used as a tool for the development of recognition algorithms based on hidden Markov models and Viterbi decoding. The complexity of HMM recognizers is greatly increased by the introduction of detailed context dependent units for representing interword coarticulafion. A vectorized representation of the data structures involved in the decoding process, along with compilation of the connection information among temporally consecutive words, has led to a speed up of the algorithm of about one order of magnitude. An average recognition time of about one minute per sentence (on the computer configuration used in the experiments), although far from real time, allows us to perform a series of training experiments and to tune the recogmtion system parameters in order to obtain high performance recognition on complex tasks such as the DARPA resource management. 9.
