Klatt","t One does not necessarily require a phonetic baseform to add a new word to a recognition system [ I, 2], but if the system is odginaUy based on phonetic baseforms, the system structure is complicated by having more than one type of recognition model present. [3] reviews various approaches to this problem; most solutions involve some set of human-derived rules combined with a dictionary lookup procedure for exceptions. The best systems seem to produce correct baseforms for 95%-98% of the words in running text. We believe that such systems are inadequate to handle the baseform construction problem in speech recognition for several reasons. First, many new words in speech recognition systems are either names or task-specific jargon (see discussion in section 4). Pronunciation of such items tend to be highly irregular and present substantial difficulties for text-to-speech systems [3]. Second, talkers tend to develop idiosyncratic pronunciations of many words, especially proper names.

While in theory it should be possible to deduce a baseform from the utterance alone, current speech recognition systems do not yet produce phonetic transcriptions with a high enough accuracy for this to be feasible. We follow the basic approach as described in Lucassen [4]. In particular, our goal is to find the phone string T' to maximize P('P I £,/'/) ~"]},{"title":"argmaxP(Lt","paragraphs":["I 7~)p(7 ~ I £).

This is a standard speech recognition problem in which p(H I ~) is computed with an acoustic model, usually a Hidden Markov Model [5], and p(P I £) is computed with a language model. In Lucassen's work, this language model was constructed automatically from pairs of word spellings and pronunciations with the aid of a decision tree.","We have advanced Lucassen's original work in the following directions. First, the construction of decision trees has 179 been studied in much more detail [6, 7, 8] since the original work was performed; this allows us to construct better trees. Second, Lucassen only had the data in Webster's 7th Dictionary avaliable in incomplete form for training the decision trees; we now have access to other sources of data; e.g., the 20000 baseforms used in the Tangora [9]. We have also substantially improved our techniques for aligning phone strings agianst letter strings, a crucial component of decision tree construction (Section 2.2). Third, Lucassen used a single utterance of a word to construct a baseform; we have since found that multiple utterances of a word can be utilized to construct a more consistent baseform. Finally, in the original study, the evaluation of all baseforms was done via visual inspection and recognition performance was not measured; we will describe a series of experiments in which we attempt to evaluate the performance of the baseforms for recognition.","The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of decision trees for spelling to sound rules. Section 3 describes how a phonetic baseform is decoded using one or more utterances in conjunction with the spelling-to-soundrules.

Therefore, for each combination of binary question and context element, the data will be partitioned into two sub-collections; corresponding to each sub-collection is a probability distribution over the pronunciations r. We select the question by and context element k that minimizes the average entropy of the two distributions corresponding to the two sub-collections. We now repeat the above procedure for each of the sub-collections individually. The data is thus successively split into smaller and smaller collections until some termination criterion is met; the result is a tree of binary questions about different context elements. The leaves of the tree consist of probability distributionsp(r) which can be used in equation 2, above.","There are various termination criteria that can be used to avoid overtraining trees by growing them too deeply. Lucassen used a combination of seven different termination criteria at a node; Breiman [7] recommends growing the tree quite deeply and then pruning it back to minimize the entropy on held-out data. We use the following two techniques, which are quite simple to implement. First, a threshold is placed on"]},{"title":"180","paragraphs":["the product of the number of samples at a node and the entropy ofp(r). Second, the data is divided into two parts, A and B. The data in part .,4 is first used to construct the tree. When a question b i and context position k is selected using data from part -4 at a particular node in the tree, data from part B is also propagated to this node and the average cross entropy between the .,4 and B data is calculated. If the reduction in cross entropy is below a threshold, the node is not expanded, otherwise the B data is split as the ,4 data and used at the next level of tree construction. This way, spurious questions that result from a lack of training data may be eliminated. After a tree using -4 is constructed, the roles of-4 and B are reversed and a second tree is grown. The predictions from both trees are then averaged to compute p(TZ I £).","In order to be robust with respect to new data, it is usually important to smooth the distributions at the leaves of the tree. This is typically done via deleted estimation [5]: one tries to maximize the probability of some held-out data with the model by adjusting a set of smoothing coefficients. The most powerful technique is to smooth the distribution at a leaf with a linear combination of the distributions leading up to the root of the tree from the leaf. The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it requires that each leaf be represented in the held-out data. There are various solutions to this problem [4, 6] but they require very careful manipulation of the training and held-out data. Instead, we have developed a simple recursive smoothing scheme that operates in the following fashion. Held-out data is poured down the tree from the root. Each node is assigned a class that is a function of the number of held-out data samples that appear. Each node n in the tree is smoothed according to: p'~ = Al(cn)p. + A2(cn)p}cn~ + A3(C.)U"]},{"title":"(5)","paragraphs":["wherep' denotes the smoothed distribution,p, the unsmoothed distribution on held-out data, f (n), the father node of n, c(n), the count class of node n, and u, the uniform distribution. The As are computed via deleted estimation [5]; the p's may be computed recursively from the root down for each iteration of deleted estimation. The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it strongly favors node distributions close to the leaf in question for smoothing; for trees with many levels, this may be disadvantageous."]},{"title":"2.2 Data Preparation","paragraphs":["The main task in data preparation for decision tree construction lies in determining a series of pronunciations for the letters and in extracting the data items for each letter. It is assumed that there exists a source of words matched against phone strings. Our primary source of such material was an online version of Webster's 7th Collegiate Dictionary. To this we added the phonetic baseforms from our 20K word recognition system, yielding a total of roughly 80K word-phone string pairs. A substantial amount of time was spent \"completing\" the entries in Webster's - inflections and variant pronunciations were indicated by a shorthand notation that was not trivial to unravel. In addition, the notation the dictionary used to indicate pronunciation was not consistent with the notation in our recognition system; notation in Webster's had to be converted to match our 'style' of writing baseforms. For example, Webster's makes many more distinctions between vowels than we do; certain endings are consistently transcribed differently; e.g., we typically represent -ment as 'm eh0 n t' while in Webster's it is found as 'm uh0 n t', etc.. Converting pronunciation formats to be consistent with local conventions is a generic problem in trying to utilize online dictionaries and often can take more time to solve that to employ the dam.","Given such a set of data, the next step is to determine a set of pronunciations for each letter. First, an initial guess is made and a set of pronunciations is selected for each letter. A hidden markov model is generated for each letter whose outputs represent the allowable pronunciations for the letter. An HMM for the letter d is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Hidden Markov Model for Pronunciations of the letter d.","There are five permissible pronunciations of d: D as in 'dog', T as in 'passed', D EEl as in 'PhD', D ZH as in 'graduate', and ~ as in the second 'd' in 'ladder'. The HMM for a word may be constructed by concatenating the HMMs for the letters; the models are now trained using the phone strings as output data. Once the models are trained, a Viterbi alignment is made of all the phone strings against the letter strings for each word. A certain number of the alignments will fail, either because the original pronunciation set was deficient or because there was an error in the original phone string for the word. Based on observing the misalignments, one may augment the original pronunciation set or correct an incorrect baseform, and repeat the procedure as many times as might be necessary. One may then simply obtain the data items for each letter from a combination of the Viterbi alignment and the pronunciation inventory; however, we find that there is often complete arbitrariness the way certain letter strings are aligned against phones; for example, sometimes the phone T will be aligned against the first t in the letter string \"tt\" and other times, the second. To enforce homogeneity, it is sometimes useful to post-process the Viterbi alignment. The baseforms are written using a set of 50 phones; we typically develop an inventory of 130 pronunciations. Typical letters average 5 pronunciations; some vowels, such as 'u', have up to 13 different pronunciations. 181"]},{"title":"3 Decoding New Baseforms","paragraphs":["To determine the best phonetic baseform using the concept of pronunciations, we can rewrite equation 1 in terms of pronunciation strings to find 7~ such that: argmaxp(l.l 17~)p('E 1£) (6) In the above equation, p(/,/I 7~) may be identified with the acoustic model component of a standard Hidden Markov Model based speech recognition system, and p(7~"]},{"title":"I z)","paragraphs":["with the language model component. The task of determining a phonetic baseform by combining acoustic information with spelling-to-sound rules is substantially simpler than the typical speech recognition problem. First, the 'vocabulary' is not large, typically 130 pronunciations. Second, the number of 'words' in each 'sentence' is determined by the length of the letter string. However, the number of language model states, determined by the number of tree leaves, can be quite large (on the order of several thousand) thus making a Viterbi-type decoder somewhat unwieldy. Instead, a simple stack decoder [5] was implemented to determine the phonetic baseforms. For the n 'h letter of the word in question, we define the score za tobe z~(l~,"]},{"title":"r~)","paragraphs":["a logp(u I r.) + logp(r, [ r~_-~, l\"+S x ~"]},{"title":"z~(l~- i, r~ -I )","paragraphs":["where subscripts and superscripts refer to strings of letters or pronunciations.

Note that z~ may be computed recursively by proceeding left to right through the letters of the word. Since each letter in the word can have many different pronunciations, we only examine for the n th letter the pronunciation strings associated with the top m values of za from the (n - 1) 'h letter; we have observed that m = 16 or m = 32 is usually satisfactory. We have also foundit necessary to premultiply logp(u [ r,) by a factor a between. 1 and .5 to obtain better baseforms. This crudely compensates for poor modelling of time correlation in the Hidden Markov Models.","The above algorithm is only suitable for producing a baseform when there is a single utterance of each word. When there are multiple utterances, we must modify the algorithm slightly. For each utterance of a particular word, we use the above algorithm to produce the top m-scoring pronunciations rather than a single pronunciation, and separately keep track of the score due to the acoustic component and the spelling-to-sound rules. We form the union of all pronunciations across all utterances for each word, and from those pronunciations, find the pronunciation 7~ to maximize p 13 logp(b/i I \"R.) + logp('R.

To examine performance, we found the most frequently occurring words not in our 20000 vocabulary from a corpus of one million words of recent internal electronic mail. We selected a random subset of 500 words from this list, and had two talkers each read the list of words on two different days. Each word was read four times each in a single sentence on both days; e.g., \"hello hello hello hello\". Baseforms were produced using the above techniques under several conditions; in all cases, the baseforms produced were used in conjunction with the 20000 baseforms already in the recognition systems' vocabulary to recognize the second four repetitions recorded from each talker. All recognition took place with a language model that predicted each word uniformly. Talkers recorded our 100 standard training sentences [10] to train the parameters of the Hidden Markov Models. Endpoints of words were located automatically by obtaining a Viterbi alignment of the VQ output against the top baseform produced by the spelling to sound rules. This introduced some errors into the results (see below).","The conditions examined were","(7) 1. Spelling-to-sound rules alone used to create baseforms.

Baseforms made from all four utterances; spelling-to-sound rules score contribution set to zero.","Note that the fourth and fifth conditions are not identical to completely ignoring the spelling of the word; the number of letters in the word will determine the length of the pronunciation string (though letters can be given the null pronunciation).","Only 31% of the 500 words were covered by the 80000 words used to determine the spelling-to-sound rules. For that matter, we found that even a much larger word list, generated by combining a list of 40000 common acronyms with the 20000 words in our vocabulary and 250000 words in the Shoup dictionary [11], only covered 60% of these 500 words. Most of the missing words consist of names, acronyms, and specialized jargon, once again illustrating that straightforward dictionary lookup procedures are not adequate for adding words to a vocabulary.","Recognition results for each of the two talkers across all five conditions are shown in Table 2, and compared to results on handwritten baseforms.

Spelling-to-soundrules whencombined with four utterances of the word produce baseforms that perform quite competitively with handwritten baseforms; spelling-to-sound rules with a single utterance, or acoustics alone with four utterances yield slightly worse recognition results.

Visual inspection of the baseforms generated by combining spelling-to-sound rules with four utterances of each word for Talker 1 indicated approximately one-tenth of the baseforms contained some error (as defined above). Approximately one-half the errors occurred on names, one-quarter on acronyms, and one-quarter on actual words. For comparison, the list of 500 words contained 60% words or jargon, 35 % names, and 5% acronyms. An acronym is considered to be not only strings of letters but combinations of strings of letters and words; e.g. 'PCSTORE' is pronounced 'pee-see-store'. One error ('AAA', pronounced 'triple-A') resulted from the word's pronunciation having essentially nothing to do with its spelling. Table 3 lists 10 of the sample errors (chosen at random among the 50).","Some of the above errors, as for \"dingles\", \"Gonzales\", \"megapels .... Stefanos\" and \"cepstrum\", never resulted in recognition errors, in spite of what subjectively seemed to be substantial errors in the baseforms. The acronym errors were traced a flaw in the endpoint detection algorithm. Endpoints were detected via Viterbi alignment against baseforms produced by the spelling-to-sound rules alone; the baseforms are so terrible for acronyms that substantial misalignment occurred during endpoint detection, generating faulty input to the baseform generator. Very few acronyms were present in the data used to generate the spelling-to-sound rule trees; in-clusion of such data might have generated better baseforms. Finally, it should be pointed out that both talkers were not always consistent across recording sessions in their pronunciations of words. For example, the name \"Kanevsky\", pronounced \"kq uh0 n ehl v s k ee0\", was mispronounced in the first recording session as \"kq eil n v eel s k all\", and the word \"cations\" was initially pronounced \"kq ael tail uh0 n z\" and dingles Gonzales Irwin megapels"]},{"title":"NBS","paragraphs":["ODAS Stefanos Yong BC cepstrum dil ngglz guh0nzaallz uh0 er0 w il n m eh 1 g uh0 p pq uh01 z Comment Missing uh0 before 'T' Missing eh0 before \"z\" Inserted uh0; er0 should be erl Last uh0 should be be ehl","ehl s Acronym Acronym; no baseform produced","s t tq eh I f uh0 n aul should be oul","au 1 ug z","j aal n n should be ng","b k kq Acronym","tqsh ehl ppqs t tq sh should be kq","tqr uhl m Table 3: Sample errors in automatic baseform generation. then \"k eil sh uh0 n z\".

However, the spelling-to-sound rules obviously have more problems with names and acronyms than actual words; we attribute this at least in part to the fact that there were relatively few names and acronyms in the data used to construct the spelling-to-sound rule trees. We feel that in-cluding such information would give the spelling-to-sound rules substantially more power, and are currently working on obtaining data from such sources to improve the quality of baseform construction.","It is hard to compare the performance of this technique with techniques that try to deduce the baseform from the spelling alone. Typical figures quoted are between a 3% and 5% error rate in running text. Crudely speaking, we have observed that a fixed 20000 word vocabulary covers about 93% of completely new text across a variety of sources, implying 7% of the words encountered will be new and must be added to the vocabulary. From the previous section, we calculated a 10% error rate on such new words in constructing baseforms, which would imply we would generate incorrect baseforms for less than 1% of words in running text. It is clear that this hardly impacts the 5% recognition error we obtain in the the laboratory.","In conclusion, we believe we have a viable technique for generating good phonetic baseforms for new words in speech recognition systems. Work is currently progressing to incorporate more data in the above algorithms, and to employ this technique in other components of the speech recognizer to 183 supply us with the ability to adapt the phonetic baseforms for words already in the vocabulary of the recognizer."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["[1] L.
