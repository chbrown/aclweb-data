The development of a robust algorithm to determine the location of a talker is a fundamental is-sue for a microphone-array system. Here, a two-step talker-location algorithm is introduced. Step 1 is a rather conventional filtered cross-correlation method; the cross-correlation between some pair of microphones is determined to high accuracy using a some-what novel, fast interpolation on the sampled data. Then, using the fact that the delays for a point source should fit a hyperbola, a best hyperbolic fit is obtained using nonlinear optimization. A method which fits the hyperbola directly to peak-picked delays is shown to be far less robust than an algorithm which fits the hyperbola in the cross-correlation space. An efficient, global nonlinear optimization technique, Stochastic region Contraction (SRC) is shown to yield highly accurate (>90%), and computationally efficient, results for a normal ambient."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the problems for all speech input is the necessity for the talker to be encumbered by a hcadmounted, hand-held, or fixed position microphone, or, perhaps, a technician-conlxolled mechanical unidirectional microphone. Whether for teleconferencing [I], speech recognition [2], or large-room recording or conferencing [3], an intelligent, eleclronically-aimed unidirectional microphone would overcome this problem. Array techniques hold the best promise to bring such a system to practicality.","Algorithms for passive tracking -- the determina-tion of range, bearing, speed, and signature as a function of time for a moving object -- have been studied for nearly 100 years partiomLqrly for radar and sonar systems. While there is currently much activity involved with the wacking of multiple sources using variants of the eigenvalue-hased decomposition MUSIC algorithm, [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], most systems still use correlational techniques"]},{"title":"[9], [10], [11].","paragraphs":["The method presented here is also based on correlation. First, a coarse, normalized cross-correlation function is computed over the delay range of interest. It turns out that, even for the relatively high sampfing rate of 20kHz, the 5Olas resolution of the time-delay estimates causes derived locations to be unsatisfactory. However, the latter may be refined by nearly two orders of magnitude through accurate interpolation techniques which can be attained for a relatively small computational using multirate filtering[12].","For M microphones, one can estimate M-1 in-dependent relative delays. As, theoretically, only two relative delays are needed to triangulate a source, for M >3, the system is overspecified. However, since noise is always present in a real system, this extra information can be profitably used to overcome some of the effects of the noise. In fact, the geometry of the array constrains the vector of relative delays. For example, a simple linear array, with all the microphones on the axis, y=0, has delays constrained to be on a particular hyperbola with a focus on the target. Therefore, errors in the estimation of the delays may be corrected by fitting the best hyperbola. Two methods for doing so are presented here.","In the first method, Time-Delay Estimation, Hyperbolic Fit (TDEHF), peak-picking is used on the results of the interpolated cross-correlations to estimate the individual time delays. Then, constrained nonfincar optimization is used to fit the best hyperbola through the sparse rime-delay estimations. As the data turn out to be pretty much unimodal, gradient techniques [13] were used to minimize a least-squares functional.
