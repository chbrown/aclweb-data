These issues are relevant not just to the work within a particular R&D group, but also to the exchange of technology among different groups. In particular, technology transfer among speech recognition groups is inhibited by the lack of convenient and powerful means for exchanging programs and d~t~:","Under a Phase I SBIR grant from DARPA, Entropic will begin the development of a new Speech Recognition Package (SRP) using advanced software engineering techniques, including abstract interfaces, object-oriented programming, machine-independent numeric types, and selfdescribing objects. These techniques have already been applied to speech and signal processing in two commercial products -- the Enu'opic Signal Processing System (ESPS) and waves+ (the ESPS graphics interface). ESPS and waves+ will be used as a technology base for the SRP.","The Phase I effort will include an analysis of requiremerits followed by the design and implementation of prototype modules. 416"]}]}
