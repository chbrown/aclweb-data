INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["In natural language processing, syntactic and semantic knowledge are deeply intertwined with each other, both in their acquisition and usage. The goal of our research is to build a syntactic and semantic knowledge base through an iterative process that involves both language processing and language acquisition. We start the process by parsing a large corpus with a manually constructed parser that has only syntactic knowledge. We then extract lexical semantic and statistical knowledge from the parsed corpus, such as similar words and phrases, collocations and idiomatic expressions, and selectional preferences. In the second cycle, the text corpus is parsed again with the assistance of the newly acquired semantic and statistical knowledge, which allows the parser to better resolve systematic syntactic ambiguities, removing unlikely parts of speech. Our hypothesis is that this will result in higher quality parse trees, which in turn allows extraction of higher quality semantic and statistical knowledge in the second and later cycles. LaTaT is a Language and Text Analysis Toolset that demonstrates this iterative learning process. The main components in the toolset consist of the following:","• A broad coverage English parser, called Minipar. The grammar is constructed manually, based on the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995). Instead of using a large number of CFG rules, Minipar achieves its broad coverage by using a small set of principles to constrain the overgerating X-bar schema;","• A collocation extractor that extracts frequency counts of grammatical dependency relationships from a corpus parsed with Minipar. The frequency counts are then injected into Minipar to help it rank candidate parse trees;","• A thesaurus constructor (Lin, 1998) that automatically computes the word similarities based on the distributional characteristics of words in the parsed corpus. The resulting word similarity database can then be used to smooth the probability distribution in statistical language models (Dagan et al, 1997);","• A clustering algorithm that constructs Roget-like semantic categories in an unsupervised fashion (Lin and Pantel, 2001a); and","• An unsupervised learner to identify similar expressions from a parsed corpus (Lin and Pantel, 2001b)."]},{"title":"2. Minipar","paragraphs":["Minipar is a principle-based English parser (Berwick et al, 1991). Like Principar (Lin, 1993), Minipar represents its grammar as a network where nodes represent grammatical categories and links represent types of syntactic (dependency) relationships. The grammar network consists of 35 nodes and 59 links. Additional nodes and links are created dynamically to represent subcategories of verbs. Minipar employs a message passing algorithm that essentially implements distributed chart parsing. Instead of maintaining a single chart, each node in the grammar network maintains a chart containing partially built structures belonging to the grammatical category represented by the node. The grammatical principles are implemented as constraints associated with the nodes and links. The lexicon in Minipar is derived from WordNet (Miller, 1990). With additional proper names, the lexicon contains about 130,000 entries (in base form). The lexicon entry of a word lists all possible parts of speech of the word and its subcategorization frames (if any). The lexical ambiguities are handled by the parser instead of a tagger. Minipar works with a constituency grammar internally. However, the output of Minipar is a dependency tree. A dependency relationship is an asymmetric binary relationship between a word called head, and another word called modifier (Mel’čuk, 1987). The structure of a sentence can be represented by a set of dependency relationships that form a tree. A word in the sentence may have several modifiers, but each word may modify at most one word. The root of the dependency tree does not modify any word. It is also called the head of the sentence. Figure 1 shows an example dependency tree for the sentence John found a solution to the problem. The links in the diagram represent dependency relationships. The direction of a link is from the head to the modifier in the relationship. Labels  associated with the links represent types of dependency relations. Table 1 lists a subset of the dependency relations in Minipar outputs. Minipar constructs all possible parses of an input sentence. However, only the highest ranking parse tree is outputted. Although the grammar is manually constructed, the selection of the best parse tree is guided by the statistical information obtained by parsing a 1GB corpus with Minipar. The statistical ranking of parse trees is based on the following probabilistic model. The probability of a dependency tree is defined as the product of the probabilities of the dependency relationships in the tree. Formally, given a tree T with root root consisting of D dependency relationships (headi, relationshipi, modifieri), the probability of T is given by:"]},{"title":"() ( ) ( )∏","paragraphs":["="]},{"title":"=","paragraphs":["D i iii"]},{"title":"head|ifiermod,iprelationshProotPTP","paragraphs":["1  where P(relationshipi, modifieri | headi) is obtained using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Minipar parses newspaper text at about 500 words per second on a Pentium-III 700Mhz with 500MB memory. Evaluation with the manually parsed SUSANNE corpus (Sampson, 1995) shows that about 89% of the dependency relationships in Minipar outputs are correct."]},{"title":"3. Collocation and Word Similarity","paragraphs":["We define a collocation to be a dependency relationship that occurs more frequently than predicted by assuming the two words in the relationship are independent of each other. Lin (1998) presented a method to create a collocation database by parsing a large corpus. Given a word w, the database can be used to retrieve all the dependency relationships involving w and the frequency counts of the dependency relationships. Table 2 shows excerpts of the entries in the collocation database for the words duty and responsibility. For example, in the corpus from which the collocation database is constructed, fiduciary duty occurs 319 times and assume [the] responsibility occurs 390 times. The collocation database entry of a given word can be viewed as a feature vector for that word. Similarity between words can be computed using the feature vectors. Intuitively, the more features that are shared between two words, the higher the similarity between the two words will be. This intuition is captured by the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1985). Features of words are of varying degree of importance. For example, while almost any noun can be used as object of include, very few nouns can be modified by fiduciary. Two words sharing the feature object-of-include is less indicative of their similarity Table 2. Excerpts of entries in the collocation database for duty and responsibility.

The similarity measure proposed in (Lin, 1998) takes this into account by computing the mutual information between two words involved in a dependency relationship. Using the collocation database, (Lin, 1998) presented an unsupervised method to construct a similarity matrix. Given a word w, the matrix returns a set of similar words of w along with their similarity to w. For example, the 35 most similar words of duty, Beethoven, and eat are shown in Table 3. The similarity matrix consists of about 20,000 nouns, 4,000 verbs and 6,000 adjectives and adverbs."]},{"title":"4. Unsupervised Induction of Semantic Classes","paragraphs":["Consider the similar words of Beethoven. The quality of similar words obviously decreases as the similarity value decreases. Some of the words have non-zero similarity simply because they share common features with Beethoven by accident. For example, tough guy is similar to Beethoven because both Beethoven and tough guy can be used as the object of the verb play. The similar words of duty exemplify another problem: The top similar words of a given word may be similar to different senses of the word. However, this is not made explicit by the similarity matrix. LaTaT includes an algorithm called UNICON (UNsupervised Induction of CONcepts) that clusters similar words to create semantic classes (Lin and Pantel, 2001a). UNICON uses a heuristic maximal-clique algorithm, called CLIMAX, to find clusters in the similar words of a given word. The purpose of CLIMAX is to find small, tight clusters. For example, two of the clusters returned by CLIMAX are:","(Nq34 \"Harvard University\" 0.610996 Harvard 0.482834 \"Stanford University\" 0.469302 \"University of Chicago\" 0.454686 \"Columbia University\" 0.44262 \"New York University\" 0.436737 \"University of Michigan\" 0.43055 \"Yale university\" 0.416731 MIT 0.414907 \"University of Pennsylvania\" 0.384016 \"Cornell University\" 0.333958",")","(Nq184 \"University of Rochester\" 0.525389 \"University of Miami\" 0.466607 \"University of Colorado\" 0.46347 \"Ohio State University\" 0.430326 \"University of Florida\" 0.398765 \"Harvard Medical School\" 0.39485 \"University of North Carolina\" 0.394256 \"University of Houston\" 0.371618",") Nq34 and Nq184 are automatically generated names for the clusters. The number after each word in the clusters is the similarity between the word and the centroid of that cluster. The UNICON algorithm computes the centroids of a cluster by averaging the collocational features of the words in the cluster. The CLIMAX algorithm is then recursively used to construct clusters of centroids and the clusters whose centroids are clustered together are merged. This process continues until no more clusters are merged. The details of the UNICON and CLIMAX algorithms are presented in (Lin and Pantel, 2001a). Table 4 shows 10 sample semantic classes identified by the UNICON algorithm, using a 1GB newspaper text corpus."]},{"title":"5. Automatic Discovery of Inference Rules","paragraphs":["In many natural language processing and information retrieval applications, it is very useful to know the paraphrase relationships between natural language expressions. LaTaT includes an unsupervised method for discovering paraphrase inference rules from text, such as X is author of Y ≈ X wrote Y, X solved Y ≈ X found a solution to Y, and X caused Y ≈ Y is triggered by X (Lin and Pantel, 2001b). Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris Distributional Hypothesis. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus.","Table 3.

A path allows us to represent indirect semantic relationships between two content words. We name a path by concatenating dependency relationships and words along the path, excluding the words at the two ends. For the sentence in Figure 1, the path between John and problem is named: N:subj:V!find\"V:obj:N\"solution\"N:to:N (meaning X finds solution to Y). The root of the path is find. A path begins and ends with two dependency relations. We call them the two slots of the path: SlotX on the left-hand side and SlotY on the right-hand side. The words connected by the path are the fillers of the slots. For example, John fills the SlotX and problem fills the SlotY in the above example. We extract the fillers and frequency counts of all the slots of all the paths in a parsed corpus. Table 5 shows an excerpt of the fillers of two paths. The underlying assumption of algorithm is that when the meanings of paths are similar, their corresponding sets of fillers share a large number of common words. Richardson (1997) extracted semantic relationships (e.g., hypernym, location, material and purpose) from dictionary definitions using a parser and constructed a semantic network. He then described an algorithm that uses paths in the semantic network to compute the similarity between words. In a sense, our algorithm is a dual of Richardsons approach. While Richardson used paths as features to compute the similarity between words, we use words as features to compute the similarity of paths. We use the notation |p, SlotX, w| to denote the frequency count of word w filling in the SlotX of a path p, and |p, SlotX, *| to denote"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["w"]},{"title":"wSlotXp ,,","paragraphs":[", and |*, *, *| to denote"]},{"title":"∑","paragraphs":["wsp"]},{"title":"wsp","paragraphs":[",,"]},{"title":",,","paragraphs":[".
