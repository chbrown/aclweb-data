We find that simple interpolation methods, like log-linear and linear interpolation, improve the performance but fall short of the performance of an oracle. The oracle knows the reference word string and selects the word string with the best performance (typically, word or semantic error rate) from a list of word strings, where each word string has been obtained by using a different LM. Actually, the oracle acts like a dynamic combiner with hard decisions using the reference. We provide experimental results that clearly show the need for a dynamic language model combination to improve the performance further. We suggest a method that mimics the behavior of the oracle using a neural network or a decision tree. The method amounts to tagging LMs with confidence measures and picking the best hypothesis corresponding to the LM with the best confidence."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["Statistical language models (LMs) are essential in speech recognition and understanding systems for high word and semantic accuracy, not to mention robustness and portability. Several language models have been proposed and studied during the past two decades [8]. Although it has turned out to be a rather difficult task to beat the (almost) standard class/word n-grams (typically","","or","), there has been a great deal of interest in grammar based language models [1]. A promising approach for limited domain applications is the use of semantically motivated phrase level stochastic context free grammars (SCFGs) to parse a sentence into a sequence of semantic tags which are further modeled using","-grams [2, 9, 10, 3]. The main motivation behind the grammar based LMs is the inability of","-grams to model longer-distance constraints in a language. With the advent of fairly fast computers and efficient parsing and search schemes several researchers have focused on incorporating relatively complex language models into speech recognition and understanding systems at different levels. For example, in [3], we  The work is supported by DARPA through SPAWAR under grant #N66001-00-2-8906. report a significant perplexity improvement with a moderate in-crease in word/semantic accuracy, at","-best list (rescoring) level, using a dialog-context dependent, semantically motivated grammar based language model.","Statistical language modeling is a ”learning from data” problem. The generic steps to be followed for language modeling are"," preparation of training data"," selection of a model type"," specification of the model structure"," estimation of model parameters","The training data should consist of large amounts of text, which is hardly satisfied in new applications. In those cases, complex models fit to the training data. On the other hand, simple models can not capture the actual structure. In the Bayes’ (sequence) decision framework of speech recognition/understanding we heavily constrain the model structure to come up with a tractable and practical LM. For instance, in a class/word","-gram LM the dependency of a word is often restricted to the class that it belongs and the dependency of a class is limited to","-1 previous classes. The estimation of the model parameters, which are commonly the probabilities, is another important issue in language modeling. Besides data sparseness, the estimation algorithms (e.g. EM algorithm) might be responsible for the estimated probabilities to be far from optimal.","The aforementioned problems of learning have different effects on different LM types. Therefore, it is wise to design LMs based on different paradigms and combine them in some optimal sense. The simplest combination method is the so called linear interpolation [4]. Recently, the linear interpolation in the logarithmic domain has been investigated in [6]. Perplexity results on a couple of tasks have shown that the log-linear interpolation is better than the linear interpolation. Theoretically, a far more powerful method for LM combination is the maximum entropy approach [7]. However, it has not been widely used in practice, since it is computationally demanding.","In this research, we consider two LMs:"," class-based 3-gram LM (baseline)."," dialog dependent semantic grammar based 3-gram LM [3].","After N-best list rescoring experiments with linear and log-linear interpolation, we realized that the performance in terms of word and semantic accuracies fall considerably short of the performance of an oracle. We explain the set-up for the oracle experiment and point out that the oracle is a dynamic LM combiner. To fill the performance gap, we suggest a method that can mimic the oracle. concept G S C W dialog goal generator generatorsequenceword speech generatorwaveform phoneme sequence generator P A dialog context Figure 1: A speech production model","The paper is organized as follows.

THE ORACLE APPROACH","paragraphs":["The set-up for oracle experiments is illustrated in Figure 3. The purpose of this set-up is twofold. First, we use it to evaluate the oracle performance. Second, we use it to prepare data for the training of a stochastic decision model. For the sake of simplicity, we show the set-up for two LMs and do experiments accordingly. Nonetheless, the set-up can be extended to an arbitrary number of LMs.","The language models are used for N-best list rescoring.

After training the oracle combiner (here, we assume a neural network), we set our system as shown in Figure 4. The input to the neural network (NN) is the augmented feature vector. The output of the NN is the LM indicator probably with fuzzy values. So, we first pick the max output, and then, we select and output the respective word string."]},{"title":"5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS","paragraphs":["The models were developed and tested in the context of the CU Communicator dialog system which is used for telephone-based flight, hotel and rental car reservations [11]. The text corpus was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 15220 and 1220 sentences, respectively. The test set was further divided into two parts. Each part, in turn, was used to optimize language and interpolation weights to be used for the other part in a ”jacknife paradigm”. The results were reported as the average of the two results. The average sentence length of the corpus was 4 words (end-of-sentence was treated as a word). We identified 20 dialog contexts and labeled each sentence with the associated dialog context.","We trained a dialog independent (DI) class based LM and dialog dependent (DD) grammar based LM. In all LMs","is set to 3. It must be noted that the DI class-based LM served as the LM of the baseline system with 921 unigrams including 19 classes. The total number of the distinct words in the lexicon was 1681. The grammar-based LM had 199 concept and filler classes that completely cover the lexicon. In rescoring experiments we set the N-best list size to 10. We think that the choice of","","","is a resonable tradeoff between performance and complexity.","The perplexity results are presented in Table 1. The perplexity of the grammar-based LM is 36.8% better than the baseline class-based LM.","We did experiments using","-best lists from the baseline recognizer. We first determined the best possible performance in WER Table 1: Perplexity results","LM Perplexity DI class 3-gram 22.0 DD SCFG 3-gram 13.9 offered by","-best lists. This is done by picking the hypothesis with the lowest WER from each list. This gives an upperbound for the performance gain possible from rescoring","-best lists . The rescoring results in terms of absolute and relative improvements in WER and semantic error rate (SER) along with the best possible improvement are reported in Table 2. It should be noted that the optimizations are made using WER. The slight drop in SER with interpolation might be due to that. Actually this is good for text transcription but not for a dialog system. We believe that the results will reverse if we replace the optimization using WER with the optimization using SER. Table 2: The WER and SER results of the 10-best list rescoring with different LMs: the baseline WER is 25.9% and SER is 23.7% Method WER SER Class based LM alone 0.0% 0.0% Grammar based LM alone 1.4(5.4)% 1.4(5.9)% Linear interpolation 1.6(6.2)% 1.3(5.5)% Log-linear interpolation 1.7(6.6)% 1.2(5.1)% Oracle 3.0(11.6)% 2.7(11.4) % Best 6.4(24.1)% 5.5(23.2)%","The performance gap between the oracle and interpolation methods promotes the system in Figure 4. We expect that, based on the universal approximation theory, a neural network with consistent features, sufficiently large training data and proper training would approximate fairly well the behavior of the oracle. On the other hand, the performance gap between the oracle and the best possible performance from 10-best lists suggests the use of more than two language models and dynamic combination with the acoustic model."]},{"title":"6. CONCLUSIONS","paragraphs":["We have presented our recent work on language model combining. We have shown that although a simple interpolation of LMs improves the performance, it fails to reach the performance of an oracle. We have proposed a method for LM combination that mimics the behavior of the oracle. Although our work is not complete without a neural network that mimics the oracle, we argue that the universal approximation theory ensures the success of such a method. However, extensive experiments are required to reach the goal with the main focus on the selection of features. At the moment, the number of concepts, the number of filler classes and the number of 3-gram hits in a sentence (all normalized by the length of the sentence) and the behavior of n-grams in a context are the features that we consider to use. Also, it has been observed that the performance of the oracle is still far from the best possible performance. This is partly due to the very small number of LMs used in the rescoring, partly due to the oracle’s hard decision combining strategy and partly due to the static combination with the acoustic model. The work is in progress towards the goal of filling the performance gap."]},{"title":"7. REFERENCES","paragraphs":["[1] J. K. Baker. Trainable grammars for speech recognition.
