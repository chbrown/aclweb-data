{"sections":[{"title":"","paragraphs":["Robust Speech Recognition","Program Summary Clifford J. Weinstein MIT Lincoln Laboratory","The Lincoln Laboratory Program in Robust Speech Recognition Technology was initiated in FY85 with the major goal of developing techniques for high-performance speech recognition under the stress and noise conditions typical of the fighter cockpit. After achieving significant advances in robust isolated-word recognition (IWR) during FY85 and FY86, the program evolved in FY87 to the development of robust continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques for the stressful, limited-task-domain environment typical of the Pilot's Associate. In FY88, the Lincoln CSR work was extended successfully to the large-vocabulary task typical of the Battle Management environment. A major goal of the current program, starting in FY89, is to extend and apply these robust CSR techniques to talker-independent, noisy and distorted speech conditions.","The work in recognition in stress and noise produced a robust Hidden Markov Model (HMM) IWR system with 99% speaker-dependent (SD) accuracy for several difficult stress/noise databases, and very high performance for normal speech. Robustness techniques which were developed included multi-style training, robust estimation of parameter variances, use of time-differential speech parameters, and discriminant analysis.","More recently, the robust HMM system has been extended to large-vocabulary CSR for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) tasks. Performance on the DARPA Resource Management task (991-word vocabulary, perple.xity-60) is 96.5% word accuracy (SD) and 87.5% word accuracy (SI). The robust HMM CSR has Mso been integrated in real-time with a simulated flight task, judged to be very realistic by a number of military pilots. Phrase recognition accuracy on the limited-vocabulary flight task is better than 99.5%.","Goals for the current program include: (1) development of robust techniques for talker-independent recognition of noisy and distorted continuous speech; (2) research into the application of speaker recognition strategies to improve speech recognition performance; and (3) continued development and evaluation of CSR techniques on the DARPA Resource Management continuous-speech database.
