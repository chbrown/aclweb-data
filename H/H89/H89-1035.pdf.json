Based on our earlier work on cooperative systems for interaction through language, further significant contributions were made in the following major areas: (1) development of linguistic formalisms (syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) and the corresponding algorithms; (2) extensions of deterministic parsing; (3) some aspects of discourse coherence; (4) some aspects of tense and anaphora; (5) a theory of response structure and response generation; and (6) initiation of research in information carried by intonation and its role in spoken language systems.","The basic research and system development is expected to lead to: (1) characterization of information carried by (a) syntax, semantics, and discourse structure, (b) their relationship to information carried by intonation, (c) development of methods for applying their information in generation and understanding; (2) development of architecture for integration of utterance planning, lexical, syntactic, and intonational choice; (3) development of incremental strategies for applying syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge in understanding and generating language, especially spoken language.
