Robin Rohlicek Boston University BBN Systems and Technologies Corp."]},{"title":"Objective:","paragraphs":["The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independent recognition of continuous speech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate for use with these models. The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic, segment-based models that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (feature vectors) that correspond to a phoneme. Since the use of segment models is computationally complex, we will also investigate multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficient search. Furthermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higherorder information. This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF."]},{"title":"Summary of Accomplishments:","paragraphs":["• Refined the stochastic segment model to model time correlation using a Markov time structure and using time-dependent parameter reduction.","• Investigated the utility of sentence-level duration phenomena for incorporation in a multi-level algorithm. • Investigated robust covariance estimates for limited training data.","• Developed a speaker-independent phoneme classification system that achieves 72% accuracy on the TIMIT database.","• Implement segment-based and HMM-based phoneme recognition systems to better understand the relative advantages of these modelling techniques.","• Evaluate further refinements to the stochastic segment model such as use of different parameter estimation methods, alternative variable-to-fixed-length transformations, and incorporation of context modelling. • Implement a multi-level, iterative search algorithm for phomeme recognition. 446"]}]}
