The Comparator checks whether the answer provided by a SLS accords with a canonical answer, returning either true or false. The Common Answer Specification determines the syntax of answer expressions, the minimal content that must be included in them, the data to be included in and excluded from test corpora, and the procedures used by the Comparator. Though some details of the CAS are particular to individual domains, the Comparator software is domain-independent, as is the CAS approach."]},{"title":"1 INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["The DARPA community has recently moved forward in beginning to define methods for common evaluation of spoken language systems. We consider the existing consensus to include at least the following points:","• Common evaluation involves working on a common domain (or domains). A common corpus of development queries (in both spoken and transcribed form), and answers to those queries in some canonical format, are therefore required.","• One basis for system evaluation will be answers to queries from a common database, perhaps in addition to other measures.","• Automatic evaluation methods should be used whenever they are feasible.","• System output will be scored by NIST, though all sites will be able to use the evaluation program in-ternally.","• Development and test corpora should be subdivided into several categories to support different kinds of evaluation (particularly concerning discourse phenomena).","An implicit assumption here is that we are consider-ing database query systems, rather than any of the various other natural language processing domains (message understanding, command and control, etc.). Evaluating systems for these other domains will naturally require other evaluation procedures.","Building on the points of consensus listed above, this proposal presents an evaluation procedure for the DARPA Common Task which is essentially domain-independent. The key component is a program, designated the Comparator, for comparing canonical answers to the answers supplied by a Spoken Language System. A specification for such answers, which incorporates the requirements of the Comparator, is presented in Section 2. This specification, called the Common Answer Specification (CAS), is not intended to be suitable for interactive systems: rather, it is designed to facilitate automatic evaluation. While we have attempted to cover as broad a range of queries and phenomena as possible, data which fall outside the scope of the CAS can simply be left out of test corpora for now.","Section 3 presents some of the justification supporting the proposal in Section 2, as well as amplifying several points. Details on the Comparator are given in Section 4.","Section 5 concludes with a discussion of corpus development, looking at what kind of data should be collected and how corpora should be annotated to facilitate testing various types of natural language. 135"]},{"title":"2 THE PROPOSAL","paragraphs":["Here we present the basic substance of our proposal for a Common Answer Specification (CAS), deferring some details and elaboration to Section 3. The CAS, which is designed to support system evaluation using the Comparator, covers four basic areas.\" 1. The notation used for answer expressions. 2. The minimal content of canonical answers. 3. The material included in test corpora.","4. The procedure used by the Comparator for comparing canonical answers to system output.","We assume an evaluation architecture like that in Figtire 1. Everything on the right hand side of the figure is the developer's responsibility 1. Items on the left side of the diagram will be provided as part of the evaluation process.","The Common Answer Specification was devised to enable common, automatic evaluation: it is expressly not designed to meet the needs of human users, and should be considered external. This means that developers are free to implement any output format they find convenient for their own use: we only propose to dictate the form of what is supplied as input to the Comparator. It is assumed that some simple post-processing of system output by the developer will be required to conform to the CAS.","While the central points of the CAS are domain-independent, certain details relating to content can only be determined relative to a specific domain. These portions of the proposal are specified for the personnel domain and SLS Personnel Database (Boisen, 1989), and all examples are taken from that domain as well."]},{"title":"2.1 Notation","paragraphs":["S-1 The basic CAS expression will be a relation, that is, a set of tuples. The types of the elements of tuples will be one of the following: Boolean, number, string, or date. Relations consisting of a single tuple with only one element can alternatively be represented as a scalar.","1BBN has offered their ERL interpreter (Ramshaw, 1989) as a backend database interface for those who desire one: use of the ERL interpreter is explicitly not required for common evaluation, however, and developers are free to use whatever database interface they find suitable. S-2 CAS expressions will be expressed as a Lisp-style parenthesized list of non-empty lists. Scalar answers may alternatively be represented as atomic expressions. The two Boolean values are true and false. Numeric answers can be either integers or real numbers. Dates will be an 9-character string like \"01-JAN-80\". The number and types of the elements of tuples must be the same across tuples. An empty relation will be represented by the empty list. Alphabetic case, and whitespace between elements, will be disregarded, except in strings.","A BNF specification for the syntax of the Common Answer Specification is found in Appendix A.

This allows for a completely homogeneous representation of answers, however, and is permitted for this reason.","The range of types in S-l, while adequate for the personnel domain, may need to be enlarged for other domains. One obvious omission is a type for amounts: units are not specified for numbers. In the personnel domain, there are only two amounts, years and dollars, neither of which is likely to require expression in other units (though one could conceivably ask \"How many days has Paul Tai worked for the company?\"). Other domains would not be similarly restricted, and might require unit labels for amounts of length, speed, volume, etc. Of course, it is always possible to simply specify canonical units for the domain and require all numbers to be in those units: this would increase the effort required to conform to the CAS, however.","Answers to requests for percentages should express the ratio directly, not multiplying by 100: so if 45 out of 423 employees have PhD's, the answer to \"What percentage of employees have PhD's?\" should be 0.1064"]},{"title":"3.2 Minimal Content","paragraphs":["Under section S-3 of the proposal, one should note the possibility of a required NP being conjoined or modified by a \"conjoining\" PP modifier, as in the following examples: List the clerks and their salaries. List the clerks with their salaries. Clearly in both of these cases the salaries as well as the employee IDs should be required in the answer.","One possible objection to the approach proposed in S-3 is that it ignores some well-documented concerns about the \"informativeness\" or pragmatic capabilities of question-answering systems. For example, in a normal context, a suitably informative answer for List the salary of each employee. would provide not just a list of salaries but some identification of the employees as well, under the assumption that this is what the user really wants. Since the purpose of the CAS is automatic evaluation rather than user convenience, this objection seems irrelevant, at least until a metric for measuring pragmatic capabilities can be defined. Note that S-10 means developers are free to include extra fields for pragmatic purposes: such fields are simply not required for correctness. A similar point can be made concerning vague expressions (S-5). Only the street field is explicitly required for references to an address, since that should be sufficient to determine correctness, but developers may also include city and state if they wish. 139","One might argue that the proposed treatment of manager/supervisor in S-6 is inconsistent with the approach taken for scientists, engineers, programmers, etc. Our decision is essentially to consider manager and supervisor as technical terms which indicate a supervisory relation to another employee, rather than generic descriptions of a profession. This has the possibly unfortunate consequence that employees in the Common Personnel Database with job rifles like \"SUPERVISOR\" and \"PROJECT MANAGER\" may not be considered supervisors or managers in this technical sense. Nevertheless, given that these rifles seem less like descriptions of a profession, the approach is not inconsistent.","There are probably other vague expressions which will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, either by agreeing on a referent or eliminating them from the corpora. 3.3 Test Corpora Some comments are in order about various items excluded by section S-8 of the proposal. For example, ambiguity (as opposed to vagueness) is barred at present, primarily to simplify the Common Answer Specification. It would not be difficult to enhance the canonical answer to include several alternatives for queries which were genuinely ambiguous: then the Comparator could see if a system answer matched any of them, counting at least one match as correct. A more challenging test would be to only score answers as correct that matched all reasonable answers. This would obviously require substantial consensus on which queries were ambiguous and what the possible readings were.","Presupposition is another area where one could imagine extensions to the proposal: for queries like List the female managers who make more than $50000. there is an implicit assumption that there are, in fact, female managers. If no managers are female, the answer would presumably be an empty relation. The reason the answer set would be empty, however, would have nothing to do with the data failing to meet some set of restrictions, as in ordinary cases. Rather, the object NP would have no referent: this is a different kind of failure, and systems that can detect it have achieved a greater degree of sophistication, which presumably ought to be reflected in their evaluation. Such failure to refer can be subdivided into two cases:","necessary failure: cases which are impossible by definition. For example, the set of men and the set of women are disjoint: therefore \"the female men\" necessarily fails to refer to any entity.","contingent failure: cases which happen to fail because of the state of the world (as in the example above).","One modification to the CAS that would include such cases would be to extend S-1 to include types for failure, with several possible values indicating the failure encountered. Then the canonical answer to the example above might be the special token"]},{"title":"contingent-failure","paragraphs":["rather than simply () Until a broader consensus on this issue is achieved, how-ever, we consider the best approach to be the elimination\" of such cases from the test corpora.","Section S-8 excludes queries whose answer is not available due to missing data. As an example, in the SLS Personnel Database the home phone number for Richard Young, an attorney, is missing, and is therefore entered as NIL. We therefore propose to exclude queries like \"What is Richard Young's home phone?\" from test corpora, since no data is available to answer the question. On the other hand, the query \"List the home phone numbers of all the attorneys\" would not be excluded.

Different sites might have different and incompatible approaches to sub-sorts, ff the primary keys are not unique.","• Since relations are assumed to not be ordered, a different notation for sorted answers would be needed. 140 In addition to these problems, evaluating queries that require sorting would seem to contribute little to under-standing the key technological capabilities of an SLS, and is therefore at best a marginal issue. In light of these points, we consider it expedient to simply omit such cases for the present."]},{"title":"3.4 Comparator","paragraphs":["The epsilon measure proposed in S-9 assumes that, if an SLS does any rounding of real numbers, it will not exceed the epsilon figure. Two particular cases where this might be problematic are percentages and years: repeating an earlier example, the correct answer to a query like \"What percentage of employees have PhDs?\" might be 0.1064 and rounding this to 0.11 would score as incorrect. Similarly, for a query like \"How many years has Sharon Lease worked here?\", the years must not be treated as whole units: an answer like 36.87 would score as correct, but 37 would be incorrect.","One consequence of S-10 is the small possibility of a incorrect system answer being spuriously scored as correct.

Eliminating such aberrations would require distinguishing queries whose answers are relations from those that produce scalars, and imposing this distinction in the CAS. We therefore assume for the time being that developers will pursue more pnncipled approaches, and we rely on the variety of test corpora to de-emphasize the significance of these marginal cases. 4 THE COMPARATOR In this section we describe the Comparator, a Common Lisp program for comparing system output (conforming to the CAS) with canonical answers. We have chosen this name to reflect an important but subtle point: evaluation requires human judgement, and therefore the best we can expect from a program is comparison, not evaluation. Since the degree to which system output reflects system capabilities is always imperfect, we view the resuits of the Comparator as only one facet of the entire effort of evaluating Spoken Language Systems. The Comparator software is available without charge from BBN Systems and Technologies Corporation, which reserves all fights to the software. To obtain a copy, contact sboisen@bbn, con","The Comparator takes two inputs: the answer from a particular SLS, and the canonical answer. The output is a Boolean value indicating whether the system-supplied answer matched the canonical one. To make that judgement, the Comparator needs to perform type-appropriate comparisons on the individual data items, and to handle correctly system answers that contain extra values.","As described in S-9, real numbers are compared using an epsilon test that compares only a fixed number of the most significant digits of the two answers. The number\" of digits compared is intended to generously reflect the accuracy range of the least accurate systems involved. Note that there is still some danger of numeric imprecision causing an answer to be counted wrong if the test set includes certain pathological types of queries, like those asking for the difference between two very similar real numbers.","The other, more major issue for the Comparator concerns the fact that table answers are allowed to include extra columns of information, as long as they also include the minimal information required by the canonical answer(S-10). Note that these additional columns can mean that the system answer will also include extra tupies not present in the canonical answer. For example, if Smith and Jones both make exactly $40,000, they would contribute only one tuple to a simple list of salaries, but if a column of last names were included in the answer table, there would be two separate tuples.","What the Comparator does with table answers is to explore each possible mapping from the required columns found in the canonical answer to the actual columns found in the system-supplied answer. (Naturally, there must be at least as many columns as in the canonical answer, or the system answer is clearly incorrect.) Applying each mapping in turn to the provided answer, the Comparator builds a reduced answer containing only 141 those columns indicated by the mapping, with any duplicate tuples in the reduced answer eliminated. It is this reduced answer that is compared with the canonical answer, in terms of set equivalence.","Finally, it should be stressed that the Comparator works within the context of relational database principles. It treats answer tables as sets of tuples, rather than lists. This means first that order of tuples is irrelevant. It also means that duplicate tuples are given no semantic weight; any duplicates in a provided answer will be removed by the Comparator before the comparison is made.","5 CORPUS DEVELOPMENT AND TAG-GING Any corpus which is collected for SLS development and testing will be more useful if it is easily sub-divided into easier and harder cases. Different systems have different capabilities, particularly with respect to handling discourse phenomena: the ideal corpus will therefore include both the most basic case (i.e., no discourse phenomena) and enough difficult cases to drive more advanced research.","We propose the tagging of corpora using a hierarchical categorization that reflects the richness of context required to handle queries. These categories primarily distinguish levels of effort for Spoken Language Systems, such that the lowest category should be attempted by every site, and the highest category attempted only by the most ambitious. Two other criteria for the categorization are the following:","• Categories should be maximally distinctive: there is no need for fine distinctions that in practice only separate a few cases.","• Categories should be easily distinguishable by those who will do the tagging. That is, they should be objective and clearly defined rather than relying on sophisticated linguistic judgements.","Here is a candidate categorization, where the category number increases as the context required becomes successively richer:","Category 0: no extra-Sentential context is required (i.e., \"0\" context): the sentence can be understood in isolation. This is the default case."]},{"title":"Category 1:","paragraphs":["\"local\" extra-sentential reference, exclud-ing reference to answers: that is, the sentence can be understood if the text of the previous question is available. One is not allowed to go back more than one question, or look at the answer, to find the referent.","Category 2: ellipsis cases, such as the following sequence: \"What's Sharon Lease's salary?\" \"How about Paul Tai?\"","Category 3: \"non-local\" reference. The referent is in the answer to the previous query, or in the text of a query earlier the previous one. This probably includes several other kinds of phenomena that would be usefully separated out at a later date.","Category X: all cases excluded from corpora, both for discot~se and other reasons (see S-8).","We propose two initial uses of this categorization for SLS evaluation: creating basic test corpora of Category 0 queries, and designing simple discourse corpora that include Category 1 queries (see S-7). The other categories would enable developers either to focus on or to eliminate from consideration more difficult kinds of discourse phenomena.","There may be other categories which are of interest to particular developers: for such cases, it is suggested that the developer do their own site-specific tagging, using those features which seem reasonable to them. This scheme is offered solely to expedite community-wide evaluation: there are many possible categorizations which might be useful for other purposes, but they are independent of the considerations of common evaluation. 6 CORPUS COLLECTION The evaluation scheme described in the previous sections assumes the existence of realistic test corpora: it says nothing, however, about how such corpora will be collected. This section describes our approach to corpus collection, which uses a human simulation of a Spoken Language System. Since the test and training corpora will be shared, they need only be collected once, and then distributed to SLS developers. The setup described 142 here has been delivered to Texas Instruments for use in their effort to collect a common corpus for the SLS community.","Our approach to corpus collection is to simulate the behavior of a spoken language system (SLS) for database access which is beyond the state of the art, but within about 5 years of effort. We are concerned with obtaining a large corpus of spontaneous task-oriented utterances, without being restricted by current capabilities. Such a corpus would help in prioritizing research for the next few years, while providing a challenging base of exampies for system evaluation.","Our methodology has been guided by the following primary goals:","• The subject should be as unbiased as possible in terms of the kinds of language which are possible.","• The subject should be performing a task, in order to get realistic input exhibiting context-dependent phenomena.","• The simulation mechanism must be fast enough to maintain the interaction in a natural fashion.","• The simulation must be accurate enough that the subject can rely on it: otherwise interactions tend to degenerate into consistency checking by the subject.","• The system must behave cooperatively, especially when it is unable to answer a query, so as not to fruslrate the subject.","• Minimal training should be required so that relatively naive subjects can be utilized.","We accomplish these goals by providing a human simulator (here referred to as the Wizard) of a speech recognition system, using a \"PNAMBC\" setup (\"Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain\"). The Wizard is provided with tools to obtain and display answers to user queries, and to provide appropriate diagnostic messages when the query cannot be satisfied."]},{"title":"6.1 The Setup","paragraphs":["In a data collection session, the subject is first provided with the following: • general information describing the session • a description of the database","• a list of possible tasks for the subject to pursue (including specific details, but not examples of English queries) • pen and paper The subject and the Wizard are kept in separate rooms, in order to remove any influence of the Wizard's actions on the subject. The Wizard is only allowed to communicate with the subject by displaying information on the subject's console, either as an answer to a request, or by using one of a fixed set of canned messages. A \"push to talk\" microphone is used by the subject when directing requests to the Wizard, and his utterances are recorded. A diagram of the setup is in Figure 2.","There is a cyclic interaction which begins by the subject verbalizing a query, which the Wizard transcribes and sends as text to the subject's screen.

All revision is \"behind the curtain\", and unseen by the subject. The speed of the NL tool (a few seconds per query for Parlance) allows for several revisions of a request if necessary, while still keeping a fast turnaround time. If the Wizard is unable to obtain a correct answer, or the request is outside the scope of the simulation, the Wizard sends one of a predefined set of canned messages to the user (see the next section for examples). All input and output to the Wizard's window is recorded in a log. file.","With this setup we are able to collect approximately 50 queries per hour, using one subject per hour."]},{"title":"6.2 The Wizard","paragraphs":["Beyond the simple transcription of the spoken query, the role of the Wizard is to extend the linguistic coverage of the NL tool (by revising queries when necessary), while keeping the simulation within the bounds of a system that is realistically attainable in a few years.

When a query cannot be an-swered within the bounds of the simulation, or the Wizard is unable to obtain an answer due to an NL tool limitation (even though the query is considered reasonable), the Wizard selects an appropriate canned message and dispatches it to the subject. Currently there are 11 such messages, including the following:","• \"No information is available on ~ \": the informarion requested is not in the database---the Wizard fills in the blank. • \"No information about the information itself is available\", when the subject's request assumes meta-level knowledge.","• \"Sorry, the system is unable to answer your query\", when the NL tool fails to process a request that is within the scope of the simulated system.","A successful Wizard needs to know the domain, though \"expert\" status is not necessary.
