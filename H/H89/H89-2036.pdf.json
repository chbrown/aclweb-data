When encountered in the context of an embedded speech recognition system this problem can be be divided into the following sub-problems. First, identify the presence of a new word. Second, acquire a phonetic transcription of the new word. Third, acquire the orthographic transcription (spelling) of the new word. In this paper we present the results of a preliminary study that employs a novel approach to the problem of acquiring the orthographic transcription through the use of an n-gram language model of english spelling and a quad-letter labeling of acoustic models that when taken together potentially produce an acoustic to spelling transcription of any spoken input."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["This paper focuses on t_he problem of acquiring the orthographic transcription of new words and explicitly ignores the problems of identifying the presence of a new word and generating the phonetic base-form of the new word. The approach that we employ here is to map directly from the acoustic evidence to an orthographic transcription. In other words we model the acoustics of our training set based on the readily available orthographic transcription of the sentence instead of a phonetic transcription. The language model that we employ is the familiar n-gram model. Our model consists of a five gram with 27 tokens, A through Z plus blank. One may reasonably ask what led us to think that a reasonable level of performance would be possible. A question is the answer in this case. Ask yourself how many guesses you might require to get the fifth letter correct in a five letter sequence if you had been given the previous 4 letters? We guessed that a perplexity of english spelling might be somewhere between two and five for a five gram language model. A more detailed analysis of the perplexity of english spelling can be found in [Shannon 51]. Given such a low perplexity we believed it would be possible to overcome much of the inherent ambiguity in english spelling."]},{"title":"Acoustic Models Signal Processing","paragraphs":["The signal processing front-end used in this work is identical to the Sphinx front-end [Lee 89]. We computed power and 12 bilinear-transformed LPC cepstral coefficients, which are then quantized into three different codebooks: (1) 12 stationary coefficients, (2) 12 differential coefficients, and (3) power and differenced power. Each codebook has 256 entries, thereby reducing each centisecond of speech into three bytes. 266"]},{"title":"HMM Inventory","paragraphs":["In most speech recognition systems, subword units are based on phonemes, which we believe to be most appropriate for this task as well. However, deriving orthography from phonemic units requires a probabilistic phoneme-to-spelling component, as well as a complex search algorithm that satisfies orthographic as well as phonemic context constraints. This was considerably more effort than warranted for a preliminary study such as this one. Therefore, we compromised some accuracy by using letters of the alphabet and"]},{"title":"blank","paragraphs":["as our speech unit. In other words, a hidden Markov model represents each letter of the alphabet.","One serious problem with letter models is that letters are highly context-dependent -- much more so than phonemes. For example, the \"h\" in \"sh\", \"ch\", \"th\", \"eh\", are extremely different. In order to deal with this problem, we modeled the letters in a context-dependent fashion. Since there are only 28 units (26 letters,"]},{"title":"blank,","paragraphs":["and silence), we could afford to train very detailed units that model each letter in the context of its two left letters and one right letter.

For example, the letter \"h\" in the word \"school\" is aware that its two left neighbors are \"s\" and \"c\", and that its right neighbor is \"o\". From this information, the proper pronunciation of each letter can be inferred, and context can be modeled in the same spirit as triphones [Schwartz 85]. Since not all quad-letters occur frequently enough, we model only those that occur often enough. The less frequent ones would be merged into"]},{"title":"tri-letter","paragraphs":["(one left and one right context) or"]},{"title":"bi-letter","paragraphs":["(right context only) models.

These databases are described in [Hon 89].","First, an inventory of 1427 models was detemined by examining the frequencies of the quad-letters in the training set. These models are trained on sentences of connected speech, using an initialization from the context-independent letter models.

To train this model we chose a suitably large data base in the digital version of the Academic American Encyclopedia. The encyclopedia was preprocessed to remove tokens that were not part of the the 27 token lexicon as well as tokens that were likely to add noise to the language model. Examples of such 'noise' tokens would be those tokens that appeared between delimiters such as 0 and [] and those tokens that appeared in sentences that were fewer than ten tokens in length. After preprocessing 45 million tokens remained from which two language models were developed. The first language model included the"]},{"title":"blank","paragraphs":["token and modeled spelling across word boundaries.

Finally, in each of these language models, the five grams where interpolated with their four grams and the four grams with their three grams etc. when the number of observations was below a specified threshold. For the sake of simplicity in the recognizer five grams that were not observed are assumed to have a probability of zero. We note here that all of the five grams in our test happened to be modeled in the training set even though the two data sets were disjoint."]},{"title":"Recognition System","paragraphs":["The recognition system used is a version of the one used in Sphinx [Lee 89] with the following additions. First we adapted it to compute the additional null transition in the acoustic models and second we adapted it to be able to manipulate our simplified five gram language model. 268"]},{"title":"Results for continuous speech","paragraphs":["Two experiments were perfomaed. The first experiment was performed on a set of 25 general english sentences from 5 different speakers. For this experiment the language model that included blank was used. The results were a letter accuracy of 59.3% and an error rate of 54.3%. The spelling perplexity of this test set was 2.09. One problem we observed was that the system was unable to reliably fred correct word boundaries and that this was a source of many errors. Below we present the two most accurately transcribed sentences from this experiment.

In this experiment we identified 30 ship and place names from the 1987 Resource Management test set. Using the begin and end times identified by the Sphinx recognizer we analyzed this portion of the utterance with the second language model (the one that does not contain blank). The results were a letter accuracy of 72.7% and an error rate of 39.3% and a string accuracy of 21.1%. The spelling perplexity of the test set words was 4.04. It is not surprising that this perplexity is twice as large as the General English test set since the spelling for names is not as well constrained as the rest of english spelling. Despite this higher perplexity, the accuracy is much improved over the previous experiment though it remains to be seen if the end points of unknown words can be determined as accurately as the end points determined by Sphinx when it knew the word in question. Summary","The performance is still too low to suggest that this approach be employed to address the new word problem. In future work we will address the use of phonetic units for acoustic modeling with an intermediate mapping from phonetic units to english spelling or perhaps to the syllable level and then to english spelling. Also the problems of identifying the presence of a new word and of creating the base-form for the new word must be addressed before we can fully integrate the new word into a speech recognizer. 269"]},{"title":"[Hon 89] [Jelinek 80] [Lee 89] [Schwartz 85] [Shannon 51 ] References Hon, H.W., Lee, K.F., Weide, R.
