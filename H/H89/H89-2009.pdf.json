Norton, Lynette Hirschman, Carl Weir, Marcia Linebarger Unisys Corporation Paoli Research Center P.O. Box 517, Paoli PA 19301 ABSTRACT This paper describes issues in adapting the PUNDIT system, designed originally for message processing, to a query-answering system for the VOYAGER application. The resulting system, whose architecture and capabilities are described here, represents a first step towards our goal of demonstrating spoken language understanding in an interactive problem-solving context. INTRODUCTION The application which we describe in this paper is a natural language interface to VOYAGER, an expert system which provides navigational assistance for the area between MIT and Harvard 1. The application is well-suited to exploring the role of natural language understanding in an interactive problem-solving context: the expert system knows enough about its domain to allow extended problem-solving dialogue, e.g. for a user to find a hotel near MIT, find a nearby Italian restaurant, and get directions from the hotel to the restaurant (see below). Our ultimate goal is to process spoken input, and indeed, dialogue is, to use the terms of [Bib88], a stereotypically oral genre. A reasonable strategy for incrementally arriving at this goal is to begin with typed input. This approach allows us to explore general issues in handling dialogue, and further allows us to look at ways in which characteristics of the genre, aspects of the task, the informational structure of the utterance and the discourse context can all be used to limit the search space for spoken language recognition. The following dialogue illustrates a typical problem-solving session with VOYAGER (note: utterances labelled 'VFE' are contributed by the VOYAGER front-end, discussed shortly).","User: Is there a hotel near MIT?","VFE : I'll ask Voyager...","Vgr : Z can't determine if objects SLre near something.

(etc.) MESSAGE PROCESSING AND QUESTION-ANSWERING The PUNDIT natural language processing system was initially developed in the context of message-processing applications. Because PUNDIT is a modular system, typical potting tasks include the creation of a domain-specific lexicon, knowledge base, and semantics rules. Another common feature is basic extensions to handle constructions which are part of the standard written language, but which have not previously appeared in the data (e.g. comparatives, superlatives, address expressions). More interesting are the extensions occasioned by basic differences between messages and face-to-(inter)face conversational interaction. Basic Differences Between Messages and Voyager Dialogue To fully characterize these differences requires representative data from naturally-occurring messages and task-oriented dialogue. We have the former; it is our plan to collect the latter, possibly using PUNDIT + VOYAGER as a data collection vehicle. For present purposes, we may highlight some of the observed differences and similarities. Our message corpora consist largely of short narratives in what has been called"]},{"title":"telegraphic","paragraphs":["style (cf. [GK86]). As a consequence, we find frequent agentless passives, noun-noun compounds, nominalizations, run-on sentences, and zeroing of determiners, subjects, copula, and prepositions. Explicit pronouns and dummy subjects are raze, as are interrogatives, indirect questions, imperatives, and conditionals. Where temporal relations are explicitly marked, they are commonly marked by preposed time adverbials. Modals are raze. In contrast, our initial corpus of user inputs to VOYAGER shows, not surprisingly, that interrogatives and imperatives are more frequent than statements. The types of zeroing seen in telegraphic narrative do not occur in the corpus 2, nor do nominalizations and run-ons. Passives are rare.

Modals are common. Many of these differences are p~edicted by considering the two genres to be at opposite ends along Biber's textual dimensions of 'involved versus informational production', 'narrative vs. non-narrative concerns', and 'abstract vs. non-abstract information' [Bib88]. We plan to take advantage of such differences to tune the system for the VOYAGER task. In terms of discourse structure, we might expect there to be radical differences between messages and dialogue, but in fact here there are interesting similarities. The basic interactional unit in VOYAGER dialogue can be characterized as the"]},{"title":"request-response pair","paragraphs":["(e.g."]},{"title":"Where are you?

Nields: Did you? North: Tried to. Nields: Then? North: No ... [Scr87] 61 [Bal89] discusses our approach to handling such structured messages as a series of question/answer pairs, and we were able to extend this approach to dialogue. The interactional structure of monologue and dialogue is, of course, quite different. To provide the control structure for dialogue, we extended a query front-end (QFE) which had been developed for database query applications. The result is a general dialogue manager which can be used for a variety of interactive applications. SYSTEM"]},{"title":"ARCHITECTURE","paragraphs":["The system contains four major components: the VOYAGER front-end (VFE), PUNDIT, a query translation and interface module (QTIP), and the VOYAGER expert system. The first three components are currently running on Sun workstations under Quintus Prolog, and VOYAGER, which is written in Lisp, runs on a Symbolics machine.

As discussed below, VOYAGER is also a conversational participant, whose utterances must 62 be analyzed and integrated into the discourse context. VFE administers the turn-taking structure, and maintains a higher-level model of the discourse than that available to PUNDIT. This level of knowledge enables it, for example, to call the parser in different modes, depending on preceding discourse (see below).

The input to PUNDIT is currently text, and the output is a set of semantic representations and other predications representing the discourse context (the DISCOURSE LIST), and a list of entities in focus, ordered by saliency (the FOCUS LIST). QTIP'S function is to translate PUNDIT representations into LISP function calls, to pass these to VOYAGER, and to return VOYAGER'S response to VFE. QTIP also incorporates some knowledge about VOYAGER'S capabilities which enables it to trap certain types of queries for appropriate action by VFE. For example, VOYAGER cannot answer direction requests with an unspecified starting point, unless it knows where the user is. In this case, QTIP informs VFE that it must elicit the user's location. As another example, VOYAGER cannot answer questions about whether a class of objects is located on a street. QTIP traps such questions, and VFE informs the user: User: Is there a subway station on Church Street? VFE : Sorry, Voyager can't determine whether something is on a street. QTIP also monitors the state of the machine-machine interface to VOYAGER, and notifies VFE when the link is down or VOYAGER is not loaded; VFE then notifies the user. The final component is the VOYAGER expert system, a version of which has been made available to us by MIT. VOYAGER includes a generation component, and one of our initial issues was how to deal with its output. Clearly, it would be a poor sort of interactive system that did not allow for ordinary anaphoric and definite reference to entities introduced in the course of the conversation, e.g. to"]},{"title":"Royal East","paragraphs":["in the example below: A: Is there a restaurant near here? B: . .. The neaxest restauxant to HIT is Royal East ... £: What kind of food does it serve7 However, in order to integrate VOYAGER'S conversational contribution into the discourse context, we were faced with the choice of (a) modifying VOYAGER to return some semantic representation of its utterances (together with information relevant to focusing), or (b) simply treating VOYAGER as an ordinary conversational participant, and using PUNDIT to analyze what VOYAGER said. The latter proved the most expedient course of action. Though not the most efficient approach in the long run, it has the unexpected benefit of allowing us to look at issues on both sides of the dialogue. MAINTAINING THE DISCOURSE CONTEXT Interactive systems must provide for the strategies by which speakers refer to what has been previously discussed, e.g."]},{"title":"one-anaphora:","paragraphs":["Q1. Is there a restaurant that serves seafood near MIT? ... Q2. Is there one near Harvard? A system which does not handle anaphoric and definite references requires unnatural behaviour on the part of the user, who will be forced to refer to all entities as though they were brand-new in the discourse, e.g. Q2': Q2'. Is there a restaurant that serves seafood near Harvard? 63 But it is clearly not sufficient to allow reference only to what the user has said, for the system's response forms part of the user's discourse context, as illustrated above and below. These points, of course, are not specific to the application or domain, but adhere to language and dialogue. For this reason, the discourse processing facilities of PUNDIT ate largely embodied in the domainindependent Reference Resolution module. This module, which required no significant extensions for the VOYAGER application, is capable of handling a variety of referential strategies. In the following annotated dialogue, we illustrate some of the capabilities of Reference Resolution and the importance of understanding both sides of the dialogue. ! User: 2 VFE : 3 Vgr : Is there a restaurant near Harvard ? I'll ask Voyager... I can't determine if objects are near something. I'll try to find the nearest one. The nearest restaurant to Harvard University is Border Care. Border Care is located at 32 Church Street. Comments: VOYAGER's response is processed by PUNDIT and integrated into the discourse context. As a result, the Border Cafe enters the list of entities in focus, and is thus available for anaphoric reference in (4) below. 4 User: What kind of food does it serve ? 8 VFE : X'll ask Voyager... 6 Vgr : Border Care serves Mexican food. Comments: it- the user is referring to the Border Care, an entity introduced by VOYAGER in turn (3). Reference Resolution quickly finds this entity, which is at the head of the Focus List.","7 User: How do I get there?","8 VFR : X'll ask Voyager... Where are youY","9 User: At NIT.","10 VFE : Ok. I will tell Voyager...","11 Vgr : MIT is located in the area of 77 Massachusetts Avenue. I'll try to find the beet way to got from HIT to Border Care. If your car is on the same side of the street as NITp start driving. Take the next left onto Hassachusetts Avenue. There is a traffic light there. After you cross Garden Street, take the next right onto Church Street. Border Care is about one eighth mile down on your left side. Comments: there in (7) is interpreted as an anaphoric reference to a salient location. Note the clarification dialogue (VOYAGER will need to know the starting point), where VFE becomes the querier. Since there is a salient wh-query in the context (Where are you?), VFE anticipates a short response s and calls the parser and semantics in a special mode. The user's short response is analyzed and bound to the variable in the query (where), and VFE creates a new proposition: The user is at MIT. This information, together with the translation of the original query (How do f get there?) is passed to VOYAGER.","3For purposes of the present discussion, a short response is one which is not a complete sentence, e.g. What im your name f Mary Smith vs. My name ia Mary Smith. See [Hiz79] for a discussion of short responses. 64 12 User: Nhat's the phone number? 13 VFE : I'll ask Voyager... 14 Vgr : The telephone number of Border Care is 864-6100.

There is no previously mentioned telephone number, and yet it is a stereotypic assumption that certain classes of objects, e.g. commercial establishments, have phone numbers. This information is encoded in our knowledge base. Reference Resolution looks for previously-mentioned entities that have the property of having phone numbers, and finds the Border Care. 15 User: 16 VFE : 17 Vgr : Is there a subway stop near the restaurant?

Harvard Station is located at the intersection of Nassachusetts Avenue and Church Street. Comments: the restaurant is a definite reference to the Border Cafe. Note that it would not be correct to look for the last explicit mention of a restaurant, for this algorithm would find the restaurant introduced in turn 1: Is there a restaurant near Harvard. 9 Instead, Reference Resolution looks for the salient entity of type restaurant, and finds the Border Cafc."]},{"title":"CURRENT COVERAGE AND ISSUES","paragraphs":["Current coverage on our training corpus of 174 VOYAGER inputs is 57%; that is, 100 of the utterances are correctly processed by VFE, PUNDIT and QTIP, and are sent to VOYAGER. We plan to increase coverage to 90%, and will then test the system on a more extensive corpus of spontaneous queries, collected by MIT. In addition, we plan to collect and analyze samples of task-orlented dialogue, in order to evaluate the system performance in providing a co-operative interface for interactive problem-solving. One of the issues which we anticipate addressing is the interpretation of additional types of questions, e.g. short questions. For example, the notions of focus and open proposition (cf. [Pri86]) seem crucial to the interpretation of sequences such as Are there any bars around MIT? ... How about clubs? ... Restaurants?. We also intend to further explore the relationship between the information structure of the question and the answer, in order to optimize the processing of the answer. For example, when VFE asks a clarification question such as Where are you?, we construct an open proposition whose variable is typed as a location 4. We can therefore anticipate a cohesive response from the user in which the open proposition is satisfied by a location. A short response is maximally cohesive (MIT or At MIT), and we currently anticipate the possibility of this type of response, and call the parser first for an NP fragment, and then (if that fails) for a PP fragment. We could go farther by expecting certain types of prepositional phrases, namely location expressions (e.g. By subway would be an incoherent response). For the long response (I am at MIT), we may expect the focus to be accented, and the material corresponding to the open proposition to be de-accented. Such expectations should prove useful for speech recognition. These are not only important research issues, but we believe them to have a direct bearing on the ultimate performance of the system, in terms of user satisfaction and time to accurately complete the task. 4Intultively, an open proposition is an expression containing an unbound variable. 65"]},{"title":"References [Ba189] Catherine N.
