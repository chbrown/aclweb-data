Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the most exciting and promising areas of speech research is large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition. A myriad of applications await a good speech recognizer. However, while many reasonable recognizers exist today, they are impractical and inflexible due to the tedious process of configuring a recognizer. This tedium is typically embodied in one of the following forms:","• Speaker-specific training: each speaker must","speak for about an hour to"]},{"title":"train the","paragraphs":["system. • Vocabulary-specific training: with each new vocabulary comes the dilemma of tedious retrain-ing for optimal performance, or tolerating substantially higher error rate. • Training time: with each new speaker or vocabulary, many hours are needed to process the speech and train the system.","Recent work at Carnegie Mellon [1, 2] and several other laboratories has shown that highly accurate speaker-independent speech recognition is possible, thus alleviating the need for speaker-dependent training.

In this paper, we will discuss our initial work to alleviate the tedious vocabulary-specific training process.","Our work thus far has involved collecting and processing a large"]},{"title":"general English","paragraphs":["database, and evaluating the"]},{"title":"generalized triphone","paragraphs":["[3, 2] as a vocabulary independent unit. We collected and trained generalized triphone models on up to 15,000 training sentences, and compared our results to that from vocabulary-dependent models. We found that as we increased VI training data, VI generalized triphones improved from 109% more errors than vocabulary-dependent training to only 16% more errors. In another vocabulary-adaptation experiment, we found that interpolating vocabulary-dependent models with vocabulary-independent models reduces the error rate by 18%.","Based on the enouraging results of this preliminary study, we conjecture that generalized triphones are a reasonable starting point in our search for a more vocabulary-independent subword unit. In the future, we hope to further increase our training database. With increased training data will come the ability to train more detailed subword models. We expect that this combination will enable us to further improve our results.","In this paper, we will first discuss the issue of VI models. Next, we will briefly describe generalized triphones. Then, we will describe our databases and experimental results. Finally, we will close with some concluding remarks about this and future work."]},{"title":"2. Vocabulary-Independent Subword Modeling","paragraphs":["Subword modeling has become an increasingly more important issue because as the vocabulary capacity of recognizers increases, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to train whole-word models. Many subword modeling techniques have been proposed (see [4] for a survey on these techniques). However, most subword models were evaluated using the same vocabulary for training and testing. An important question that has often been ignored is: how"]},{"title":"well will these subword models perform under vocabulary-independent conditions? In","paragraphs":["other words, if we train on one vocabulary and test on another, will the performance degrade considerably? If so, it will then be necessary to retrain for each new vocabulary, which is time-consuming, tedious, and costly.","Why should performance degrade across vocabularies? There are two main causes: the lack of coverage and the inconsistency of the models. The coverage problem is caused"]},{"title":"271","paragraphs":["by the fact that the phonetic events in the testing vocabulary are not covered by the training vocabulary. This lack of coverage makes it impossible to train the models needed for the testing vocabulary. Instead, we must improvise with a more general model. For example, if the phone/t/ in the triphone context of/s t r/ occurs in testing but not in training, it will be necessary to use a more general model, such as/t/ in the context of/s t/, or/t r/, or even a context-independent/t/.","The problem of improvising with general models is that they may become"]},{"title":"inconsistent.","paragraphs":["That is, the same model may generate many different realizations. For example, if context-independent phone models are used, the same model for/t/ must capture various events, such as flapping, unreleased stop, and realizations in / t s/and/t r/. Then, if/t s/ is the only context in which/t/occurs in the training, while /t r/is the only context in the testing, the model used will be highly inappropriate.","To ensure that the models are consistent and that new contexts are covered, it is necessary to account for all causes of phonetic variability.

Generalized Triphones","paragraphs":["In this section, we describe the basis of our current work generalized triphone models, which are based on triphone models [5]. Triphones account for the left and right phonetic contexts by creating a different model for each possible context pair. Since the left and right phonetic contexts are the most important factors that affect the realization of a phone, triphone models are a powerful technique and have led to good results. However, there are a very large number of triphones, which can only be sparsely trained. Moreover, they do not take into account the similarity of certain phones in their effect on other phones (such as /b/ and /p/ on"]},{"title":"vowels).","paragraphs":["In view of this, we introduce"]},{"title":"generalized triphone models","paragraphs":["[3]. Generalized triphones are created from triphone models using a clustering procedure that combines triphone HMMs according to a maximum likelihood criterion. In other words, we want to cluster triphones into a set of generalized *A paxtial list might include: ph(metic contexts, articulator position, stress, semantics, prosody, intonation, dialect, accent, loudness, speaking-rate, speaker anat(mly, ete. triphones that will have as high as possible a probability of generating the training data. This is consistent with the maximum-likelihood criterion used in the forward-backward algorithm.","Context generalization provides the ideal means for finding the equilibrium between trainability and consistency. Given a fixed amount of training data, it is possible to find the largest number of trainable models that are consistent. Moreover, it is easy to incorporate other causes of variability such as stress, syllable position, and word position.","One flaw with bottom-up clustering approaches to context generalization is that there is no easy way of generalizing to contexts that have not been observed before. Indeed, in a pilot experiment, we found that generalized triphones trained on the resource management task performed poorly on a new voice calculator vocabulary. We believe this was mainly due to the fact that 36.3% of the triphones in the testing vocabulary were not covered, and context-independent phones had to be used.","In order to overcome these problems, we need a much larger database that has a better coverage of the triphones that are more vocabulary-independent.

For vocabulary-dependent training, we felt that sufficient training was available for all triphones, so no generalization was performed, and we used VD triphone models. In all four cases, the trained model parameters were interpolated with context-independent phone models to avoid insufficient training. The results of these models are shown in Table 2. Also shown in Table 2 are the triphone and word coverage statistics using the above four training databases. Note that as training data is increased, triphone coverage improves more rapidly than word coverage. With 15,000 training sentences, almost all triphones are covered and the result is close to that from VD training with 1000 training sentences. Moreover, the result of GENENG which only conatins 5000 sentences is almost the same as that of VI-10000 which contains 10000 sentences, because the triphone coverage of GENENG is better.

Conclusion and Future Work","paragraphs":["This paper addressed the issue of vocabulary-independent subword modeling. Vocabulary independence is important because the overhead of vocabulary-dependent training is very high. Yet, vocabulary-independent subword models must be consistent, trainable, and generalizable. We believe this requires a large training database and a set of flexible subword units. To this end, we have collected a large multi-speaker database, from which we trained generalized triphone models. We found that with sufficient training, over 99% triphone coverage of the testing vocabulary can be attained. We report a vocabulary-dependent word accuracy of 88.6%, while the best vocabulary-independent models led to 86.7%. In another experiment, we found that it is possible to reduce the vocabulary-dependent error rate by 18% (to 90.7%) by interpolating the vocabulary-dependent models with the vocabulary-independent ones.","These results are very encouraging. In the future, we hope to further enlarge our multi-speaker database. As this database grows, we hope to model other acoustic-phonetic detail such as stress, syllable position, between-word phenomena, and units larger than triphones. To reduce the large number of resultant models, we will first use phonetic knowledge to identify the relevant ones, and then apply the clustering technique used in generalized triphones to reduce these detailed phonetic units into a set of generalized allophones. We will also experiment with top-down clustering of allophones. While the top-down approach may lead to less \"optimal\" clusters, it has more potential for generalization in spite of poor coverage.","The choice of speaker-independence gives us the luxury of plentiful training. We believe that the combination of knowledge and subword clustering will lead to subword models that are consistent, trainable, and generalizable. We hope that plentiful training, careful selection of contexts, and automatic clustering can compensate for the lack of vocabulary-specific training."]},{"title":"Acknowledgments","paragraphs":["The authors wish to thank the members of the Carnegie Mellon Speech Group for their contributions.
