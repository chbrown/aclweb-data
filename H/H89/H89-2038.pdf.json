The spplicability of the SCHMM to speaker-independent conUnuous speech is explored based on 200 generalized triphone models [12].

The major problem with the discrete output probability is that the VQ operatmn partitions the acoustic space znto separate regions according to some distortion measure This introduces errors as the partition operations may destroy the original ssgnal structure An improvement is to model the VQ codebook as a family of Gaussian density functions such that the d~stributionsare overlaped, rather thsndisjointed Each codeword nf the codehook can then be represented by one of the Gaussian probability density functions and may be used together with others to model the acoustic event. The use of a parametric family of fimte m~xture densities la mixture density VQ~ can then be closely combined with the HMM methodology. From the continuous mixture HMM point of view. the output probability in the continuous mixture HMM is shored among the Gaussian probability density functions of the VQ. This can reduce the number of free parameters to be estimated as well as the computational complex. ~ty. From the discrete HMM point of view. the pertihon of the VQ is unnecessary, and is replaced by the mixture density model. ~ng with overlap, which can effectively minimize the VQ errors The procedure, known as the EM algorithm [3]. is a specialization. to the mixture density context, of a general algorithm for obtain. ~ng maximum likelihood estimates. This has been defined earlier by Baum [l] in a similar way and has been widely used in HMM-based speech recognition methods. Thus, the VQ problems and HMM modeling problems can be unified under the same probabilistic framework to obtain an optimized VQ'HMM combination, which forms the foundation of the SCHMM. Provided that each eodeword of the VQ codeboek is represented by a Gaussian density function, for a given state s~ of HMM, the probability density function that sr produces a vector x can then be written as: b,,(xl ="]},{"title":"f(zls,) = ,~ f(xlO,,,s,)Pr(Os, ls,) (3)","paragraphs":["where L denotes the VQ codebook level.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 3.1, Analysts Conditions For both training and evaluation, the standard Sphinx front-end consists of t2th order bilinear transformed LPC cepstrum [12]. The complete database consists of 4358 training sentences from 105 speakers Qune-train~ and 300 test sentences from 12 speakers. The vocabulary of the Resource Management database is 99I words. There is also an uncial word.pair recognition grammar. which is just a list of allowable word pairs without probabilities for the purpose of reducing the recognition perplexity to about 60. 3.2. Experimental Results Using Bilinear Transformed Cepstrum Discrete HMMs and continuous mixture HMMs based on 200 generalized triphones are first experimented as benchmarks. The discrete HMM is the same as Sphinx except only 200 generalized triphones are used [12]. In the continuous mixture HMM implemented here. the cepstrum, difference cepstrum, normalized energy, and difference energy are packed into one vector. This is similar to the one codebook implementation of the discrete HMM [12I. Each continuous output probahllity consists of 4 diagonal q;aus~*an pruhahlhty density function as Eq ,2~ To obte,n rehahle initial m,~dels for the con. tinuous mixture HMM. the Viterbi alignment w,th the d,screte HMM is used to phonetically segment and label trammg speech. These labeled segments are then clustered by using the k-means clustering algorithm to obtain initial means and diagonal covariances. The forward-backward algorithm is used iteratively for the monophone models, which are then used as initial models for the generalized trlphone models. Though contmuous mixture HMM was reported to significantly better the performance of the discrete HMM [15]. for the experiments conducted here. it is signi/~cantly worse than the discrete HMM Why is this paradox? One expla- .nation is that multiple codebooks are used in the discrete HMM. therefore the VQ errors for the discrete HMM are not so serious here. Another reason may be that the diagonal coveriance assumption is not appropriate for the bilinear transformed LPC cepstrum since many coefficients are strongly correlated after the transformation. Indeed, observation of average covariance matrix for the bilinear transformed LPC cepstrum shows that values of off-diagonal components are generally quite large. For the semi-continuous model, multiple codebooks are used instead of packing different feature parameters into one vector The initial model for the SCHMM comes directly from the discrete [IMM with the VQ variance obtained from k-mean~ clustering for each codeword In computing the semi cuntinuousoutput probabil. ~ty den~*ty function, only the M ' i. 4 here, must qtcntficant codewordq are used for subsequent processing Under the same analysis condition, the percent correct tcorrect word percentage, and word accuracy tpercent correct - percent insertiont results of the discrete HMM. the continuous mixture IIMM, and the SCHMM are shown in Table 1.","[ Table 1","Average recognition accuracy","t#pes percent correct (u:ord accuracy) Discrete HMM 8915% (88.0q","Continuous Mixture HMM 842~ ~81.3~ SCHM.M - topl 87.2c~ ,84.0~) SCHMM ~ top4 90 8'~\" ,89.1'3~ From Table 1. it can be observed that the SCHMM with top 4 codewords works better than both the discrete and continuous mixture HMM The SCHMM with top I codeword works actually worse than the discrete'HMM, which indicates that diagonal Gaussian assumption may be inappropriate here Though bilinear transformed cepstral coefficients could not be well modeled by the diagonal Gaussian assumption ,which was proven by the poor performance of the continuous mixture HMM and the SCHMM wit__h Gaussian assumption lwhich was proven by the poor performance of the continuous mixture HMM and the SCHMM with top I codeword), the SCHMM with tdp 4 codewords works modestly better than the discrete HMM. The improvement may primarily come from smoothing effect of theSCHMM, ie the robustness of multi. pie codewords and multiple codebooks in the sem,.continuous output probability representation, albeit 200 generalized triphone models are relatively well trained in comparison to standard Sphinx version [12], where I000 generalized triphone models are used. 3.3. Experimental Results Using Less Correlated Data If the diagonal Gaussian covariance is used, each dimension in speech vector should be un-correlated. In practice, this can be partially satisfied by using less correlated feature as acoustic observation representation. One way to reduce correlation is principal component projection. In the implementation here. the projection matrix is computed by first pooling together the bilinear • transformed cepstrum of the whole training sentences, and then computing the eigenvector of that pooled coveriance matrix Unfortunately. only insignificant improvements are obtained based on such a projection[7] This is because the covariance for each codeword is quite different, and suc.h a proJection only makes average covariance diagonal, which is inadequate 278 As bilinear transformed cepstral coefficients could not be well modeled hy diagnnal Gaus~ian prohahihty density function, expertments without bdmear transformation are conducted The lSth order cepstrum is used here for the SCHMM because of less correlated characteristics of the cepstrum With 4:]58 Ira=sang sentences {june-trainL test results of 300 sentences cjune.test~ are listed in Table 2.","Table 2 Average accuracy of IRtb order cepstrum"]},{"title":"~~.______.~e.fcent correct (.,nrd","paragraphs":["nccurncv) -~'screte HMM [ 863% '83.8~':I SCHMM -~ topl"]},{"title":"I","paragraphs":["~6 e~ ,as s,-~, SCHMM .Mop2 t 898~,876~ SCHMM + top4 ] :q93% ,~RSr;-~ SCHMM + topfi [ 896q ,~86~;~ SCHMM + top8 I 89 3%,~g2\"~* Here. the recognition accuracy of the SCHMM is significantly improved in comparison with the discrete ltMM, and error reduction is over 29% Even the SCHMM with top one codeword is used. it is still better than the discrete HMM '855~ vs, ~3S%,.

CONCLUSIONS Semi-continuous hidden Markov models based on multiple vector quantization codebooks take the advantages of both the discrete HMM and continuous HMM. With the SCHMM, it is possible to model a mixture of a large number of probability density rune• tions with a limited amount of training data and computational complexity Robustness is enhanced by using multiple codewords and multiple codebooks for the semi-continuous output probability representation. In addition, the VQ codebook itself can be adjusted together with the HMM parameters in order to obtain the optimum maximum likelihood of the HMM. The applicab,lity of the continuous mixture HMM or the SCHMM relies on appropriately chosen acoustic parameters and assumption of the continuous probability density function. Acoustic features must be well represented if diagonal covariance is applied to the Geussian probability density function. This is strongly indicated by the experimental results based on the bilineer transformed cepstrum and eepstrum. With bilinear transformation, high frequency components are compressed in comparison to low frequency com. ponents [2.3]. Such a transformation converts the linear frequency axis into a mel.scale-like one. The discrete HMM can be substantially improved by bilinear transformation However. bil. inear transformation introduces strong correlations, which is inap. propriate for the diagonal Gausstan assumption modeling. Using the cepstrum without bilinear transformation, the diagonal SCHMM can be substantially improved in comparison to the discrete HMM All experiments conducted here were based on only 200 generalired tr~phnnes as smoothing can play a more ~mportant role m those less-well.tra=ned models, more improvement can be expected for 1000 generahzed triphones ,where the word accuracy for the discrete HMM is 91~ with bilinear transformed data~ [n addi. tion. removal of diagonal covariance assumption by use of full covariance can be expected to further improve recognition accuracy[l]. Regard,ng use of full covariance, theSCl(MM hasadis. tinctive advantage Since Gaussian probability density functions are tied to the VQ codebook, by chosing M mo~t significant codewords, computational complexity can be several order lower than the conventional continuous mixture [{MM while mamtalning the modeling power of large mixture components Experimental results have clearly demonstrated that the SCIIMM ofl'erx improved recognition accuracy in compurison to hoth the discrete HMM and the continuous mixture HMM in speaker. independent continuous speech recognition, We conclude that the SCHMM is indeed a powerful technique for modeling nonstationary stochastic processes with multi-modal prohabilistic functions of Markov chains ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would hke to thank Professor Mervyn Jack and Profe*sor Ra| Reddy for their help ~nd ~nslght shared In this research REFERENCES [l]Baum.
