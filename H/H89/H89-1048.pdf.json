Demonstrated by port to domain of Navy Trouble Failure Reports.","• Applications: Processing of CAS17~P messages, producing tabular summary; Navy RAINFORM (sighting messages), and Trouble and Failure reports, producing database updates.","• Technology Transfer Activity: PUNDIT User's Guide released, system installed at National Library of Medicine, Unisys applications group; system requested by RADC, CECOM, Harvard, U. Penn., Cambridge U., Swedish Inst. of Computer Science.","• Treatment of fragmentary input as found in message traffic, by means of minimal extensions to the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic components.","• Semantic coverage of nominallzed verbs, adjectival participles and noun predicates, based on the treatment of the underlying predicate, using reference resolution and temporal processing to complete the interpretation.","• Interactive selection component, interleaved with syntax, uses semantic (selectlonal) information to filter parses, producing dramatic, 6-fold, decrease in number of parses.","• Modules for processing intra-sentential temporal information and referring expressions (including definite and indefinite noun phrases, phrases with omitted determiners, and reference to events).","• Integration of contextual information from fixed message fields with that from free-text fields: system now handles complex multl-paragraph message formats.
