For example, the context preceding phoneme has 46 values in our dictionary's alphabet. Splitting on all 46 values rapidly decreases the number of exemplars per node. These two characteristics are accommodated by using a general metric in tree induction and by using clustering of context values, both of which are described in the next sections.

In the next section we discuss the clustering procedure which groups context values with similar realization distributions to potentially reduce the number of splits at a node and form categories. Clustering of Attribute Values Traditionally, in tree induction, nodes are split either along all values of an attribute (e.g., Quinlan, 1986) or else binary splits are used (e.g., Breiman"]},{"title":"¢t ai.,","paragraphs":["1984). When there are only a few values per attribute, splitting along all values of an attribute will not reduce quickly the number of exemplars per node. But z A pure node contains exemplars of only one realization type. 285 sometimes attributes may have many different values. In speech, some of the values are thought to be similar in their influence on sound realizations; hence, in theory one would not want to split separately on all values, but instead would like to keep sounds with similar effects together. The values could be pre-clustered by a person according to theoretical ideas of what is similar, but the groupings may change depending on context. Alternatively, the values could be clustered into a predefined number of groups at each node (Chou, 1988). However, the appropriate number of groups is not the same for all sounds and again may depend on the current context. Thus, we want to cluster the values of each context at a node and want the number of clusters to be determined by the exemplars in the node. The context values within each resulting group will then be similar in their prediction of the distribution of realizations.","Hierarchical clustering is used to group the values of an attribute. This type of clustering was chosen because it allows the number of clusters for each set of attribute values to be determined from the data, rather than predefined. Mutual information is used as the distance metric and is computed as in Jelinek (1985). That is, let the average mutual information between context value or attribute value vi and realizations or classes X be: The increase in average mutual information resulting from pairing two attribute values vm and v, is the difference between the average mutual information resulting from pairing vm and vn and the contribution to the average mutual information before pairing v,~ and v, : AI(V; X) = I(v,~ U v,; X) - I(v,,~; X) - I(v,; X).","At each iteration, the pairing that results in the largest increase in mutual information is selected and forms a new cluster. This is continued until one of the following conditions for stopping is reached: 1) There are only two clusters left; 2) The increase in the mutual information is negative and more than doubles from one iteration to the next; 3) The increase in the mutual information measure decreases more than a threshold, which we set at -30. At each iteration, the increase in mutual information is often negative because some information is usually lost each time a new cluster is formed. The conditions for stopping define when the loss in mutual information is too great to continue clustering.","Since we cluster the values of each attribute prior to splitting, it may be useful to split on this attribute again under a more specific context (i.e., farther down the tree). Thus, in contrast to ID3, after an attribute is selected for splitting, it is not removed from the set of attributes considered. This is also the case in the binary split method of Breiman et al. (1984); however, our method has the potential of providing meaningful splits which accommodate graded categorization in the realizations. Pruning of Trees A tree that has been constructed by this method may be too specialized to the training exemplars. In the extreme case, each leaf is pure, which is not desirable because such a tree would not be robust with respect to new data. In understanding the relationship between contexts and realizations, we want to uncover generalizations. This can be achieved by pruning, which combines subtrees, resulting in more general distinctions. Many methods of pruning have been suggested (e.g., Breiman et al., 1984 and Chou, 1988), but in general their primary goal is to optimize the probability of error versus some characteristic of the tree, such as average length or number of leaves.","Since our concern is to use only the parts of the tree which will be robust to new data, a different type of pruning was used. First, nodes are extended only when the number of exemplars is greater than a specified threshold (Breiman et al., 1984); we used 20. In addition, only nodes relevant to the classification of exemplars are kept. A chi-square test (Quinlan, 1986) at the .01 level of significance is used. Each tree is also pruned by running a separate set of exemplars, or cross-validation set, through the constructed tree. If the cross-validation exemplars in a node indicate that an attribute is not relevant to the classification of the exemplars in a node, the subtree beginning at the node is collapsed into a leaf. Data The data comprised almost 30,000 hand-transcribed segments from approximately 900 of the \"sx\" sentences from the TIMIT acoustic-phonetic speech database (Lamel el al., 1986; Fisher et al., 1987), spoken by more than 180 different speakers. Trees were induced using 60% of the data; the results that will be described are based on trees pruned on the remaining 40% of the data.

These contexts and corresponding values, which are the union of possible values over all phonemes, are listed in Table 1. Note that some contexts, such as stress and foot-boundary refer to how the phoneme functions within a larger unit. Because lexical context is used, contexts such as foot-boundary are easily determined. Also note that the context values based on adjacent phonemes are defined across word boundaries.

This tree is for the special case describing whether/t/ is glottalized. A context other than preceding phoneme and following phoneme is incorporated; the first split (nodes 0 and 10) in this tree is on syllable boundary (SYLL-BDRY), indicating that when /t/ is glottalized it is generally in syllable-final position. Note that grouping the syllable boundary context values not-initial-and-not-final (NF-NI) and initial (I) separately from final (F) can be interpreted as the predicate syllable-final?. Without clustering, selection of this attribute would result in a three-way split. Further examination of this tree suggests additional conditions on this generalization. For example, node 3 may be described as containing a subset of voiced sounds; in particular all semivowels and nasals and most of the voiced fricatives and tense vowels. Node 1 contains primarily plosives, unvoiced fricatives, and lax vowels. Additionally, the nodes labeled 5 and 9 are preceded by PRE-PHONEME nodes containing vocalics. Thus, we might produce a more precise rule, predicting that a/t/ in syllable-final position and preceded by a vocalic will be glottalized with greater likelihood when preceded by a phoneme m node 8 than in node 4.","Along with trees such as these, we have constructed 45 general trees, one for each phoneme in the dictionary.

This is partially due to the amount of data needed to train the network units in which context is represented. These units include whole word models, where phones are represented in the context of the word in which they occur (e.g., Paul, 1988), generalized triphones (Lee, 1988), and a hierarchy from words to subsets of triphones (Chow et al., 1986). Whole word models provide the most complete context of the internal phones, but usually do not model word boundary effects well. Although a subword unit, such as the triphone, can be concatenated into word models, thus providing easy additions to the lexicon, triphones account for only a subset of contextual factors. Work using log-linear modeling (Chen, 1987) has shown that use of only the preceding and following contexts do not adequately describe realization distributions.","To test the common working assumption that preceding phoneme and following phoneme are the most useful contextual factors, as in triphone models, we examined the contexts in the trees constructed for each phoneme. As stated in the previous section, when the realizations of a phoneme are considered jointly, the preceding phoneme and following phoneme are the most useful contexts overall. However, additional contextual factors other than preceding phoneme and following phoneme can provide better estimates of the likelihood of different realizations. We thus suggest a mixed context unit based on the partitioning represented by the computed trees for use in continuous speech recognition. The organization of the phonological realizations into trees provides a way to specify contexts for creating models intermediate in the continuum of context models from adjacent phone to whole word. A subset of a predetermined set of possible contexts which are useful for differentiating among the realization distributions is identified. This subset is a larger number of contexts than the data would permit if the selected contexts were always considered together. Consequently, a larger overall number of contexts can be used for describing the realizations. For example, in Figure 2, the contexts of PRE-PHONEME, FNC-WORD-P, and FOOT-BDRY are used for describing the realizations of/y/, but only two contexts, either eRE-PHONEME and FNC-WOaD-P or PRE-PHONEME and FOOT-BDRY, are used to describe each leaf.","In tree induction, different realizations are considered simultaneously and the partitioning based on context values is mutually exclusive. By considering all realizations of a phoneme simultaneously, the overall usefulness of the different contextual factors is analyzed. The set of selected contexts generally is not the same as those chosen in trees in which the occurrence of each realization of a phoneme is separately computed. Since each exemplar belongs to one set of context values because of the partitioning, the proportion of each realization for each set of context values can be estimated. 288"]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraphs":["In our work describing phonological variation for speech recognition, we use a systematic, data-intensive approach. Contexts are identified that correlate with the phonological variation exhibited in a large hand-transcribed database of utterances. From these correlations, we identify useful context descriptions. The combination of decision tree induction and hierarchical clustering organizes the realization data into a representation conditioned on context. The tree induction attempts to separate different realizations, while the hierarchical clustering provides for theoretically meaningful grouping of the context values, which, in turn, allows for better estimates of the realization distributions. The use of a tree structure allows multiple mutually exclusive context sets to be used to describe allophone distributions. The trees can be traversed to produce pronunciation distributions for each phoneme in a dictionary baseform. Because the chosen contextual factors in a tree are dependent on contextual factors chosen closer to the root node (e.g., for the phoneme/y/in Figure 2, FOOT-BDKY is useful when PRE-PHONEME has the values {h, v, f, k, m, b, g, n, l, p, z}), the context trees, rather than the set of contexts in the trees, should be used for building pronunciation networks for speech recognition systems. The context trees can be reinterpreted straightforwardly, and we are examining the clustered context values in each branch for such general descriptions.
