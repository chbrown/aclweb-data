Ashley","Department of Computer and Information Science University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA 01003 Abstract","In this paper we examine the use of hypotheticals as a heuristic device to assist a case-based reasoner test the strengths, weaknesses, and ramifications of an analysis or argument by exploring and augmenting the space of known cases and indirectly, the attendant spaces of doctrine and argument. Our program, HYPO, works in the task domain of the law, particularly, the area of trade secret protection for software. We describe how HYPO generates a constellation of legally-meaningful hypothetical fact situations (\"hypos\") which are \"near\" a given fact situation. This is done in two steps: analysis of the given situation and then generation of the hypos. We discuss the heuristics HYPO currently uses, which include: (1) make a case weaker or stronger; (2) generate an extreme case; (3) generate a near miss; (4) manipulate a near win; and (5) generate a case on a related \"dimension\"."]},{"title":"I. Introduction","paragraphs":["HYPO is a program to model reasoning with cases and hypotheticals (\"hypos\"). The program comprises a means of representing and indexing cases in a Case Knowledge Base (\"CKB\"), a computational definition of relevance in terms of \"dimensions\" which capture the utility of a case for making a particular kind of argument, a dimension-based method for comparing cases, and methods for generating hypotheticals to help an arguer formulate an argument, gather relevant facts, and explain his argument. HYPO's domain is legal argument where, as illustrated below with examples of oral arguments before the Supreme Court,-cases and hypotheticals are primary tools. In this paper, we concentrate on HYPO's creation of hypothetical new cases to accomplish such tasks as: (1) test the sensitivity of one's argument to absence or presence of certain facts; (2) locate and explore subspaces of relevant cases in the CKB; (3) augment and \"flesh out\" sparse areas of the CKB; (4) sample the space of implications of a given argument; (5) formulate refinements and refutations of an argument. Thus, we are using hypotheticais as a heuristic device to explore several \"spaces\" -- the CKB itself, and the spaces of legal doctrine and argument -- and to acquire new case knowledge. HYPO generates these hypotheticals heuristically using certain well-known general heuristics (e.g., examine extreme cases) as well as HYPO-specific ones (e.g., examine weaker/stronger cases along a HYPO dimension). While HYPO is a program whose primary task domain is legal argument, the lessons learned from HYPO should prove useful for other case-oriented tasks like strategic planning and learning by experimentation. The posing and manipulating of hypotheticals is important in strategic planning where one must examine a proposed plan in light of telling what ifs -- all too often the advocate of a plan only tells of its good points and and a devil's advocate is needed to unmask its weaknesses. In learning, some of the questions concerning how to intelligently select examples as training instances have a large overlap with our concerns here.","1This work supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and monitored by the Office of Naval Research under contract no. N00014-84-K-0017 165 In case-based systems, one ,cannot afford to wait passively for the \"right\" case to come along before grappling with a potential problem; one must create cases to reason in anticipation. So too in learning systems, one (i.e., the problem generator) must select or generate cases to drive the learning system. The heuristics we discuss here are the subject of another on-going project of ours on intelligent example selection for rule-learning systems like Buchanan and Fu's RL"]},{"title":"[1985].","paragraphs":["Before going into details, we must mention that in the law there is a distinction between \"real\" and \"hypothetical\" cases. A real case is a case that has been litigated and decided; a hypo has not (even though it might be a very slight variation of one that has, or foretells of cases in the process of coming to light or just \"waiting to happen\") [Rissland, 1985]. Real cases are the basis of our Anglo-American legal system which reasons according to the standard of precedent, or stare decisis, which means roughly that like cases should be decided similarly and that one gives support for a legal outcome by citing other similar cases which share the desired conclusion and by distinguishing those that do not [Levi, 1949]. Of course, what counts as \"similarity\" is often up for grabs and one can apply the idea of precedent \"loosely\" allowing broad matches and interpretations or \"strictly\" allowing only narrow ones [Llewellyn, 1930, 1933]. Legal concepts are \"open-textured\", that is, they cannot be defined in a purely logical way with necessary and sufficient conditions [Hart, 1961; Gardner, 1984]. Further the meaning of concepts (and rules) changes over time, and, in fact, the law can be viewed as a system which learns (in a LEX-like manner) from the cases presented to it [Rissland & Collins, 1986]. These observations apply mostly to \"common law\" systems, like our own, which reason in a case-based manner. Others, such as the Continental systems (e.g., German or French) rely mostly on rules and to a much lesser degree on cases. However, even in the most rule-like legal orientations, like statute law, one must rely on cases since rarely is a statute so well-defined as to leave no room for ambiguity or interpretation [Levi, 1949]. Note, there are two situations where hypotheticals may actually be preferred over real cases: (1) law school teaching; and (2) aspects of litigation. In law school, hypos are used (sometimes unmercifully) to ferret out unspoken assumptions and prejudices of students, to focus attention on subtle or troublesome points, and to exercise the student's argumentative powers [Gewirtz, 1981; Rissland, 1984]. In litigation, hypos are used primarily at two points: (a) preparation and \"debugging\" of an argument in the way a strategic planner \"dry runs\" his plan, and (b) in oral argument, in oral argument, the hypos usually come from the judges trying to probe an advocate's position and the ramifications of it; once in a while, when a hypo is particularly strong or compelling an advocate might recite a hypo in support of his position, or he might present a \"counter-example\" hypo to refute or limit his opponent's position [Prettyman, 1975; Rissland, in press]. Our model of legal reasoning is based on actual verbatim data from experts, namely the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, on legal jurisprudential scholarship, and on scholarly analysis in legal journals. We have also gathered and analyzed interchanges from law school classes (at Harvard Law School) [Rissland, 1983], and interviews with a few of our own experts on software trade secret law [Werner, Ashley & Stucky, 1986]."]},{"title":"2. Examples from Supreme Court Oral Arguments","paragraphs":["The uses that attorneys and judges make of cases and hypotheticals as tools in argument are illustrated in the oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court. To the chagrin of counsel before the bar of the Supreme Court, the Justices frequently interrupt an attorney's presentation to pose hypotheticals. For example, in Lynch v. Donnelly, 104 S. Ct. 1355 (1984), a case involving the constitutionality of a Christmas creche display of a city on municipal land, the Justices posed the following hypotheticals: 166","To the attorney for the City:","Q: Do you think ... that a city should display a nativity scene alone without other displays such as Santa Claus and Christmas trees...? Q: [C]ould the city display a cross for the celebration of Easter, under your view? To the attorney opposing the display:","Q: [S]supposing the creche were just one ornament on the Christmas tree and you could hardly see it unless you looked very closely, would that be illegal?","Q: What if they had three wiseman and a star in one exhibit, say? Would that be enough? ... What if you had an exhibit that had not the creche itself, but just three camels out in the desert and a star up in the sky?","Q: Well, the city could not display religious paintings or artifacts in its museum under your theory.","Q: There is nothing self-explanatory about a creche to somebody ... who has never been exposed to the Christian religion. .Q: Would the display up on the frieze in this courtroom of the Ten Commandments be unconstitutional then, in your view? Q: Several years ago ... there was a ceremony held on the Mall, which is federal property of course .... [T]here were 200,000 or 300,000 people ... and the ceremony was presided over by Pope John Paul II. Would you say that was a step, towards an establishment of religion violative of the religion clauses? ... Then you think it would be alright to put a creche over on the Mall? ... How do you distinguish a high mass from a creche? ... [T]here was a considerable involvement of government in that ceremony, hundreds of extra policeman on duty, streets closed... That was a considerable governmental involvement, was it not? SUP, Lynch v. Donnelly, Case No. 82-1256, Fiche No. 5 In the above questions, one can see the Justices modifying the fact situation along various dimensions: location, size, and focus of display religious content of the display, nature of the viewer, degree of government involvement Sometimes the purpose of the modifications (and thus the derivative hypos) is to compare the fact situation to actual cases previously decided by the Court to test whether the current case presents stronger or weaker facts. 2 Or a hypothetical case, like the Mall example, may be significant because it did not give rise to litigation. Frequently, the Justices use hypotheticals to apply pressure to the rule proposed by an attorney for deciding the case. That can be seen in the Mall example above and in the following example from New Jersey v. T.L.O, 105 S.Ct. 733 (1985), a case involving the consitutionality of a high school principal's search of a female student's handbag for cigarettes after a teacher reported that she had been smoking in the girls' room. A Justice asked:","Q: Do you think then that a male teacher could conduct a pat-down search of a young women at age sixteen to find the cigarettes? In response, the attorney for the state took the position that the Fourth Amendment, which","2See e.g., Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980): Posting copies of Ten Commandments in schools held unconstitutional; Gilfillan v. City of Philadelphia, 637 F. 2d 924 (CA3, 1980): City-financed platform and cross used by Pope John Paul II to celebrate public mass held unconstitutional; McCreary v. Stone, 575 F.Supp. Ill2 (SDNY 1983): Not unconstitutional for village not to refuse permit to private group to erect creche in public park. 167","prohibits unreasonable searches by law enforcement authorities, does not apply to high school","administrators. The Justice rejoined:","Q: And does that mean that their authority then to make searches, if the Fourth Amendment is completely inapplicable, extends to any kind of search, strip search or otherwise? SUP, New Jersey v. T.L.O, 1984 Term, Fiche No. 5 In this T.L.O. example, the Justices have posed a short but typical \"slippery slope\" sequence of hypos, where each hypo is successively more extreme than its predecessor, and the culminating \"reductio\" case (of strip search) is dearly undesireable and suggests refutation of the attorney's position. Another slippery slope -- this time involving the numerical range of a variable -- can be seen in the following exchange from oral argument from Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984). The attorney was advocating the position that if Sony sold video recorders while knowing that consumers would use them to copy copyrighted materials, then Sony should be legally responsible to the owners of the copyrights:","Q: Suppose ... that about 10 percent of all programming could be copied without interference by the producer or whoever owned the program...","A: [ don't think that would make any difference. ! think 10% is too small of an amount. Q: Well, what about 50? The attorney then asserted even if there were only one television program that was copyrighted, if Sony knew the program would be copied, it should be legally responsible. Finally, the Justice asked:","Q: Under your test, supposing somebody tells the Xerox people that there are people who are making illegal copies with their machine and they know it .... Xerox is a contributory infringer? A: To be consistent, Your Honor, I'd have to say yes. Q: A rather extreme position. SUP, Sony Corp v. Universal City Studios, Case No. 81-1687, Fiche No. 2 In these last two questions, although the altered fact situations posed by the Justice are still covered by the proposed rule, it is progressively harder for the attorney to justify his position because the hypotheticals present progressively weaker facts; the Justice has \"stacked\" the hypothetical with extreme facts. The attorney to keep his argument alive must distinguish the current Sony situation and the hypos, indeed, the attorney failed. The Court held for Sony on the ground that the Betamax was capable of substantial noninfringing use because so many programs were not subject to copyright restrictions, 464 U.S. 417, 456. To summarize, the above example illustrate how cases, especially hypotheticals, are used: To present, support and attack positions (e.g., by testing the consequences of a tentative conclusion, pressing an assertion to its limits, and exploring the meaning of a concept); • To relate a fact situtation to significant past cases; • To augment an existing case base with meaningful test or training cases;","• To factor a complex situation into component parts (e.g., by exagerating strengths, weaknesses or eliminating features); • To control the course of argument (e.g., by focussing discussion on particular issues) 168 Such observations translate into our heuristics for using hypotheticals which we discuss after we present some background on the workings of HYPO."]},{"title":"3.

The focal slot of this dimension is the number of disclosees and its range is a non-negative integer. To strengthen the plaintiff's position in a fact situation to which this dimension applies, decrease the number of disclosees; the best case being that with 0 disclosees. The significance of the dimension is that courts have found that the prerequisite facts are a reason for deciding a trade secrets misappropriation claim.

The dimensions were gleaned from law journal articles describing 169 the state of the (case) law in this a,rea [Gilburne & Johnson, 1982]. The overall flow of information in HYPO is presented in Figure 1. Particularly of interest to us here is HYPO's CASE-ANALYSIS module. In essence, this module works as a diagnostic engine to determine which dimensions apply to a fact situation. The prerequisites, in effect, define antecedent conditions and a dimension (i.e., a possible reason for deciding a claim in a particular way) is the consequent. To make an analogy with the medical domain and MYCIN-like diagnosis, the prerequisite facts are like symptomatic features and the dimensions are like intermediate disease classes.

Since one cannot explore all the \"legally\" possible (in the sense of syntactic legal move), one needs to explore the space heuristically. Dimensions provide a handle on how to do this exploration in a legally meaningful way. The process occurs in two steps: (1) analyze the seed case; (2) generate legally relevant derivative hypotheticals. Step one is accomplished by the CASE-ANALYSIS module and results in the case-analysis-record described in the previous section. To recall, this is like a \"legal-diagnosis\". Step two is accomplished by the HYPO-GEN module which given high level argument goals (e.g., generate a slippery slope sequence to refute side l's position), uses the case-analysis-record, and heuristics like the following to generate hypotheticals derived from the seed case: H1. Pick a near miss dimension and modify the facts to make it applicable.","H2. Pick an applicable dimension and make the case weaker or stronger along that dimension.","H3. Pick a dimension related to one of the applicable dimensions and apply or 2.","H4. Pick an applicable dimension and make the case extreme with respect to that dimension. 170","H5. Pick a target case ,that is a win and, using 1 and 2, move the seed case toward it to create a near win.","In order to illustrate these methods, we will use the following hypothetical case, Widget-King","v. Cupcake, whose facts are as follows:","Plaintiff Widget-King and defendant Cupcake are corporations that make competing products. Widget-King has confidential information concerning its own product. Cupcake gained access to Widget-King's confidential information. Cupcake saved expense developing its competing product. The parts of the case-analysis-record for Widget-King v. Cupcake that are relevant for the following sections are: app] icable dimensions: competitive-advantage-gained near-miss dimensions : secrets-voluntarily-disclosed; vertical-kr.owledge relevant CKB cases: Telex v. IBM 4.1. Make a near miss dimension apply To make a hypothetical out of a fact situation according to this heuristic method, HYPO selects a near miss dimension and \"fills in\" the missing prerequisites. HYPO instantiates objects and makes appropriate cross references among objects' slots so that the missing factual predicates are satisfied. For example, secrets-voluntarily-disclosed would apply to Widget-King but for the fact that the confidential information had not been disclosed to anyone. The program instantiates, let us say, five disclosures and sets the subject of the disclosures to be the confidential information. As discussed below, the number of disclosures, five, may be derived from an actual case that the program is considering in the context of making up the hypothetical, or it may be somewhat arbitrarily chosen by the program from within the range of the dimension. 4.2. Make a case weaker or stronger HYPO generates a derivative hypothetical weaker/stronger than the seed case by using the information it knows about dimensions. It can make a case weaker or stronger in two ways: (1) independently of the \"caselaw\" represented by the CKB; or (2) based on the CKB using a weak form of analogy. To accomplish a CKB-independent strengthening/weakening, HYPO simply changes the values of a focal slot in the manner specified by the direction-to-strengthen slot; the amount of change is somewhat arbitrary. To accomplish a CKB-based modification, for instance to strengthen, HYPO first chooses a case that (a) shares the dimension being manipulated, and (b) is further along the dimension in the stronger direction. HYPO then adjusts the values of the focal slots of the seed in the stronger direction so that the derivative case is stronger than the \"precedent\" chosen from the CKB. These changes can involve numerical, symbolic or Boolean values. For symbolic values, this means using a partial ordering on values. Modifications can involve more than one focal slot, for instance a ratio. For example, given our fact situation involving Widget-King and Cupcake which involves some expenditure of money by Widget-King for product development, the Telex v. IBM case in the CKB is relevant. In Telex the ratio of paintiff's to defendant's expenditures was 2:1 (and the paintiff won). So to strengthen Widget-King's case, change ratio of Widget-King's to Cupcake's expenses to be at least 2:1. All example of such ratio manipulation can also be found in [McCarty & Sridharan, 1981]. Even a simple change in a single numerical focal slot value can have serious legal impications. Again consider our Widget-King case, as modified by the introduction of 5 disclosees, and make it weaker along the secrets-voluntarily-disclosed dimension by using cases from the CKB. HYPO increases the number of Widget-King disclosees from 5 to 150 based on :Midland-Ross which was decided for the defendant because there were too many disclosees (100) and now Widget-King has passed the 100-disciosee threshold. Note, Widget-King could 171 still rely on"]},{"title":"Data-General","paragraphs":["and a(gue that since the plaintiff won in that case (with 6000 disclosees), it should still win with only 150. HYPO could make the case weaker still by increasing the number of disclosees near or above 6000, the highest value in the CKB or even greater (in a CKB-independent way) to the highest value allowed by HYPO. There are pros and cons to the two methods. The CKB-independent method is easy to do, but the precedential value of the derivative hypothetical is not predictable. The CKB-based method generates a hypo with known precedents; the drawback is that it call get complicated. HYPO tries to do CKB-based strengthening/weakening first, if it can't (e.g., because no relevant case exists in the CKB), it uses the CKB-independent approach. In either case, the task of actually generating the explanation (as we did above) why the hypo is stronger or weaker belongs to HYPO's EXPLANATION module. 4.3.

A hypothetical generated on a conflicting dimension is interesting because it is an example of a case where, at least arguably, facts associated with one dimension can override the effects of the other dimension's facts. 4.4. Examine an extreme case To generate an extreme case, HYPO simply changes the value of a focal slot to be an extreme of its range of values. This can also be done in either a CKB-based or CKB-independent manner. The former method pushes the slot value to the extreme actually existing in a case in the CKB, the latter simply pushes the slot value to its permissible extreme. For instance, the extreme case on the strongest end of the"]},{"title":"secrets-voluntarily-disclosed","paragraphs":["dimension for Widget-King is the facts as stated above with the exception that there are 0 disclosees.

A near win hypo is one in which a seed fact situation is weak on behalf of, let us say, the plaintiff. It can be \"moved\" in the direction of a real target case from the CKB that has been decided in favor of the plaintiff. Using methods H1 through H3, HYPO endows the seed situation with the facts to make the case strong for the plaintiff. As a result, the target case becomes relevant to the seed hypothetical and an argument can be made, based on the pro-plaintiff target case, that the hypo should be decided in favor of the plaintiff. Correspondingly a near win hypo can start with a pro-plaintiff fact situation and be moved ill the opposite direction away from the pro-plaintiff target case or towards a pro-defendant target case.

Starting from a real case, methods 3 and 5, in particular, are recipes for creating hypo's with facts that justify a different holding from the real case. Our goal is for the system itself to realize that the hypo is significantly distinguishable and why and to generate such hypos on purpose to make points in an argument. Having reached step (d) in the above extended example, a hypothetical has been constructed that is fairly strong for the plaintiff. But plaintiff's position can be eroded by moves along 173 other dimensions. One can imagine the scene at 11 p.m. in the oak-paneled library at 14 Wall Street as two first year associate attorneys, assigned to preparing an initial memorandum as to the strengths of Widget-King's claim against Cupcake, play devil's advocate with the facts:","Q: Suppose (e) that Widget-King made disclosures to 100 outside persons as in the"]},{"title":"Midland-Ross","paragraphs":["case.","Q: Well, maybe (f) all of the disclosees entered into nondisclosure agreements as in"]},{"title":"Data-General.","paragraphs":["Under that case, Widget-King (g) could have made restricted disclosures to as many as 6000 people.","Q: What if (h) Widget-King made restricted disclosures to 10,000,000 people.

Having exhausted the possibilities for weakening the case along the secrets-voluntarily-disclosed dimension, the program moves, using methods 1 and 2, to a dimension that became a near miss as soon as nondisclosure agreements came into the hypo at (f), agreement-supported-by-consideration.

Conclusions","paragraphs":["In this paper, we have discussed an aspect of reasoning involving the use of hypothetical cases. In particular, we have discussed how our case-based legal reasoning program HYPO currently uses case examples, dimensions, and five or so heuristic methods to compare the legal consequences of facts and to generate hypothetical fact situations to augment and explore its case base. The hypos help accomplish analysis tasks, such as testing the sensitivity of positions and relating a fact situation to significant past cases, and argument tasks, such as generating a slippery slope to refine or refute an argument and controlling the course of argument. HYPO's heuristics involve (1) strengthening/weakening of a case; (2) taking the case to extremes:"]},{"title":"(3)","paragraphs":["making a near miss case a winning one; (4) manipulating a near win; and (5) examining a case along a related dimension. As indicated earlier, one of our performance goals for HYPO is to have HYPO generate 3-ply argument exchanges which involve a heavy dose of case-based reasoning like distinguishing cases and using hypotheticals. Eventually we hope to bring together our descriptive work on argument moves and hypotheticals [Rissland, 1985; Stucky, 1985] with our computational 3-ply argument work. We also hope that this work on HYPO will cross-potentiate with work on the intelligent selection of examples for learning systems, a topic, we feel has been too often glossed over. The heuristic generation of hypotheticals is a step towa.rds both these goals. However even as they now stand, HYPO's current hypothetical reasoning powers can be helpful in formulating, testing, debugging, and learning in case-based tasks. 174"]},{"title":"References [1] Kevin D.
