The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be labelled as such, and reference resolution can be directed to find specific referents for the entities. In this way the task of making implicit linguistic information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks perfgrmed by reference resolution. The success of this approach is dependent on marking missing syntactic constituents as elided and missing semantic roles as ESSENTIAL so that reference resolution can know when to look for referents.","I This work is supported in part by DARPA under contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered by the Office of Naval Research.

PUNDIT, written in Prolog, is a highly modular system consisting of distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatics components. Each component draws on one or more sets of data, including a lexicon, a broad-coverage grammar of English, semantic verb decompositions, rules mapping between syntactic and semantic constituents, and a domain model. PUNDIT has been developed cooperatively with the NYU PROTEUS system (Prototype Text Understanding System), These systems are funded by DARPA as part of the work in natural language understanding for the Strategic Computing Battle Management Program. The PROTEUS/PUNDIT system will map Navy CASREP's (equipnlent casualty reports) into a database, which is accessed by an expert system to determine overall fleet readiness. PUNDIT has also been applied to the domain of computer maintenance reports, which is discussed here.","Tile paper focuses on the interaction between the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is required for the task of making implicit information explicit. We have isolated two types of implicit entities: syntactic entities which are missing syntactic constituents, and semantic entities which are unfilled semantic roles. Some missillg entities are optional, and can be ignored. Syntax and semantics have to recognize the OBLIGATORY missing entities and then mark them so that reference resolution knows to find specific referents for those entities, thus making the implicit information explicit. Reference resolution uses two different methods for filling the different types of entities which are also used for general noun phrase reference problems. Implicit syntactic entities, ELIDED CONSTITUENTS, are treated like pronouns, and implicit semantic entities, ESSENTIAL ROLES are treated like definite noun phrases. The pragmatic module as currently implemented consists mainly of a reference resolution component, which is suificient for the pragmatic issues described in this paper. We are in the process of adding a time module to handle time issues that have arisen during the analysis of the Navy CASREPS. 2. The Syntactic Component","The syntactic component has three parts: the grammar, a parsing mechanism to execute the grammar, and a lexicon. The grammar consists of context-free BNF definitions (currently numbering approximately 80) and associated restrictions (approximately 35). The restrictions enforce context-sensitive well-formedness constraints and, in some cases, apply optimization strategies to prevent unnecessary structure-building. Each of these three parts is described further below. ........................ 2 Prolog UNDderstands Integrated Text 97 Recover|ng Impl|c|t Information 2.1. Grammar Coverage","The grammar covers declarative sentences, questions, and sentence fragments. The rules for fragments enable the grammar to parse the \"telegraphic\" style characteristic of message traffic, such as"]},{"title":"disk drive down,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"has select lock.","paragraphs":["The present grammar parses sentence adjuncts, conjunction, relative clauses, complex complement structures, and a wide variety of nominal structures, including compound nouns, nominalized verbs and embedded clauses.","The syntax produces a detailed surface structure parse of each sentence (where \"sentence\" is understood to mean the string of words occurring between two periods, whether a full sentence or a fragment). This surface structure is converted into an \"intermediate representation\" which regularizes the syntactic parse. That is, it eliminates surface structure detail not required for the semantic tasks of enforcing selectional restrictions and developing the final representation of the information content of the sentence. An important part of regularization involves mapping fragment structures onto canonical verb-subject-object patterns, with missing elements flagged. For example, the rye fragment consists of a tensed verb + object as in"]},{"title":"Replaced spindle motor.","paragraphs":["Regulariza-tion of this fragment, for example, maps the rye syntactic structure into a verb+ subject+ object structure:"]},{"title":"verb(replace),subject(X),object(Y]","paragraphs":["As shown here, verb becomes instantiated with the surface verb, e.g.,"]},{"title":"replace","paragraphs":["while the arguments of the subject and object terms are variables. The semantic information derived from the noun phrase object"]},{"title":"spindle motor","paragraphs":["becomes associated with Y. The absence of a surface subject constituent results in a lack of semantic information pertaining to X. This lack causes the semantic and pragmatic components to provide a semantic filler for the missing subject using general pragmatic principles and specific domain knowledge. 2.2. Parsing","The grammar uses the Restriction Grammar parsing framework [Hirschman1982, Hirschman1985], which is a logic grammar with facilities for writing and maintaining large grammars. Restriction Grammar is a descendent of Sager's string grammar [Sager1981]. It uses a top-down left-to-right parsing strategy, augmented by dynamic rule pruning for efficient parsing [Dowding1986]. In addition, it uses a meta-grammatical approach to generate definitions for a full range of co-ordinate conjunction structures [Hirschman1986]. 2.3. Lexlcal Processing","The lexicon contains several thousand entries related to the particular sub-domain of equipment maintenance. It is a modified version of the LSP lexicon with words classified as to part of speech and subcategorized in limited ways (e.g., verbs are subcategorized for their complement types). It also handles 98 Recovering Implicit Information multi-word idioms, dates, times and part numbers. The lexicon can be expanded by means of an interactive lexical entry program.","The lexical processor reduces morphological variants to a single root form which is stored with each entry. For example, the form has is transformed to the root form have in Has select lock. In addition, this facility is useful in handling abbreviations: the term awp is regularized to the multi-word expression waiting'for'part. This expression in turn is regularized to the root form wait \"[or'part which takes as a direct object a particular part or part number, as in is awp 2155-614 7.","Multi-word expressions, which are typical of jargon in specialized domains, are handled as single lexical items. This includes expressions such as disk drive or select lock, whose meaning within a particular domain is often not readily computed from its component parts. Handling such frozen expressions as \"idioms\" reduces parse times and number of ambiguities.","Another feature of the lexical processing is the ease with which special forms (such as part numbers or dates) can be handled. A special \"forms grammar\", written as a definite clause grammar[Pereira1980] can parse part numbers, as in awaiting part 2155-6147, or complex date and time expressions, as in disk drive up at 11/17-1236. During parsing, the forms grammar performs a well-formedness check on these expressions and assigns them their appropriate lexical category. 3. Semantics","There are two separate components that perform semantic analysis, NOUN PHRASE SEMANTICS and CLAUSE SEMANTICS. They are each called after parsing the relevant syntactic structure to test semantic well-formedness while producing partial semantic representations. Clause semantics is based on Inference Driven Semantic Analysis [Palmer1985] which decomposes verbs into component meanings and fills their semantic roles with syntactic constituents. A KNOWLEDGE BASE, the formalization of each domain into logical terms, SEMANTIC PREDICATES, is essential for the effective application of Inference Driven Semantic Analysis, and for the final production of a text representation. The result of the semantic analysis is a set of PARTIALLY instantiated semantic predicates which is similar to a frame representation. To produce this representation, the semantic components share access to a knowledge base, the DOMAIN MODEL, that contains generic descriptions of the domain elements corresponding to the lexical entries. The model includes a detailed representation of the types of assemblies that these elements can occur in. The semantic components are designed to work independently of the particular model, and rely on an interface to ensure a well-defined interaction with the domain model. The domain model, noun phrase semantics and clause semantics are all explained in more detail in the following three subsections. 99"]},{"title":"Recovering Implicit Information 3.1. Domain Model","paragraphs":["The domain currently being modelled by SDC is the Maintenance Report domain. The texts being analyzed are actual maintenance reports as they are called into the Burroughs Telephone Tracking System by tile field engineers and typed in by the telephone operator. These reports give information about the customer who has the problem, specific symptoms of the problem, any actions take by the field engineer to try and correct the problem, and success or failure of such actions. The goal of the text analysis is to automatically generate a data base of maintenance information that can be used to correlate customers to problems, problem types to machines, and so on.","The first step in building a domain model for maintenance reports is to build a semantic net-like representation of the type of machine involved.

Noun phrase semantics","paragraphs":["Noun phrase semantics is called by the parser during the parse of a sentence, after each noun phrase has been parsed. It relies heavily on the domain model for both determining semantic well-formedness and building partial semantic representations of the noun phrases. For example, in the sentence,"]},{"title":"field engineer replaced disk drive at 11/2/0800,","paragraphs":["the phrase"]},{"title":"disk drive at 11/2/0800","paragraphs":["is a syntactically acceptable noun phrase, (as in"]},{"title":"participanls at the meeting).","paragraphs":["However, it is not semantically acceptable in that"]},{"title":"at 11/20/800","paragraphs":["is intended to designate the time of the replacement, not a i00 Recovering Implicit Information property of the disk drive. Noun phrase semantics will inform the parser that the noun phrase is not semantically acceptable, and the parser can then look for another parse. In order for this capability to be fully utilized, however, an extensive set of domain-specific rules about semantic acceptability is required. At present we have only the minimal set used for the development of the basic mechanism. For example, in the case described here, at 11/2/0800 is excluded as a modifier for disk drive by a rule that permits only the name of a location as the object of at in a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase.","The second function of noun phrase semantics is to create a semantic representation of the noun phrase, which will later be operated on by reference resolution. For example, the semantics for the bad disk drive would be represented by the following Prolog clauses. lid(diskd̂rive,X), bad(X), def(X), that is, X was referred to with a full, definite noun phrase, full npe(X)] rather than a pronoun or indefinite noun phrase. 3.3. Clause 8emantlc8","In order to produce the correct predicates and the correct instantiations, the verb is first decomposed into a semantic predicate representation appropriate for the domain. The arguments to the predicates constitute the SEMANTIC ROLES of the verb, which are similar to cases. There are domain specific criteria for selecting a range of semantic roles. In this domain the semantic roles include: agent,instrument,theme, objectl,object2, symptom and rood. Semantic roles can be filled either by a syntactic constituent supplied by a mapping rule or by reference resolution, requiring close cooperation between semantics and reference resolution. Certain semantic roles are categorized as ESSENTIAL, so that pragmatics knows that they need to be filled if there is no syntactic constituent available. The default categorization is NON-ESSENTIAL, which does not require that the role be filled. Other semantic roles are categorized as NON-SPECIFIC or SPECIFIC depending on whether or not the verb requires a specific referent for that semantic role (see Section 4). The example given in Section 5 illustrates the use of both a non-specific semantic role and an essential semantic role. This section explains the decompositions of the verbs relevant to the example, and identifies the important semantic roles. The decomposition of have is very domain specific.","have(time(Per)) <- symptom(object 1 (O 1),symptom(S),time(Per)) It indicates that a particular symptom is associated with a object, as","particular in \"the disk drive has select lock.\" The objectl semantic role I01"]},{"title":"Recovering Implicit Information","paragraphs":["would be filled by the disk drive, the subject of tile clause, and the"]},{"title":"symptom","paragraphs":["semantic role would be filled by select lock, the object of the clause.

The mapping rules can take advantage of generalities like \"SUBJECT to AGENT\" Syntactic cues while still preserving context sensitivities.

The predicate environments for an objectl and object2 are speCified more explicitly.

The selection restrictions on the two objects are more complicated, since they must be machine parts, have the same type, and yet also be distinct objects. In addition, the first object must already be associated with something else in a haspart relationship, in other words it must already be included in an existing assembly. The opposite must be true of the second object: itmust not already be included in an assembly, so it must not be associated with anything else in a haapart relationship.","There is also a pragmatic restriction associated with both objects that has not been associated with any of the semantic roles mentioned previously. Both objectl and object2 are essential semantic roles. Whether or not they are mentioned explicitly in the sentence, they must be filled, preferably by an an entity that has already been mentioned, but if not that, then entities will be created to fill them [Palmer1983]. This is accomplished by making an explicit call to reference resolution to find referents for essential semantic roles, in the same way that reference resolution is called to find tile referent of a noun phrase. This is not done for non-essential roles, such as the agent and the instrument in the same verb decomposition. If they are not mentioned they are simply left unfilled. The instrument is rarely mentioned, and the agent could easily be left out, as in The disk drive was replaced at 0800. 3 In other domains, the agent might be classified as obligatory, and then it wold have to be filled in.","There is ,~nother semantic role that has an important pragmatic restriction on it in this example, the object2 semantic role in wait \"for'part (awp).","idiomVer b(wait ̂for̂part,time(Per))<- ordered(objectl(O 1),object2(O2),time(Per)) The sem:~.utics of wait'I/or'part indicates that a particular type of part has been ordered, and is expected to arrive. But it is not a specific entity that might have already been mentioned. It is a more abstract object, which is indicated by restricting it to being non-specific. This tells reference resolution that although a syntactic constituent, preferably the object, can and should fill this semantic role, and must be of type machine-part, that reference resolution should not try to find a specific referent for it (see Section 4).","The last verb representation that is needed for the example is the representation of be.","be(time(Per)) <- ........................ 8Note that an elided subject is handled quite differently, as in replaced disk drife. Then tile missing subject is 103 Recovering Implicit Information art ribute(theme(T),mod(M),time(Per)) In this domain be is used to associate predicate adjectives or nominals with an object, as in disk drive is up or spindle motor is bad. The representation merely indicates that a modifier is associated with an theme in an attribute relationship. Noun phrase semantics will eventually produce the same representation for the bad spindle motor, although it does not yet. 4. Reference Resolution","Reference resolution is the component which keeps track of references to entities in the discourse. It creates labels for entities when they are first directly referred to, or when their existence is implied by the text, and recognizes subsequent references to them. Reference resolution is called from clause semantics when clause semantics is ready to instantiate a semantic role. It is also called from pragmatic restrictions when they specify a referent whose existence is entailed by the meaning of a verb.","The system currently covers many cases of singular and plural noun phrases, pronouns, one- anaphora, nominalizations, and non-specific noun phrases; reference resolution also handles adjectives, prepositional phrases and possessive pronouns modifying noun phrases. Noun phrases with and without determiners are accepted. Dates, part numbers, and proper names are handled as special cases. Not yet handled are compound nouns, quantified noun phrases, conjoined noun phrases, relative clauses, and possessive nouns. The general reference resolution mechanism is described in detail in [Dahl1986]. In this paper the focus will be on the interaction between reference resolution and clause semantics. The next two sections will discuss how reference resolution is affected by the different types of semantic roles. 4.1. Obligatory Constituents and Essential Seinantic Roles","A slot for a syntactically obligatory constituent such as the subject appears in the intermediate representation whether or not a subject is overtly present in the sentence. It is possible to have such a slot because the absence of a subject is a syntactic fact, and is recognized by the parser. Clause semantics calls reference resolution for such an implicit constituent in the same way that it calls reference resolution for explicit constituents. Reference resolution treats elided noun phrases exactly as it treats pronouns, that is by instantiating them to the first member of a list of potential pronominal referents, the FocusList. ........................ assumed to fill the agent ~ole, and an appropriate referent is found by reference resolution. 104 Recovering Implicit Information The general treatment of pronouns resembles that of[Sidnerl979], although there are some important differences, which are discussed in detail in [Dah11986]. The hypothesis that elided noun phrases can be treated in much the same way as pronouns is consistent with previous claims by [Gunde11980], and [Kameyama1985], that in languages which regularly allow zero-np's, the zero corresponds to the focus. If these claims are correct, it is not surprising that in a sublanguage that allows zero-np's, the Zero should also correspond to the focus.","After control returns to clause semantics from reference resolution, semantics checks the selectional restrictions for that referent in that semantic role of that verb. If the selectional restrictions fail, backtracking into reference resolution occurs, and the next candidate on the FocusList is instantiated as the referent. This procedure continues until a referent satisfying tile selectional restrictions is found. For example, in Disk drive is dawn. Has select lack, the system instantiates the disk drive, which at this point is the first member of the"]},{"title":"FocusList,","paragraphs":["as the objectl of have:"]},{"title":"[event39] have(time(time1)) aymptom(objectl([drlvel0]), aymptom([lock17]), time(time1))","paragraphs":["Essential roles might also not be expressed in the sentence, but their absence cannot be recognized by the parser, since they can be expressed by syntactically optional constituents. For example, in the field engineer replaced the motor., the new replacement motor is not mentioned, although in this domain it is classified as semantically essential. With verbs like replace, the type of the replacement, motor, in this case, is known because it has to be the same type as the replaced object. Reference resolution for these roles is called by pragmatic rules which apply when there is no overt syntactic constituent to fill a semantic role. Reference resolution treats these referents as if they were full noun phrases without determiners. That is, it searches through the context for a previously mentioned entity of the appropriate type, and if it doesn't find one, it creates a new discourse entity. The motivation for treating these as full noun phrases is simply that there is no reason to expect them to be in focus, as there is for elided noun phrases."]},{"title":"4.2. Noun Phrases in Non-Specific Contexts","paragraphs":["Indefinite noun phrases in contexts like the field engineer ordered a disk drive are generally associated with two readings. In the specific reading the disk drive ordered is a particular disk drive, say, the one sitting on a certain shelf in the warehouse. In the non-specific reading, which is more likely in this 105 Recovering Implicit Information sentence, no particular di~k drive is meant; any disk drive of the appropriate type will do. Handling noun phrases in these contexts requires careful integra-tion of the interaction between semantics and reference resolution, because semantics knows about the verbs that create non-specific contexts, and reference resolution knows what to do with noun phrases in these contexts. For these verbs a constraint is associated with the semantics rule for the semantic role object2 which states that the filler for the object2 must be non-specific. 4 This constraint is passed to reference resolution, which represents a non-specific noun phrase as having a variable in the place of the pointer, for example, id(motor,X).","Non-specific semantic roles can be illustrated using tile object2 semantic role in"]},{"title":"wait'for'part","paragraphs":["(awp). The part that is being awaited is non-specific, i.e., can be any part of the appropriate type. This tells reference resolution not to find a specific referent, so the referent argument of the id relationship is left as an uninstantiated variable. The analysis of fe is awp spindle motor would fill the objectl semantic role with [el from id(fe,fel), and the object2 semantic role with X from id(splndlem̂otor,X), as in ordered(objectl(fel),object2(X)). If the spindle motor is referred to later on in a relationship where it must become specific, then reference resolution can instantiate the variable with an appropriate referent such as spindlem̂otor3 (See Section 5.6). 5.

However, in the maintenance domain, when a disk drive is referred to it can be assumed to be part of a B3700 computer system.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["This paper has discussed the communication between syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is necessary for making implicit linguistic information explicit. The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be marked as such, and reference resolution can be directed to find specific referents for the entiLies. Implicit entities may be either empty syntactic constituents in sentence fragments or unfilled semantic roles associated with domain-specific verb decompositions. In this way the task of making implicit information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks performed by reference resolution. The success of this approach is dependent on the use of syntactic and semantic categorizations such as ELLIDED and ESSENTIAL which are meaningful to reference resolution, and which can guide reference resolution's decision making process.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Bonnie Webber for her very helpful suggestions on exemplifying semantics/pragmatics cooperation. 111 Recovering Implicit Information REFERENCES","[Dahl1986] Deborah A.
