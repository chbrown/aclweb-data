Pustejovsky March, 1985 CPTM #s This paper will be presented at and published in The Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 8-12, 1985, University of Chicago.","paragraphs":["146 I, Albstraet","Tree Adjolni-~ Grammars, or \"rAG's\", (Joshi, Levy & Takahashi 1975; Joshi 1983; Kroch & Joshi 1985) were developed as an alternative to the standard syntactic formalisms that are used in theoretical analyses of language. They are att~=,~ctive because they may provide just the aspects of context sensitive expressive power that actually appear in human languages while otherwise remaining context free.","This paper describes how we have applied the thmry of Tree Adjoinln~ Grammars to natural language generation. We have been attracted to TAG's because their central operation-the extension of an \"initial\" phrase ~hucture tree through the inclusion, at very specifically constrained locations, of one or more \"auxiliary\" trees--corresponds directly to certain central operations of our own, performance-oriented theory.","We begin by briefly describing TAG's as a formalism for phrase structure in a competence theory, and summarize the points in the theory of TAG's that are germaine to our own theory. We then consider generally the position of a grammar within the generation process, introducing our use of TAG'S through a contrast with how others have used systemic grammars. This takes us to the core results of our paper: using examples from our research with weft-written texts from newspapers, we walk through our TAG inspired treatments of raising and wh-movement, and show the correspondence of the TAG '%djunction\" operation and our \"attachment\" process.","In the final section we discuss extensions to the theory, motivated by the way we use the operation corresponding to TAG'S\" adjunction in performance. This suggests that the competence theory of TAG's can be profitably projected to structures at the morphological level as well as the present syntactic level. 2. Tree Adjunction Grammars","The theoretical apparatus of a TAG consists of a pr/mitively defined set of \"elementary\" phrase structure trees, a '~xking\" relation that can be used to define dependency relations between two nodes within an elementary tree, and an \"adjunction\" operation that combines trees under specifiable constraints. The elementary trees are divided into two sets: init/a_l and auxiliary. Initial trees have only terminals at their leaves. Auxiliary trees are distinguished by having one non-terminal among their leaves; the category of this node must be the same as the category of the root. All elemental trees are \"minimal\" in the sense that they do not recurse on any non-terminal.","A node N1 in an elementary tree may be linked (co-indexed) to a second node N2 in the same tree provided NI c-commands N2. Linking is used to indicate grammatically defined dependencies between nodes inch as mbcategorization relationships or filler-gap dependencies. Links are preserved (though \"stretched out\") when their tree is extended through adjunction; this is the mechanism TAG's use to represent unbounded dependencies. 147","Sentence derivations start with an initial tree, and continue via the adjunction of an arbitrary number of auxiliary trees. To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with root category X to a initial (or derived) tree T, we first select mine node of category X within T to be the point at which the ad~.mction is to occur. Then (1) the subtree of T dominated by that instance of X (call it X') is removed from T, (2) the auxiliary tree A b knit into T at the position where X\" had been located, and (3) the subtree dominated by X\" b knit into A to replace the second occurence of the category X at T's frontier. The two trees have now been merged by '%pricing\" A into T, displacing the subtree of T at the point of the adjunction to the frontier of A.","For example we could take the initial tree:","IS\" Wh°i does IS John like e i ] ] (the subscript \"i\" indicates that the \"who\" and the trace \"e\" are linked) and adjoin to it the auxiliary tree:"]},{"title":"[S Bill befieves S ]","paragraphs":["to produce the derived tree: IS\" Wh°i does IS Bill believe IS John likes e i ] ] ]","Adjunction may be \"constrained\". The grammar writer may specify which specific trees may be adjoined to a given node in an elementary tree; if no specification is given the default is that there is no constraint and that any auxiliary tree may be adjoined to the node. 2.1 Key features of the theory of TAG's","A TAG specifies surface structure. There is no notion of derivation from deep structure in the theory of TAG's--the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwise changed once they are introduced into a text, only combined with other primitive trees. As Kroch and Joshi point out, this means that a TAG is incomplete as an account of the structure of a natural language, e.g. a TAG grammar will contain both an active and a passive form of the same verbal subcategorizafion pattern, without an theory-mediated description of the very close relationship between them.","To our minds this is by no means a deficit. The procedural machinery that generative grammars have traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of employing those characterizations in processing models of generation. This is because a generation model, like any theory of performance, has a procedural structure of its own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at least not while still operating efficiently or while retaining a simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual machine that its authors put forward as their account of psycholinguistic data.","Our own generator uses surface siJucture as its only expficitly represented linguistic level. Thus grammatical formalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface form are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a deep to surface transformational process."]},{"title":"148","paragraphs":["¢","A TAG Involvw the tmmlpuladon of very small dementary structmrw. This is because of the stip,,Indon that elementary trees may not induck recurtive nodes. It impliea that the sentences one tee, in everyday usage, e.g. newpaper texts, are the result of many tucemive adjunctions. This melds nicely with a move that we have mack in recent yeatt to view the conceptual representation from which generation proceeds as comiging of a heap of very small, reduadaatly related information units that have been deliberatebj selected by a text planning process from the total state of the kaowledge base at the time of utterance; each satch unit will correspoad in the final text to a head lexical item plus selected thematic arguments--a linguistic entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a TAG.","TAG theory ladmles only one operation, adJnnctlon, and otherwise makes no changes to the elementary trees that go into • text, This comports well with the indefibility stipulation in our model of generation, dnce selected text fragments can be used directly as specified by the grammar without the need for any later transformation. The composition options delimited by the constraints on adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative text forms which can correspond directly in generation to alternative conceptual relations among information units, alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in prose style."]},{"title":"3. Adapting TAG's to Generation","paragraphs":["The mapping from TAG's as a formalism for competence theories of language to our formalism for generation is strikingly direct. Their adjuncti0n operation corresponds to our \"attachment process\"; their constraaints on adjunction correspond to our \"attachment points\"; their surface structure trees correspond to our surface structure trees. 1 We further hypothesize that two quite strong correspondence claims can be made, though considerably more experimentation and theorizing will have to be done with both formalisms before these claims can be confirmed.","1. The primitive information units in realization specifications can be realized exclusively as one or another elementary tree as defined by a suitable TAG, i.e. linguistic criteria can be used in determining the proper modularity of the conceptual structure. 2","2.

The following is a brief summary of the model; a more complete description can be found in McDonald & Pustejovsky [1985b].","We have always had two complementary goals in our research: on the one hand our generation program has had to be of practica~l utility to the knowedge based expert systems that use it as part of a natural language interface. This means that architecturally our generator has always been designed to produce text from conceptual specifications, ~plans\", developed by another program and consequently has had to be sensitive to the limitations and varying approaches of the present state of the art in conceptual representation.","At the same time, we want the architecture of the virtual machine that we abstract out of our program to be effective as a source of psycholinguistic hypotheses about the actual generation process that humans use; it should, for example, provide the basis for predictive accounts of human speech error behavior and apparent planning limitations. To achieve this, we have restricted ourselves to a highly constrained set of representations and operations, and have adopted strong and suggestive stipulations on our design such as high locality, information encapsulation, online quasi-realtime runtime performance, and indelibility) This restricts us as programmers, but disciplines us as theorists.","We see the process of generation as involving three temporally intermingled activities: (1) determining what goals the utterance is to achieve, (2) planning what information content and rhetorical force will best meet those goals given the context, and (3) realiz/ng the specified information and rhetorical intent as a grammatical text. Our linguistic component (henceforth LC), the Zetalisp program MUMBLE, handles the third of these activities, taking a \"realiTztion specification \"4 as input, and producing a stream of morphologically specialiTed words 5 as output.","As described in [McDonald 1984], our LC is a \"description-directed\" process: it uses the structure of the realization specification it is given, plus the syntactic surface structure of the text in pro~ss (which it extends incrementally as the specification is realized) to directly control its actions, interpreting them as though they were sequential computer programs. This technique imposes strong demands on the descriptive formalima used for representing surface structure. For example, nodes and category labeis now designate actions the generator is to take (e.g. imposing scoping relations or constraining embedded decisions) and dictate the inclusion of function words and morphological specializations.","3 \"~ty\" in a computation requires that no action of a process (making decisions, constructing represeatations, chan8~ state, etc.) can be tramparently undone once it has been performed. Many nonbacktracking, nonfntra~ program designs have this property; it is our term for what Marcus [1980] referred to as the property of being \"strictly determlnhtic'.","4A realization specification can informally be taken to correspond to what many researchers, partioti~iy p~hok~t.% lhink of Its the \"me~tge love.J\" g~Uttion of a text.","5 Which is to say tb~t it presently produces written rath~ .hn ~ok~ U~UI.

Two of the most important generation systems that have been developed, PROTEUS [Davey 1974] and NIGPJ- [Mann & Matthieuen 1983], use systemic grammar, and others, including our own, have been strongly influenced by it. The reasons for this enthusiamn are central to the special concerns of generation. Systemic grammars employ a functional vocabulary: they emphasize the uses to which language can be put--how languages achieve their speakers\" goals-rather than its formal structure. Since the generation process begins with goals, unlike the comprehem/on process which begins with structure, this orientation makes systemic grammars more immediately useful than, for example, transformational generative grammars or even procedurally oriented AI formalisms for language such as A TN's.","The generation researcher's primary question is why use one construction rather than another--active instead of passive, \"the\" instead of \"a\". The principle device of a systemic grammar, the \"choice sy~em\", supports this question by highlighting how the constructions of the language are grouped into sets of alternatives. Choice systems provide an anchoring point for the rules of a theory of language use since it is natural to a~ociate the various semantic, discourse, or rhetorical criteria that bear on the selection of a given construction or feature with the choice system to which the construction belongs, thus providing the basis of a decision-procedure for selecting from its listed alternatives; the NIGEL system does precisely this in its \"chooser\" procedures.","In our formalism we make use of the same information as a systemic grammar captures, however we have choosen to bundle it quite differently. The underlying reason for this is that our concern for psycholinguistic modeling and efficient processing takes precedence in our design decisions about how the facts of language and language use should be represented in a generator. It is thus instructive to look at the different kinds of linguistic information that a network of choice systems carry. In our system we distribute these to separate computational dev/ces.","o Dependencies among structural features: A generator must respect the constraints that dependencies impose and appreciate the impact they have on its realization options: for example that some subordinate clauses can not express tense or modality while main clauses are required to; or that a pronominal direct object forces particle movement while a lexical object leaves it optional.","o Usage criteria. The decision procedures amoc/ated with each choice system are not a part of the grammar per se, although they are naturally associated with it and organized by it. Also most systemic grammars include very abstract featur~ such as \"generic reference\" or \"completed action\", which cross-correlate the language's surface features, and thus are more controllers of why a construct is used rather than conshucts themselves.","o Coordinated structural alternatives. A sentence may be either active or passive, either a question or a statement. By groupin 8 these alternatives into systems and using these systems exdusively when constructing a text, one is guaranteed not to combine inconsistent structural features. \"7","o Efficient ordering of choices. The network that connect, choice t~stems provides a natural path between decisiom, which if followed strictly guarentees that a choice will not be made unlm it is required, and that it will not be made before any of the choic_~___ that it it itself dependent upon, insuring that it can","151 be made indelibly. ~ o"]},{"title":"Typology of sm'face","paragraphs":["structure.

Generating qua/ions m/ng a TAG version of wh-movement","paragraphs":["Earlier we illustrated the TAG concept of \"linking\" by showing how one would start with an initial tree consisting of the /nnermost clause of a question plus the fronted wh-phrase and then build outward by successively adjoining the desired auxiliary phrases to the S node that intervenes between the wh-phrase and the clause. Wh-questions are thus built from the bottom up, as in fact is any sentence involving verbs taking sentential complements.","analylis has the desirable property of allowing one to state the dependendes between the Wh-phrase and the gap as a local relation on a single elementary tree, eliminating the need to Include any machinery for movement in the theory. All unbounded dependendes now derive from adjunctions (which, as far as the grammar is concerned, can be made without limit), rather than to the expficit migration of a constituent acrms clauses.","We also find this locality property to be desirable, and use an analogous procedure in our production of questiona and other kinds of Whquestions and unbounded dependency constructions.","This \"bottom-up\" design has consequences for how the realization specifications for these constructions must be organized. In particular, the logician's usual representation of sentential complement verbs as higher operators is not tenable in that role. For example we cannot have the source of, say, How many ships did Reuters report that Iraq had said it attacked? be the expreuion: Lambda(quantlty-of-shlps) . report(Reuters, sty(Lraq, attack(Iraq, quantity-of-ships))) Such an expression defines a natural sequence of exposure when used as realization specification, namely that one realize the Lmnlght operator first, the report operator second, the sty third, and so on. A local TAG analysis of Wh-movement requires us to have the Lambda and the expression containing its matrix trace, attach, be present in a single \"layer\" of the specification, otherwise we would be forced to violate one of the strong principles of our theory of generation, namely that the characteristics in a realization class may \"see\" only the immediate arguments of the unit being realized; they may not' look \"inside\" those arguments to subsequent levels of conceptual structure.","This principle has served t~s well, and we are disinclined to give it up without a very compelling reason. We elected instead to give up the internal representation of sentential complement verb texts as tingle expressions. This move was easy for us to make since such expreuions are awkward to manipulate in the \"East Coast\" style frame knowledge bases that we use in our own reasonin S programs, and we have preferred a representational style with redundant, smaller sized conceptual units for quite some time.","The representation~ we use instead amounts to breaking up the logical expression into individual units and allowing them to include references to each other.","U I = lambda(quantity-of-shipa) . attack(Iraq,quantity-of-ships)","U 2 = sty(Iraq, U1) u 3 : repo.(Reuten, U2) 160","Given such a network as the realization specification, the LC must have some principle by which to judge where to start: which unit should form the basis of the surface mucture to which the others are then attached? A natural principle to adopt is to begin with the '°rash\" unit, i~. the one that does not mention any other units in its definition. We are comiderin s adopting the policy that such units should be allowed only realizations as initial trees while units whose definition involves \"pointing to\" (naming) other units shouldbe allowed only rea!iza\" tions as auxiliary trees. We have not, however, worked through all of the ramifications such a policy might have on other parts of our generation model; without yet knowing whether it would improve or degrade the other parts of our theory, we are reluctant to assert it as one of our hypotheses relating our generation model to TAG's.","Given that three part source, the realization of the question is fairly straightforward (See Figure 9). The Lambda expression is assigned a realization class for clausal Wh constructions, whereupon the ©xUscted argument quantlty.of.shlps is placed in COMP, and the body of the expression is placed in the HEAD position. At the same time, the two instances of qumd/ty-of-ehIp8 are specially marked. The one in COMP is ass/gned to the realization class for Wh phrases appropriate to quantity (e.g. it will have the choice how many X and possibly related choices such as <quantity> of which and other variants appropriate to relative clauses or other positions where Wh constructions can be used). Simultaneously the instance of quanflty-ef-eidps in the argument position of the head frame attack is assigned to the realization class for Wh-trace. These two specializations are the equivalent, in our model, of the TAG linking relation."]},{"title":"~ ~\" Reuters reports S Iraq say S comp / WH(ships)","paragraphs":["° Fitmre 9 Qeesaea fermae[oa with ~ ¢emplement verbs","The two pending units, U 2 and U3, are then attached to this matrix, submerging first the attach unit and then U 2 into complement positions."]},{"title":"161 7. Extensions to'the 'l]~eory of TAG","paragraphs":["Context-free grammars are able to express the word formation processes that seem to exist for natural language, (cf. Williams [1981], Selkirk [1982]). A TAG analysis of inch a grammar seems like a natural application to the current version of the theory (d. Puste~k-y (in preparation)). To illustrate our point, consider compounding rules in English. We can say that for a context-free grammar for word formation, Gw, there is a TAG, T w, that is equivalent to G w (d.

Had there been no word-level compound realization option, we would have worked our way into a corner without expressing the relation between #<oil> and #<tanker>. Because of this it may be better to view units such as U 4 as being associated directly with a lexical compounded form, i.e. oil tanker. This partial solution, however, would not speak to the problem of active word formation in the language. Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare the strategic decisions made by a generation system with those planning mistakes made by humans when speaking. This is an aspect of generation that merits much further research. 163"]},{"title":"8.
