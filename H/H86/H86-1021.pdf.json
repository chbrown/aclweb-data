Such knowledge can be of several dilferent varieties and can be represented and used in a number of different ways. Taken collectively, the information that a.system has of its users is typically refered to as its user model. This is so even when it is distributed through out many components of the system. Examples that we have been involved with include systems which attempt to provide help and advice [4, 5, 15], tutorial systems [14], and natural language interlaces [16]. Each el these systems has a need to represent information about individual users. Most el the information is acquired incrementaly through direct observation and/or interaction. These systems also needed to infer additional facts about their users based on the directly acquired informalion. For example, the WIZARD help system [4, 15] had to represent which VMS operating system objects (e.g. commands, command qualifiers, concepts, etc) a user was familiar with and to infer which other objects he was likely to be familiar with. We are evolving the e design of a general user model maintenance system which would support the modeling needs of the projects mentioned above. The set of services which we envision the model maintenance system pedorming includes: • maintaining a data base of observed facts about the","user. • infering additional true facts about the user based on the","observed facts. • infering additional facts which are likely to be true based on default facts and default roles. • informing the application system when certain facts can be infered to be true or assumed true. • maintaining the consistency of the model by retracting default information when it is not consistent with the observed facts. providing a mechanism for building hierarchies of stereotypes which can form initial, partial user models. • recognizing when a set of observed lacts about a user is no longer consistent with a given stereotype and suggesting alternative stereotypes which are consistent.

In trying to specify what is being refered to as a user model, one has to answer a number of questions: who is being modeled; what aspects of the user are being modeled; how is the model to be in'rtially acquired; how will it be maintained; and how will it be used. In this section we will attempt to characterize our own approach by answering these questions."]},{"title":"Who is being modeled?","paragraphs":["The primary distinctions here are whether one is modeling individual users or a class of users and whether one is attempting to construct a short or long term model. We are interested in the aquisition and use of lonq ter m models of individual users.

It will be neccessary, of course,to represent generic facts which are true of large classes (even all) of users. In particular, such facts may include inference rules which relate a person's belief, knowledge or understanding of one thing to his belief, knowledge and understanding of others. For example In the context of a timeshared computer system we may want to include a rule like:","ff a user U believes that machine M is running,","then U will believe that it is possible for him to log","onto M. It is just this sort of rule which is required in order to support the kinds el cooperative interactions studied in [6] and [7], such as the following:"]},{"title":"224","paragraphs":["User: Xs UPZI~-LXNC up?","System: Ces, but. you aen't 1o9' on now. P~eventatlve maintenance is being done until ll:OOam. What is to be modeled? Our current work is focused on building a general purpose, domain independent model maintenance system. Exactly whet information is to be modeled is up to the application. For example, a natural language system may need to know what language terms a user is likely to be familiar with [16], a CAI system for second language teaming may need to model a user's knowledge of grammatical mias [14], an intelligent database query system may want to model which fields ot a data base reialion a user is Interested in [10], and an expert system may need to model a user's domain goals [11).. How is the model to be aquired and maintained? We are exploring a system in which an initial model of the user will be selected from a set of stereotypical user models [13]. Selecting the most appropriate stereotype from the set can be accomplished by a number of techniques, from letting the user select one to surveying the user and having an expert system select one. Once an initial model has been selected, it will be updated and maintained as direct knowledge about the user Is aquired from the interaction. Since the use of stereotypical user models is a kind of default reason/ng[12], we will use truth maintenance techniques[9) for maintaining a consistent model. In padicular, if we learn something which contradicts a tact in the our current model of the user than we need to update the model. Updating the model may lead to an Inconsistency which must be squared away. If the mode! can he made consistent by changing any of the default facts In the model, then this should be done. If there is a choice of which defaults to alter, then a mechanism must be provided to do this (e.g. through further dialogue with.the user). If there are no defaults which can be altered to make the model consistent then the stereotype must be abandoned and a new one sought. How Is the model to be used? The model can be accessed in two primary ways: facts can be added, deleted or updated from the model and facts can be looked up or inlerad. A forward chaining component together with a truth maintenance system can be used to update the default assumptions and keep the model consistent."]},{"title":"Architectures for User Modeling Systems","paragraphs":["Our goal Is to provide a general user modeling utility organized along the lines shown in figures 1 and 2. The user modeling system provides a service to an application program which interacts directly with a. user. This application program gathers Information about the user through this interaction and chosas to store some of this information in the user model. Thus, one service the user model provides is accepting (and storiogl) new Information about the user. This Information may trigger an Inferential process which could have a number of outcomes:","• The user modeling system may detect an Inconsistency","and so Intorm the applioation.","• The user model may infer a new fact about the user","which Idggers a demon causing some action (e.g.","informing the application)."]},{"title":"G-u,,k~","paragraphs":["A: an Application","GUMS: General User Modeling System GUMS(A): Modeling System for Application A GUMS(A,U): Model lor User U in Application A Figure 1: A General Architecture for a User Modeling Utility U3 • S1 $2 S3 $4"]},{"title":"A A 1 $5 $6 U2 $7 $8 I U1","paragraphs":["NULL: the Empty Stereotype St: Stereotype i UI: User I Figure 2: A User Modeling System for an Application"]},{"title":"225","paragraphs":["• The user model may need to update soma previously Infered default Information about the user Another kind of service the user model must provide is answedng queries posed by the application. The application may need to look up or deduce certain Information about its current user. We are currently experimenting with some of these ideas in a system called GUMSp This system is implemented In proiog and used a simple default logic together with a backward chaining Interpreter rather than a truth maintenance system and a forward chaining engine. The next section describes GUMS t and its use of default logic. Default Logic and User Modeling A user model is most useful in a situation where the application does not have complete Information about the knowledge and beliefs of its users. This leaves us with the problem of how to model a user given we have only a limited amount ol knowledge about him. Our approach involves using several forms of default reasoning techniques: stereotypes, explicit default rules, and failure as negation. We assume that the GUMS 1 system will be used In an application which incrementaly gains new knowledge about its users throughout the interaction. But the mere ability to gain new knowledge about the user is not enough. We can not waif until we have full knowledge about a user to reason about him. Fortunately we can very often make generalization about users or classes of users. We call a such a generalization a stereotype. A slereotype consists of a set of facts and rules that are believed to applied to a class of users. Thus a stereotype gives us a form of default reasoning. Stereotypes can be organized in hierarchies in which one stereotype subsumes another if it can be thought to be mare general. A stereotype S t is said to be mere general than a stereotype S 2 it eveq~,thlng which is true about S t is necoessarily true about S 2. Looking at this from another vantage point, a stereotype inherits all the facts and rules from every stereotype that it is subsumed by. For example, in the context of a programmer's apprentice application, we might have stereotypes corresponding to different classes of programmer, as is suggested by the the hierarchy In figure 2. In general, we will want a stereotype to have any number of Immediate ancestors, allowing us to compose a new stereotype out of several existing ones. In the cmntext of a programmers apprentice, gor example, we may wish to describe a particular user as a SymbolicsWizard and a UnixNovice and a ScribeUser. Thus, the stereotype system should form a general lattice. Our current system constrains the system to a tree. Within a stereotype we can have default Information as well. For instance, we can be sure that a programmer will know what a file is, but we can only guess that a programmer will know what a file directoq, is. If we have categorized a given user under the programmer stereotype and discover 1 that he is not familiar with the concept of a file then we can conctudethat we had improperly chosen a stereotype and most choose a new one. But if we got the information that he did not know what a file directory was, this would not rule out the possibility of him being a programmer° Thus GUMS 1 1perhaps tlwough direct Interac6on with her","P EOgEz~wI E","/\\...","/","Progr-~4 -,gWizard","! \\","/ \\","LispMachineWizard UnixHacker","l \\ I\\","/ \\ ......","Sy~olicsWizard XeroxWi=ard Figure 3: A Hierachy of Stereotypes allows rules and facts within a stereotype to be either definitely true or true by default (i.e. in the absence ol information to the contrary.) In GUMS t we use the certain/1 predicate to introduce a definite fact or rule and the default/1 predicate to indicate a default fact or rule, as in:","certain(P).","certain(P il Q).","a definite fact: P is true.","a definite rule: P is true if Q is","definitely true and P is assumed to be","true if Q is only assumed to be true. default(P), a default fact: P is assumed to be true","unless it is known to be lalse. default(P if Q). a default rule: P is assumed to be true","if Q is true or assumed to be true and","there is no definite evidence to the","contrary.","As an example, consider a situation in which we need to model a","persons familiarity with cedain terms.

(d) This user does understand the term cpu. GUMS I also treats negation as failure in some cases as a default rule. In general, logic is interpreted using an open wodd assumption. That is, the failure to be able to prove a proposition is not taken as evidence that it is not tree. Many logic programming languages, such a prolog, encourage the interpretation of unprovability as logical negation. Two approaches have been forwarded to justify the 226 negation as failure rule. One approach IS the closed world assumption [2]. In tide case we assume that anything not inferable from the database is by necessity laise. One problem with this assumption is that this IS a mataisvat assumption and we do not know what the equlvatent obJecl level assumptions are. A second approach originated by Clark is based upon the conce~ of a completed database [I]. A completed database is the database constmctad by rewdtlng the set of clauses deflnlng each predicate to an If and only If dalinltion that Is called the completion of the predicate. The purpose of the completed delinition is to Indicate that the clauses that define a prodioato define OVOry possible instance of"]},{"title":"that Wedioate.","paragraphs":["Any approach to negation as failure requires that a negated goal be ground before execution, (actually a sfightly less restrictive rule could agow a partially instanfiated negated goal to run but would produce the wrong answer if any vadable was bound.) Thus we must have some way of Insuring that every negated literal will be bound. In GUMS I we have used a simple vadabla typing scheme to achieve this, as will be discussed later. We have used a vadant of the completed database approach to show that a predicate within the scope of a negation is closed. A predicate is dosed if and only if if is defined by an ill statement and eveP/other predicate in the definition of this predicate IS closed. We allow a metaievel statement completed(P) that IS used to signify that by predicate P we really Intend the iff definition associated with P. This same technique was used by Kowaiskl[8] to indicate cernplation. By default we believe competed(P) where not indicated. So if P IS not explioltly closed not P IS decided by default. Thus In GUMS I we have the abiflty to express that a default should be taken from the lack of certain information (i.e. negation as failure) as well as from the presence of certain information (i.e. default rules). For example, we can have a default cuts for the programmer stereotype that can conclude knowledge about linkers from knowledge about compilers, as in:","default (knows (linkers) if knows (compilers)) We can also have a rule that will take the lack of knowledge about compilers as an indication that the user probably knows about interpreters, as in:","certain (knows (interpreters)","if - knOWS (compilers)) This system also allows explicit negative facts and default facts. When negation is proved in reference to a negative fact then negation is not censldered a default case. Slmilady negation as failure IS not considered a default when the predicate being negated IS closed. Such dlstinstions are possPate because the GUMSf Interpreter Is based on a four value logic. The distinction between truth or falsity by default (i.e. assumption) and truth or falsity by logical Implication IS an Impodanf one to this system. The central predicate of the system is the two aroumenf predicate show which relates a goal G expressed as a literal to a truth value. Thus show(GoaI,Val) returns in the vadable Va/the current beifef In the literal Goal The variable Valcan be Instantlated to true, false, assume(true), or ansume(fatse). The meanings of these values are as follows:","true definitely tree aocording to the current","database.","assume(true) true by assumption (i.e. tree by default)","aseume(fatse) false by assumption false ¢lefinltely not INs. These values represent truth values for a given user with respect to a given stereotype. If the stereotype Is net appropriate, then even define values may have to change. Having a four value logic allows us to distinguish conclusions made from purely iogicat information from those dependent on default Information. Four value logic also allows a simple type of intmspeclive reasoning that may be useful for modeling the beifels o! Ihe user. We currently use a default role to represent an uncertai. belief about what the user knows or believes, but we could imagine a situation where we would like to model uncertainties that Ihe user has in his beliefs or knowledge. One such predicate is an embeded show predicate. For example we might have a rule that a user will use a operating system command that he believe might erase a file only if he is certain that he knows how to 0se that command. This might encode as:","cart ain (okay to use (Co~nand) if","can erase files (Co--and),","sh~w tkno~(Command) , true) ) . Another pmdioate assumed(PrecO will evaluate the troth of Pred and \"strengthen\" the result. That is","demo(assumed(P),V) :-","demo (P, V2),","strengthen (V2, V) . where the strengthen relation maps assumed values into definite values (e.g. assume(true) becomes true, assume(false) becomes false and true and false remain unchanged). The assumed predicate Is used to express a cedain belief from an uncertain knowledge or belief. For example we might want to express a role that a user will always want to use a screen editor if he believes one may be available.","certain (willUse ( screenEditor ) if","assumed(available (screenEdltor)) ) . The interpreter that GUMSf is .base on is a metalevel interpreter wdtten in Prolog. The interpreter must generate and compare many possible answers to each subquery, because of the multiple value logic and the presence of explicit negative information. Slrono answers to a query (i.e. true and false) are sought first, followed by weak answers (i.e. assume(true) and assume(faLse)). Because strong answers have precedence over weak ones, it is not necessary to r4move weak information that contradicts strong information. Another feature of this system is that we can specify the types of arguments to predicates. This type information can be used to allow the system to handle non-ground goals. In our system, a type provides a way to enumerate a complete set of possible values subsumed by that type. When the top-level show predicate is given a partially instantlated goat to solve, it uses the type information to generate a stream of consistent fully instantiated goals. These ground goals are tried sequentially. That goals must be fully intantlated follows from the fact that negation as failure is built Into the evaluation algorithm. Complex terms wifl be instantiated to every pattern allowed by the datatype given the full power of unification. To specify the type information, one should specify argument types tot a predicate, subtype Information and type instance information. For example, the following says that the ¢anProgmm predicate ranges over instances of the type person and progmmmlngLanguage, that the type functtormlLanguage is a sub-type of programmlngLanguage and"]},{"title":"227","paragraphs":["that the value scheme is an instance of the functlonalLanguage: declare (eanProgram(person,","programmingLanguage) ) . • subtype (progrJm4ngLanguag~,","functionalLanguage} . inst (functionalLanguage, scheme} . type"]},{"title":"Limitations of the Present System","paragraphs":["OUr current system has several limitations. One problem is thai it does not extract all of the available information Item a now fact leamed of the user. If we assert thai a predicate is closed, we are saying that the set o! (cedain) rules for the predicate form a detinilion, i.e. a neccessary and sufficient description. In our current system, however, the information still only liows direction1 For example, suppose that we would like to encode the rule that a user knows about YO redirection if and only of they know about files and about pipes. Further, let's suppose that the default is that a person in this stereotype does not know about files or pipes. This can be expresses as:","certain (knows (io redirection} if","knows (pipes),","knows (files}) . default (~knows (pipes}) . default l-knows (files))","closed {knows (io redirection} ) . It we learn that a particular user doe_._._..s know about I/0 redirection then it should follow that she neocessarily knows about i:3oth files and pipes. Adding the assertion","certain (knows (io redirection) } however, will make no additional changes in the data base. The values of knows(pipes) and knows(files) will not changel A sample run alter this change might be :","?- show fknows (io redlrection) ,Val) .","Val = true","?- show (knows (pipes}, Val) . Val = assume(false)","?- show (knows (files}, Val} . Val = assume(false). The reason for this problem is that the current interpreter was designed to be able to Incorporate new information without actually using a full truth maintenance system. Before a fact F with truth value V Is to be added to the data base, GUMSf checks to see If an inconsistent truth value V'can be derived for F. If one can be, then a new stereotype is sought In which the contradiction goes away. New knowledge that does not force an obvious inconsistency within the database is added as is. Neither redundant information or existing default information effect the correctness of the Interpreter. Subtler inconsistencies are possible, of course. Another limitation of the current system its inefficiency. The use of default rules requires us to continue to search for solutions for a goal until a strong one is found or all solutions have been checked. These two limitations may be addressable by redesigning the system to be based on a forward chaining truth maintenance system. The question is whether the relative elfioiency of forward chaining will offset the relative Inefficiency el truth maintenance, \"lT'~e use of an assumption based truth maintenance system[3] Is another alternative that we will Investigate."]},{"title":"The GUMS 1 Command Language","paragraphs":["Our current experimental implementation provides the following commands to the application. show(Query,Vat) succeeds with Valas the strongest truth value Ior the gaol Query.
