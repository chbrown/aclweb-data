Our task is to characterize more precisely what this expected informativeness consists of. la question answering, there seem to be several quite different types of information, over and beyond the simple answer to a question, that are nevertheless expected. For example,","1. When a task-related question is posed to an expert {R), R is expected to provide additional information that he recognizes as necessary to the performance of the task, of which the qt:estioner (Q) may be unaware. Such response behavior was discussed and implemented by Alien [1] in a system to simulate a train information booth attendant responding to requests for schedule and track information. In this case, not providing the expected additional information is simply uncooperative: Q won't conclude the train doesn't depart at any time if ?~ fails to volunteer one.",": ~=~ i~:~ respect to discussions ald/or arguments, a speaker contradicting another is expected to supp~'~ his contrary contention. Again, failing to provide support would simply be viewed as u.~c~,o~erative [2, 3]. . With respect to an expert's responses to questions, if Q expects that R would inform him of P !f P were true, then Q may interpre t R's silence regarding P as implying P is not true. s Thus if I:~ k.qows P to be true, his silence may lead to Q's being misled. This third type of expected informativeness is the basis for the potentially misleading responses that we are trying to avoid a.~d that constitute the subject of this paper. What is of interest to us is"]},{"title":"characterizing","paragraphs":["the Ps that Q would expect an expert R to inform him of, if they hold. Notice that these Ps differ from script-based expectations [8], which are based on what is taken to be the ordinary course of events in a situation. In describing such a situation, if the speaker d,,esn't explicitly reference some element P of the script, the listener simply assumes it is true. On the other hand, the Ps of interest here are based on normal cooperative discourse behavior, as set out in Grice's maxims. If the speaker doesn't make explicit some information P that the listener believes he would possess and inform the listener of, the listener assumes it is false. In this paper, we attempt to give a formal account of a subclass of Ps that should be included (in addition to the simple answer) in response to questions involving Q's achieving some goal 4 - e.g., • Can I","3This is an interactional version of what Reiter [IS l has called the \"Closed World Assumption\" and what McCarthy [O] has discussed in the context of \"Circumscription'.","4A companion paper [6 ! discusses responses which may mislead Q into assuming some default which R knows not to hold.

In this endeavor, our first step is to specify that knowledge that an expert R must have in order to identify the Ps that Q would expect to be informed of, in response to his question. Our second step is to formalize that knowledge and show how the system can use it. Our third step is to show how the system can modify its planned response so as to convey those Ps. In this paper, Section 2 addresses the first step of this process and Sections 3 and 4 address the second. The third step we mention here only in passing."]},{"title":"2. Factors in Computing Likely Informing Behavior]","paragraphs":["Before discussing the factors involved in computing this desired system behavior, we want to call attention to the distinction we are drawing between actions and events, and between the stated goal of a question and its intended goal. We limit the term action to things that Q has some control over. Things beyond Q's control we will call events, even if performed by other agents. While events may be likel3/or even necessary,, Q and R nevertheless can do nothing more than wait for ~hem to happen. This distinction between ~ctions and events shows up in R's response behavior: if an action is needed, R can suggest that Q perform it. If an event is, R can do no more than inform Q. Our second distinction is between the stated goal or \"S-goal = of a request and its intended goal or =I-goal =. The former is the goal most directly associated with Q's request, beyond that Q know the information. That is, we take the S-goal of a request to be the goal directly achieved by using the information. Underlying the stated goal of a request though may be another goal that the speaker wants to achieve. This intended goal or °l-go3!\" may be related to the S-goal of the request in any of a number of ways: • The l-goal may be the same as the S-goal. • The l-goal may be more abstract than the S-goal, which addresses only part of the I-goal. (This is the standard goal/sub-goal relation found in hierarchical planning [14].) For example, Q's S-goal may be to delete some files (e.g., *How can I delete all but the last version of FOO.MSS?°), while his l-goal may be to bring his file usage under quota. This more abstract goal may also involve archiving some other files, moving some into another person's directory, etc.","* The S-goai may be an enablinK condition for the I-goal. For example, Q's S-goal may be to get read/write access to a file, while his I-goal may be to alter it. The l-goal may be more ~eneral than the S-goal. For example, Q's S-goal may be to know how to repeat a control-N, while his l-goal may be to know how to effect multiple sequential instances of a control character. Conversely, the l-goal may be more specific than the S-goal - for example, Q's S-goal may be to know how to send files to someone on another machine, while his I-goal is just to send a particular file to a local network user, which may allow for a specialized procedure. Inferring the l-goal corresponding to an S-goal is an active area.of research [1, Carberry83, 10, 11]. We assume for the purposes of this paper that R can successfuUy do so. One problem is that the relationship that Q believes to hold between his S-goal and his I-goal may not actually hold: for example, the S-goal 181 may not fulfill part of the bgoal, or it may not instantiate it, or it may not be a pre-condition for it. In fact, the S-goal may not even be possible to effect! This failure, under the rubric \"relaxing the appropriate-query assumption', is discussed in more detail in [10,"]},{"title":"nl.","paragraphs":["It is also reason for augmenting R's response with appropriate Ps, as we note informally in this section and more formally in the next. Having drawn these distinctions, we now claim that in order for the system to compute both a direct answer to Q's request and such Ps as he would expect to be informed of, were they true, the system must be able to draw upon knowledge/beliefs about • the events or actions, if any, that can bring about a goal • their enabling conditions","• the likelihood of an event occuring or the enabling conditions for an action holding, with respect to a state • ways of evaluating methods of achieving goals - for example, with respect to simplicity, other consequences (side effects), likelihood of success, etc. • general characteristics of cooperative expert behavior The roles played by these different types of knowledge (as well as specific examples of them) are well illustrated in the next section."]},{"title":"3. Formalizing Knowledge for Expert Response","paragraphs":["In this section we give examples of how a formal model of user beliefs about cooperative expert behavior can be used to avoid misleading responses to task-related questions - in particular, what is a very representative set of questions, those of the form =How do I do X? =.

Conclusion","paragraphs":["Since the behavior of expert systems will be interpreted in terms of the behavior users expect of cooperative human experts, we (as system designers} must understand such behavior patterns so as to implement them in our systems. If such systems are to be truly cooperative, it is not sufficient for them to be simply truthful. Additionally, they must be able to predict limited classes of false inferences that users might draw from dialogue with them and also to respond in a way to prevent those false inferences. The current enterprise is a small but non-trivial step in this direction.
