The nucleus and satellites do not necessarily correspond to a single uninterrupted text span.","8. The relation definition must be consistent with the spans of text related by the instantiation of the schema containing the relation.","It is possible for the conventions to apply to a text in more than one way, so that the text is rhetorically ambiguous. A relation definition specifies three kinds of information: 1. A characterization of the nucleus. 2. A characterization of the satellite. 3. A characterization of what sorts of interactions between the conceptual","span of the nucleus and the conceptual span of the satellite must be","plausible.","To define, for example, the motivation relation, we would include at least the following.","1. The nucleus describes an action performable, but not yet performed, by the reader.","2. The satellite describes the action, the situation in which the action takes place, or the result of the action in ways that help the reader associate value assessments with the action.","3. The expected value assessments are positive, to lead the reader to want to perform the action.","The relational propositions do not arise independently of the relation definitions. Rather, finding that a relation definition holds is sufficient to establish the corresponding relational proposition. As readers recognize the functional relations of the parts, they are recognizing that the relation definitions hold. The content of the relational proposition is identified in this process. As a consequence, the definition scheme for RST requires no additional definitions in order to specify the relational proposition. In any particular case, the proposition can be derived from the way the relation definition fits.","We have found the relation definitions, useful in predicting other facts about the text, such as the kinds of conjunctions that will appear in certain places. We have analyzed a large number of texts, including thousands of clauses, in this way. We are confident that we can perform this analysis, with fairly high reliability, for virtually any small, written, multisentence monologue in general American culture, using only about 25 schemas.","Note that these rhetorical schemas are defined in terms of the functions of segments of text. The evidence relation applies when one segment supports another as evidence, Solutionhood applies when we can see one segment as identifying a 267 problem and another as a partial solution to that problem. These are not criteria of form; as one might expect, the relationship of these function categories to form categories is quite loose. The rhetorical structure of text, in these terms, is composed of function-specific units. The structure does not express categories of knowledge or form as much as it expresses the roles of specific parts in relation to the whole text, especially the role of each satellite relative to one particular, immediate portion of the text, the corresponding nucleus."]},{"title":"3 RST as an Account of Relational Propositions","paragraphs":["The key observation for the purposes of this paper is:","For every relation of the rhetorical structure of a text, a corresponding relational proposition is asserted.","For solutionhood relations, the discourse structure asserts a solutionhood proposition. For evidence relations it asserts an evidence proposition, and so forth. Readers attribute the assertions to the text because they recognize the functional relations of the parts. Now we can explain why relational pi'opositions are coherence-producing.","First, RST structures always have the connectivity of trees. The schema application conventions guarantee this, because when a span is decomposed, each of the parts is further decomposed separately.","If a portion of the text is to be connected to the whole without being a non-sequitur, some relation must be established. A relation is established through implicit assertion of a relational proposition. Since the relations form a tree, denial of any one relational proposition is sufficient to separate the structure into two parts, thus destroying connectedness, a key attribute of coherence.","Now we can also explain why relational propositions are always present in coherent multisentence texts. In regarding the text as a single whole, readers impute rhetorical structure to it, necessarily positing relations between the parts; the relations give rise to assertion of relational propositions.","We can also see how to create more precise specifications of relational propositions. They can be developed from the relation definitions of RST. RST tells what sorts of propositions can be relational, gives the conditions under which relational propositions arise, and tells how to alter a text or a situation so that the asserted relational proposition is changed. Rather than simply searching texts for potential relational propositions, we can search rhetorical structures for the necessary relational propositions. 268"]},{"title":"4 Uses of Rhetorical Structure Theory","paragraphs":["Rhetorical Structure Theory provides an attractive basis for explaining relational propositions, although some details need development.","In addition, RST satisfies some of the attributes identified in section 2, above, as desirable for a descriptive theory of text organization. It is comprehensive enough to apply to many different kinds of text; it is functional, in that it explains what various portions of a text do for the writer. And it is scale insensitive, applying to a wide range of sizes of units, from simple clauses up to whole magazine articles.","However, RST still lacks two desired attributes: It needs for more detailed expression of each part, and it would be useful to develop a constructive counterpart to the descriptions, a way to select schemas and plan texts.","In addition to these attributes, benefits of RST. we recognize other opportunities for and","1.

We have found no boundary for its uses; it is like trying to delimit the uses of a grammar. We have identified the following as particularly attractive applications: • Thematization and text development .
