At its core is a multilingual, knowledge-based, interlingual, interactive, machine-assisted translation system consisting of a source language analysis component, an interactive augmentor, and a target language generation component. During the initial phase, the CRL's objectives were to develop tools for constructing lexical items and ontological entries automatically from on-line resources, to develop the initial Spanish analysis component, and, jointly with CMT and ISI, to establish the infrastructure for the three site project, develop the formats and initial content of the interlingua, the ontology, and the knowledge base, and to prepare design documents for the second phase versions of the analysis and generation components, the augmentor, and the translator's workstation. The second phase is a two-year program, and we are currently in the first six months of this phase. Building on the results of the initial phase, the second phase calls for the construction of a new analysis component, with a considerably broader base than the first year analysis sytem, and incorporating a wider variety of fail-soft techniques; development and incorporation of the ontology into the year-two system; use of the jointly-developed in-terlingua; continued emphasis on automatic acquisition of lexical and semantic information. RECENT RESULTS At this p6int, a first version of the year-two analysis system has been completed and is undergoing expansion and refinement. The initial ontology has been constructed, and a large number of sense-tokens have been incorporated. A phrasal lexicon has been extracted from on-line dictionary resources and is being prepared for incorporation into the Translator's WOrkstation. The second year analysis sytem begins with a dictionarybased part-of-speech tagger, followed by a component which chunks the tagged text into small syntactic sections. These are analyzed and semantic/lexical information accessed and incorporated into the representation by a constituent parser. These smaller constituents will be grouped into predicates and arguments, which are then further grouped into clausal structures. At each level, possible readings are rated for syntactic and semantic likelihood. With respect to automatic acquisition, several advances have occurred in the past year.

PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR By next fall we hope to extend the project to a second source language (Japanese). During the remainder of phase 2, we will deepen and broaden the coverage of the analysis system. Broadening will include further addition of domain-specific lexical items (and a new domain) and the inclusion of proper name recognizers of various types (gazetteers, company names, personal names and titles). Deepening will involve working withthe ontology to sharpen the semantic coherence judgments-providing fewer but more likely analyses for each input sentence. 406"]}]}
