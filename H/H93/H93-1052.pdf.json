In this paper we show that for certain definitions of collocation, a polysemous word exhibits essentially only one sense per collocation. We test this empirical hypothesis for several definitions of sense and collocation, and discover that it holds with 90-99% accuracy for binary ambiguities. We utilize this property in a disambiguation algorithm that achieves precision of 92% using combined models of very local context. 1. INTRODUCTION The use of collocations to resolve lexical ambiguities is certainly not a new idea. The first approaches to sense disambiguation, such as [Kelly and Stone 1975], were based on simple hand-built decision tables consisting almost exclusively of questions about observed word associations in specific positions. Later work from the AI community relied heavily upon selectional restrictions for verbs, although primarily in terms of features exhibited by their arguments (such as +DRINKABLE) rather than in terms of individual words or word classes. More recent work [Brown et al. 1991][Hearst 1991] has utilized a set of discrete local questions (such as"]},{"title":"word-to-the-right)","paragraphs":["in the development of statistical decision procedures. However, a strong trend in recent years is to treat a reasonably wide context window as an unordered bag of independent evidence points. This technique from information retrieval has been used in neural networks, Bayesian discriminators, and dictionary definition matching. In a comparative paper in this volume [Leacock et al. 1993], all three methods under investigation used words in wide context as a pool of evidence independent of relative position. It is perhaps not a coincidence that this work has focused almost exclusively on nouns, as will be shown in Section 6.2. In this study we will return again to extremely local sources of evidence, and show that models of discrete syntactic relationships have considerable advantages.","*This research was supported by an NDSEG Fellowship and by DARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863.

DEFINITIONS OF SENSE The traditional definition of word sense is \"One of several meanings assigned to the same orthographic string\". As meanings can always be partitioned into multiple refinements, senses are typically organized in a tree such as one finds in a dictionary. In the extreme case, one could continue making refinements until a word has a slightly different sense every time it is used. If so, the title of this paper is a tautology. However, the studies in this paper are focused on the sense distinctions at the top of the tree. A good working definition of the distinctions considered are those meanings which are not typically translated to the same word in a foreign language. Therefore, one natural type of sense distinction to consider are those words in English which indeed have multiple translations in a language such as French. As is now standard in the field, we use the Canadian Hansards, a parallel bilingual corpus, to provide sense tags in the form of French translations. Unfortunately, the Hansards are highly skewed in their sense distributions, and it is difficult to find words for which there are adequate numbers of a second sense. More diverse large bilingual corpora are not yet readily available. We also use data sets which have been hand-tagged by native English speakers. To make the selection of sense distinctions more objective, we use words such as"]},{"title":"bass","paragraphs":["where the sense distinctions"]},{"title":"(fish","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"musical instrument)","paragraphs":["correspond to pronunciation differences ([b~es] and [beIs]). Such data is often problematic, as the tagging is potentially subjective and error-filled, and sufficient quantities are difficult to obtain. As a solution to the data shortages for the above methods, [Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b] proposed the use of \"pseudo-words,\" artificial sense ambiguities created by taking two English words with the same part of speech (such as"]},{"title":"guerilla and reptile),","paragraphs":["and replacing each instance of both in a corpus with a new polysemous word"]},{"title":"guerrilla~reptile.","paragraphs":["As it is entirely possible that the concepts guerrilla and reptile are represented by the same orthographic string in some foreign language, choosing between these two meanings based on context is a problem a word sense disambiguation algorithm could easily face. \"Pseudo-words\" are very useful for developing and testing disambiguation methods because of their nearly unlimited availability and the known, fully reliable 266 ground truth they provide when grading performance. Finally, we consider sense disambiguation for mediums other than clean English text. For example, we look at word pairs such as terse/tense and cookie/rookie which may be plausibly confused in optical character recognition (OCR). Homophones, such as aid~aide, and censor/sensor, are ideal can-didates for such a study because large data sets with known ground truth are available in written text, yet they are true ambiguities which must be resolved routinely in oral communication. We discover that the central claims of this paper hold for all of these potential definitions of sense. This corroborating evidence makes us much more confident in our results than if they were derived solely from a relatively small hand-tagged data set. 3. DEFINITIONS OF COLLOCATION Collocation means the co-occurrence of two words in some defined relationship. We look at several such relationships, including direct adjacency and first word to the left or right having a certain part-of-speech. We also consider certain direct syntactic relationships, such as verb/object, subject/verb, and adjective/noun pairs. It appears that content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) behave quite differently from function words (other parts of speech); we make use of this distinction in several definitions of collocation. We will attempt to quantify the validity of the one-sense-per-collocation hypothesis for these different collocation types."]},{"title":"4.

For each type of collocation, we also compute how well an observed probability distribution predicts the correct classification for novel examples. In general, this is a more useful measure for most of the comparison purposes we will address. Not only does it reflect the underlying entropy of the distribution, but it also has the practical advantage of showing how a working system would perform given this data. 5. ALGORITHM The sense disambiguation algorithm used is quite straightforward. When based on a single collocation type, such as the object of the verb or word immediately to the left, the procedure is very simple. One identifies if this collocation type exists for the novel context and if the specific words found are listed in the table of probability distributions (as computed above). If so, we return the sense which was most frequent for that collocation in the training data. If not, we return the sense which is most frequent overall. When we consider more than one collocation type and combine evidence, the process is more complicated. The algorithm used is based on decision lists [Rivest, 1987], and was discussed in [Sproat, Hirschberg, and Yarowsky 1992]. The goal is to base the decision on the single best piece of evidence available. Cross-validated probabilities are computed as in Section 4.2, and the different types of evidence are sorted by the absolute value of the log of these probabil- • • .

The sense with the greatest listed probability is returned, and this cross-validated probability represents the confidence in the answer. This approach is well-suited for the combination of multiple evidence types which are clearly not independent (such as those found in this study) as probabilities are never combined. Therefore this method offers advantages over Bayesian classifier techniques which assume independence of the features used. It also offers advantages over decision tree based techniques because the training pools are not split at each question. The interesting problems are how one should reestimate probabilities conditional on questions asked earlier in the list, or how one should prune lower evidence which is categorically subsumed by higher evidence or is entirely conditional on higher evidence. [Bahl et al. 1989] have discussed some of these issues at length, and there is not space to consider them here. For simplicity, in this experiment no secondary smoothing or pruning is done. This does not appear to be problematic when small numbers of independent evidence types are used, but performance should increase if this extra step is taken. 6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 6.1.

Part of Speech Differences","paragraphs":["It is interesting to note the difference in behavior between different parts of speech. Verbs, for example, derive more disambiguating information from their objects (.95) than from their subjects (.90). Adjectives derive almost all of their disambiguatinginformation from the nouns they modify (.98). Nouns are best disambiguated by directly adjacent adjectives or nouns, with the content word to the left indicating a single sense with 99% precision. Verbs appear to be less useful for noun sense disambiguation, although they are relatively better indicators when the noun is their object rather than their subject. 97% of samples of a given collocation exhibit the same sense, this is the expected precision of a disambiguafion algorithm which assumes one sense per collocation, when applied to new samples of these collocations. 269 Figure ] shows that nouns, verbs and adjectives also differ in their ability to be disambiguated by wider context. [Gale et al. 1993] previously showed that nouns can be disambiguated based strictly on distant context, and that useful information was present up to 10,000 words away. We replicated an experiment in which performance was calculated for disambiguations based strictly on 5 word windows centered at various distances (shown on the horizontal axis). Gale's observation was tested only on nouns; our experiment also shows that reasonably accurate decisions may be made for nouns using exclusively remote context. Our results in this case are based on test sets with equal numbers of the two senses. Hence chance performance is at 50%. However, when tested on verbs and adjectives, precision drops off with a much steeper slope as the distance from the ambiguous word increases. This would indicate that approaches giving equal weight to all positions in a broad window of context may be less well-suited for handling verbs and adjectives. Models which give greater weight to immediate context would seem more appropriate in these circumstances. A similar experiment was applied to function words, and the dropoff beyond strictly immediate context was precipitous, converging at near chance performance for distances greater than 5. However, function words did appear to have predictive power of roughly 5% greater than chance in directly adjacent positions. The effect was greatest for verbs, where the function word to the right (typically a preposition or particle) served to disambiguate at a precision of 13% above chance. This would indicate that methods which exclude function words from models to minimize noise should consider their inclusion, but only for restricted local positions."]},{"title":"6.3.

Algorithm Design","paragraphs":["Our results also have implications for algorithm design. For the large number of current approaches which treat wide context as an unordered bag of words, it may be beneficial to model certain local collocations separately. We have shown that reliability of collocational evidence differs considerably between local and distant context, especially for verbs and adjectives. If one one is interested in providing a probability with an answer, modeling local collocations separately will improve the probability estimates and reduce cross entropy. Another reason for modeling local collocations separately is that this will allow the reliable inclusion of evidence with very low frequency counts. Evidence with observed frequency distributions of 1/0 typically constitute on the order of 50% of all available evidence types, yet in a wide context window this low frequency evidence is effectively noise, with predictive power little better than chance. However, in very local collocations, single data points carry considerable information, and when used alone can achieve precision in excess of 92%. Their inclusion should improve system recall, with a much-reduced danger of overmodeling the data."]},{"title":"7.3. Building a Full Disambiguation System","paragraphs":["Finally, one may ask to what extent can local collocational evidence alone support a practical sense disambiguation algorithm. As shown in Table 3, our models of single collocation types achieve high precision, but individually their applicability is limited. However, if we combine these models as described in Section 5, and use an additional function word collocation model when no other evidence is available, we achieve full coverage at a precision of 92%. This result is comparable to those previously reported in the literature using wider context of up to 50 words away [5,6,7,12]. Due to the large number of variables involved, we shall not attempt to compare these directly. Our results are encouraging, however, and and we plan to conduct a more formal comparison of the \"bag of words\" approaches relative to our separate modeling of local collocation types. We will also consider additional collocation types covering a wider range of syntactic relationships. In addition, we hope to incorporate class-based techniques, such as the modeling of verb-argument selectional preferences [Resnik, 1992], as a mechanism for achieving improved performance on unfamiliar collocations. 8. CONCLUSION This paper has examined some of the basic distributional properties of lexical ambiguity in the English language. Our experiments have shown that for several definitions of sense and collocation, an ambiguous word has only one sense in a given collocation with a probability of 90-99%. We showed how this claim is influenced by part-of-speech, distance, and sample frequency. We discussed the implications of these results for data set creation and algorithm design, identifying potential weaknesses in the common \"bag of words\" approach to disambiguation. Finally, we showed that models of local collocation can be combined in a disambiguation algorithm that achieves overall precision of 92%."]},{"title":"References","paragraphs":["1. Bahl, L., P.
