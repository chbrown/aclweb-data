The techniques were based on Bayesian decision theory, neural networks, and content vectors as used in information retrieval. To understand these methods better, we posed s very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts. To see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three- and slx-sense tasks are compared. The results demonstrate that each of the techniques is able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy greater than 70%. Furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another. Comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["The goal of this study is to systematically explore the effects of such variables as the number of senses per word and the number of training examples per sense on corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods. To enable us to study the effects of the number of word senses, we selected the highly polysemous noun line, which has 25 senses in WordNet. 1 Automatic sense resolution systems need to resolve highly polysemous words. As Zipf [2] pointed out in 1945, frequently occurring words tend to be polysemous. The words encountered in a given text will have far greater polysemy than one would assume by simply tak-ing the overall percentage of po]ysemous words in the language. Even though 86% of the nouns in WordNet have a single sense, the mean number of WordNet senses per word for the one hundred most frequently occurring nouns in the Brown Corpus is 5.15, with only eight words having a single sense.","1WordNet is a lexical database developed by George Miller and his colleagues at Princeton Urdversity.[l]"]},{"title":"2. PREVIOUS WORK","paragraphs":["Yarowsky [3] compared the Bayesian statistical method with the published results of other corpus-based statistical models. Although direct comparison was not possible due to the differences in corpora and evaluation criteria, he minimizes these differences by using the same words, with the same definition of sense. He argues, convincingly, that the Bayesian model is as good as or better than the costlier methods. As a pilot for the present study, a two-sense distinction task for line was run using the content vector and neural network classifiers, achieving greater than 90~ accuracy. A three-sense distinction task was then run, which is reported in Voorhees, st. al. [4], and discussed in Section 5."]},{"title":"3. METHODOLOGY","paragraphs":["The training and testing contexts were taken from the . 1987-89 Wall Street Journal corpus and from the APHB corpus. 2 Sentences containing '[L1]ine(s)' were extracted and manually assigned a single sense from WordNet. Sentences containing proper names such as 'Japan Air Lines' were removed from the set of sentences. Sentences containing collocations that have a single sense in WordNet, such as product line and line of products, were also excluded since the collocations are not ambiguous. Typically, experiments have used a fixed number of words or characters on either side of the target as the context. In this experiment, we used linguistic units - sentences - instead. Since the target word is often used anaphorically to refer back to the previous sentence, we chose to use two-sentence contexts: the sentence containing line and the preceding sentence. However, if the sentence containing line is the first sentence in the article, then the context consists of one sentence. If the preceding sentence also contains line in the same sense, then an additional preceding sentence is added to the context, creating contexts three or more sentences long.",":ZThe 25 million word corpus, obtained from the American Printing House for the Blind, is archlved at 1BM's T.J.

The next 149 contexts were selected as test contexts. The remaining contexts were not used in that trial. The 200 training contexts for each sense were combined to form a final training set (called the 200 training set) of size 1200. The final test set contained the 149 test contexts from each sense, for a total of 894 contexts. To test the effect that the number of training examples has on classifier performance, smaller training sets were extracted from the 200 training set. The first 50 and 100 contexts for each sense were used to build the new training sets. The same set of 894 test contexts were used with each of the training sets in a given trial. Each of the classifiers used the same training and test contexts within the same trial, but processed the text differently according to the needs of the method. 4. THE CLASSIFIERS The only information used by the three classifiers is cooccurrence of character strings in the contexts. They use no other cues, such as syntactic tags or word order. Nor do they require any augmentation of the training contexts that is not fully automatic. 4.1. A Bayesian Approach The Bayesian classifier, developed by Gale, Church and Yarowsky [5], uses Bayes' decision theory for weighting tokens that co-occur with each sense of a polysemous target. Their work is inspired by Mosteller and Wallace [6], who applied Bayes' theorem to the problem of author discrimination.

For the sense resolution problem, each sense is represented by a single vector constructed from the training contexts for that sense. A vector in the space defined by the training contexts is also constructed for each test context. To select a sense for a test context, the inner product between its vector and each of the sense vectors is computed, and the sense whose inner product is the largest is chosen. The components of the vectors are weighted to reflect the relative importance of the concepts in the text. The weighting method was designed to favor concepts that occur frequently in exactly one sense. The weight of a concept c is computed as follows:","Let n, : number of times c occurs in sense s p = n,/ ~senses n, d : difference between the two largest n,","(if difference is 0, d is set to 1) thenw, = p*min(n,,d) For example, if a concept occurs 6 times in the training contexts of sense 1, and zero times in the other five sets of contexts, then its weights in the six vectors are (6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). However, a concept that appears 10, 4, 7, 0, 1, and 2 times in the respective senses, has weights of (1.25, .5, .88, 0, .04, .17), reflecting the fact that it is not as good an indicator for any sense. This weighting method is the most effective among several variants that were tried. We also experimented with keeping all words in the content vectors, but performance degraded, probably because the weighting function does not handle very high frequency words well. This is evident in Table 1, where 'mr' is highly weighted for three different senses. 4.3. Neural Network The neural network approach [9] casts sense resolution as a supervised learning paradigm. Pairs of [input features, desired response] arc presented to a learning program. The program's task is to devise some method for using the input features to partition the training contexts into non-overlapping sets corresponding to the desired responses. This is achieved by adjusting link weights so that the output unit representing the desired response has a larger activation than any other output unit. 262 Each context is translated into a bit-vector. As with the content vector approach, suffixes are removed to conflate related word forms to a common stem, and"]},{"title":"stop-words","paragraphs":["and punctuation axe removed. Each concept that appears at least twice in the entire training set is assigned to a bit-vector position. The resulting vector has ones in positions corresponding to concepts in the context and zeros otherwise. This procedure creates vectors with more than 4000 positions. The vectors are, however, extremely sparse; on average they contain slightly more than 17 concepts. Networks are trained until the output of the unit corresponding to the desired response is greater than the output of any other unit for every training example. For testing, the classification determined by the network is given by the unit with the largest output. Weights in a neural network link vector may be either positive or negative, thereby allowing it to accumulate evidence both for and against a sense. The result of training a network until all examples axe classified correctly is that infrequent tokens can acquire disproportionate importance.

As a result, 'henderson' appears in Table 1, in spite of its infrequency in the training corpus. To determine a good topology for the network, various network topologies were explored: networks with from 0 to 100 hidden units arranged in a single hidden layer; networks with multiple layers of hidden units; and networks with a single layer of hidden units in which the output units were connected to both the hidden and input units. In all cases, the network configuration with no hidden units was either superior or statistically indistinguishable from the more complex networks. As no network topology was significantly better than one with no hidden units, all data reported here are derived from such networks."]},{"title":"5.

To test the hypothesis that the methods have different response patterns, we performed the X 2 test for correlated proportions. This test measures how consistently the methods treat individual test contexts by determin-ing whether the classifiers are making the same classification errors in each of the senses. For each sense, the test compares the off-diagonal elements of a matrix whose columns contain the responses of one classifier and the rows show a second classifier's responses in the same test set.

Although the addition of three new senses to the task caused consistent degradation, the degradation is relatively slight.

If statistical classifiers are to be part of higher-level NLP tasks, characteristics other than overall accuracy are important. Collecting training contexts is by far the most time-consuming part of the entire process. Until training-context acquisition is fully automated, classifiers requiring smaller training sets are preferred. Figure 1 shows that the content vector classifier has a flatter learning curve between 50 and 200 training contexts than the neural network and Bayesian classifiers, suggesting that the latter two require more (or larger) training contexts. Ease and efficiency of use is also a factor. The three classifiers are roughly comparable in this regard, although the neural network classifier is the most expensive to train. 264 80-0 70. c P.

CONCLUSION The convergence of the response patterns for the three methods suggests that each of the classifiers is extracting as much data as is available in word counts from training contexts. If this is the case, any technique that uses only word counts will not be significantly more accurate than the techniques tested here. Although the degree of polysemy does affect the difficulty of the sense resolution task, a greater factor of performance is the difficulty of resolving individual senses. Using hindsight, it is obvious that the tezt sense is hard for these statistical methods to learn because one can talk or write about anything. In effect, all words between a pair of quotation marks are noise (unless line is within the quotes). In the three-sense task, the Bayesian classifier did best on the tezt sense, perhaps because it had open and closed quotes as important tokens. This advantage was lost in the six-sense task because quotation marks also appear in the contexts of the phone sense. It is not immediately obvious why the formation sense should be hard. From inspection of the contexts, it appears that the crucial information is close to the word, and context that is more than a few words away is noise. These corpus-based statistical techniques use an impoverished representation of the training contexts: simple counts of tokens appearing within two sentences. We believe significant increases in resolution accuracy will not be possible unless other information, such as word order or syntactic information, is incorporated into the techniques. ment, and Slavs Katz of IBM's T.J.
