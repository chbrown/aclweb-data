Many systems have been built to do pattern matching on strings of words. One crucial innovation in the FASTUS system has been separating that process into the two steps of recognizing phrases and recognizing patterns. Phrases can be recognized reliably with purely syntactic information, and they provide precisely the elements that are required for stating the patterns of interest. The system is implemented in CommonLisp and rmls on both Sun and Symbolics machines."]},{"title":"AN EXAMPLE","paragraphs":["The task in the MUC-3 and MUC,-4 (Message Understanding Conference) evaluations of text processing systems was to scan news reports and extract intbrmation about terrorist incidents, in particular, who did what to whom.

Essentially the full complexity of English noun groups and wq'b groul.)S is accommodated. This phase of the processing gives very reliable results - better than 96% accuracy on the data we haxe examined. 3. Reeognlzing Patterns: In the exa.mlAe, two patterns are recognized in the sequence of phrases: <Perpetrator> <Killing> of <Hmnan'Fa.rget> and","<GovtOtficial> accused <PerpOrg> of <Incident> Two corresponding incident structures are constructed: Incident: KILLING Perpetrator: \"terrorist\" Confidence: Hurnan Ta.rget: \"Roberto (.-;aleia Alvarado\" and Incident: INCIDENT Perpetrator: FMLN Confidence: Suspected or Accused by","Authorities Human Target: -- Altogether for the MUC-4 application, about one hundred patterns were recognized. 4.

We believe that our success was due to two key ideas. The frst, as stated above, is the use of cascaded finite-state automata, dividing the task at the noun group and verb group level. The second is our approach to skipping over complements. One significant problem in pattern-matching approaches is linking up arguments with their predicates when they are distant in the sentence, for example, linking up the subject noun group with the main verb when the subject has a number of nominal complements. One technique that has been tried is to skip over up to some umnber of words, say, five, in looking for tile subject's verb. One trouble with this is that there are often more t.han five words in tim subject's nominal complement. Another trouble is that in a. sentence like","The police reported that terrorists bombed the Parliament today. this teclmique would find \"the police\" as the subject of \"bombed\". Our approach is to implement knowledge of the grammar of nominal complements directly into the finite-state pattern recognizer. The material between the end of the subject noun group and the beginning of the main verb group nmst be read over. There are patterns to accomplish this. Two of them are as follows:","Subject {Preposition NounGroup}* VerbGroup","Subject Relpro {NounGroup I Oi, her}* VerbGroup {NounGroup [Other}* VerbGroup Tlle first of these patterns reads over prepositional phrases. The second over relative clauses. The verb group at the end of these patterns takes the subject noun group as its subject. There is another pattern for capturing the COl)tent encoded in relative clauses:","Subject Relpro {NounGroup { Other}* VerbGroup Since tile finitie-state mechanisnl is nondeternlinistic, tile full colll, ent can be exl, ra.cted fl'om the selli,ellce 134","The n3a.yor, who was kidiral)ped yesterday, was foulid dead today. One branch discovers i.he iricident encoded in the rela.tive clause. Another branch marks t, ime through the relative clause arid then discovers the incident in the niain clause. \"Flies(, incidents are then merged. A similar device is used for\" conjoined verb phrases. The pattern","Subject VelbGroup {Nourr(~4roup I Other}* Conju uction Verb(Iroup allows i,lie n]achine to nondeternlinistically skip over the first, conjunct and associate the subject with the verb group in the second colrjunct. This is llow, in the ahove examph', we were able to recognize Cristia.ni a~s the one who was accusing the FMLN of the crime."]},{"title":"THE PERFORMANCE OF FASTUS","paragraphs":["On the MUC-4 evahlation in June 1992, FASTUS was among to top few systems, even tllough it had only been tinder (levelopnient for five nlonths.

The ela.pse(l real time was 1.5.9 minutes, hi nlore concrete terms, FASTUS can read 2,375 words per minute. It can analyze one text in an average of 9.6 seconds. This translates into 9,000 texts per day. This fast run time translates directly into fast development time. I~;%STUS became operationa.1 on May 6, 1992, aud we did a. run on a set of messages that we had not trained on, obtaining a score of 8% recall and 42% precision. At that point we began to train the system on 1300 development texts, adding patterns and doing periodic runs on the fair test to monitor our progress. This effort culminated three and a half weeks later on June 1 in a. score of 44% recall and 57% precision. (Recall is percent of the possible answers the system got correct; precision is percent of the system's answers that were correct.)"]},{"title":"'thus,","paragraphs":["in less than a lnonth, recall went up 3(J points and precision 15 points.

We expect this to speed up developrirerrt time for a new application by a factor of three or four. Moreover, whereas hefore riow only a systenl dew4oper could inlpleinent a new application, now virtrrally a.nyoue should I)e able to. In a specification interface tbr FASTUS, there needs to be convenient means for performing four tasks: 1. Defining ta.rget strtr('tlrres. 2. Defining word classes. 3. Defining sta.te l, ra.risitiorrs. 4. Defining nierge coirditioris. ViSe have dolle nothing yet irl the firsl, two areas, since e.veryone currently working with the syst(~nl is tltlent ill Lisp. Target structures are defined with defstruct, word classes with deDa.r. As we acquire users who are not programmers, it will be straighth)rward to inil)lenlent convenient means for these tasks. The Grasper-based graphical interface provides a convenient inemls for creating, exaulining, editing, and destroying nodes arid links in the graphs representing the finite-state automata. Each link is labelled with the to-kens that cause that transition to take place. Nodes have associated with them sequences of instructions that are executed when that node is reached. These instructions typically fill slots in the target strlrctures, and they ~can be conditionalized on what link the node was reached from, allowing greater economy in the finite-state machiries. In addition, the interface allows the graphs a,t each level to be modularized in whatever fashion the user desires, so that at any given tin]e, the user can focus on only a small portion of the total graph. There are also convenient means for saving and compiling the graphs afl.er changes have been made. Perhaps the hardest problem in the inforn]ation extra.ction task is defiifing when two target structures can be merged. This is, after a.ll, the coreference l)rol)h'nr in dis- ('Oilr'SO, well-knowrl to I)e \"al-eomlilete\". W'e have develol)ed a kiird of a.lgebra on l,he l,a.rgel, sl, ructures. 'Hie rrser 135 can define abstract data types, inchiding ntlniber rallges, date ranges, locations, and strings. Comparison opera.- lions can then be defined for each of these data. l.ypes, returning vahies of Equal, Snbstnnes, Inconsistent, and hlcorupa.rable. (]onlbina.tion operations ca.n also be defined. For exainple, the cornbination of two uunil)er or date ranges is the nlore restrictive range. For striligs, the conll)ination depends on the semantic categories of the heads of the strings. If one is more specific than the other, the more sl)ecific term is the resu It. of the combhmt,ion. There are t.hree types of actions that be l)erformed after doing a comparison. The items can be merged or c.ombined. If they are incomparable and if the slot. in t.he target struct,ure admits eonlpound entries, die two call simply be added together. Or the unification of the l.wo items can be rqjected. This algebra of target structures gives us a very clean treatment of what in the MUC-4 systenl was often very ad hoe. FASTUS has been restrtictured somewhat a.s well since MUC-4. A Tokenizer Phase has been added, its in-put consists of ascii characters and it output is tokens, usually words, numerals, and punctuation lnarks. This phase gives the user control over the lowest level of input,, so that special rules can be encoded for abbreviations, numbers with radix other than 10, and other such phenOlllena. The illOSt conlnlon tokenizations are, of course, ah'eady iniplenmnted. A Preprocessor Phase has also been added. This incof pora.tes t,he nmltiword handling that. was done in t.he Phrase R.ecognition phase of the first, version of FASTUS. It also allows the user to customize automata lot dealing, for example, with names that have a different given-name falnily-nanae order and with names of nonhuman entities that have internal structure significant to /.he donm.in, such a.s company names. The treatment of appositives, conjunct,ions, and \"oF' prepositional phrases was originally done in the Pattern Recognition phase.
