We show how to model at least a part of the information contained in a bilingual dictionary so that we can treat a bilingual dictionary and a bilingual corpus as two facets of a unified collection of data from which to extract values for the parameters of a probabilistic machine translation system. We give an algorithm for obtaining maximum iikefihood estimates of the parameters of a probabilistic model from this combined data and we show how these parameters are affected by inclusion of the dictionary for some sample words.","There is a sharp dichotomy today between rationalist and empiricist approaches to machine translation: rationalist systems are based on information cajoled fact by reluctant fact from the minds of human experts; empiricist systems are based on information gathered wholesale from data. The data most readily digested by our translation system is from bilingual corpora, but bilingual dictiona.ries are data too, and in this paper we show how to weave information from them into the fabric of our statistical model of the translation process.","When a lexicographer creates an entry in a bilingum dictionary, he describes in one language the meaning and use of a word from another language.

We imagine that a lexicographer, when constructing an entry for the English word or phrase e, first chooses a random size s, and then selects at random a sample of s instances of the use of e, each with its French translation.

We extend the method of Brown et al. to develop a scheme for estimating O so as to maximize the joint probability of the corpus and the dictionary, Pro(//,D). We assume that Pro(//, D) = Pro(//)Pro(D). In general, it is possible only to find local maxima of Pro(//,D) as a function of O, which we can do-by applying the EM algorithm [3, 4]. The EM algorithm adjusts an initial estimate of O in a series of iterations. Each iteration consists of an estimation step in which a count is determined for each parameter, followed by a maximization step in which each parameter is replaced by a value proportional to its count. The count ce for a parameter 0 is defined by co = a~0 log Pro(//, D).

In terms of the a priori multiplicity, p0(e,f) = A(e)p(fle), it is given by","#0(e,f) /s(e,f) - 1 - e-~0(e,f)\" (17) Figure I shows the effective multiplicity as a function of the a priori multiplicity. For small values of lL0(e,f), /s(e,f) is approximately equal to 1 + #o(e, f)/2. For very large values, #0(e, f) and p(e, f) are approximately equal. Thus, if we expect a priori .that the lexicographer will see the translation (e,f) very many times, lhen the effective multiplicity will be nearly equal to this number, but even if we expect a priori that he will scarcely ever see a translation, the effective multiplicity for it cannot fall below 1. This is reasonable because in our model for the dictionary construction process, we assume that nothing can get into the dictionary unless it is seen at least once by the lexicographer.
