Essentials of document retrieval Document retrieval (DR) is for the user who wants to find out about something by reading about it. DR systems illustrate every variety of indexing language, request and document description, and search mechanism. Controlled languages (CLs) have been commonly used, across the range from only slightly restricted natural language (NL) to a carefully designed artificial language. With CLs professional indexing is required and professional searching is the norm. However automatic DR systems have also encouraged the use of NL through searching on titles and abstracts. This naturally makes end-user searching practicable, though not necessarily easy; and end-users often lack the experience to search effectively when strict word matching fails to identify appropriate documents. The essential requirement in retrieval is that a match between request and document descriptions should reflect the underlying relation between user need and document content. Indexing, providing for matches, thus aims to promote precision and/or recall. It often has to do this under the external constraints of large files with small relevance sets. It always has to do it under the internal constraints on indexing itself. These are, for both requests and documents,"]},{"title":"variability","paragraphs":["of language, whether this stems from ambiguity or differences of perspective; for requests,"]},{"title":"underspecification,","paragraphs":["whether through vagueness or incompleteness; and for documents, information"]},{"title":"reduction,","paragraphs":["whether through generalisation or selection. Reduction is essential for DR, for both efficiency in scanning and effectiveness in concentrating on key content. The implications of these constraints for index language design and use are conflicting, and suggest many alternative possibilities within the CL/NL space for the treat-ment of terms and term relations, of implicit and explicit relations, and of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations. Mixes and tradeoffs are possible, and the necessary flexibility is achieved, because descriptions are manipulated in searching. However though the conventional preference is for CLs, extensive tests have shown that very competitive performance can be obtained through cheap and simple indexing using coordinated single NL terms along with statistical selection and weighting, ranked output, and relevance feedback.

The findings have been supported by many tests investigating different DR system factors, and the approach has been implemented commercially. But the test evidence is not always strong, and the tests have been on a limited scale; further, the strategy depends on request quality and probably also on working with document surrogates, like abstracts, which concentrate information. Even so, the puzzle is that linguistic sophistication, even with human LP, does not provide clear performance gains, and routine performance typically falls within an undistinguished 30-60% R-P tradeoff area."]},{"title":"2.","paragraphs":["Text retrieval However a new situation has arisen with the availability of machine-readable full text. For text retrieval (TR), NLP to provide more sophisticated indexing may be needed because more discrimination within large files of long texts is required, or may be desired because more focusing is possible. This suggests the more NLP the better, but whether for better-motivated simple indexing or for more complex representation has to be determined. Given past experience, and the need for flexibility in the face of uncertainty, a sound approach appears to be to maintain overall simplicity but to allow for more complex indexing descriptors than single terms, derived through NLP and NL-flavoured, e.g. simple phrases or predications. These would be just coordinated for descriptions but, more importantly, statistically selected and weighted. To obtain the reduced descriptions still needed to emphasise important text content, text-locational or statistical information could be exploited. To support indexing, and, more critically, searching a terminological apparatus again of a simple NL-oriented kind providing term substitutes or collocates, and again statistically controlled, could be valuable. Searching should allow 347 the substitution or relaxation of elements and relations in complex terms, again with weighting, especially via feedback. This whole approach would emphasise the NL of the texts while recognising the statistical properties of large files and long documents. The crux is thus to demonstrate that linguistically-constrained terms are superior to e.g. co-locational ones. Heavy testing is needed to establish performance for the suggested approach, given the many factors affecting retrieval systems, both environment variables e.g. document type, subject domain, user category, and system parameters e.g. description exhaustivity, language specificity, weighting formula. There are also different evaluation criteria, performance measures, and application methods to consider. Proper testing is hard (and costly) since it requires large collections, of requests as much as documents, with relevance assessments, and implies finegrained comparisons within a grid of system contexts and design options. Various approaches along the lines suggested, as well as simpler DR-derived ones, are being investigated within ARPA TREC. The TREC experiments are important as the largest retrieval tests to date, with an earnest evaluation design, as well as being TR tests on the grand scale. But any conclusions drawn from them must be treated with caution since the TREC queries are highly honed, and are for standing interests (matching a document against many requests not vice versa), with tightly specified response needs. TREC is not typical of many retrieval situations, notably the 'wants to read about' one, so any results obtained, especially good ones relying on collection tailoring, may not be generally applicable and other tests are mandatory. 3.
