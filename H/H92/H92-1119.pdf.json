Our goal is to develop fast speech recognition algorithms and supporting hardware capable of recognizing continuous speech from a bigram or trigram based 10,000 word vocabulary or a 1,000 to 5,000 word SLS system. RECENT RESULTS The special-purpose system achieves its high computation rate by using special-purpose memories and data paths, and is made up of the following several components:","• A special-purpose HMM-board with eight newly designed integrated circuits that does the HMM inner-loop processing to implement the word-recognition algorithms.","• An output-distribution board made of off-the-shelf components for computing HMM discrete-density state-output probabilities.","• A multi-processor TMS32030 board for computing the statistical language processing. This board has a custom high-speed interface to the HMM-board.","• A general-purpose CPU board to perform system control.","• A DSP board with A/D convertor for computing the feature extraction.","• A Sun workstation for computing the spoken language system database retrieval and human machine interface. SRI and U.C. Berkeley's recent accomplishments on this project include:","• Completed the construction of a working hardware prototype. This prototype has been demonstrated running the Resource Management (RM) task as well as the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) task.","• Began intensive use of the hardware for a real-time Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) task.","• Completed the design and construction of a second generation multiprocessor TMS32030 grammar processing board. Testing is currently in progress.","• Revised and corrected errors in several of the custom VLSI chips that are used for the HMM word-recognition processor. PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR","• Complete the construction and testing of the second generation multiple-processor TMS32030 board with a high I/O bandwidth to interface with the special-purpose HMM-board.","• Implement multiple types of grammars using this hardware.","• Collect data about man-machine speech interactions using the real-time hardware.","• Integrate the real-time recognizer into our research to shorten the development cycle for new systems","• Evaluate the current architecture to determine the computational and algorithmic bottlenecks. • Deliver a hardware prototype to DARPA. 486"]}]}
