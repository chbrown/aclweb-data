These include context-dependent phonetic modelling, the use of a bigram language model in conjunction with a probabilistic LR parser, and refinements made to the lexicon. Together with the use of a larger training set, these modifications combined to reduce the speech recognition word and sentence error rates by a factor of 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, on the October '91 test set. The weighted error for the entire spoken language system on the same test set is 49.3%. Similar results were also obtained on the February '92 benchmark evaluation."]},{"title":"INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["This paper presents an update on the MIT ATIS system, which has been under development since 1990. We will describe several changes made to our system since the last official common evaluation in February, 1991 [8], with particular emphasis on the speech recognition component.. We will also present our evaluation results for the October '91 \"dry-run\" test set and the February '92 test set. We have also modified our natural language component to include a robust parsing strategy. This change is described in detail in a companion paper [9]."]},{"title":"SPEECH RECOGNITION","paragraphs":["In this section we will describe the changes we have made over the past year to the speech recognition component (SUMMIT) of our ATIS system. These include improvements to both the phonetic and language models, and refinements on the lexicon. We have also implemented the acoustic models on a set of DSP boards to allow near real-time evaluation and demonstration.","The baseline SUMMIT system uses a mixture of up to 16 diagonal Gaussian models for each lexical unit. In recent months, we have been able to simplify the input representation of the models significantly with no loss in performance. The current representation consists of 39 1This research was supported by i)ARPA under Contract","N00014-89-J-1332, monitored through the Office of Naval Research.","84 segmental measurements for each hypothesized segment.

At the moment, spontaneous disfluencies are represented by one model, and are required to be one segment long."]},{"title":"Training and Testing Corpora","paragraphs":["The multi-site ATIS data collection effort has resulted in a significant increase in the amount of speech data available to the community [6]. For speech recognition system development, we started with all the MADCOW data released by NIST, and augmented them with ATIS data collected earlier at MIT. Some 9,711 utterances in this pool were designated as training material, and an additional 1,595 utterances were set aside as a development set for independent evaluation.","To facilitate a meaningful comparison, all the experiments described in this section are performed on the October '91 \"dry-run\" test set, containing some 362 utterances collected at BBN, CMU, MIT, and SRI. The experiments that we conducted are summarized in Table 1, and will be described in this section.","In order to monitor progress internally, we also ran the same test set through our system as reported a year ago [8]. Our February '91 system had a vocabulary of 577 words. That system constrained the N-best search with the use of a word-pair grammar with a perplexity of 92. The N-best outputs were subsequently resorted using our natural language component TINA. It was trained on some 2400 utterances collected at TI and MIT. The recognition performance of that system on the October '91 \"dry-run\" test set, with and without the word-pair language model, is shown in the first two rows of Table 1 (labelled as AW and WP, respectively)."]},{"title":"Lexicon","paragraphs":["With the availability of a larger amount of training data we enlarged our vocabulary to contain 841 words. This was done by examining word frequency counts in the training data and adding all reasonable words that occurred more than once. Examples of words that were not added included misspellings or people's names.","Other improvements to the lexicon included refinement of the pronunciation baseforms and the phonological rules used to generate the pronunciation networks. In part, this involved improving pre-existing rules such as the flapping rule. We also introduced a number of specific allophones for certain phonemes in certain contexts, such as a retroflexed /f/ or a stop closure following a fricative, and a number of new diphone units, allowing a sequence of two phonemes to be treated as a diphthong, such as/el/or/at/. The inventory of phonetic units in the expanded lexicon contained 115 distinct labels.","As shown in the third row of Table 1 (labelled as AW, Small Training), these changes combined to reduce the word error rate from 62.5% to 55.4% for the system a year ago using an all-word language model. The next row in the same figure (labelled as AW, Full Training) shows that the word error rate is further reduced to 51% by using the full training set described earlier 2.

Instead, a subset of about 7,500 utterances were used. 85 perplexity had a broad minimum when K was around 20. On our development data set this smoothed bigram had a perplexity of 20.1. The perplexity measures did not include out of vocabulary words since our recognition system does not currently have the capability of detecting these words.

In order to apply this model to speech recognition (i.e., optimizing word accuracy), the parse table was extended to \"accept\" all word strings. This was accomplished by adding explicit error states to the parse table, and computing recovery actions to allow normal parsing to resume in an appropriate state after an error 3. Other extensions to the model described previously [3] include various mechanisms for smoothing the probabilities by changing the conditioning state.","The ATIS gramrnar contains 971 rules, the vast majority of which introduce lexical items, and the resulting parse table contains about 1600 states. The lexicon of the parser is the same as that used by the recognizer. The probabilities were trained on all 9,711 utterances in the training set. The perplexity measured on the October '91 test set was 17.6.","Row 6 of Table 1 (labelled as BG+PLR) shows that further reduction in error rate is possible by incorporating the PLR. PLR is incorporated by using the parse score in place of the bigram score to reorder the 50 N-best outputs produced by the recognizer. The sentence error rate is reduced more than the word error rate, presumably due to the fact that PLR can deal with some of the long distance constraints better than the bigram.

In an initial experiment, regression tree analysis was used to form a set of context-specific models for each phonetic unit. However, we found that we were able to obtain the best performance by using the regression trees to independently learn a context-normalization factor for each of the input dimensions of the model. The model for each phonetic unit is then trained using these context-normalized in-puts for all of the training samples in that class.","We have extended this work by considering more contextual effects, including phonetic labels two phones away and whether or not the current segment is in a syllable before a pause or at a sentence boundary. The new effects were simply added to the list of questions that could be asked at each node in the tree splitting algorithm.","When we applied this context-normalization to the ATIS domain, we found that the word error rate dropped from 24.1% to 20.6%, as shown in rows 5 and 7 in Table 1) (labelled as BG and BG+CD, respectively). This represents a 15% reduction in error rate. In the Resource Management domain, we found a decrease in word error rate from 10.3% to 7%, or 32% [5]. We believe that we are achieving a smaller reduction in error rate in the ATIS domain because a greater number of errors can be attributed to problems other than phonetic modelling (e.g., out-of-vocabulary words, mismatch of language model, spontaneous speech effects, etc.). In fact, if we look at the performance of the phonetic models in terms of their ability to match the \"forced-recognition\" phonetic string (the string obtained during recognition allowing only the correct word string), we see a much larger reduction in error rate in the ATIS domain (37.5%) than in the Resource Management domain (18.8%).

The complete system, using an IBM RS6000 for lexical access and a Sun SPARCstation-II for the rest of the processing, now runs in 2-3 times real-time.","In the coming months, we plan to conduct research in several directions that will hopefully lead to further im-Provement in system performance.
