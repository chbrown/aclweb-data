MOTIVATIONS","paragraphs":["Although stochastic techniques applied to syntax modeling have recently regained popularity, current language models suffer from obvious inherent inadequacies. Early proposals such as Markov Models, N-gram models [1, 2, 3] and Hidden Markov Models were very quickly shown to be linguistically not appropriate for natural language (e.g. [4]) since they are unable to capture long distance dependencies or to describe hierarchically the syntax of natural languages. Stochastic context-free grammar [5] is a hierarchical model more appropriate for natural languages, however none of such proposals [6, 7] perform as well as the simpler Markov Models because of the difficulty of capturing lexical information. The parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar do not correspond directly to a distribution over words since distributional phenomena over words that are embodied by the application of more than one context-free rule cannot be captured under the context-freeness assumption. This leads to the difficulty of maintaining a standard hierarchical model while capturing lexical dependencies. This fact prompted researchers in natural language processing to give up hierarchical language models in the favor of non-hierarchical statistical models over words (such as word N-grams models). Probably for lack of a better language model, it has also been argued that the phenomena that such devices cannot capture occur relatively infrequently.","*This work was partially supported by DARPA Grant N0014-90-31863, ARO Grant DAAL03-89-C-0031 and NSF Grant IRI90-16592.

We are also grateful to Peter Braun, Fred 3elinek, Mark Liberman, Mitch Marcus, Robert Mercer, Fernando Pereira and Stuart Shieber for providing valuable comments. Such argumentation is linguistically not sound. Lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (LTAG) 1 combine hierarchical structures while being lexically sensitive and are therefore more appropriate for statistical analysis of language. In fact, LTAGs are the simplest hierarchical formalism which can serve as the basis for lexicalizing context-free grammar [10, 11].

This kind of statistical analysis as independently suggested in [12] can be made with LTAGs because of their extended domain of locality but also because of their lexicalized property. In this paper, this intuition is made formally precise by defining the notion of a stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (SLTAG). We present an algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG, and finally we introduce an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of text. This algorithm can either be used for refining the parame-","1 We assume familiarity throughout the paper with TAGs and its lexicalized variant. See, for instance, [S], [9], [10] or [111. 140 ters of a SLTAG or for inferring a tree-adjoining grammar from a training corpus. Due to the lack of space, in this paper the algorithms are described succinctly without proofs of correctness and more attention is given to the concepts and techniques used for SLTAG. 2. SLTAG Informally speaking, SLTAGs are defined by assigning a probability to the event that an elementary tree is combined (by adjunction or substitution) on a specific node of another elementary tree. These events of combination are the stochastic processes considered. For sake of mathematical precision and elegance, we use a stochastic linear rewriting system, stochastic linear indexed grammars (SLIG), as a notation for SLTAGs. A linear indexed grammar is constructed following the method given in [13]. However, in addition, each rule is associated with a probability. Linear Indexed grammar (LIG) [14, 15] is a rewriting system in which the non-terminal symbols are augmented with a stack. In addition to rewriting non-terminals, the rules of the grammar can have the effect of pushing or popping symbols on top of the stacks that are associated with each non-terminal symbol. A specific rule is triggered by the non-terminal on the left hand side of the rule and the top element of its associated stack. LIGs [15] restrict The productions of a LIG are restricted to copy the stack corresponding to the non-terminal being rewritten to at most one stack associated with a non-terminal symbol on the right hand side of the production. 2 In the following, [..p] refers to a possibly unbounded stack whose top element is p and whose remaining part is schematically written as '..'. [$] represents a stack whose only element is the bottom of the stack. While it is possible to define SLIGs in general, we define them for the particular case where the rules are binary branching and where the left hand sides are always incomparable."]},{"title":"A stochastic linear indexed grammar, G,","paragraphs":["is denoted by"]},{"title":"(VN, VT, Vt, S, Prod),","paragraphs":["where"]},{"title":"VN","paragraphs":["is a finite set of non-terminal symbols; VT is a finite set of terminal symbols; Vi is a finite set of stack symbols;"]},{"title":"S E VN","paragraphs":["is the start symbol;"]},{"title":"Prod","paragraphs":["is a finite set of productions of the form:"]},{"title":"x0[$p0] a Xo[..po] Xl[..pd x0[..p0] xl[$pl] z0[$p0] Xl[$pl] x2[$p2]","paragraphs":["where"]},{"title":"Xk E VN, a G VT","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"Po E Vi, Pl,P2 G V~;","paragraphs":["2 LIGs have been shown to be weakly equivalent to Tree-Adjoining Grammars [16].

CONCLUSION","paragraphs":["A novel statistical language model and fundamental algorithms for this model have been presented. SLTAGs provide a stochastic model both hierarchical and sensitive to lexical information. They combine the advantages of purely lexical models such as N-gram distributions or Hidden Markov Models and the one of hierarchical modes as stochastic context-free grammars without their inherent limitations. The parameters of a SLTAG correspond to the probability of combining two structures each one associated with a word and therefore capture linguistically relevant distributions over words. An algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG was presented as well as an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of raw text. Similarly to its context-free counterpart, the reestimation algorithm can be extended to handle partially parsed corpora [20]. The worst case complexity of the algorithm with respect to the length of the input string (O(N6)) makes it impractical with a large corpus on a single processor computer for grammars requiring the worst case complexity. However, this complexity reduces to O(N 3) or to O(N 2) for interesting subsets of SLTAGs. If time permits, experiments in this direction will be reported 144 at the time of the meeting. Furthermore, the techniques explained in this paper apply to other grammatical formalisms such as combinatory categorial grammars and modified head grammars since they have been proven to be equivalent to tree-adjoining grammars and linear indexed grammars [21]. In collaboration with Aravind Joshi, Fernando Pereira and Stuart Shieber, we are currently investigating additional algorithms and applications for SLTAG, methods for lexical clustering and automatic construction of a SLTAG from a large training corpus."]},{"title":"REFERENCES","paragraphs":["1.
