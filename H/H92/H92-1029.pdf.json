THE PROBLEM WITH PARSERS","paragraphs":["A parser is a device that provides a description of the syntactic phrases that make up a sentence. For a speech understanding task such as ATIS, the parser has two roles. First, it should provide a description of the phrases in a sentence so these phrases can be interpreted by a subsequent semantic processor. The second function is to provide a language model - a model of the likelihood of a sentence - to constrain the speech recognition task. It is unfortunately the case that existing parsers developed for text fulfill neither of these roles very well. It is useful to begin by reviewing some of the reasons for this failure. We can describe the situation in terms of three general problems that parsers face: the Lexicality Problem, the Tail Problem, and the Interpolation Problem."]},{"title":"The Lexicality Problem","paragraphs":["The most familiar way to think of a parser is as a device that provides a description of a sentence given some grammar. Consider for example a context free grammar, where nonterminal categories are rewritten as terminals or nonterminals, and terminals are rewritten as words. There typically is no way to express the constraints among individual words. Yet it is clear that much of our knowledge of language has to do with what words go together.[2] Merely knowing the grammatical rules of the language is not enough to predict which words can go together. So for example, general English grammatical rules admit premodification of a noun by another noun or by an adjective. It is possible to describe broad semantic constraints on such modification; so for example,"]},{"title":"early morning","paragraphs":["is a case of a time-adjective modifying a time-period, and"]},{"title":"morning flight","paragraphs":["is a time-period modifying an event.

This dependency of syntactic combinability on particular lexicM items is repeated across the grammar and lexicon. The lexicality problem has two aspects.

This is of course the typical problem in language modeling, and it raises the problem of estimating the probabilities of structures that have not been seen - the Interpolation Problem. The rules of the grammar must be extendible to new constructions. In this parser the approach is through analogy, or memory-based reasoning.[8] 150"]},{"title":"_flight(s)","paragraphs":["morning 143 afternoon 146 evening 51 night 27 easy_ N 33 597 25 504 12 215 0 121 Table 1: Pre- and post- modifiers for time nominals in a 266k word ATIS sample. 2. THE PARSER The basic parser data structure is a pointer to a node, the parser's focus of attention. The basic operation is to combine the focus of attention with either the preceding or following element to create a new node, updating preceding and following pointers and updating the focus of attention and then repeat. If no combination is possible, the focus is moved forward, and thus parsing proceeds from the beginning of the sentence to the end. Some consequences of this model: no non-contiguous dependencies are picked up by this stage of the parser. The idea is that the parser is a reactive component. Its output is not the complete analysis of a sentence, but rather consists of a set of fragments that subsequent processing will glue together. (cf. [1, 3, 4]). 2.1. The Grammar Trees in the grammar are either terminal or non-terminal. Terminal trees are a pair of a syntactic feature specification and a word. Non-terminals are a pair of trees, with a specification of which tree is head - thus, this is a binary dependency grammar. t ~ terminal I (1 t t) I (2 t t) terminal ~ (features word) The category of a non-terminal is the category of its head. The grammar for the parser is expressed as a set of trees that have lexically specified terminals, each with a frequency count. For example, in the ATIS grammar, the tree corresponding to the phrase book a flight is (1 (V \"book\") (2 (XI \"a\")(N \"flight\"))) It occurs 6 times. The grammar consists of a large set of such partial trees, which encode both the grammatical and the lexical constraints of the language. Following are examples of two trees that might be in the grammar for the parser.","(V 1","(V 1 (V 0 aIVZ) (XPII_O 0 NE))","(N 1 (N 2","(Xl o A)","(N 0 LIST)) (P 1","(P o OF)","(N2 2","(XQ 0 ALL)","(N2 0 AIRFARES)))))","(P 1 (P 0 FOR) (~2 2","(N 0 ROUND-TRIP)","(N2 0 TICKETS))) 2.2. Parsing The basic parser operation is to combine subtrees by matching existing trees in the grammar. Consider, for example, parsing the fragment give me a list. Initially, the parser focuses on the first word in the sentence, and tries to combine it with preceding and following nodes. Since give exists in the grammar as head of a tree with me as second element, the match is straightforward, and the node give me is built, directly copying the grammar. Nothing in the grammar leads to combining give me and a, so the parser attention moves forward, and a list is built, again, directly from the grammar. At this point, the parser will is looking at the fragments give me (with head give) and a list (with head list), and is faced again with the question: can these pieces be combined. Here the answer is not so obvious. 2.3. Smoothing by analogy. If we could guarantee that all trees that the parser must construct will exist in its grammar of trees, then the parsing procedure would be as described in the preceding section. Of course, we don't predict in advance all trees the parser might see. Rather, the parser has a grammar representing a subset of the trees it might see along with a measure of similarity between trees. When the parser finds no exact way to combine two nodes to match a tree that exists in the grammar, it looks for similar trees that combine. In particular, it looks at each of the two potential combined nodes in turn and tries to find a similar tree that does combine with the observed tree. So in our example, although give me a list does not occur, 151 give me occurs with a number of similar trees, including: a list of ground transportation a list of the cities serve a list of flights from philadelphia a list of all the flights a list of all flights a list of all aircraft type One of these trees is selected to be the analog of a list, thus allowing give me to be combined as head with a list. The parser uses a heuristically defined measure of similarity that depends on: category, root, type , specifier, and distribution. Obviously, much depends on the similarity metric used. The aim here is to combine our knowledge of language, to determine what in general contributes to the similarity of words, with patterns trained from the text. The details of the current similarity metric are largely arbitrary, and ways of training it are being investigated. Notice that this approach finds the closest exemplar, not average of behavior. (cf. [7, 81) 2.4. Disambiguation For words which are ambiguous among more than one possible terminal (e.g. to can be a preposition or an infinitival marker), the parser must assign a terminal tree. In this parser, the disambiguation process is part of the parsing process. That is, when the parser is focusing on the word to it selects the tree which best combines to with a neighboring node. If that tree has to as, for example, head of a prepositional phrase, then to is a preposition, and similarly if to is an infinitival marker. Of course, if a word is not attached to any other constituent in the course of parsing, this method will not apply. Disambiguation is still necessary, to allow subsequent processing. In such cases, the parser reverts to its bigram model to make the best guess about the proper tree for a word. 3. DEVELOPING A GRAMMAR Developing a grammar for this parser means collecting a set of trees. There are 4 distinct sources of grammar trees. General English. The base set of trees for the parser is a set of general trees for the language as a whole, independent of the domain. These include standard sentence patterns as well as trees for the regular expressions of time, place, quantity, etc. For the current parser, these trees were written by hand (though in this set will over time be developed partly by hand and partly from text). This set of trees is independent of the domain, and available for any application. It forms part of a general model for English. The remaining three parts of the tree database are all specific to the particular restricted domain. Domain Database Specific. Trees specific to the subdomain, derived semi-automatically from the underlying database. Included are airline names, flight names and codes, aircraft names, etc. This can also include a set of typical sentences for the domain. In a sense, this set of trees provides information about the content of the messages in the domain, the things one is likely to talk about. Parsed Training Sentences. hand parsed text from the training sentences. These trees are fairly easy to produce through an incremental process of: a) parse a set of sentences, b) hand correct them, c) remake the parser, and d) repeat. About a thousand words an hour can be analyzed this way. (Thus for the ATIS task, it is easy to hand parse the entire training set, though this was not done for the experiment reported here.) Unsupervised Parsed Text. also from the training sentences, but parsed by the existing parser and left uncorrected. (Note: given an existing database of parsed sentences, these could transformed into trees for the parser grammar.) Obviously, one aim of this design is to make acquisi-tion of the grammar easy. Indeed, the parser design is not English-specific, and in fact a Spanish version of the parser (under an earlier but related design) is currently being updated. 4. THE ATIS EXPERIMENT For The ATIS task, a vocabulary was defined consisting of 1842 distinct terminal symbols (a superset of the February 91 vocabulary, enhanced by adding words to regularize the grammar, and by distinguishing words with features; e.g. \"travel\" as a verb is a different terminal from \"travel\" as a noun). A grammar was derived, based on 1) a relatively small general English model in-cluding trees for general sentence structure as well as trees for dates, times, numbers, money, and cities, and 2) an ATIS specific set of trees covering types of objects in the database (aircraft, airports, airlines, flight info, ground transportation) and 3) sentences in the training set. In this experiment, approximately 10% of the grammar are language general, 10~ are database specific, 50% are supervised parsed trees and 30~ are unsupervised. 152 The weighting of the various sources of grammar trees has not arisen here - all trees are weighted equally. But in the general case, where there is a pre-existing large general grammar, and a large corpus for unsupervised training, the weighting of grammar trees will become an issue. Given this grammar consisting of 14,000 trees, derived as described above, the grammar perplexity is 15.9 on the 138 February 91 test sentences. This compares to a perplexity of 18.9 for the bigram model (where bigrams are terminals). The grammar trees derived from the unsupervised parsing of the training sentences improve the model slightly (from 16.4 to 15.9 perplexity)."]},{"title":"5.

FURTHER WORK","paragraphs":["While current results for this parsing model look promis-ing, there are several directions of further exploration. Integration in Speech Recognition. There are two obvious ways of incorporating this parser into the speech recognition task. First, it can be used to select among a set of candidate sentences proposed by a recognizer. The second, more interesting, approach is to embed the parser in the recognition process. Given the parser's localization of information and its deterministic beginning-to-end processing, it can naturally be used to find a locally (where the domain of locality is adjacent trees) optimal path through an (appropriately sparse) lattice. Development of Further Processing. This parser rests on the assumption, shared in a variety of recent work from quite different perspectives [1, 3, 4], that a level of underspeeified syntactic description is efficiently obtainable and is useful. The current work supports a particular view of what partial syntactic descriptions are obtainable. It remains to show that the further processing components can be constructed to make these pieces useful. Implementation Details. A number of decisions in the implementation of the current parser are arbitrary, and further development demands exploring the optimal design. For example, we need to explore what the similarity function should look like, and what function should be used for comparing potential attachments."]},{"title":"7. REFERENCES","paragraphs":["1.
