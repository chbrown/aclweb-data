Though the description of each individual structural change is not difficult, special provision must be made when they are combined, because interaction between them sometimes causes unexpected problems. Transfer of coordinate structures is also discussed as this often necessitates a structural change and interacts with other structural changes in a problematic way.","1. Introduction Several focal issues have emerged in machine translation (MT) research as the result of recent intensive studies in the field. That is,","• Declarative Frameworks for expressing Bi-lingual Knowledge","• Integration of Knowledge-based Processing and Contextual Processing with the Translation Process","• Effective Exploitation of Domain/Text Type Specificity (or Sublanguageness) in MT and Discovery Processes for such Specificities Though new frameworks of MT such as Statistics-based MT (SBMT), Example-based MT (EBMT), Analogy-based MT (ABMT), Knowledge-based MT (KBMT) etc. look radically different from conventional linguistic-based MT (LBMT) such as Transfer-based, they address one or two of the above focal issues and ignore the rest [7] [9]. In particular, the new paradigms of MT tend to ignore the first issue ie. declarative representation of bi-lingual knowledge and the complexities involved n the process of combining units of bi-lingual knowledge. It is our contention that any MT system, whichever paradigm it belongs to, has to store a set of translation-equivalent units for a pair of languages and combine these to produce larger units of translation. In EBMT, for example, a set of translation examples has to be stored and several of them have to be combined properly to produce translation. Because of the declarative nature of translation examples, EBMT inevitably encounters the same complexities of combining translation units in declarative representation as LBMT does. Research in LBMT [1] [2] [31 [10] [12] has revealed that difficulties in the declarative representation of bi-lingual knowledge stem mainly from the treatment of idiosyncratic structural changes caused by lexical items, and in-teractions of such idiosyncratic structural changes when they co-exist in single sentences. These types of structural changes also cause problems when they are combined with general or ordinary linguistic phenomena such as coordination. A formal framework to cope with these matters is essential in other approaches, such as EBMT, as in LBMT, if the translation is produced in a compositional way. In this paper, we discuss problems caused by such interaction, and give solutions in our logic-based transfer framework [8]. Our transfer model views the transfer process as deduction; it produces the target linguistic description without changing the source description. This gives a clear contrast to the conventional tree-transducer model, which gradually transforms the source description, and is therefore hard to control. Because of the logic oriented nature of out framework, it can also be extended to cope with the other focal issue of MT such as the integration of knowledge-based processing with translation[4]. 2. Formalism We use a simple formalism, representing a sentence as a network of semantic dependencies. The basic units of the formalism are"]},{"title":"indices, properties,","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"relations. A","paragraphs":["logical form consists of an unordered set of"]},{"title":"terms;","paragraphs":["each term is either a property predicated of an index, or a relation between two indices. The written notation depicts properties and relations as unary and binary functors, respectively, and indices as their arguments, i.e. within brackets. A logical form representing 'John saw Mary' might be e : john(j) ~5 see(e) ~ mary(m) & tense(e,past) & 255 subj(e,j) & obj(e,m) This representation is simplified particularly in that the relation tense here stands for what should be a complex representation of tense, aspect, and aktionsart, re-lated anaphorically to the preceding discourse. It can be seen that the representation includes the names of the concepts, both objects and events, which are mentioned in the sentence, and the semantic relationships between them. Each of the three indices, j, m and e, is a unique label given to a node in the dependency network. The root node of the network is specified at the beginning of the representation, in this case e, the node representing the seeing event. As long as the toot node of the network is specified, it is possible to convert a logical form mechanistically into a structured representation such as a dependency graph or a feature structure. The particular characteristics of the formalism -- the types of relations and predicates used and the manner of their use -- are justified elsewhere[11]."]},{"title":"3. Transfer","paragraphs":["We follow the standard division of a machine translation system into stages of analysis, transfer, and generation. It is a requirement for the transfer description that it should state all and only the equivalence relationships between expressions of a pair of languages. It should contain no general linguistic information, either universal or specific to any single language: these types of information belong in the formalism and content, respectively, of the descriptions of individual languages. In fact most of our transfer descriptions consist of direct equivalences between predicates or groups of predicates of the language pair. A transfer rule shows a particular translation equivalence between two languages. It consists of three parts: a pair of logical forms, one for each language, representing the equivalence, and a third logical form giving the conditions under which the equivalence is applicable. We call these the equivalence pair and the condition respectively. Two ~ logical forms form an equivalence pair if the natural language expressions they represent have overlapping denotations. The rule can therefore be used for translating in either direction: the two logical forms of the equivalence pair are always translationally equivalent if the condition is satisfied. The logical forms of the equivalence pair will be indistinguishable from logical forms of the respective languages, using the same predicates and relations. The logical forms of the condition use meta-predicates which allow reference to to the logical form of the current local translation unit (sentence or clause) and to the linguistic context. In practice, most transfer rules have no condition; they consist just of an equivalence pair. Some examples of rules follow: English Japanese Explanation table(X) teeburu(X) table --- teeburu paper(P) ronb~(P) paper = ronb~ paper(P) sinbun(P) paper = sinbun subj(E,X) ga(E,X) subject marker obj(E,X) wo(Z,X) object marker hypothetical(E),like(E) -tai(F),omou(E) would like = i.l~ inLeft(obj(E,F)) -tai omou The following is the basic definition of transfer between two texts (sentences, clauses, or whatever):","A source logical form and a target logical form are correctly transferred if the terms of each can be divided into non-overlapping subsets such that the source subsets can be placed into one-to-one correspondence with the target subsets by each corresponding pair being 'unified' with the two halves of the equivalence pair of a transfer rule, and if the accumulated conditions of the transfer rules used are satisfied.

'IYansfer of Coordinate Structures","5.1. Problems in transfer of coordinate structures Though transfer of coordinated structures often interacts with transfer of other translation units to produce miserable results in translation, few attempts have been reported to formalize this problem. We here divide the problem into two categories: • Divergence in semantic constraints • Combination of complex transfers A typical example of the first type is shown in the following. Japanese. (la) She wears a hat and shoes.","(lb) kanojo-ga boushi-wo kaburi, kutsu-wo she-subj hat-obj wear shoe-obj haku. wear As is understood from its translation, \"wear\" is translated \"kaburu\" or \"haku\" in Japanese, depending on whether its object is something worn on the head or on the foot(or leg). This means that, in this example, coordination of objects in English should be altered to that of verb phrases in Japanese. This type of knowledge for lexical choice is very common in a transfer or bi-lingual dictionary, and plays an essential role in lexical transfer of most current transfer-based MT systems. The problem arises because neither a transfer program or a transfer-rule writer expects such an awkward problem ot be caused by coordination. To translate \"wear\" into \"kaburu\" in the above example, a rule writer may usually write the following rule in our notation1:","1 In this section, we consider translation whose source and target logical forms are on the left and right sides of a transfer rule. For the sake of simplicity, transfer rules hereafter are described as unidirectional ones. wear(X) , kaburu(X)iff obj(X,Y)&HAT(Y) But the condition part of this rule is implicitly expected to be interpreted as follows. wear(X) , kaburu(X) iff V Y obj(X,Y)&HAT(Y) The precise definition may change depending on how the coordinate structure is represented. But the point is that \"wear\" may be translated \"kaburu\" only if all the objects have a feature of being a \"HAT\". A simple transfer algorithm, for example, may choose the target word when it finds the first applicable transfer rule for a source word: this algorithm may produce \"boushi-to kutsu-wo kaburu\" for the sentence (la), which means that the semantic relation between \"wear\" and \"shoes\" is ignored. The second type of problems occurs when one of the coordinated objects triggers a complex transfer which is described in §3. This type of problem can be seen in the following translation. He committed murder then suicide. kare-ga satsujin-wo okashi, jisatsu-shita. he-subj murder-obj commit commlt-ed suicide This problem is more complicated than the previous one because complex transfer, in this example \"many-to-one transfer\", causes a structural change. There are several possible solutions to this problem. The simplest one is that a transfer-rule writer writes all the transfer rules which explicitly describe every possible sub-structure with coordination. This is of course unrealistic. Another solution is to make a transfer program which modifies the transfer result dynamically when, for example, a source word is given two different target words. But such a dynamic modification of the result during transfer is against our policy of logic-based transfer, because this means gradual transformation of the source structure and therefore transfer cannot be for-malized as logical inference.","5.2. Transfer with Coordinate Expansion Coordinate Expansion Hereafter we concentrate on a case where coordinated objects of a verb cause the problem, though there is apparently an example where other cases such as \"subj\" cause the same problem.

This transfer result will be reorganized again into an appropriate representation of coordination in the target language. But this solution seems inefficient from the computational point of view because caseswhere expansion is necessary are rare . Unnecessary expansion and reorganization of coordinate structures should be avoided. The strategy we propose executes coordination expansion only if it is necessary[5] (See Fig. 1). Transfer is divided into three phases; in the first phase, logical forms are expanded if expand rules (explained below) find the necessity of coordinate expansion. This process continues as long as the necessity remains. In the second phase, transfer described in previous sections is executed. Finally, in the third phase, coordination is reorganized if the target language has a more appropriate structure for coordination than the second phase result. (Consider the translation of (lb). Without reorganizing coordination, the transfer result will contain two \"wear\"s .)

This rule suggests that coordinate expansion is necessary if the object of \"wear\" is a coordinate structure, and one constituent is a HAT while another isn't. We assume that expand rules are produced automatically from transfer rules before the actual transfer operation. The simplest way of extracting such a rule refers only one transfer rule at one time. This means that the necessity of expansion can be detected not by creating expand rules but by referring transfer rules in actual transfer phase. But the former approach seems essential if we wish to optimize expansion detection. Other examples Expand rules from a transfer rule which involves a structural change are a little different in forms to the previous case. The following are a transfer rule for translating \"commit suicide\" into Japanese and its expand rule.","commit (X)&obj (X,Y) &suicide(Y) , jisatsu_suru(X) commit(X)&obj (X,Y)&coord(Y,Y1)&suicide(Y1)&"]},{"title":"coord(Y,Y2) 8zYl #Y2&-~suicide(Y2) , expand(Y,X)","paragraphs":["Another example is the translation of the English \"HU-MAN have ADJ NOUN\" construction into Japanese.

This rule will apply when the system translates \"she has long hair and beautiful eyes\". have(X) & subj(X,S) & HUMAN(S) & obj(X,Y) & -~mod(Y,_) & coord(Y,Y1) & rood(Y1,_) & PART_OF_BODY(Y1)",", expand(Y,X) Discussion Our coordinate expansion detection works even if a coordinate structure has more than two constituents. What we have to consider is an appropriate expansion algorithm. For example, in translating (4a), an appropriate expansion should keep coordination of \"shoes\" and \"stockings\", as shown in (45), because both satisfy a semantic constraint on which the system chooses \"haku\" as the translation of \"wear\". Otherwise reorganizing a coordination in the generation phase is inevitable. (4a) She wears a hat, stockings and shoes. (4b) She wears a hat and wears stockings and shoes. Reorganization of a coordination in the target language does not only occur as outlined in the above case. Since the coordinate expansion is completely separate from the actual transfer process, transfer rules which do not cause problems might be used. There is still an open problem to be solved with regard to the transfer of coordination with \"expansion\"; expansion is not always straightforward. There is often a case where coordinate expansion is impossible without deep understanding of the sentences, or it is impossible in that it may change their semantic structures. For example, the sentence (55) cannot be the expansion of (ha) though it seems so at first glance. (ha) I saw a group of men and women. (55) I saw a group of men and I saw a group of women.","6. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we showed how complex structural changes in transfer are treated within our logic-based transfer model, in which the target linguistic description is obtained from the source description in a non-destructive manner. These types of structural changes cause a problem when they co-occur and their transfer rules are in-teracted. We also discussed a problem in transferring coordinate structures and presented an extended transfer model with coordinate expansion. One of our current concerns is to implement our transfer model in a parallel processing framework. Our current algorithm for transfer and its implementation have a procedural aspect of operation. That is, the sense of \"logic\" in the name of our model has not been fully achieved. We think that the search for parallel implementation will lead to \"logic-based transfer\" in the true sense.","References","1.
