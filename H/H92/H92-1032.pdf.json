The first topic is a new HMM (hidden Markov model) technique that uses VQ-code bigrams to constrain the output probability distribution of the model according to the VQ-codes of previons frames. The output probability distribution changes depending on the previous frames even in the same state, so this method reduces the overlap of feature distributions with different phonemes. The second topic is approaches for adapting a syllable trigram model to a new task in Japanese continuous speech recognition. An approach which uses the most recent input phrases for adaptation is effective in reducing the perplexity and improving phrase recognition rates. The third topic is stochastic language models for sequences of Japanese characters to be used in a Japanese dictation system with unlimited vocabulary. Japanese characters consist of Kanji (Chinese characters) and Kana (Japanese alphabets), and each Kanji has several readings depending on the context. Our dictation system uses character-trigram probabilities as a source model obtained from a text database consisting of both Kanji and Kana~ and generates Kanji-and-Kana sequences directly from input speech."]},{"title":"1. PHONEME HMM CONSTRAINED BY STATISTICAL VQ-CODE TRANSITION 1.1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Speaker-independent phoneme models need a large amount of training dam to cover the phonetic features of various speakers and various phoneme environments. However, more training data leads to broader spectral feature distributions of each phoneme. One speaker's spectral feature distribution often overlaps the distributions of different phonemes of other speakers. This causes confusion and degrades recognition performance. It has widely been confirmed that transitional spectral information, such as that represented by the so-called delta-cepstrum, is effective for decreasing these overlaps and improving the performance of speaker-independent recognition when it is used together with instantaneous spectral information [1]. The delta-cepstrum attempts to model the differential spectnma. The second-order differential spectrum [2][3] has also been used to further improve the performance. In the vector quantization (VQ) -based recognition, another kind of transitional spectral information can be represented by VQ-code sequences. Conditional models of VQ-code transitions have been proposed to obtain accu-rate speech models [4][5]. However, it is very difficult to obtain conditional models from the training data in a real situation, since numerous parameters must be estimated. We have tried to use bigrams of VQ-code sequences to represent statistical transitional information and restrict the feature distributions to a suitable region [6]. This method reduces the overlap of feature distributions between phonemes without requiring a huge amount of training data."]},{"title":"1.2 Bigram-constrained HMM","paragraphs":["A bigram-constrained HMM is obtained by combining a VQ-code bigram and the conventional HMM.

A speaker-dependent bigram-constrained HMM is obtained by using speech data of an input speaker for the bigram calculation. A speaker-independent bigram-constrained HMM, on the other hand, is obtained by using speech data of many speakers different from the input speaker.

The 5240-Japanese word sets uttered by 10 males and 10 females were used. Phoneme periods extracted from the even-numbered words by 16 speakers were used for training the conventional HMMs, and those from odd-numbered words of the other four speakers were used for evaluation. 216 phonetically-balanced-Japanese-word sets uttered by the four test speakers were used to calculate speaker-dependent bigrams. A speaker-independent bigram was obtained using all the training utterances by the 16 training speakers. Multiple codebooks were created for each set of the feature parameters: 16 cepstrum coefficients, 16 delta cepstrum coefficients, and delta energy. The frame period for feature extraction was 8,ms. Codebook sizes were 256, 256, and 64, respectively. The VQ-code bigrams were calculated independently for each codebook. Phoneme-dependent bigrams were calculated referring to manually segmented phoneme labels. The HMMs had four states and three loops. Each phoneme had two models, one for the beginning and the other for the middle of words. Average phoneme recognition rates for various bigram conditions are shown in Table 1. It can be concluded that the phoneme-dependent bigram is much better than the phoneme-independent bigram. The recognition rate using the phoneme- and speaker-dependent bigrams achieved 78.6%, which is 7.8% higher than that obtained by the traditional HMM without combining the bigrams. Even the speaker-independent bigrarn can improve the recognition rate by 5.5%.

']?ASK ADAPTATION IN STOCHASTIC LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION 2.1 Introduction","paragraphs":["One of the ultimate goals of automatic speech recognition is to create a device capable of transcribing speech into written text. The most typical structure of the recognizer consists of an acoustic processor and a linguistic decoder. Most of the recent linguistic decoders use stochastic language models, such as bigrams and trigrams of linguistic units. In order to obtain a reliable stochastic language model, which achieves good recognition performance, it is necessary to use a very large text database. It is also necessary that the task of the database is similar to the recognition task. When the recognition task is changed, recognition performance decreases because the language model is no longer appropriate. However, it is not always possible to obtain a very large text database for each new task. Therefore, it is very important to establish a method of adapting the statistical language model to a new task using a small amount of text similar to the recognition task."]},{"title":"2.2 Model Adaptation","paragraphs":["We have investigated two approaches for adapting a syllable-trigram model to a new task in a Japanese transcription system, a phonetic typewriter, based on continuous speech recognition [7]. In this system, sentences are assumed to be spoken phrase by phrase. Japanese syllables, which are basic linguistic units, roughly correspond to consonant-vowel concatenation units. The first adaptation method, \"preliminary learning\", uses a small amount of text similar to the recognition task, and the second method, \"successive learning\", is based on supervised learning using the most recent input phrases. Since the goal of the system is to transcribe speech into written text, recognition errors are finally corrected by the user. Therefore, supervised learning can be applied using text which has recently been input to the system. The successive learning method using \"cache\" text was first proposed by Kuhn et al. for a stochastic language model based on a word-trigram model [8]. They showed that this method greatly reduced the test-set perplexity. We applied this method to the syllable-trigram models. An initial syllable-trigram model based on a large text database on a specific task or on a general task coveting several fields is assumed to be given. Figure 2 shows the adaptation approaches for trigram models by preliminary learning and successive learning. On the right-hand side of the figure, the top row corresponds to successive learning and the second row corresponds to preliminary learning. The adapted trigram is generated using the deleted interpolation technique."]},{"title":"\\ Ad ted","paragraphs":["gram modelJ"]},{"title":"/","paragraphs":["Successive learning ,r","• ~ [ Most recent [","--(Trlgram model ~input phrases) Preliminary learning"]},{"title":"\\","paragraphs":["I Specific/general 1","trigram model from large amount of text Fig. 2.

Two large text databases about conference registration (1.4 × 104 kbytes, 9.3 × 10 4 phrases) and about travel arrangement (1.1 × 104 kbytes, 7.9 × 10 4 phrases) were used in the experiments. The recognition task concerned conference registration. The travel arrangement database was used to generate an initial trigram model on a specific task different from the recognition task. In successive learning, the initial trigrarn model generated from the travel arrangement database was modified using the most recent 100 phrases at every fixed number of input phrases. Since the number of available phrases for the first 100 input phrases was less than 100, phrases of the similar task were added to keep the total number of training phrases at 100, as shown in Fig. 3. 1-st phrase , 61-st phrase , Over 101-st phrase 40 phrases ~ 100 most"]},{"title":"=7:pots","paragraphs":["J 100 phrases J r=ent inputs Fig. 3. Construction of learning text in successive learning 164 The recognition process flow of the phonetic typewriter is as follows: Cepstra, delta-cepstra and delta-energy are extracted for each frame of input speech and are fuzzy-vector-quantized. Phoneme sequence likelihood is then calculated as a joint likelihood combining acoustic and syntactic likelihoods. The acoustic likelihood is derived from phoneme-based HMMs, and the syntactic one is obtained by a predictive LR parser [9] and the syllable trigram. Each HMM is trained by word utterances. The joint likelihood is maximized to obtain the solution. As a reference, speaker-dependent recognition tests were first carried out on 279 phrases uttered by one male speaker. The trigrarn model was generated from the large conference registration text database, which is the same task as the recognition task. The syllable perplexity and the phrase recognition rate were 12.2 and 64.2%, respectively. These values were the targets for the adaptation. Table 2 shows syllable perplexities and phrase recognition rates for various learning conditions. For the successive learning ease, the perplexities are shown as a function of the learning period. The perplexity was reduced from 24.5 to 18.1 by the adaptation using 100 phrases of the similar text, and was reduced to 14.6 by successive learning at every 10 phrases using the most recent 100 phrases. This clearly shows that successive learning is more effective than preliminary learning, and that the more frequent the successive learning is, the more effective it becomes.

Although still there is a gap between the performances based on training using a large text database and adaptation, these results confirm that the successive learning method is effective."]},{"title":"3. CHARACTER SOURCE MODELING FOR A JAPANESE DICTATION SYSTEM 3.1 Introduction","paragraphs":["Japanese sentences are usually written using both Kana (Japanese alphabets) and Kanji (Chinese characters). Kana are the minimal linguistic units in the written form and correspond to Japanese syllables, which consist of a consonant-vowel pair or a single vowel. Kanji are linguistic units having one or more meanings and pronunciations, and the pronunciations can be written by Kana sequences. Japanese words are made up of sequences of Kana and Kanji. For convenience we will use \"Kanji\" to represent both Kana and Kanji. In English, word sequence probability is usually used to make a language model. However in Japanese, since words are not clearly defined, Kana sequence probability has usually been effectively used for speech recognition. We are trying to build a Japanese dictation system using a \"Kanji\" source model, instead of using a Kana source model, for the following reasons [10][11]. 1) For a given length of character source, a \"Kanji\" source model can effectively deal with a longer phoneme con-text. 2) A \"Kanji\" source model can directly convert speech into Kana and Kanji sequences, without post-processing of Kana-to-Kanji conversion."]},{"title":"3.2 Character Source Modeling","paragraphs":["A \"Kanji\"-trigram probability is calculated using a text database to construct a character source model.

The phoneme verifier calculates the likelihood of the predicted phoneme for the input speech, and returns the score to the LR parser.
