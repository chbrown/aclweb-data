Yet there appears to be a concensus that syntactic phrases do not correspond well to prosodic phrasing, and independent structures have been proposed to account for prosody. I propose that the problem with phrase structure lies with the particular measures of boundary strength applied to syntactic structures, and with the fact that phrase structure is viewed as an immediate constituency tree exclusively. I propose viewing phrase structure as a composite of immediate constituency and dependency relations, and present an alternative measure of boundary strength. I show that boundary strength according to this measure corresponds much more closely to empirical prosodic (and psycholinguistic) boundary strength than does syntactic boundary strength according to a standard measure."]},{"title":"1. INTRODUCTION","paragraphs":["It is natural to expect phrase structure to be important in predicting prosodic phrasing. Hence it is somewhat unsettling that the relationship between prosodic and syntactic structure appears so tenuous, as for example in Selkirk's account [10, 11, 12]. Selkirk's prosodic structure differs from standard phrase structure on several counts, but most notably because it is much flatter than standard phrase structure, which is heavily rightbranching in English: U I !

Martin, Grosjean, and others have explored experimental measures of the relative prominences of boundaries between words, and conclude that the syntactic prominence of a boundary is not the best predictor of its empirical prominence [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. If prosodic structures and performance structures differ from phrase structure, however, they appear to correspond well to each other. For example, Gee and Grosjean [6] use Selkirk's prosodic phrases in an algorithmic model of their experimental data. And turnabout being fair play, Bachenko and Fitzpatrick [3] adapt Gee and Grosjean's algorithm to predict prosodic structure for speech synthesis. However, I believe the perceived inadequacy of syntactic structure is at least in part an artifact of measures of syntactic boundary prominence that are based on immediate-constituency trees alone. I would like to show that we can obtain a measure of syntactic boundary prominence that corresponds better to prosodic and psycholinguistic boundary prominence if we view phrase structure as a composite of immediate constituency and dependency relations."]},{"title":"2.

In particular, if a particle or indirect object pronoun intervenes between a verb and its following dependent, the boundary before the dependent is still weakened. I assign the following heuristic values to boundaries.

COMPARING THE MODELS","paragraphs":["To compare the chunks-and-dependencies model to the standard model, we need to compare both models to boundary-prominence data. I am primarily interested in the local relative prominence of boundaries. A boundary \" b is defined to be locally more prominent than boundary c iff b is more prominent than c and every intervening boundary is less prominent than c. In comparing theoretical and empirical prominences, each inversion counts as an error. An inversion arises wherever b is locally more prominent than c according to the model, but c is locally more prominent than b according to the data. cl~klren 110 2 3O"]},{"title":"~r'~m I ~ss°ns Igrut~ 6o '","paragraphs":["'2 120 6 In this case, there is an inversion: the second boundary is more prominent than the third, according to the model, but the third is more prominent than the second, according to the data. The inversion is reflected in the line crossing."]},{"title":"5. DATA","paragraphs":["To compare the models, I examined two sets of data: performance structure data reported by Grosjean, Grosjean and Lane [7]; and a set of sentences with handmarked prosodic boundaries, kindly provided by Julia Hirschberg of AT&T Bell Laboratories. Grosjean, Grosjean and Lane conducted two experiments, one examining pauses when subjects read sentences at various speeds, and one examining parsing by linguistically-naive subjects. They report only the data on the pausing experiment, though they claim that the parsing data is highly correlated with the pausing data. The data consists of 14 sentences, containing 55 oppor-427 tunities for inversions. (An opportunity for inversion is a boundary that, according to the model, is locally more prominent than at least one other boundary). In 52 cases the model makes the correct prediction (5% error). The three inversions all involved unexpectedly prominent boundaries around multisyllabic pre-head modifiers at sentence end, hence they arguably reflect a single un- • modelled effect. Using the standard measure gives us 42 inversions out of 102 opportunities for inversion, or 41% error, dramatically worse than the licensing measure's 5% error rate. (There are more opportunities for inver: sion because the standard model typically makes more distinctions in boundary prominence.) The second data set consists of 127 sentences from the Darpa ATIS task, with prosodic boundary markings added by Julia Hirschberg. She distinguished three boundary strengths: strong, weak, and no boundary. A complication in the prosodic data is the presence of hesitation pauses, which I do not expect a syntactic model to capture. As a primitive expedient, I formulated a rule that I could apply mechanically to distinguish hesitation pauses from \"genuine\" prosodic boundaries, and I eliminated those boundaries that were hesitation pauses according to the rule. Namely, I eliminated any prosodic boundary immediately following a preposition, conjunction, infinitival to, or a prenominal modifier. After eliminating hesitation pauses, I applied the licensing-structure measure and the standard measure. Using the licensing measure, there were 363 opportunities for inversions, and 12 observed (3% error). Applying the standard model to 16 sentences drawn at random from the data gives 38 inversions out of 114 opportunities, or 33% error. Caution is in order in interpreting these results, in that I have not controlled for all factors that may be relevant. For example, the standard measure generally has a greater range of distinctions in boundary prominence, and that may lead to a larger proportion of errors. Also, the method I use to eliminate hesitation boundaries may help the chunks-and-dependencies model more than it helps the standard model. In short, these are exploratory, rather than definitive results. Nonetheless, they strongly suggest that the chunks-and-dependencies model corresponds to empirical prominences better than the standard model does, hence that syntactic structure may be a better predictor of prosodic and performance structures than previously thought.","References","1.
