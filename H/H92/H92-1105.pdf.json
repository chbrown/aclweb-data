Specific technical objectives for the first year include: (1) Refine the software engineering method that was developed during Phase I. (2) Choose an existing speech recognition system as a \"reference\" target. (3) Produce a working subset of the utility modules. (4) Produce a working subset of the numerical algorithms modules. (5) Write an open specification for the file formats and I/O functions. (6) Produce example user-level programs (including at least one auditory model). RECENT RESULTS Since contract award (1 Sept. 1991), we have concentrated on refining the software engineering method and building a significant set of low-level utiility modules. The method yields reusable, modular C libraries with these properties:","• Modules are simple enough to be designed, written, tested, understood, and maintained by a single person (at a time).","• Testing adding, removing, replacing, or modify-ing modules are simple operations.","• The result of combining several modules into a library is itself useable as a module in a \"higher level\" library. • Modules are organized into a \"uses hierarchy\" that makes the module dependencies explicit. Our mehod does not require an elaborate CASE environment. Rather, we stick to ANSI C, a full-featured make program (at present,"]},{"title":"gnumake),","paragraphs":["and a collection of relatively simple shell scripts.

Design goals include providing for automatic type conversion if a type-specific signal processing function is not available, having uniform treatment of signals regardless of their storage location (memory, disk, or mixed), and providing run-time parameterization of the number of records (e.g., frames) dealt with as a single unit. The next tasks will be to specify and implement the file system, to implement the command-line user-interface modules, and then to complete several user-level programs that demonstrate and illustrate various aspects of the approach. We will also be selecting an existing speech recognition system to serve as a target for the optional second year of the project. A detai2ed progress report (and plan for the optional second year) will be available in May, 1992. 472"]}]}
