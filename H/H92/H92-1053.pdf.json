Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 ABSTRACT","paragraphs":["The time required for our translation system to handle a sentence of length I is a rapidly growing function of i. We describe here a method for analyzing a sentence into a series of pieces that can be translated sequentially. We show that for sentences with ten or fewer words, it is possible to decrease the translation time by 40% with almost no effect on translation accuracy. We argue that for longer sentences, the effect should be more dramatic."]},{"title":"Introduction","paragraphs":["In a recent series of papers, Brown et aL introduce a new, statistical approach to machine translation based on the mathematical theory of communication through a noisy channel, and apply it to the problem of translating naturMly occurring French sentences into English [1, 2, 3, 4]. They develop a probabilistic model for the noisy channel and show how to estimate the parameters of their model from a large collection of pairs of aligned sentences. By treating a sentence in the source language (French) as a garbled version of the corresponding sentence in the target language (English), they recast the problem of translating a French sentence into English as one of find-ing that English sentence which is most likely to be present at the input to the noisy channel when the given French sentence is known to be present at its output. For a French sentence of any realistic length, the most probable English translation is one of a set of","\"This work was supported, in part, by DARPA contract N00014-91-C-0135, administered by the Office of Naval Research. English sentences that, although finite, is nonetheless so large as to preclude an exhaustive search. Brown et aL employ a suboptimal search based on the stack algorithm used in speech recognition. Even so, as we see in Figure 1, the time required for their system to translate a sentence grows very rapidly with sentence length. As a result, they have focussed their attention on short sentences."]},{"title":"100 80 = 60 E 40","paragraphs":["~P"]},{"title":"E 20 0","paragraphs":["I I I I I I"]},{"title":"T ±","paragraphs":["o_i -L _oo","@ @ ~ 0 I t I I I I"]},{"title":"4 6 8 10 12 14 Sentence Length","paragraphs":["Figure 1: Search time as a function of sentence length.","The designatum of some French words is so specific that they can be reliably translated almost any-where they occur without regard for the context in which they appear. For example, only the most contrived circumstances could require one to translate the French techndtium into English as anything but technetium. Alas, this charming class of words is woefully small: for the great majority of words, phrases, and even sentences, the more we know of the context 267 in which they appear, the more confidently and eloquently we are able to translate them. But the example provided by simultaneous translators shows that at the expense of eloquence it is possible to produce satisfactory translation segment by segment seriatim.","In this paper, we describe a method for analyzing long sentences into smaller units that can be translated sequentially. Obviously any such analysis risks rupturing some organic whole within the sentence, thereby precipitating an erroneous translation.

Even when the analysis avoids splitting a noun from an associated adjective or the opening word of an idiom from its conclusion, we cannot expect that breaking a sentence into pieces will improve translation. The gain that we can expect is in the speed of translation. In general we must weigh this gain in translation speed against the loss in translation accuracy when deciding whether to divide a sentence at a particular point."]},{"title":"Rifts","paragraphs":["Brown"]},{"title":"et al.","paragraphs":["[1] define an"]},{"title":"alignment","paragraphs":["between an English sentence and its French translation to be a diagram showing for each word in the English sentence those words in the French sentence to which it gives rise (see their Figure 3).

Similarly, if a French sentence contains a number of rifts, then we can piece together a translation of the cbmptete sentence from translations of the individual segments. Because of this, we assume that breaking a French sentence at a rift is less likely to cause a translation error than breaking it elsewhere.","Let Pr(e, alf ) be the conditional probability of the English sentence e and the alignment a given the French sentence"]},{"title":"f = flf2...fM.","paragraphs":["For 1 < i < M, let"]},{"title":"I(i; e,","paragraphs":["a,f) be ] if there is a rift between"]},{"title":"fi","paragraphs":["and"]},{"title":"fi+l","paragraphs":["when f is translated as e with alignment a, and zero otherwise.

Of these locations, we determined 13,268,639 to be rifts and the remaining 13,948,592 not to be rifts.

For each of the 27,217,234 training locations, we created a record of the form vl v~ v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 vs b, where vs is the value of the informant at site s and b is 1 or 0 according as the location is or is not a rift.

[5]. We have in-sinuated the segmenter into the system between the analysis and the transfer phases ofour processing. The analysis operation, therefore, is unaffected by the presence of the segmenter. We have also modified the transfer portion of the decoder so as to investigate only those translations that are consistent with the segmented input, but have otherwise left it alone. As a result, we get the benefit of the English language model across segment boundaries, but save time by not considering the great number of translations that are not consistent with the segmented input."]},{"title":"Results","paragraphs":["To test the usefulness of segmenting, we decoded 400 short sentences four different ways. We compiled the results in Table l, where: Tree is a shorthand for segmentation using the tree described above with a threshold of 7; Every 5 is a shorthand for segments made regularly after every five words; Every 4 is a shorthand for segments made regularly after every four words; and None is a shorthand for using no segmentation at all. We see from the first line of the table that the decoder performed somewhat better with segmentation as determined by the decision tree. If we carried out an exhaustive search, this could not happen, but because our search is suboptimal it is possible for the various shortcuts that we have taken to interact in such a way as to make the result better with segmentation than without. The result with the decision tree is clearly superior to the results obtained with either of the rigid segmentation schemes.","In Table 2, we show the decoding time in minutes for the four decoders. Using the segmentation tree, the decoder is about 41% faster than without it. We use a trigram language model to provide the a priori probability for English sentences. This means that the translation of one segment may depend on the result of the immediately preceding segment, but should not be much affected by the translation of any earlier segment provided that segments average more than two Words in length. Because of this, we expect translation time with the segmenter to grow approximately linearly with sentence length, while translation time without the segmenter grows much more rapidly. Therefore, we anticipate that the benefit of segment-ing to decoding speed will be greater for longer sentences.
