TEXT UNDERSTANDING","paragraphs":["In text understanding we emphasize an architecture in which a variety of components cooperate to produce 459 an analysis of texts. Not all components may be required for any one particular application - they can be intermixed in various ways to suit each application's needs. This architecture, shown in Figure 3 includes keyword-based information retrieval, for message routing. A knowledge-based information retrieval component (KBIRD) extracts text information which is accessable without a detailed natural language analysis. If an application requires detailed natural language processing, a natural language processing system is available. Finally, a database record generator formats the extracted information for database generation. This approach is described in [2]. ~::~::~::~::~!~i:~ ................... ~:~% .................................... ::::::::i:i:i:i::\"\" \"'::i:i \" !:::i Mecqlng dettcr~l?ttoms of ~¢eat~ts -::!: ::::: ::::: :. -:: :::::|. ...... ~::::: ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::i~:~:i~::.~i \" ................ ~; ~:i~.::::~:::: ~mm~m~mm ~ I~!~i~:::::::::. !!!~i~i.':...~....:~iiii!i~i~i~i~ii! ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: :::::::::::::: :: :::::::::: :: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::: :: ::::::::::.\":~i~ii i~i YWORD-BASED INFORMATION R~TR1EVAL"]},{"title":"iF ..... •","paragraphs":[".... ,-"]},{"title":"lii","paragraphs":["~ .: .__ ,,"]},{"title":")","paragraphs":["Figure 3: Paramax text understanding architecture 4. DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING The object of Paramax document understanding research is to develop novel knowledge-based approaches to the processing of document images. Starting with the scanned image(s) of a document's pages, our goal is to determine the document's functional and physical organization and to extract the key ideas from the ASCII representation of its text. Our current focus is on producing the structural interpretation of the document and the accompanying ASCII text for each component. The ASCII text would then be analyzed by a text-understanding system, as discussed in Section 2. An intelligent document understanding system is shown in Figure 4 with the scope of our project falling in the shaded region. This work is discussed in detail in [3].","References","1. L. M.
